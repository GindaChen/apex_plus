As you might expect, there's a little more science to it than that, and two French engineers have dug into exactly what happens when a kernel of corn does its thing. Their formula-filled study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, kicks off with this sentence: \"Popcorn is the funniest corn to cook, because it jumps and makes a 'pop' sound in our pans.\" But Emmanuel Virot and Alexandre Ponomarenko get far more scientific from there, noting that while previous studies have examined the conditions needed to properly pop corn, the physical origin of a kernel bursting open, jumping, and making that sound remain \"elusive in the literature.\" Using elementary tools of thermodynamics and fracture mechanics (along with an oven, a microphone, and some cameras), they set out to solve the mystery. Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees Fahrenheit, 96% of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture (the Guardian reports kernels are 14% water) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains Phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture. A camera taking 2,900 frames per second captured what happens next: At 6.9 milliseconds, the starch expands; at 13.8ms, \"we observe the formation of a 'leg' which is compressed on the plate.\" Some 7ms later, \"this leg bounces and the popcorn jumps.\" As for the pop, they determined that it's not caused by the kernel cracking or the popcorn jumping (as in a pan)\u2014it's triggered by the pressurized vapor being released. \"More precisely, the pressure drop excites cavities inside the popcorn as if it were an acoustic resonator.\" (Scientists have also finally figured out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.)", "StartTimeOffset": 309286103154, "RequestID": "bc360ac9a2af438eaa351fb3fd04621d", "TotalTokens": 1730}

Don't fret: just play Tetris. In what might just be the best news you read all day, a new study published in Addictive Behaviors finds playing Tetris for just 3 minutes reduces cravings by an average 20%. And that doesn't just apply to cravings for chocolate. Researchers say it works on hankerings for sex, sleep, cigarettes, and more. Over one week, psychologists prompted 31 participants, ages 18 to 27, to report cravings for food and drink, drugs (think coffee, alcohol, and cigarettes), and activities, including how strong those cravings were, seven times a day via text message. Of those, 15 participants were told to play 3 minutes of Tetris in between and report back. The result: \"Playing Tetris decreased craving strength ... from 70% to 56%,\" researcher Jackie Andrade says in a press release. What sort of power might Tetris hold? A relatively simple one, it turns out. \"Craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity,\" says Andrade. It's \"hard to imagine something vividly and play Tetris at the same time.\" And the effect didn't wear off: Those who played averaged 40 sessions during the week, but the impact remained consistent. Researchers were so impressed that they hope to test the theory on people with drug addictions. Just as significantly, \"this is the first demonstration that cognitive interference can be used outside the lab to reduce cravings for substances and activities other than eating,\" the researchers write. As far as undergrads' cravings, they reported wanting something about 30% of the time: about two-thirds of cravings were for food and non-alcoholic drinks; 21% were for cigarettes, beer, etc.; and 16% were for activities, including sleep, video games, socializing, and sex.

The Wall Street Journal reports on a somewhat whimsical sounding potential treatment for anxiety and insomnia: \"night milk.\" That would be milk taken from cows at night; it's been found to be naturally higher in sleep-promoting compounds. South Korean researchers recently put the theory to the test in a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food. In this case, the subjects were lab mice that were fed milk in powdered form that had been collected either during the day or at night. The latter contained notably higher levels of tryptophan (24% more) and melatonin (almost 10 times more), and the researchers found night-milk \"shortened the sleep onset and prolonged the sleep duration\" of drug-induced sleep. On the anxiety front, the Journal reports that those mice who received night milk were more likely to explore open spaces, \"an indication of reduced anxiety\"; further, their behavior was similar to that of mice who had been administered the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. The big \"but\" in this study is that the subjects were, again, mice, not humans. But that doesn't mean humans haven't tried night milk. The New Zealand Herald reports on a night-milk powder called iNdream3 that's produced by Synlait. A sleep trial partly funded by Synlait at Otago University found that the product \"reduced the time to onset sleep [and] increased the deepest phase of sleep\" in humans.

The process, which involves fat migrating to chocolate's surface, was also largely a mystery until German scientists decided to take a closer look. They mixed up cocoa, milk powder, cocoa butter, and sugar, ground the mixture to a fine powder, then watched through an X-ray generating synchrotron as sunflower oil was added, Science reports. Within hours, the oil had melted the chocolate crystals, which allowed the fat in cocoa butter to navigate to the surface where it crystallized, turning the usually glossy treat into an unappealing mess. \"The technology used to examine the samples shows us both the fat crystals and the pores inside the product, down to a scale of a few nanometers,\" explains a researcher, who worked alongside scientists from Nestle. \"For the first time, we have been able to track in detail the dynamic mechanisms that lead to the creation of fat bloom,\" another adds. Such a close-up view also revealed clues about how chocolatiers could avoid fat blooming in the future, say, by reducing the \"porosity of the chocolate during manufacture, so that the fat migrates more slowly,\" the study author says, per UPI. \"Another approach is to limit the amount of fat that is present in a liquid form by storing the product in cool, but not too cold, conditions.\" If you're really serious about keeping your chocolate looking and tasting its best, store it at an optimal 64 degrees, researchers say.

The Survivor producer's Mexican trial for Monica Burgos' murder has finally wrapped up after stretching on for nearly three years. Prosecutors argued Beresford-Redman killed his wife in their room at Cancun's Moon Palace resort on the morning of April 5, 2010, then hid her body in the room until evening, when he deposited it in a cistern, about 75 yards away. The judge's verdict is expected sometime next spring, and Beresford-Redman could face 30 years in prison if convicted. But as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the case is hardly cut and dried. Coroner's tale: Evidence gathered from Burgos' body doesn't support the prosecution's argument. As her body showed no evidence of lividity\u2014the bluish marks left by exposure to a hard surface, like in a hotel room\u2014a coroner said Burgos likely died at the cistern itself. The coroner also determined Burgos died at around 11pm on April 5, not that morning. Missing evidence: Police didn't complete a rape kit on Burgos and didn't test under her fingernails, though the state claimed scratches on Beresford-Redman's neck indicated a fight. The prosecution later said much of its evidence was \"lost\" or damaged by mold and water. It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to Burgos or Beresford-Redman. Witnesses recant: Hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said Beresford-Redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a British family had complained\u2014in a handwritten note\u2014of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: A forensic scientist and criminologist hired by Beresford-Redman's Mexican defense attorney said Burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel. He also found no evidence tying Beresford-Redman to the crime. An expert for the prosecution and an independent forensic expert brought in by the judge couldn't link him to it either. Beresford-Redman is now facing more charges, because Mexican officials are upset about a recent 48 Hours special in which the producer recorded video diaries revealing, among other things, the \"noisy ... smelly ... sweaty and hot and cramped\" conditions of his life in prison.
