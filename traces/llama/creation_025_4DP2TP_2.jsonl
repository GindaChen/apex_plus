The investigation by Yellowstone officials into Murphy's death was kept private, but KULR obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request, the AP reports. The investigative report reveals Murphy's wife told park authorities that Murphy was looking for the treasure when she called to report him missing. Murphy's body was found June 9, 2017. He had fallen about 500 feet down a steep slope. The report ruled the death an accident. The lure of the treasure, which is said to be worth nearly $2 million, has prompted thousands to comb areas of New Mexico, Yellowstone National Park, and elsewhere. Murphy is one of several people who have died while looking for the treasure; the deaths have led some to call for an end the treasure hunt. Besides the danger to the treasure hunters, they note that search and rescue efforts for missing treasure hunters are costly. Fenn has dropped clues to the chest's whereabouts in a cryptic poem in his memoir, The Thrill of the Chase.

In what the study in Gender Issues describes as a \"low violation\" scenario, the male asks to borrow a pen; in the \"high violation\" or \"disconcerting\" scenario, he suggests she try modeling and asks to take her photo. The women were then asked a series of questions, including whether they would comply; most said yes to the pen and no to the photo, regardless of how attractive the man was. But they also ranked each man as to how friendly, ambitious, mean, rude, and creepy (and more) he was. In the low-violation case, both men's personalities were perceived to be similar.

The AP has much more: Background: Trump said in May that he would pull the United States out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don't cut off Iranian oil imports by early November. US response: In a written statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the legal move an attempt by Tehran \"to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security.\" The United States, which argues that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case, is to present its legal arguments to judges on Tuesday. More on Iran's argument: Iranian representative Mohsen Mohebi told the court the US decision was a clear breach of the 1955 treaty as it was \"intended to damage, as severely as possible, Iran's economy.\" Mohebi said the re-imposition of sanctions was unjustified as Iran was abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal. He said sanctions are already having damaging effects on Iran's economy and society and threaten to further destabilize the volatile Mideast. More background: The 1955 treaty was signed when the US and Iran were still allies following the 1953 revolution\u2014fomented by Britain and the US\u2014that ultimately cemented the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Iran and the US have a history of litigation at the International Court of Justice, in cases covering crises including the Tehran embassy hostage-taking and the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet mistaken by a US warship for a fighter jet. Rulings by the world court, which settles disputes between nations, are final and legally binding. The gulf: Reuters separately reports a top Iranian naval official on Monday said Iran now fully controls the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz that connects the gulf with the open ocean, and \"there is no need for the presence of aliens like the US and the countries whose home is not in here.\" Reuters notes the country has indicated that it could choke off other countries' oil exports as a sort of payback for the US curtailing its own foreign oil sales via sanctions.", "StartTimeOffset": 1081324529711, "RequestID": "6030badfea284b9ca75a99137c17bf25", "TotalTokens": 2091}

The Atlantic reports researcher Andrew Gallup had his students go online to collect videos of animals yawning (not a hard task considering yawning animals are the dang cutest). He then found he was able to predict the brain weight and the number of brain cells in the cortexes of various animals based on their yawn length. \u201cWe were just really blown out of the water,\u201d Gallup tells the Atlantic. \u201cIt\u2019s such a strong predictor.\u201d Perhaps surprisingly, body and mouth size had nothing to do with yawn length. The explanation for brain size correlating to yawn length comes from a theory first proposed by Gallup in 2007, Stat reports. He argues animals yawn to cool their brains, according to the Washington Post. If that's true, it stands to reason that larger brains would require a larger yawn to cool. And it explains why humans' yawns, at 6.5 seconds, are the longest yawns in the animal kingdom, beating out those of gorillas, lions, elephants, and more. However, not all scientists are convinced yawning serves a cooling function, and some point to its contagiousness as evidence of a sociological function. Gallup isn't swayed. \u201cWhether yawning functions specifically to cool the brain can still be debated, but there is no debate on whether yawning has thermoregulatory consequences,\" he says.

In a study titled, \"To pee or not to pee: urine signals mediate aggressive interactions in the cooperatively breeding cichlid,\" researchers explain that urination for the cichlid fish is not only a bodily function but also a form of communication, per Science. To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually. But the fish also gave off a chemical signal with urine. In cases where the barrier had tiny holes allowing water to flow through, for example, the smaller fish appeared to get a signal from the larger fish to stop their attack since they were more likely to show aggression when the barrier was solid. Both the smaller and larger fish also peed more when presented with another fish than they did when alone, especially when the barrier between them kept them from receiving the other fish's signals.

Tin Fish owner Joe Melluso tells ABC News that the lobsters he buys from vendors usually top out at 5 pounds. A picture of Larry circulated on social media, and a family reserved him for Tuesday night's dinner\u2014until a group of other locals caught wind. Real estate lawyer Brooke Estren and friends pitched in $300 to buy him, plus shipping costs to send him to the Maine State Aquarium, where he'll be examined and either housed permanently or put back in the sea. The group wrapped Larry in a saltwater-soaked towel, packed him in a special shipping container, and mailed him to Maine Wednesday. \"If you're going to live 110 years, you deserve to live and not be someone's dinner,\" Estren tells the Herald. And even though Larry may not be quite as ancient as Melluso guessed he is (the executive director of Maine's Lobster Institute pegs him as probably somewhere between 60 to 80 years old), the restaurant owner got \"choked up\" contemplating all the effort put into saving the lucky lobster, the Herald notes. \"My whole life's been about fish and seafood,\" Melluso says. \"[Larry's rescuers are] looking to protect and serve the species in a responsible way.

The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65% in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature (it takes the vines two to three years), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. \"To deal with a few boxes of this [variety] and few pellets of that is a real challenge,\" says Diane Gooding of Gooding Farms in Idaho.

Francisco and Jacinta Marto, along with their cousin Lucia Dos Santos, said they received three messages or \"secrets\" from Mary: the first was a vision of hell and the second was interpreted to be a prediction of World War II and the rise of communism in Russia; the third was not revealed until 2000 by the Vatican, which says it predicted the 1981 assassination attempt of Pope John Paul. Also in 2000, Pope John Paul beatified the Marto siblings, one of the final steps required before sainthood. The siblings died several years after receiving the visions. Pope Francis on Thursday officially recognized a miracle attributed to the siblings, the last requirement that needed to be fulfilled before they could become saints, the New York Times reports; that same day, he signed the canonization decree, per the AP. While no date has officially been set for the canonization ceremony, one theory is that it will be held in May when the pope visits the Fatima shrine, exactly 100 years from the day the first vision occurred. A shrine official says the miracle involves a Brazilian child cured of a disease. There is also a push for Lucia Dos Santos, who became a nun and lived to age 97, to be beatified.

She faces two counts of child abuse to her husband's six. His stem from allegations that the 36-year-old also snorted cocaine with his daughters. The Tampa Tribune cites affidavits that allege he did so with them in his parked truck in Tierra Verde and Treasure Island. He allegedly gave a friend of theirs cocaine, too. Bay News 9 reports police learned of the situation via a child-abuse hotline, and notes the girls are currently in the care of Joey Mudd's mother-in-law. Chad Mudd, who also faces a cocaine possession charge, remains in jail; Joey Mudd has been released but isn't permitted to see her daughters.

That's America in the 60s. That's all that stuff. It all looks great and when you scratch the surface you're like, 'Oh, it's hollow and it's rotten.' It's advertising.

Investigators believe his crimes go back at least 10 years. Police say the man, who's already in jail and will be back in court next month, used platforms like Facebook and Skype to communicate with his victims, pretending to be the Canadian singer to persuade children under 16 to send him explicit images, CNN reports. \"The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety,\" Rouse says.

With the city newly liberated, Iraqi forensic teams have now begun the grim process of excavating suspected mass graves thought to contain some of the 1,700 soldiers ISIS claims to have killed at Camp Speicher. The AP cites an official with the country's Human Rights Ministry who says eight sites within the complex of presidential palaces are being worked on; Reuters puts the number of suspected mass graves at 12. Another official yesterday told Reuters that \"initial indications show indisputably\" that a handful of bodies recovered yesterday are those of Speicher victims, though DNA testing will be carried out to confirm this. The AP notes that one clip aired on Iraqi state TV showed unearthed skeletal remains still wearing combat boots. A CNN reporter on the scene describes decomposed bodies with their hands still tied together. In making its claim, ISIS released photos showing soldiers being led to trenches and then facedown in them before and after their execution. Other videos showed masked gunmen bringing the soldiers to a bloodstained concrete river waterfront, shooting them in the head, and tossing them into the Tigris. Previous reports have stated that if the number of dead is indeed 1,700, the massacre would rank as by far the largest atrocity in the country in more than a decade.", "StartTimeOffset": 3072734304508, "RequestID": "f462c55b93854896a1acd278c621e1cc", "TotalTokens": 1018}

Bernie Sanders' wife, who ran the private college from 2004 to 2011, tried to boost enrollment in 2010 by buying 32 acres of land along Lake Champlain for a new campus. The land, including a 77,000-square-foot main building, was being sold by a Roman Catholic diocese that needed cash after being sued by abuse victims. But the college, which has around 70 students, was unable to attract enough new students to justify the $10 million purchase and ended up in deep financial trouble even after selling all but 8 acres of the land, Politico reports. \"I believe the vision was enrollment would grow, which it did, but not at the level that would have allowed us to manage the financial debt we had incurred,\" Dean of Operations Coralee Holm told reporters on Monday. \"So here we are.\" Neither Holm nor college President Carol Moore criticized Sanders, who reportedly received a $200,000 severance package, for her role in the college's financial problems. The Wall Street Journal notes that Burlington College, like many small colleges, had serious financial woes long before Sanders took charge. \"I thought it was going to happen for some time,\" says the school's former chair of the film and media department. \"It's a very, very, very small college without an endowment.\"", "StartTimeOffset": 3088120956036, "RequestID": "9c349933faf54967b8dd452401511750", "TotalTokens": 1164}
