The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Ariz., which sits on the Mexican border. Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helped Mexican authorities nab the cartel members, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the US border, ICE rep Gillian Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand. \"This operation was conducted with utmost secrecy to maintain the element of surprise and to ensure the safety of the Mexican law enforcement officers executing it,\" Christensen said, per CNN. ICE helped Mexican federal police into the US to keep them safe during the operation, Christensen said. The sting also netted the seizure of several assault-type weapons and hundreds of pounds of drugs. \"ICE applauds the government of Mexico for their bold action in taking down this criminal organization and for their continued pressure on the Sinaloa Cartel throughout Mexico,\" Christensen said.

And that doesn't just apply to cravings for chocolate. Researchers say it works on hankerings for sex, sleep, cigarettes, and more. Over one week, psychologists prompted 31 participants, ages 18 to 27, to report cravings for food and drink, drugs (think coffee, alcohol, and cigarettes), and activities, including how strong those cravings were, seven times a day via text message. Of those, 15 participants were told to play 3 minutes of Tetris in between and report back.

A relatively simple one, it turns out. \"Craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity,\" says Andrade. It's \"hard to imagine something vividly and play Tetris at the same time.\" And the effect didn't wear off: Those who played averaged 40 sessions during the week, but the impact remained consistent.

Per LCI News, the boy and his 10-year-old brother had taken a ski lift up the mountain on Saturday, with their dad and 6-year-old sister by their side, but when they got to the top, the father opted to take the little girl down and let the boys descend on their own. It's not clear exactly what happened after that, but the boys seem to have gotten lost, taken off their skis, and wandered into the woods; at some point they both plunged 500 feet off a cliff hidden by trees. When they didn't show at the resort, the cops were alerted, and they were found at the bottom of the cliff early Sunday. The older boy was dead at the scene. His younger brother, whose fall was apparently softened by tree branches, survived with a broken pelvis and is being treated at a nearby hospital, with a local police official calling his survival a \"miracle,\" per the BBC. The Telegraph reports on a separate incident at the Oz en Oisans resort, where on Saturday a British man died after he and two friends, all said to be in their 20s and good skiers, went off a marked ski run and got lost.

The enormous grouping of the mammals near the Inupiat Eskimo village of Point Lay, about 700 miles northwest of Anchorage, is the result of disappearing sea ice, explains a walrus expert with the US Geological Survey. The area's summer sea ice vanished by mid-September, leaving the walruses with nowhere in the Chukchi Sea to rest between their dives to the seafloor for food, Chadwick Jay tells the Alaska Dispatch News. He says that six of the last eight years have seen this occur.

A necropsy team will head to the area to investigate. And as far as food goes, biologists note that beach areas aren't the best for feeding; the richest food sources are found offshore along the continental shelf.

The Ledger reports that a 19-year-old Woodard vanished on April 14, 1975; he had intended to head from their home in Florida to Texas with friends that day, says Wells. The Charley Project, which profiles missing persons cases, says he had as much as $3,000 in cash on him at the time; WFTS reports by way of investigators that the group intended to buy marijuana in Texas. Though Wells always suspected her brother had been murdered, she tells the paper that when the Polk County Sheriff's Office asked to meet with her to discuss an investigation, it never dawned on the 62-year-old they were referring to her brother. Progress on the case began in 2009, when a bone was sent to the University of North Texas so that DNA could be recovered and added to the Missing Persons Database. The sheriff's office in Polk County, which is about two hours south of Marion County, surfaced Woodard's case in a review last year of missing persons cases.

They mixed up cocoa, milk powder, cocoa butter, and sugar, ground the mixture to a fine powder, then watched through an X-ray generating synchrotron as sunflower oil was added, Science reports. Within hours, the oil had melted the chocolate crystals, which allowed the fat in cocoa butter to navigate to the surface where it crystallized, turning the usually glossy treat into an unappealing mess. \"The technology used to examine the samples shows us both the fat crystals and the pores inside the product, down to a scale of a few nanometers,\" explains a researcher, who worked alongside scientists from Nestle. \"For the first time, we have been able to track in detail the dynamic mechanisms that lead to the creation of fat bloom,\" another adds.

What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the European Space Agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun. \"The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf,\" the ESA says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display. At the center of each wing, blue areas represent violent jets of gas gushing into space at approximately 621,000mph. Discovered in 1947 and officially known as PN M2-9, the Twin Jet Nebula gets its more common name from its shape. \"If the nebula is sliced across the star, each side of it appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines,\" says the ESA.

Morgan's arrest and ouster is the latest and thus far most dramatic move in a struggle that has emerged over Lee's business and fortune since his wife of 69 years, Joan, died in July. Police have been investigating reports of elder abuse against Lee since at least February, and had issued an emergency order keeping Morgan from Lee before Wednesday's order was issued. Lee has for decades been revered as a comic book giant for his central role in creating the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and other major Marvel characters. Morgan is a memorabilia dealer and Marilyn Monroe expert who befriended Lee's daughter and only child JC Lee. Lee appeared in a video posted to his Twitter account Sunday declaring that Morgan was his only partner and representative, and anyone claiming otherwise was lying.", "StartTimeOffset": 1293557966268, "RequestID": "dfc40636b641462da7e03dd9d50f3c1a", "TotalTokens": 1046}

As for virgins, they faced double the cancer risk faced by those who'd had sex, the Telegraph reports.

Men who had sex exclusively with men and had had more than 20 partners actually saw twice the prostate cancer risk of men who'd never slept with men.

But new research from Duke University shows that the magic lasts a little longer than previously thought: Rather than being limited to the period right after birth, the window lasts all the way up 'til Junior turns three, say researchers. \"And for some (racial) subgroups,\" says study author Christina Gibson-Davis, \"that moment lasts even longer.\" African-American moms, for example, mostly married after the child's third birthday. Other findings, per the survey of 5,255 kids born outside wedlock in the US: Some 64% of kids born to unwed parents eventually saw mom tie the knot, though the caveats here are that it wasn't necessarily to their dad and that many of those unions dissolved. \"These marriages are fragile,\" says Gibson-Davis. \"If you think that stable marriage is beneficial for kids, very few kids born out of wedlock are experiencing that.\" The odds of those marriages lasting are better when dad, rather than step-dad, is involved. After a decade, 54% of marriages involving a step-father crumbled, while that number was 38% among biological fathers. Race did not factor here. Gibson-Davis' takeaway: Despite much gnashing of teeth about out-of-wedlock kids, we really don't know a lot about their reality. \"Those who would promote marriage have more work to do,\" she says. Jesse Singal, writing in New York, seconds that. Instead of lauding matrimony as the be-all, end-all for happy, stable families, why not push social policies that \"really address the issues that make it so hard to be a new mom or dad\"?

As he and two German researchers explain in a study published in Evolution & Human Behavior, \"evolutionary psychology states that sexual attractiveness has evolved to assess the reproductive qualities of a potential mate\"\u2014and as such, past studies have looked at individual traits that have ties to things like fertility. In their study, the researchers set out with the hypothesis that attractiveness doesn't just stem from those parts but from \"the consistency of the whole appearance.\" A press release explains the set-up: Participants viewed \"schematic point-light displays that depict a person using 15 moving dots.\" The dots gave participants a sense of both the person's body shape and their movements; that allowed the researchers to grade both the most attractive shapes and movement styles. They then made super-attractive hybrids by pairing the most attractive in both buckets. But participants found the hybrid walkers to be less attractive than the two individual walkers who made up the hybrid, Troje explains in a blog post. \"We found that attractiveness depends on internal consistency\u2014whether the movement and the shape match each other or not.\" If they don't, our visual system will respond negatively. One practical application of the results: \"to formulate advice to people who are working on improving their own appearance,\" says Troje, who observes that what makes someone else good-looking may not work for you.

On Wednesday, a five-year-old shot his seven-year-old brother with an old rifle while the two played unsupervised in the bath. On Thursday, a two-year-old fatally shot himself in the head with his dad's handgun, while his father was busy elsewhere in the room, says Raw Story. And yesterday, an eight-year-old shot his five-year-old friend in the head with a rifle, as the two played alone in a bedroom. The boy is in a critical condition in hospital, the Denton Record-Chronicle reports. Two of the guns used were .22-caliber rifles, similar to the one with which a five-year-old accidentally killed his two-year-old sister in Kentucky earlier this month. The grandfather of the children spoke out this week, saying his grandson was too young to have a gun and that it was a cultural problem in rural Kentucky. \"Too many people think it's (guns) for target practice.

A pastor who was at the parade says there were \"audible gasps\" as people caught a glimpse of Kobach in his vehicle, per the Kansas City Star. \"Why was that necessary sir?\" Johnny Lewis wrote on Facebook to Kobach, adding that he respects different perspectives on the Second Amendment but that his 6-year-old daughter and other kids at the parade have been scared lately due to recent school shootings. \"My child didn't need that today.\" The Republican gubernatorial candidate, however, said in a tweet Sunday that he will \"not back down in the face of a snowflake meltdown and outrage culture.\" And Kobach's spokeswoman, Danedri Herbert, said in a text to the Star that \"the gun is a replica\" and that \"the Secretary says those who use the excuse of school violence to restrict the right to bear arms are deeply misguided.

That's according to the European Court of Justice, which was asked to rule on a case involving spreadable Dutch cheeses.

The court wasn't having it, however, ruling that taste doesn't fit the definition of a copyrighted work: an intellectual creation \"identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity.\" Taste is \"subjective and variable,\" therefore it can't be protected, the court said. \"It's a discrimination of senses that something you can taste with your mouth is not protectable by copyright,\" says Heks'nkaas CEO Michel Wildenborg. The court disagreed.

A girl of about age 6 answered the door, and officers found 24-year-old Samantha Schigel inside, surrounded by children, reports ABC News. \"Mommy was sleeping and they could not wake her up,\" a neighbor quotes one of the kids as saying.

Police say Schigel later explained that she and Carroll had snorted a powdered substance they believed was heroin before Carroll left to get food for the family, reports Cleveland.com. (The crash occurred just across the street from the family home.) Police say a white powder found at the home tested positive for cocaine and fentanyl. Schigel is now charged with child endangerment, while Carroll faces charges including child endangerment and driving under the influence. Both pleaded not guilty Thursday and are free on bond.

{"ContextTokens": 293, "GeneratedTokens": 685, "SynthesizedBody": "Can you write a long story based on the following abstract: \u2013 Researchers studying the songs of humpback whales have discovered a quirk of the undersea music: The whales sing the same song for a few years, adding individual embellishments and making it increasingly complex all the while. And then, poof, they switch to a simpler tune and start the cycle over again. In fact, lead researcher Jenny Allen of the University of Queensland refers to this switch as a \"cultural revolution\" in a UQ news release. So why the abrupt change to a new tune? One theory is that the songs become so complex that the whales reach their limit of being able to learn new material, according to the study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The researchers studied 412 song cycles from 95 singing whales over 13 years, per Science. While the whales generally sing the same song, the researchers found that individuals add their own touches, perhaps to help them stand out. (Only the males sing.) Another part of the pattern: Whale populations sometimes pick up a new tune from a different population\u2014such as when eastern Australian humpbacks meet their western counterparts at a common feeding ground. Smithsonian likens this to a game of whale \"telephone.\" But the same pattern follows: The songs begin simple and grow more complex until they're ditched altogether for a new one.
