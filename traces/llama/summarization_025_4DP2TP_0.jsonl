therefore , neutrino dis serves , for now , as an important benchmark process to perform rigorous and refined comparisons between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations . in the long run , a high luminosity neutrino factory could , of course , considerably raise the accuracy of present day information from @xmath8-dis . \n the theoretical calculations of inclusive charged current charm production have been carefully studied in the literature . \n additionally , the charm fragmentation spectrum has also been calculated in detail . while inclusive calculations are sufficient for many tasks , a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data at nlo requires additional information from the theoretical side . in \n charged current @xmath8-fe charm production , the detector acceptance depends on the full range of kinematic variables : @xmath9 . \n here , @xmath10 is the bjorken-@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the virtuality of the @xmath12-boson , @xmath13 is the scaled energy of the charm after fragmentation , and @xmath14 is the charm rapidity . \n the theoretical task is , _ mutatis mutandis _ \n , not too different from the extraction of the neutral current charm structure function @xmath15 as performed by the hera experiments ; the hera analysis uses the theoretical calculation of the differential cross section to extrapolate into regions of poor acceptance .    in this short report,@xcite \n we briefly discuss the key factors that influence the acceptance of the experimental detector , review the theoretical calculation of the fully differential cross section at nlo in qcd , and present numerical results for typical fixed target kinematics . \n dimuon events from neutrino charged current charm production can provide a clear set of events from which to study the strange sea . their signiture in a detector is a pair of oppositely charged muons and hadronic shower originating from the same vertex . the second muon is produced in the semileptonic decay of the charmed particle . in order to properly reconstruct these events from data , \n a minimum energy requirement must be applied to this muon . to be visible at all \n , it must first be energetic enough that it travels further in the detector than the particles which make up the hadronic shower . \n the background from muons from nonprompt decays of pions and kaons within the shower is large at low energy , and must also be reduced . \n typically a cut on the charm decay muon s energy of a few gev is applied to guarantee it is reconstructable , and reduce the nonprompt backgrounds . \n this energy requirement leads to a dependence on variables in addition to the typical @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 or @xmath18 dependence of the charged current cross section . \n the energy of the decay muon depends on the energy of the charmed meson from which it decays , and therefore depends on the fragmentation parameter @xmath13 . in nlo \n , it also depends on the transverse momentum of the charmed quark . \n an event with a low @xmath13 , and/or high transverse momentum will be less likely to pass a cut on the decay muon s energy than one with a high @xmath13 and no transverse momentum . \n it is therefore important that the charm production cross section s dependence on these variables be understood for a monte carlo to be able to model dimuon event acceptance properly . \n recorded charged - current charm production rates must be corrected for the detector acceptance which , as discussed above , depends on the full range of kinematic variables @xmath19 . \n therefore , we must obtain the nlo theoretical cross section which is completely differential in all these variables . as the nlo theoretical cross section contains @xmath20-function distributions and `` plus''-distributions , \n there are many inherent difficulties combining this program with a complex detector simulation mc program . \n the singular distributions are nothing but an unphysical artifact of regularized perturbation theory ; for any physically observable quantity , these singularities will be smeared by soft gluon emission to yield physical c - number distributions . \n as the theoretical machinery of soft gluon resummation is not fully developed for semi - inclusive dis ( massive ) heavy quark production , we will use a two step phenomenological approach : 1 )  we regularize the nlo calculation to provide numerical distributions free of @xmath20-function and `` plus''-distributions by integrating over bins which reflect the finite resolution of the experimental detector . \n 2 )  this result is input to a monte carlo ( mc ) where additional effects , including iterated soft gluon emissions are added to the @xmath21 smearing from nlo kinematics to match a gaussian distribution that has been fit to data . \n in addition to the above complications , we also encounter large and negative sudakov logarithms close to the phase space boundary where , at fixed - order , soft single - gluon emission is enhanced . \n these sudakov logarithms diverge in the limit of zero bin - width ; as we increase our resolution via narrow binning , we begin to resolve the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions . '' \n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . \n having addressed the complication of mapping mathematical distributions onto c - number functions by the introduction of bins , we now present some preliminary results of step  1 ) of this calculation . \n we compute the normalized differential charm production cross section for the differential structure function with the binning procedure defined above .    for our variables , \n we choose the set @xmath22 where @xmath14 is the charm rapidity evaluated in the collinear ( @xmath23 ) target rest frame . in we present results for kinematics typical of a wide - band neutrino beam on a fixed target : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . \n we plot @xmath27 in 2-dimensions _ vs. _ \n @xmath13 and @xmath14 in -a . -b and -c show @xmath28 for the case where either @xmath14 or @xmath13 is integrated out . in both cases \n , we display this for fine - binnings of 1@xmath29100 or 100@xmath291 , and broad - binnings of 1@xmath295 or 10@xmath291 . as an important cross - check on these results \n , we verify that the binning @xmath30 ( rapidity integrated out ) reproduces the integrated results in the literature . \n we observe negative sudakov logarithms which occur at large @xmath13 where we have @xmath31 in the integrand . \n this effect is an artifact of our fixed - order result , and is clearly evident in -b where we see that in the case of fine binning and large @xmath13 , the distribution turns negative . \n the fine binning effectively resolves the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions , '' and results in an unphysical negative distribution . \n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . in an actual experimental analysis , \n this requirement of broad bins arises naturally given the finite detector resolution . \n hence , we observe that negative weights can be easily avoided by using sufficiently broad bins in a reasonable broadening of the binning    our use of bins to regularize the differential distributions will have negligible impact on the experimental analysis because our bin size is small compared to the experimental detector resolution , and also because the detector acceptance is a smooth function in terms of the set of kinematic variables . in particular , given the geometry of typical neutrino detectors , the effective experimental bin size in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is _ comfortably _ large enough for the purpose of regularizing the differential distributions with the binning technique . \n in conclusion , we have presented a fully differential nlo calculation of the neutrino - induced dis charm production process . \n this calculation is an essential ingredient for a complete analysis of the dimuon data , and will allow a precise determination of the strange quark pdf . \n we have demonstrated that by binning the data appropriately , we can interface the theoretical calculation ( containing @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions '' ) directly to the experimental monte carlo analysis program . \n we observe the enhancement of the sudakov logarithms at the phase - space boundaries , and verify that these can be controlled with this binning method . \n the fully differential distributions obtained here allow charged current neutrino dis experiments to use the complete nlo qcd result in the monte carlo data analysis . \n this analysis using the nutev data is in progress . \n these tools will allow us to extract the strange quark pdf from the dimuon data at nlo with unprecedented accuracy ; this information should prove crucial to understanding the behavior of the strange quark in the proton . \n the authors would like to thank t.  adams , t.  bolton , r.  frey , m.  goncharov , j.  morfin , r.  scalise , p.  spentzouris , and w .- k . \n tung , for helpful discussions . \n this research was supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-0070443 , by the u.s . \n department of energy , and by the lightner - sams foundation .      as space in this short report is limited , we refer the reader to our long paper for a complete set of references : s.  kretzer , d.  mason , f.  olness , _ differential distributions for nlo analyses of charged current neutrino - production of charm _ \n , e - print archive : hep - ph/0112191 .", "StartTimeOffset": 11392947480, "RequestID": "ee7aaa43f5562ecfae3b5f9d40588e2237757a6a", "TotalTokens": 2536}
{"ContextTokens": 2375, "GeneratedTokens": 225, "SynthesizedBody": "the problem of galaxy formation is a central problem of cosmology . \n recent pogresses , both from the theoretical side and the observational side , have triggered numerous works . \n the most dramatic changes are probably the ability to have access to direct information at high redshift : the hi gas , the star formation rate , the possible detection of an infrared background originating from early galaxies @xcite as well as the direct spectroscopy of high redshift field galaxies provide a number of observational constraints to which theories can now be confronted . \n the model we present has a amazing small number of free parameters , and still reproduces quite well several key observational constraints . \n it is generally believed that structure formation originated accordingly to the gravitational instability picture . \n structures which achieved a high contrast density , namely greater than 200 , are called virialized . \n properties of clusters of galaxies can actually be used as useful constraints on cosmological scenarios @xcite . \n the dynamics of dark matter seems to be understood well enough that the basic time evolution of the correlation function and the mass function of cosmic structures can be described at any redshift provide that the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations is known ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n first attempts to address the question of galaxy formation has met a first important apparent success : it has been suggested that a criteria to differentiate dark halos leading to galaxies from those leading to clusters is the cooling criteria . \n when gas falls in a potential it is shock - heated ( and/or by adiabatic compression ) up to the virial temperature allowing the gas to be in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n numerical simulations has confirmed @xcite that this simple argument provides an accurate estimation of the actual temperature : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total mass in unit of @xmath3 of the object forming at redshift @xmath4 . \n the typical size of the halo is : @xmath5 when the gas reaches its virial temperature , it has a characteristic cooling time . \n clusters typically represent structures for which the cooling time exceeds the age of the universe , while for galaxies it is much shorter . \n it is tempting therefore to conclude that the cooling criteria can be used as a criteria for star formation : if the gas is able to cool , it will contract in a runaway fashion , which is can end up only by star formation ( as there is not so much cooled gas in the universe ) . \n this argument successfully explains the order of magnitude of the luminosity of the brightest galaxies ( @xmath6 ) . \n the previous scheme has remained a qualtitative picture for a while . \n however , the need for a more quantitative picture has become clear as the amount of data on distant galaxies has increased : from the number counts of faint galaxies to the recent star formation rate versus redshift . \n the first basic difficulty one faces on in the simple cooling scheme is the so - called overcooling problem : at high redshift a large fraction of the baryons lies is small potentials with temperatures in the range @xmath7k in which cooling is extremely efficient . \n consequently , most of the baryons are expected to have been cooled by now . \n this is in clear contradiction with two basic facts : known stars represent only a small fraction of baryons predicted by nucleosynthesis , typically 10% and most of the baryonic content of clusters is still in the gas phase , while most of them should have been cooled . \n both facts suggest that only 10% to 20% of the primordial baryons were actually turn into stars during the cosmic history . \n this problem was first pointed out by blanchard et al . @xcite and cole @xcite . \n a simple estimate of the integrated cooled fraction can be obtained from the mass function of cosmic structures , by noticing that any piece of gas within a halo with @xmath8k should have settled in the cooling region at some earlier epoch @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the mass of halos which have a virial temperature of @xmath11k at redshift @xmath4 . \n the amount of total cooled gas at different redshift is presented in figure [ fig : ftot ] . \n the reality of this overcooling problem is not easy to test by mean of numerical simulations because of resolution limitations \n . however , navarro & steinmetz found that [ eq : ftot ] provide a reasonable approximation and therefore qiute reasonable to believe that the simple based press and schechter argument can be used . \n therefore , the solution of the ovecooling problem implies that the gas have undergone some substantial reheating . \n the fact that the x - ray luminosity of clusters does not scale as predicted by the scaling argument provide a further evidence of a complicated baryon history . \n the existence of a reheating phase of baryons has been advocated in various contexts in galaxy formation scenario . \n for instance , white and frenk @xcite argued that the energy input of supernova from the first generation of stars is able to prevent the cooling of the gas that remains confined in galactic scale halos . \n blanchard et al . \n @xcite suggested a rather different picture : the first objects which form heat the igm to a temperature high enough that most of the gas does not fall in most of the forming potentials in which cooling would have been possible otherwise because of the temperature of the gas . \n this introduces the idea that a key physical quantity controlling galaxy formation is the temperature of the igm , which could be regulated by galaxy formation . \n the basic equation which governs the temperature of the igm in a self - regulated picture is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature of the igm at redshift @xmath4 , @xmath14 is the mass associated to this temperature , @xmath15 is the total energy ouput resulting from star formation ( essentially supernova ) and @xmath16 is the energy fraction which is transferred to the igm and @xmath17 is the cooling function . as the igm is likely to be photo - ionized at the same time that it undergoes the reheating we used the cooling function of a photoionized gas . \n the temperature of the igm versus redshift depends on the value of the efficiency of energy injection to the igm . \n the temperature of the igm is increasing from @xmath11k to reach a maximum value between @xmath18k and @xmath19k at redshift of the order of 3 to 5 depending on the details of the model . \n such a high temperature will easily explain the absence of detected gunn - peterson decreement , even if most of the baryons lies in the igm . \n explaining the existence of lyman-@xmath20 clouds will be certainly challenging for this scenario : they could not be small halos nor large scale fluctuations in the igm \n . a possible explanation might be that they are the extended parts of galactic disks . \n although this model is relatively simple , there are still a number of free parameters . \n the power spectrum as well as the primodial nucleosynthesis value have been left free until now . \n the final important free parameter is the value of @xmath16 . \n @xmath21 means that the energy transfer is 100% efficient for a standard imf ( a higher value could be used , due to a non standard imf or because of extra energy input ) . \n the parameter @xmath16 can be constrained by computing the integrated amount of stars produced . \n the gas which has been cooled can be compared directly the amount of observed hi gas versus redshift : this is presented on figure [ fig : hi ] . \n the models which are presented are those who explained the present amount of stars . at this stage , there are no free parameters other than the power spectrum . \n the standard cdm spectrum do not lead to the right amount of hi versus redshift , while the @xmath22 fits impressively well the observed distribution . \n given the relatively small number of free parameters , this is rather amazing . \n a further step can be obtained by noticing that the hi gas is likely to be the progenitors of present day stars ( or at least of the progenitors of stars in disks ) . assuming that te hi gas is transformed in stars but with some delay \n , we can infer the star formation rate at different redshift and compare it to the one inferred by madau @xcite from the cfrs survey and hdf . \n this is illustrated by figure [ fig : mad ] . \n such modeling is rather crude , but is still rather instructive : we found that the rapid decrease of star formation rate between redshift 1 and 0 is expected in the self - regulated photoionized picture . \n moreover the amplitude can be well reproduced , provide that star formation from cooled hi is delayed by 2 gyr . \n the high redshift star formation rate is not well reproduced : the theoretical model systematically predicted a higher star formation rate . \n it is fundamental to realize that this is due to the fact the madau star formation rate integrated from redshift 5 to 0 can not explain the total amount of present day stars , and therefore either this formation rate has been underestimated or there is an other period of earlier star formation at high redshift ( which is not expected in any of the models presented here ) . \n one of the strongest problem in the galaxy formation history is the so - called overcooling problem . \n it is likely that its solution and consequently the galaxy formation history is connected to the thermal ( and chemical ) history of the igm . \n we have presented a simple global coherent picture of the stars formation history based on the hypothesis of a self - regulating mechanism . \n this simple model impressively succeeds in explaining the whole set of present day observational constraints one can set on galaxy formation theory . \n it is therefore interesting to investigate such a model in more details . \n 99 bartlett , j. , 1997 , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3660, "GeneratedTokens": 89, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years considerable attention has been devoted to studying the properties of disordered systems with the hope of understanding percolative phenomena . \n key to several such approaches has been the concept of randomness and also of frustration [ 1 - 12 ] . \n however , many of the patterns we encounter in nature are not random but self - similar and scale invariant [ 13 - 14 ] . \n for instance , the complicated and scale invariant structures that occur when a solid mixture evolves via an aggregation process [ 15 ] . to understand such systems the concept of fractals has been found to be very useful . \n fractals are scale invariant objects that may be considered as intermediate lattices between regular and random ( disordered ) lattices [ 13 - 14,16 - 17 ] . \n such a fractal lattice describes a class of random systems where the consequence of the loss of translational invariance of a lattice can be studied in detail . \n additionally , resulting from their dialational symmetry , statistical , mechanical and transport problems are solvable ; hence the attraction of the model in such studies [ 14 ] . \n in this paper we consider a particular class of fractal known as the _ \n n_-simplex lattices , to model various properties of inhomogeneous materials [ 16 -

order network as a unit resistor offering resistance @xmath7 . \n a unit current enters the network at one of the external nodes and leaves through another , the rest of nodes being left open . \n it is known that the distribution of currents in such a network is found to be multifractal [ 18 ] in the sense that different moments of the distribution scale with different exponents .    for resistance \n scaling analysis two methods may be adopted , either ( a ) to obtain the distribution of current over the entire network and measure the energy dissipated in the system or ( b ) to simplify the network and obtain a closed - form solution . \n this second method has been used rigorously by us for resistance scaling and the results obtained by this method match those from the current distribution method . \n the moments of the current in a _ \n n_-simplex are : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the current in the _ p_th bond and @xmath10 goes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the cumulant for an arbitrary exponent @xmath14 . \n the currents flowing in at the external nodes of a @xmath5-simplex are represented by @xmath15 , @xmath16, ............ @xmath17 respectively ( see figure 1 ) with the condition @xmath18 . \n a scaling factor independent of @xmath15 , @xmath16 ........ @xmath17 can then be defined as : @xmath19    note that @xmath20 is related to the fractal scaling exponent @xmath21 . for a fractal with a resistance scaling parameter of 2 , \n the _ r_th generation length scales as @xmath22 . using the definitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 \n , we get : @xmath25    the case @xmath26 determines the fractal dimension of the simplex because @xmath27 is simply the ratio of number of bonds in successive order of the _ \n n_-simplex lattice ; @xmath28 measures the heat loss in the network and gives resistance scaling . \n it has been shown [ 19 -

22 ] . \n > from the symmetry properties of the simplex , it is apparent that all _ ( n-2 ) _ external nodes apart from those through which current enters and leaves are at equipotential . \n redrawing just those bonds through which currents flow , we have _ ( n-1 ) _ parallel paths for current to flow . of these paths , \n one offers unit resistance and each of the others offer twice the unit resistance ( since they include two resistances in series ) . \n hence the equivalent resistance is given by : @xmath38\\ ] ] where r is the unit resistance and the square bracket contains exactly ( n-2 ) identical terms . \n this directly leads to : @xmath39    now if we consider a star of \n _ n_-branches , each offering a resistance of @xmath40 , the effective resistance between any two external nodes through which current flows will be @xmath41 as they are in series and all other nodes being left open . \n it is then straight forward to show using these transformation for @xmath5-simplex lattice that the following scaling holds good : @xmath42    > from equation ( 11 ) we know that for any _ n_-simplex the equivalent resistance of first order is : @xmath43 combined with equation ( 12 ) gives the equivalent resistance of _ \n r_th order as : @xmath44    thus we see how , by merely knowing the simplex one can calculate the equivalent resistance of any iteration . no long winded applications of kirchoff s laws are required to obtain the resistance scaling . \n the exponent @xmath36 is related to @xmath45 by : @xmath46 \n it has been shown that the @xmath47 moment of current distribution is associated with the noise exponent [ 18 ] . \n assuming that the cumulant @xmath48 can be expressed as a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath49 , the most general polynomial is a linear combination of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n these polynomials are defined as @xmath55    however in present case @xmath56 due to current conservation . \n hence @xmath48 can be written as @xmath57    the next step is to determine @xmath58 . to establish a recursion relation between + @xmath59 and @xmath60 we obtained current distribution in an @xmath5-simplex lattice at each node . \n it is easy to see that the current distribution at each node is @xmath61\\ ] ] by current conservation . in figure 1 \n we have shown the current along each bond . \n therefore , we can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the current cumulants of @xmath65th order of @xmath5-simplex lattice . \n @xmath66 , @xmath67 represents shaded region in figure 1 . above equation \n can be expressed as @xmath68 which establish the transformation relation between @xmath69 and @xmath65th order . comparing equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we obtain the recursion relation between the @xmath5-simplex lattices of the @xmath69 and @xmath65 th order . @xmath70 \n the eigenvalues corresponding to the transformation matrix for the @xmath5-simplex lattice are given by @xmath71 and the fractal scaling exponent corresponding to largest eigenvalue is @xmath72 \n we have seen that various moments of branch current give rise to different exponents , namely exponent @xmath31 associated with the noise amplitude , @xmath36 associated with resistance scaling and @xmath4 associated with the mass of the fractal . \n the relation between @xmath73 obtained in section 3 and the exponent @xmath31 for normalised noise is as follows : @xmath74    now , @xmath75 @xmath76 \n this gives : @xmath77 or , @xmath78    now , @xmath79 or , @xmath80 \n @xmath81    substituting this in equation(8 ) gives : @xmath82    this expression gives the respective values of the exponent @xmath31 as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the 3 , 4 and 5-simplex respectively . \n it is clear that the inequality @xmath86 is satisfied in each of the three cases .    in the limit @xmath5 \n goes to infinity @xmath87 goes to 1 . \n this is due to the fact that a large number of parallel equi -

{"ContextTokens": 3665, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years , smart grid has attracted significant interest in both communities of communications and power systems @xcite . in a smart grid , \n modern communication technologies are used to convey information like system parameters ( voltage , frequency , harmonics , etc ) and power consumption information in order to improve the robustness , agility and efficiency of power grid . \n for example , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : illu ] , phasor measurement units ( pmus ) send report to the power plant which takes actions to stabilize the power grid . \n however , the communication infrastructure also brings vulnerability to the smart grid . \n an attacker can attack the communication links using various approaches such as jamming in the physical layer and byzantine attack in the upper layers . \n the attack could result in delay or drop of report packets . \n the attacker may revise the report such that the received report is wrong , thus possibly incurring system instability and even large area blackout which brings the loss of millions of dollars . \n therefore , a secure design of smart grid is in a pressing need .    in this paper \n , we study the trustiness framework based secure control in smart grid . \n we assume that each report could be substituted by a false report from an attacker . instead of studying the security protocols in the communication networks , which has been intensively studied for data networks like internet , we focus on the controller side , i.e. , the power plant , which is aware of possible attacks . \n the controller can predict the future system state and then evaluate the trustiness of reports from different pmus . \n based on these trustiness , the controller takes a corresponding control strategy , e.g. , dropping untrusted packets . \n the trustiness will also be fed back to the pmus such that the pmus can adjust their security setups ( e.g. , the keys or the cryptography protocols ) . \n the system is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : illu ] . for example \n , the reports from pmu a is attacked by the attacker . \n then , the trustiness of the reports from pmu a is reduced , which may make the controller drop the corresponding reports . \n meanwhile , pmu a may change its key or use a more secure protocol when it finds out that its trustiness has been significantly decreased . \n note that the reliability issues for control systems have been considered in supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) standard @xcite . however , scada is mostly focused on the reliability subject to random failures , instead of malicious attacks . \n there are some studies on the control systems subject to malicious attacks @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n @xcite and @xcite introduce general problems and approaches for secure control without exploring the details . \n @xcite is focused on the control system subject to denial - of - service ( dos ) attacks , thus mainly addressing the packet delays or losses . \n there have not been any studies on combating the proofing attacks , particularly , applying the trustiness framework in the secure control . \n note that the trustiness system has been widely used in information systems , e.g. , @xcite@xcite . \n however , they are not designed for control systems . \n the unique system dynamics of the control system can be exploited to build the corresponding effective trustiness . in this paper , we apply kalman filtering @xcite to predict the system state using different combinations of pmu reports , thus realizing a cross - check of the report trustiness .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . the system model of the controller and communication infrastructure is introduced in section [ sec : system ] . \n a mechanism of evaluating the trustiness of different pmus is proposed in section [ sec : evaluation ] . \n the numerical simulation results and conclusions are provided in sections [ sec : numerical ] and [ sec : conclusion ] . \n in this section , we first introduce the linear system model for power grid . then , we explain the lqr criterion of the control .      we model the dynamics of power grid as a discrete - time linear system , whose \n dynamics are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an @xmath2-vector and represents the system state of the power grid , @xmath3 is an @xmath4-vector representing the observations and @xmath5 is the action taken by the controller . \n the matrices @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are specified by the system . \n both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gaussian noise . for simplicity \n , we suppose that each dimension of the observation vector @xmath3 is sensed by a pmu . \n it is easy to extend to the general case in which the sensor reports have overlaps . \n each pmu sends its observations to the controller via a communication channel since they are not located at the same place as the controller . \n we use the following assumptions throughout the paper :    * each report can be successfully received by the controller if there is no attack . \n this is reasonable for communication channels with good qualities . \n for the practical case of occasional packet drop , the control strategy can be obtained by considering the corresponding element in the observation matrix @xmath8 as zero . * each report could be replaced with a false report by an intervening attacker . \n the attacker could intercept the report and insert its own one . \n however , we assume that not all reports are replaced . * for simplicity \n , we assume that there is at most one attacker . \n the principle of the trustiness system can be extended to the case of multiple attackers at the cost of more computational cost .      when there is no attacker , we assume that the controller adopts the lqr control @xcite with an infinite time horizon with the cost function given by @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive definite matrices . \n the physical meaning of the objective function is given below :    * the term @xmath14 is the norm ( with respect to the positive definite matrix @xmath12 ) of the system state vector . * \n the term @xmath15 is the norm of the action vector with respect to the matrix @xmath13 , which represents the cost due to the action itself . \n based on the cost function in ( [ eq : lqg ] ) , the lqr action @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the estimation of the system state fed back from a state estimator which will be explained later , and @xmath19 and the matrix @xmath1 satisfies the algebraic riccati equation , which is given by @xmath20 \n in this section , we propose a mechanism for evaluating the trustiness of each sensor . \n the essential reason that the controller can evaluate the trustiness of each sensor is that the controller can predict the future state with some uncertainty . \n if the report from a sensor is significantly deviated from the prediction , then the controller can consider this sensor as unreliable and ignores its reports . \n the basic principle is to evaluate the trustiness of each pmu by comparing its report with the prediction obtained from the reports of other @xmath21 pmus . \n the procedure is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : kalman ] .          in each time slot \n , the controller can predict the system state in the next time slot , i.e. , @xmath22 , according to its own action @xmath16 and the current system state @xmath23 . since it is possible \n that there is one attacker , the controller computes @xmath2 predictions by excluding one sensor in each prediction . \n the kalman filtering can be applied for the system state estimation . according to @xcite , the system state @xmath22 is gaussian distributed . \n when the observation @xmath24 from pmu @xmath25 is excluded , the expectation of the system state is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 where @xmath28 is obtained by removing the @xmath25-th row from the observation matrix @xmath8 , and @xmath29 and covariance matrix given by @xmath30 where @xmath31      using the prediction obtained from the reports of pmus except pmu @xmath25 , the _ a posteriori _ probability of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 ( here @xmath34 means the observations excluding that of pmu @xmath25 ) , is gaussian distributed with the expectation given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath25-th row in matrix @xmath8 , and variance @xmath37    we denote by @xmath38 the type of pmu @xmath25 . @xmath39 if pmu @xmath25 is an attacker ; otherwise @xmath40 . \n then , we define the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 as the following conditional probability , which is given by @xmath41 the trustiness can be defined as @xmath42 . \n the challenges for computing the suspicious level is the unknown attacking strategy . \n we first assume that there must be an attacker . using the bayesian rule \n , we have @xmath43 where the last approximation is obtained by decomposing the joint distribution into the product of the probabilities in each time slot . \n note that this approximation is not rigorous . \n however , it simplifies the computation and the validity will be demonstrated in the numerical simulations . \n we do the following further simplification : @xmath44 by assuming the independence among the pmus . \n although this assumption does not hold , it simplifies the analysis . \n we further assume that @xmath45 is a constant since we have no knowledge about the attacker s strategy . substituting the approximation in ( [ eq : approx ] ) into ( [ eq : trust ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 we then approximate the probability @xmath47 by @xmath48 . \n when it is possible that there is no attacker , it is easy to repeat the above procedure and obtain the following approximation for the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 , which is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the _ a priori _ likelihood that there is no attacker , which is given by @xmath51 obviously , the large @xmath50 is , the less sensitive the controller is to possible attackers . \n one approach to handle the attacker is to omit its reports once determining that it is an attacker . \n alternatively , we propose a heuristic approach for the control based on the trustiness values , called _ \n weighted prediction_. suppose that we still use the lqr control . \n then , the control action taken at time @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where the system state estimation is a function dependent on the suspicious levels of different pmus . \n we set @xmath54 where the estimation is the weighted sum of the system state estimations of different excluded pmus . \n when the suspicious level of pmu @xmath25 is high , the corresponding system state estimation @xmath55 , which excludes the reports from pmu @xmath25 , will dominate ( recall that @xmath56 is obtained by excluding the reports from pmu @xmath25 ) . \n the proposed algorithms are summarized in procedure [ alg : trustiness ] . \n in this section , we use numerical simulations to demonstrate the proposed trustiness system in smart grid . \n we adopt the linear model analyzed in example 6.2 of @xcite , in which the system is described using the following continuous - time linear dynamics : @xmath57 where the matrix @xmath58 is given by    @xmath59    and the matrix @xmath60 is given in ( [ eq : mat_k ] ) ( at the top of the next page ) . \n the details of the model can be found in @xcite .    since we discuss the discrete - time model in this paper , we approximate the continuous - time model by setting a small time step @xmath61 , which is given by @xmath62 therefore , we assume the following discrete - time model : @xmath63 where we ignore the step @xmath61 in the index . \n we assume that the pmus can observe the system state directly , i.e. , @xmath64 , each pmu for one dimension . \n we further assume that pmu 1 is malicious while all other pmus are honest . \n @xmath65      in figures [ fig : attack ] and [ fig : attack2 ] , the evolution of the suspicious level is shown for the attacker and two honest pmus . in fig . \n [ fig : attack ] , we assume that the report of the attacker is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance 0.1 . the attacker decides to attack or not to attack with probability 0.2 ( called _ attack frequency _ ) . \n we observe that there is some fluctuation at the beginning . \n then , at the times when the attacker launches attacks , the suspicious level of the attacker increases significantly . \n after around 80 time slots , the attacker can be well distinguished from the two honest pmus . in fig . \n [ fig : attack2 ] , we assume that the attacker attaches a gaussian noise with zero expectation and variance 0.1 to the observation . the attack frequency is increased to 0.5 . \n we observe that the suspicious level increases more smoothly .              in fig . \n [ fig : cdf ] , we plot the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) curves of the time when the controller claims that an attacker is detected . \n we assume that the controller claims the attacker when the suspicious level is larger than 0.7 . \n the cases of false alarms are excluded ( note that a false alarm is defined as the event that a honest pmu is claimed to be an attacker ) . \n we change the attack frequencies from 0.1 to 0.3 . \n the linear system runs for 200 time slots . \n we observe that , when the attack frequency is 0.1 , the attacker is not detected within the 200 time slots in around 40% cases . \n when the attack frequency is increased , the attacker will be detected faster .        in fig . \n [ fig : roc ] , we plot the receiver operation characteristic ( roc ) curves , which show the average delay of detection ( excluding the false alarms ) and false alarm rate . \n the attack frequencies are 0.2 and 0.4 , respectively . \n again , we use the threshold of 0.7 for the suspicious level . \n obviously , the detection delay increases when the attack frequency becomes larger with a fixed false alarm rate .          in figures [ fig : cost1 ] and [ fig : \n cost2 ] , the cost averaged over 2000 time slots and 100 realizations is shown . \n we assume that @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( [ eq : lqg ] ) , i.e. , we pay much more attention to the norm of the system state . \n we compare the costs using the weighted system state estimation in section [ sec : evaluation ] and the system without any counter measure for the attacker ( i.e. , full trust to each pmu ) .    in our test \n , we found that a small amplitude attack ( e.g. , the attacker uses the same attack as in fig . \n [ fig : cdf ] ) causes very small impact on the system . \n this is because that the kalman filter has certain inherent robustness since the attack can be partially mitigated by observations from other pmus . \n therefore , we assume that the report of pmu1 is the sum of the original report and a strong noise with a large variance , which is called _ attack amplitude_. in fig . \n [ fig : cost1 ] , we assume that the attack amplitude is 100 and change the attack probabilities . \n we observe that , as the attack probabilities increases , the average cost of the full trust case is significantly increased . \n meanwhile , the total cost is decreased as the attack frequency increases . \n a possible reason is that a higher attack frequency may cause a more rapid degradation of the trustiness of the attacker . \n the total cost is also shown for different attack amplitudes in fig . \n [ fig : cost2 ] . \n again , the total cost increases as the attack amplitude is increased in the full trust case . in a contrast to fig . [ \n fig : cost1 ] , the average cost of the weighted system state case is not a monotonic function of the attack amplitude . \n the reason could be : when the attack amplitude is small , the attacker causes little damage to the system ; when the amplitude is large , the controller can detect the attacker early and avoid the cost in later time slots . \n in this paper , we have analyzed the possible spoof attack on the smart grid system , in which the attacker can intercept and true report and send its faked report to the controller , which can cause severe damage to the power grid . \n we have proposed a trustiness system for the controller , in which multiple kalman filtering processes , with each pmu excluded , are used to cross check the suspiciousness of each pmu . \n the suspicious levels are then used as weights for the system state estimation for the lqr control . \n numerical simulations have shown that the attacker can be effectively detected and the weighted system prediction approach significantly outperforms the system unaware of possible attacks .                              c. w. taylor , d. c. erickson , k. e. martin , r. e. wilson and v. venkatasubramanian , `` wacs - wide - are stability and voltage control system : r&d and online demonstration , '' _ proceedings of the ieee _ , pp.892906 , may 2005 .", "StartTimeOffset": 77290541850, "RequestID": "1d790ce9a6b1eacb827f6c7f89e2d26647aa5237", "TotalTokens": 3798}

impedance amplifier , limiting amplifier , bi - phase mark ( bpm ) decoder with clock recovery , and lvds drivers to send the decoded data and recovered clock off the asic . \n all transistors are fabricated with thin oxide , allowing the asic to run with a 1.5 v power supply . \n the clock and data recovery is accomplished using a delay locked loop that contains networks of switchable capacitors in the delay stages allow for the three operating frequencies , 40 , 160 , and 320 mb / s . however , due to insufficient time to optimize the design , the asics operate at somewhat lower speed and require higher threshold currents to achieve a low bit error rate ( ber ) . \n other than these two limitations , the performance of the asics is satisfactory , including clock jitter , duty cycle , rise / fall time , and high / low levels of the lvds drivers .    for the irradiation , \n the asics were tested in two different setups of four asics each . \n the first setup was purely electrical while the second setup involved a pin diode so that we could decouple the electrical and optical degradations . in both setups , \n the decoded data were transmitted to the control room using 20 m of coax . in the first setup , \n 40 mb / s bpm signals were transmitted over 20 m of coax to the asics . \n the long cable precluded testing at higher speed . in the second setup , we sent 40 mb / s bpm signal via a fiber to a pin diode coupled to an asic . \n for both setups , we observed single event upset during the spill but observed no degradation in the threshold for @xmath11 error / s as a function of dosage . \n we also monitored the ber vs. pin current during the irradiation . \n the ber decreased with larger pin current and was higher for an asic coupled to a pin diode as expected ( fig . \n [ ber ] ) . \n the current consumption was constant during the irradiation . \n detailed post - irradiation analysis reveals no significant degradation in the overall performance . \n the clock multiplier circuits consist of charge pump / ring oscillator phase locked loops ( pll ) with dividers in the feedback loop . \n one circuit performs a frequency multiplication of 16 and the other a multiplication by 4 , both yielding a 640 mhz clock . \n the multipliers are designed using thin oxide transistors and are powered by a single 1.5 v supply . \n the multiplier circuits share a common 50  @xmath0 driver and lvds receiver enabling testing of only one multiplier at a time . \n an additional switching network allows the recovered clock from the pin receiver prototype to be routed to either multiplier to allow for testing of how the received signal jitter is coupled to the multiplied clock . \n four multipliers were packaged for the irradiation . \n all asics functioned well with clock jitter of @xmath2 8 ps ( 0.5% ) . during the irradiation \n , we observed that the clocks of two asics lost lock and power cycling was needed to resume operation at 640 mhz . \n this problem is not yet understood . \n detailed post - irradiation analysis also reveals no significant degradation in the overall performance . \n we have designed prototype asics using the 130 nm process to enhance the radiation - hardness . \n the submission has been mostly successful . \n we irradiated the asics to a dose of 70 mrad and observed no significant degradation except in the vcsel driver . \n post - irradiation analysis indicates that there is a significant threshold shift in the pmos transistors fabricated in the thick oxide technology for the operation at 2.5 v to drive the vcsel . \n an improved version of the asic will be submitted implementing what we learned from the study . \n this work was supported in part by the u.s . \n department of energy under contract no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3127, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "after decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , it is generally taken for granted that neutrinos are massive particles that can vary among all the three flavors through the oscillation process described by neutrino mixing . \n one of the most important issues concerning neutrino mixing is the determination of the neutrino mixing matrix , i.e. , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata  ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite , which is the lepton sector counterpart of the quark sector mixing matrix , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . \n the pmns matrix is defined as the correlation matrix linking neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath0 and mass eigenstates @xmath1 , @xmath2 this mixing matrix is conventionally represented in the standard chau - keung ( ck ) scheme  @xcite as    @xmath3    where three mixing angles are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , with their trigonometric functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . represented by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . respectively . \n the _ cp_-violating phase is denoted by @xmath11 , meanwhile @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the other two phases in the case of majorana neutrinos . in the case of dirac neutrinos , \n the latter two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be removed by redefinition , thus there remain only four independent parameters , i.e. , three mixing angles together with one _ cp_-violating phase . \n if the neutrinos are of majorana type , the two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 are needed for a full determination of the mixing matrix . \n as the majorana phases do not manifest themselves in the oscillation , we ignore these two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 and take only the first term on the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ cke ] ) in this article . by now , the quark - sector mixing matrix has been measured with good precision . in the lepton sector , the values of the three mixing angles have been measured after years of neutrino oscillation experiments , though with relatively lower precision compared to the quark case . \n the explicit form of the fermion mixing matrix is not unique and an alternative scheme is the kobayashi - maskawa  ( km ) scheme  @xcite @xmath14 in the km scheme , as will be mentioned later , the _ cp_-violating phase of the quark sector is quite near @xmath15 , leading to the hypothesis of `` maximal _ cp _ violation ''  @xcite . \n besides the ck and km schemes , in ref . \n @xcite all the other possible schemes of the mixing matrix are considered and presented . \n there are actually 12 schemes of mixing matrix . among them \n , 3 schemes can be transformed into others through straightforward redefinition of mixing angles , thus leaving 9 different schemes  @xcite , whose forms are provided in sec . \n [ sec2 ] . \n quark - lepton complementarity  ( qlc )  @xcite and self - complementarity  ( sc )  @xcite are phenomenological relations of quark and lepton mixing angles . \n they provide a novel connection to link quarks and leptons . \n they can be expressed in a more clear way as ( [ qlcsc1])-([qlcsc4 ] ) : @xmath16 ( from now on we use @xmath17 to represent lepton sector mixing angles to distinguish them from quark sector mixing angles @xmath18 . )    here we have marked the two qlc relations by qlc1 and qlc2 , and the two slightly different sc relations by sc1 and sc2 respectively . \n originally these phenomenological relations are observed only in the ck scheme and fit the experimental results within small errors . \n however , a question naturally arises , i.e. , whether these relations still hold in schemes other than the ck scheme since we can not find any justification for the priority of the ck scheme . \n there are already some researches on qlc and sc in the nine schemes  @xcite . \n however , all of these examinations of qlc and sc are carried out under some fixed phase choices . since the _ cp_-violating phase of the lepton sector \n is not determined from current experiment , in this article we examine qlc and sc with the whole range variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase . \n these will be treated in sec . \n [ sec3 ] and sec . \n [ sec4 ] . \n we purpose to make a detailed re - analysis of qlc and sc in all the nine schemes , emphasizing on the influences due to the variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase . in sec . \n [ sec2 ] we use the latest experiment results to do calculations on mixing angles and _ cp_-violating phases in all the nine schemes . in sec . \n [ sec3 ] we focus on qlc , examine these complementarity relations and make some analyses . in sec . \n [ sec4 ] we similarly examine and analyze sc . in sec . \n [ sec5 ] we discuss some properties of _ \n cp_-violating phases among different schemes with a suggestion of convention redefinition , and suggest some empirical relations among quark _ cp_-violating phases in different schemes . \n first we list all the nine schemes mentioned in sec . \n [ sec1 ] in table  [ tabscheme ] .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n some empirical relations we can easily read out are listed here : @xmath19 in fact , ( [ 1 ] ) are satisfied by the similarities between their mixing angles . from table \n [ tab1 ] , we have these relations approximately  ( here @xmath20 represents @xmath21 in p@xmath22 scheme ) : @xmath23 then using the scheme - independent jarlskog invariant , we get @xmath24 justifying the relation ( [ 1 ] ) . by the same way , ( [ 3 ] ) \n is justified through the similarities among mixing angles in p6 , p8 , and p9 . \n relation ( [ 2 ] ) states possible maximal _ cp _ violation as we discussed before , and relation ( [ 4 ] ) merely reflects the relative largeness of the three mixing angles in p7 . with the existence of _ cp _ \n violation confirmed , @xmath25 can not be exactly @xmath26 though close to it  @xcite . \n we are willing to find out some similar empirical relations on lepton _ cp_-violating phases . \n unfortunately , similar relations can not be easily found , because the lepton mixing angles are quite different from each other in different schemes , thus invalidating our method used for the quark sector . \n from the results of sec .  [ sec3 ] and sec . \n [ sec4 ] , the validation of qlc and sc depends on the choices of schemes and lepton _ cp_-violating phases , and careful inspections should be carried out when we consider the generalization of qlc and sc from the standard ck scheme to the other eight schemes . on the issues of _ cp_-violating phases , restrictions on lepton _ cp_-violating phases in p6@xmath27p9 are recognized . \n simultaneous maximal _ \n violation in both the quark and the lepton sector is possible in the p2 and p3 scheme . \n a redefinition of _ cp_-violating phases for unification is suggested and some empirical relations on the quark _ cp_-violating phases are explored . \n all of these results may enrich our knowledge of qlc , sc relations , and _ cp_-violating phases , helping us understand the mystery of lepton mixing . \n this work is supported by the principal fund for undergraduate research at peking university . \n it is also partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( grants no .  11021092 , no . \n 10975003 , no . \n 11035003 , and no . \n 11120101004 ) , by the national fund for fostering talents of basic science ( grants no . \n j1030310 ) , and by the research fund for the doctoral program of higher education ( china ) . \n 50 b.  pontecorvo , sov . \n jetp * 26 * , 984 ( 1968 ) ; + z.  maki , m.  nakagawa and s.  sakata , prog . \n * 28 * , 870 ( 1962 ) . \n n.  cabibbo , phys . \n * 10 * , 531 ( 1963 ) ; + m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa , prog . \n theor . phys . \n * 49 * , 652 ( 1973 ) . \n chau and w.y . \n keung , phys . \n * 53 * , 1802 ( 1984 ) . \n m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa , prog . \n . phys . * 49 * 652 ( 1973 ) . \n y. koide , phys . \n b * 607 * , 123 ( 2005 ) . \n y.  koide and h.  nishiura , phys . \n d * 79 * , 093005 ( 2009 ) . \n frampton and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n b * 688 * , 67 ( 2010 ) ; p.h . \n frampton and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n d * 82 * , 017301 ( 2010 ) . \n li and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 691 * , 37 ( 2010 ) . \n n.  qin and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b 695 , 194 ( 2011 ) ; n.  qin and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n d 83 , 033006 ( 2011 ) . \n ahn , h.y . \n cheng and s.  oh , phys . lett . \n b * 701 * , 614 ( 2011 ) . \n h. fritzsch and z .- z . \n xing , phys . \n d * 57 * 594 ( 1998 ) . \n zheng , phys . \n d * 81 * , 073009 ( 2010 ) . \n x.  zhang and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 710 * , 630 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  zhang , y .- j . \n zheng and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n d * 85 * 097301 ( 2012 ) . \n a.  y.  smirnov , arxiv : hep - ph/0402264 . \n h.  minakata and a.y . \n smirnov , phys . \n * 70 * , 073009 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  raidal , phys . rev \n * 93 * , 161801 ( 2004 ) . \n see , e.g. , p.  h.  frampton and r.  n.  mohapatra , j. high energy phys . * \n 0501 * , 025 ( 2005 ) ; n.  li and b .- q .  ma , phys . \n d * 71 * , 097301 ( 2005 ) ; s.  antusch , s.  f.  king and r.  n.  mohapatra , phys . \n b * 618 * , 150 ( 2005 ) ; h.  minakata , ; j.  ferrandis and s.  pakvasa , phys . \n d * 71 * , 033004 ( 2005 ) ; s.k . \n kang , c.s . \n kim and j.  lee , phys . \n b * 619 * , 129 ( 2005 ) ; m.a . \n schmidt and a.y . \n smirnov , phys . \n d * 74 * , 113003 ( 2006 ) ; k.  a.  hochmuth and w.  rodejohann , phys . \n d * 75 * , 073001 ( 2007 ) ; f.  plentinger , g.  seidl and w.  winter , phys . rev . \n d * 76 * , 113003 ( 2007 ) ; g.  altarelli , f.  feruglio and l.  merlo , j. high energy phys . * 0905 * , 020 ( 2009 ) . \n y .- j .  zheng and b .- q . \n j. plus * 127 * , 7 ( 2012 ) . \n l.  wolfenstein , phys . \n lett . * 51 * , 1945 ( 1983 ) . \n j.  beringer _ \n ( particle data group ) , phys . \n d * 86 * , 010001 ( 2012 ) . c.  jarlskog , phys . \n * 55 * 1039 ( 1985 ) ; + d .- d . \n wu , phys . \n d * 33 * 860 ( 1986 ) ; + o.w . \n greenberg , phys . \n d * 32 * 1841 ( 1985 ) . \n g.  l.  fogli , e.  lisi , a.  marrone , d.  montanino , a.  palazzo , and a.  rotunno , phys . \n d * 86 * , 013012 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  zhang and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 713 * , 202 ( 2012 ) ; arxiv:1204.6604 [ hep - ph ] . \n k.  abe _ et al . \n * 107 * 041801 ( 2011 ) , . \n . lett . * 107 * , 181802 ( 2011 ) . c.  jarlskog phys . \n b * 625 * , 63 ( 2005 ) . \n li , h .- h . \n lin and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n b * 711 * , 57 ( 2012 ) . \n see , also , jean - marc gerard , arxiv:0811.0540 .", "StartTimeOffset": 92192100875, "RequestID": "12ff70a8b32b0a776cd0b07e343bd2e1daa45b3e", "TotalTokens": 3307}

@xmath57 in this section , we do not restrict @xmath41 to be small . instead , we note that since @xmath58 , typically @xmath59 . \n we choose the dynamics of @xmath60 to be @xmath61 in the above @xmath55 and @xmath56 may be treated as constants on the scale of variation over a period @xmath62 . \n in that situation , eqs([eq44 ] ) and ( [ eq45 ] ) reduce to @xmath63 since @xmath64 , we write the approximate solution of eq([eq46 ] ) as @xmath65 we now average eqs([eq42 ] ) and ( [ eq43 ] ) over the fast variations , drop terms that are @xmath66 and obtain @xmath67 which is the unforced system in the coarse - grained variables . \n the picture , which emerges is as follows : under a high frequency modulation , the motion can be explained as a rapidly oscillatory motion which is virtually identical to the trajectory of the unforced system . \n the amplitude of the fast variations decays according to @xmath68 as shown in eq([eq47 ] ) . \n numerical simulation of the system bears out these expectations.fig[[fig5 ] ]     is plotted against the frequency of modulation ( @xmath44 ) . \n the fitting function ( f(x ) ) supports the form of analytical result . ] \n in this paper we have shown that under lotka - volterra dynamics populations of predator and prey depend on their initial population densities . \n this dependence of initial population brings forth changes in dynamics but helps us formulate an effective mathew - hill type equation for this 2-species system under periodic seasonal changes . \n this also indicates slow seasonal changes have more effects in the variation of population than its faster counterpart . \n 99 a.j lotka , j. am . \n chem soc . * 42 * , 1595 ( 1920 ) . \n v. volterra , atti r. accad , naz . \n lincei , mem . \n fis , . mat . \n * 2 * , 31 ( 1926 ) . \n h. haken , _ synergetics _ , 3rd ed . \n ( springer - verlag , new york , 1983 ) . \n d. neal , _ introduction to population biology _ \n ( cambridge university press , cambridge , u.k . \n r. m. may , _ stability and complexity in model ecosystems _ \n ( princeton university press , princeton , 1973 ) . j. maynard smith , _ models in ecology _ ( cambridge university press , cambridge , u.k . 1974 ) . \n j. d. murray , _ mathematical biology _ , 3rd ed . \n ( springer - verlag , new york , 2002 ) , vols . \n t. fukai and s. tanaka , neural comput . \n * 9 * , 77 ( 1997 ) . \n zhang yi , k . k. tan , phys . \n e , * 66 * , 011910 ( 2002 ) . \n luca bianco , federico fontana , vincenzo manca j.j . \n hopeld , proc . \n usa * 81 * , 3088 ( 1984 ) . \n k. gopalsamy and x.z . \n he , physica d * 76 * , 344 ( 1994 ) . \n m. mobilia , t. goeorgiev , u. c. tuber , phys . \n e , * 73 * , 040903(r ) ( 2006 ) a. r. balsara , k. lindenberg and k. e. shuler , j. stat . phys,*27 * 787 ( 1982 ) a. b. budgor , b. j. west phys . \n a , * 17 * 370 ( 1978 ) mikhail f. dimentberg , phys . rev . \n e , * 65 * 036204 ( 2001 ) sabin g.c.w , summer d , math biosci . \n * 113 * 91 ( 1993 )", "StartTimeOffset": 106731891435, "RequestID": "e0a0ca5b0d20cfe8c07eac2c939471cb21933ee5", "TotalTokens": 3164}
{"ContextTokens": 3012, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "cosmological models predict that halos of luminous galaxies are assembled through merging of smaller structures . \n remnants of past mergers will survive for a long time in the halo as debris streams because of the very long dynamical time scale . \n the gaia mission offers a unique opportunity to search for and study these remnants with full phase space information in our galaxy s halo . \n however disentangling the possibly many remnants from each other and from the background of galactic stars will be very challenging . \n the gaia catalogue will contain about one billion objects of which the stars in the individual debris streams may form only a very small fraction . \n in addition the streams are spread out all over the sky . \n identifying them will require a combination of search methods that make use both of conserved dynamical quantities of the debris stream ( such as energy and angular momentum , see e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and astrophysical properties of the constituent stars ( from photometric data ) . \n the goals of this work are : * 1 . * study the retrieval from gaia data of remnants of satellite galaxies that have been disrupted in the potential of our galaxy ; * 2 . * \n include a realistic model of the galactic background population against which the remnants have to be detected ; * 3 . \n * gain practical experience with analysing and visualising the enormous volume of information that will be present in the gaia data - base .    to achieve \n this we built a monte carlo model of the smooth components of the galaxy containing a realistic number of stars and performed tree - code @xmath2-body simulations of satellites that are disrupted while orbiting the galaxy . \n the galaxy and satellite models were subsequently combined and gaia observations were simulated . in the following \n we summarise how the simulated gaia survey was generated , with emphasis on the proper combination of the satellite and milky way models , and we present some examples of the simulated gaia data . for details \n we refer to @xcite . \n the milky way model consists of three spatial components : a bulge with a plummer density law , a double exponential disk , and a flattened halo ( @xmath3 ) for which the density drops as @xmath4 . \n the kinematics are modelled in a very simple manner : each component rotates with constant velocity dispersion , for the bulge an isotropic dispersion is assumed , for the disk a different velocity ellipsoid is used for each spectral type ( obafgkm ) , while for the halo the dispersions are the same for each spectral type . \n the individual stars are assigned an absolute magnitude @xmath5 and a colour @xmath6 from a hess - diagram which is considered fixed for all galactic components and all positions throughout the galaxy . \n the hess - diagram is taken from table 47 of @xcite and provides the relative numbers of stars in bins of absolute magnitude ( @xmath5 ) and spectral type . \n these numbers integrated over spectral type provide the luminosity function . \n although this is a highly simplified and certainly not self - consistent model of the galaxy it is good enough for providing the ` background ' distribution in phase space against which the debris streams have to be found .    for a magnitude \n limited survey , as is the case for gaia , a straightforward monte carlo realisation of the galactic model is potentially a very wasteful procedure . \n most simulated stars will be too faint to be included in the survey . \n hence we used a strategy that minimizes wasted effort by generating stars only within the magnitude limited sphere centred on the observer . \n this results in a galaxy model with a luminosity function that is weighted by the space density integrated over the volume limited sphere for each spectral type . \n this luminosity function is shown in fig . \n [ fig : lumfunc ] . \n nevertheless the generation of the monte carlo model is still a large computational task and in order to save time we decided not to simulate the part of the sky within galactic coordinates : @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n tracing the debris streams in this part of the sky will be difficult in practice due to the large extinction in those directions . in our galactic model @xmath9% of the stars \n lie in this region of the sky as seen from the sun for a survey limited at @xmath10 . \n the resulting simulated survey of the galaxy is fully sampled and contains @xmath11 stars . for each of these we generated \n the 6 phase space coordinates ( positions and velocities ) , an absolute magnitude , a population type ( bulge , disk or halo ) and a spectral type . \n the models of the debris streams were generated by simulating the disruption of dwarf galaxies orbiting our galaxy . the milky way is represented by a rigid potential which is derived from a mass - model consisting of : a double exponential disc , a spherical bulge with hernquist profile , and a logarithmic halo potential with flattening @xmath3 . \n the dwarf galaxies are represented by king models @xcite with a mass of @xmath13  m@xmath14 or @xmath15  m@xmath14 and @xmath16 particles . \n the tidal radius and concentration parameter @xmath17 are 3150  pc and @xmath18 , respectively . \n the satellites are placed on five different orbits which vary in apocentre , pericentre and the initial inclination with respect to the milky way s disc . \n the simulations were evolved with a tree - code for @xmath19  gyr . \n multiple debris streams can be simulated by combining different @xmath2-body snapshots ( different orbits and/or ages ) , and each snapshot can be rotated around the @xmath20-axis or flipped with respect to the disc plane . \n two of the orbits for the @xmath2-body satellites are shown in fig .  [ \n fig : satorbits ] . \n all stars of a given dwarf galaxy are assumed to be of the same age . \n masses are drawn from a mass - function and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are derived from a low - metallicity isochrone ( from * ? ? ? \n * ) of the appropriate age . \n the 6 phase space coordinates @xmath21 for each star in the galaxy and satellite model are referred to the solar position and velocity and converted to the 5 astrometric parameters ; position @xmath22 , parallax @xmath23 , proper motions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the radial velocity @xmath26 . \n the conversion is done using the standard prescriptions for transforming cartesian position and velocity coordinates into astrometric parameters and radial velocities , such as described in in volume  1 , section  1.5.6 , of the hipparcos catalogue @xcite . \n the astrometric errors are added as a function of @xmath27 ( gaia broad band magnitude ) and @xmath6 : @xmath28 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 the parallax errors for the simulated gaia data of the milky way model are shown in fig . \n [ fig : parerr ] . the mean position and proper motion errors are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and the variation of the astrometric errors with ecliptic latitude @xmath33 is included . \n the radial velocity errors for oba - type stars are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37  km  s@xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively . for fgkm - type stars the errors are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 km  s@xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath47 . for stars fainter than @xmath48 ( oba ) or @xmath49 ( fgkm ) radial velocities \n are not available . \n these error prescriptions are according to the gaia concept and technology study report @xcite . \n having made a considerable effort to realistically simulate the number of galaxy stars that is expected to be seen by gaia , we want to ensure that the satellite simulations are properly added to the galaxy data . \n this means that the number of satellite particles in our simulated gaia catalogue should be a realistic fraction of the number of galactic particles . getting this right \n is not trivial and we explain our solution to this problem here .    given a certain distribution of stars along the orbit of a particular dwarf galaxy ( corresponding to an @xmath2-body ` snap - shot ' ) , the number of stars from this satellite that will end up in the gaia catalogue depends on three factors : * 1 . \n * the overall number stars ( i.e. , luminous particles ) in the dwarf galaxy . \n this number is determined by its overall luminosity and the stellar mass function . \n the gaia survey limit leads to an upper limit @xmath50 on the absolute magnitude of visible satellite stars . * \n the variation of @xmath50 along the satellite orbit , caused by a variation in distance from the sun .    at each distance @xmath51 where an @xmath2-body particle is located the fraction of visible satellite stars @xmath52 can be calculated : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , while @xmath55 is the mass function and @xmath56 its upper limit . \n the overall fraction @xmath57 of visible @xmath2-body stars is @xmath58 . as fig . \n [ fig : visfrac ] illustrates the overall fraction of visible stars for a fully populated mass function can be very small depending on the distribution of satellite stars along the orbit . \n in addition we are faced with the problem that real dwarf galaxies contain up to @xmath1 stars but our @xmath2-body models contain 1 million particles only . of these ` expensive ' @xmath2-body particles \n we want to waste as little as possible . \n an obvious step is to assume that all n - body particles represent stars that are brighter than the faintest star that can enter the gaia survey given the distance distribution of the @xmath2-body particles . \n this will raise the overall visible fraction @xmath2-body particles as illustrated by the dashed line in fig . \n [ fig : visfrac ] . \n this hints at the following solution : assume that all @xmath2-body particles represent a bright tracer population , such as agb stars . \n that is , @xmath59 for all particles \n . this will further raise the overall visible fraction @xmath57 . \n the details of this procedure are discussed in @xcite where it is shown that depending on the total luminosity ( mass ) of the simulated satellite one can then easily retain the majority of the @xmath2-body particles while still preserving the variation of the visible fraction of tracer stars along the debris stream . \n various methods have been proposed and used to recover satellite remnants from surveys of galactic phase space . \n figure  [ fig : elz ] shows an example of energy vs angular momentum ( @xmath60-@xmath61 ) diagrams . for this figure we combined 18 million stars from the monte carlo model of the galaxy with the satellite models 1 ( at 10  gyr ) and 4 ( at 5  gyr ) . \n the value of @xmath62 is @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . \n keep in mind that the figures under - represent the real contrast between galaxy and satellite . \n we intend to use this work to study in detail the retrieval of debris streams from the gaia catalogue by making use of the accurate phase space data that gaia will provide throughout the galaxy . \n however , as can be appreciated from the @xmath60-@xmath61 diagrams shown in fig . \n [ fig : elz ] it will not be possible to trace complete debris streams based on phase space data alone . fortunately , using the photometric information from gaia will provide astrophysical parameters for the different stellar populations . \n this will enable a drastic narrowing down of the parts of the gaia catalogue that need to be searched . investigating this will require improvements to the simulations . \n the simulation of actual gaia photometry from the broad and medium band photometers is possible using the tools developed at the university of barcelona ( see the contributions by jordi et  al .  and carrasco et  al .  in this volume ) . \n an extinction model can be included in an approximate way using currently available 3d extinction models such as the one presented by drimmel et  al . \n ( this volume ) . \n finally , if in reality the galactic halo has not had time to relax and wipe out the clumpy remnants of past merger events , it will be necessary to replace the smooth halo component in our milky way model with a clumpy one . \n a.b .  thanks everyone at ia -

{"ContextTokens": 3392, "GeneratedTokens": 85, "SynthesizedBody": "before presenting details of this small contribution to the on - going investigation of complexity - theoretic properties of vector addition systems , their extensions and related logics on words and trees with unbounded data , we provide a brief overview of most - closely related research . \n a diagrammatic summary is in figure  [ f:1 ] , where boldface and a thicker line indicate the new results . \n [ [ vas . ] ] vas . \n + + + +    vector addition systems , or equivalently petri nets , are a fundamental and established model of concurrency . \n they support an active and broad research community , with long - standing links to industry , where vas are an important modelling formalism and associated tools are extensively used .    in spite of several decades of research , \n the computational complexity of the reachability problem for vas remains one of the most well - known open questions in theoretical computer science . \n while decidability was still unknown , lipton made initial progress on the problem by showing it expspace - hard @xcite , which is still the highest known lower bound . \n a few years later , mayr showed the problem decidable @xcite . \n although his proof was subsequently substantially simplified by kosaraju @xcite , lambert @xcite and in a remarkable recent series of articles by leroux @xcite , it is still unknown even whether there exists a primitive recursive algorithm for the problem . \n [ [ branching - vas . ] ] branching vas . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    whereas computations of vas are words of vectors of natural numbers , bvas are a natural generalisation whose computations are trees of such vectors . \n although their reachability problem has been shown inter - reducible with the emptiness problem for multiple - valued linear index grammars @xcite , and with the provability problem for multiplicative exponential linear logic , the decidability status remains an open question . \n however , curiously , a lower bound that is two notches above adding alternation to lipton s result , namely 2expspace - hardness , was recently shown  @xcite .    [ [ priority - vas . ] ] priority vas . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equipping two counters ( in petri - speak , places ) with zero tests , of course , makes vas as powerful as minsky machines and the reachability problem undecidable . \n it has turned out , though , that the mayr - kosaraju - lambert proof can be extended when only one counter may be tested for zero . \n in fact , reinhardt has obtained a highly non - trivial proof of an even more general result : that reachability is decidable for _ pvas _ , where one may test whether all counters from any one of a series of sets @xmath0 are zero @xcite . so far with one zero - testable counter \n , bonnet has succeeded in greatly simplifying reinhardt s proof along the lines of leroux @xcite . \n let us say that pvas whose series of zero - testable sets of counters have length @xmath1 are of _ index _ \n @xmath1 . \n [ [ stack - vas . ] ] stack vas . \n + + + + + + + + + +    another natural extension of vas is to allow them to use a stack over a finite alphabet . \n equivalently to these systems , which we call svas and whose motivations include modelling software with integer variables and call - return procedures , one may consider intersections of vas languages and context - free languages . for an svas in that alternative presentation , \n let us say that it is of _ index _ \n @xmath1 if and only if the context - free language is of index @xmath1 , i.e.  there is a context - free grammar such that every word in the language has a derivation whose every step contains at most @xmath1 non - terminal symbols . \n atig and ganty have recently shown that finite - index svas are essentially equivalent to pvas : every index-@xmath1 svas can be simulated by an index-@xmath1 pvas , and every index-@xmath1 pvas can be simulated by an index-@xmath2 svas @xcite . \n incidentally , that seems to be the only interesting known relationship among bvas , pvas and svas . \n the reachability problem for finite - index svas is consequently decidable since it is decidable for pvas . \n although decidability for unrestricted svas remains an open question , we make some progress here in the opposite direction , obtaining that the problem is not elementary . \n that puts svas in contrast to bvas , for which decidability is also unknown but so far there is only an elementary lower bound @xcite . \n [ [ coverability . ] ] coverability . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the well - known coverability problem for vas and their extensions corresponds to `` control - state reachability '' : it asks whether a given system can reach a configuration that is pointwise ( i.e. , for each counter ) greater than or equal to a given configuration . \n lipton s and rackoff s classical results show that coverability for vas is expspace - complete @xcite , and by building on those works , demri et al . \n have shown 2exptime - completeness of the problem for bvas @xcite . \n unfortunately , for pvas and svas , there is no hope for such results , since for both classes of systems , there are straightforward reductions of reachability to coverability . \n [ [ variable - fo - on - data - words - and - data - trees . ] ] 2-variable fo on data words and data trees . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    partly motivated by verification of concurrent systems and by querying of xml databases , in recent years there has been extensive research in logics on data words and data trees . \n in addition to letters from a finite alphabet as classically , the latter structures have labels from an infinite domain , which are called _ data _ and on which only certain operations are available . \n in fact , typically , the data can only be compared for equality , and that is the only operation we consider here . \n remarkably , there are several connections between , on one hand , vas and their extensions that we have introduced , and on the other hand , two - variable first - order logics on data words and data trees . for positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of a data word , \n the logics have navigational predicates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as equality of data labels @xmath7 . on data trees , where variables range over nodes , navigational predicates are either vertical ( `` child '' and `` descendant '' ) , or horizontal ( `` next sibling '' and `` following sibling '' ) , or compare nodes for positions in the pre - traversal ( `` document order '' ) .    on data words , \n bojaczyk et al . \n @xcite showed that the satisfiability problem for such a logic reduces in doubly - exponential time to the reachability problem for vas , and is therefore decidable . \n moreover , they exhibited a polynomial - time converse reduction , and so lipton s lower bound carries over to the logic . \n on data trees , the picture is more complicated . \n already without document order , bojaczyk et al . \n @xcite observed that the satisfiability problem is at least as hard as the reachability problem for bvas ( whose decidability is open ) , but obtained decidability by disallowing also the transitive navigational predicates ( `` descendant '' and `` following sibling '' ) . \n another way of getting decidability was found by bjrklund and bojaczyk : no restrictions on the navigational predicates are required provided the depth of data trees is bounded . with that assumption , they showed how to reduce satisfiability to the reachability problem for pvas . \n an alternative restriction on data trees suggests itself : that data labels be allowed only on leaf nodes . \n although decidability of the full 2-variable fo on such structures remains open , we show that even without the `` descendant '' and `` following sibling '' predicates , satisfiability is at least as hard as the reachability problem for svas , and so is not elementary . \n ( 60,27)(0,-1 ) ( vas)(30,2.5 )    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( vas , bvas ) ( vas , pvas ) ( pvas , svas ) ( vas , vas2 ) ( vas2,vas ) ( bvas , bvas2 ) ( pvas2,pvas ) ( svas , svas2 ) \n it is convenient for our purposes to formalise svas as programs which operate on non -

deterministic jump to one of two labelled commands ( @xmath12 ) , or termination ( @xmath13 ) . initially , all counters have value @xmath14 and the stack is empty . whenever a decrement of a counter with value @xmath14 or an erroneous pop is attempted , the program aborts . in every program , \n @xmath13 occurs only as the last command . \n the reachability problem can now be stated as follows : given an svas , does it have a computation which reaches the @xmath13 command with all counters being @xmath14 and the stack being empty ? \n the reachability problem for svas is not elementary . \n the proof is by reducing from the @xmath15-bounded halting problem for _ counter programs _ with @xmath16 commands , where :    * for @xmath17 , the _ tetration _ operation @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; * the counter programs are defined like svas , except that they have no stack , have only deterministic jumps ( @xmath21 ) , but can test counters for zero ( @xmath22 ) ; * the @xmath15-bounded halting problem asks whether @xmath13 is reachable by a computation during which all counter values are at most @xmath23 \n .    given such a counter program @xmath24 , we construct in time polynomial in @xmath16 an svas @xmath25 which simulates @xmath24 as long as its counters do not exceed @xmath23 . as in stockmeyer s yardstick construction @xcite , \n the idea is to bootstrap the ability to simulate zero tests of counters that are bounded by @xmath26 , @xmath27 ,  , @xmath23 . \n more precisely , for each counter @xmath3 of @xmath24 , @xmath25 has a pair of counters @xmath3 and @xmath28 , on which it maintains the invariant @xmath29 . \n thus , every increment of @xmath3 in @xmath24 is translated to @xmath30 in @xmath25 , and similarly for decrements . \n for every zero test of @xmath3 in @xmath24 , @xmath25 uses auxiliary counters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for which it also maintains @xmath33 . \n moreover , we assume that @xmath34 at the start of each zero - test simulation . \n the simulation begins by @xmath25 transferring some part of @xmath28 to @xmath31 ( while preserving the invariants ) . \n it then calls a procedure @xmath35 which decrements @xmath31 exactly @xmath23 times . for the latter to be possible , \n @xmath3 must have been @xmath14 . \n otherwise , or in case not all of @xmath28 was transferred to @xmath31 , the procedure can only abort . \n when @xmath35 succeeds , the initial values of @xmath3 and @xmath28 are reversed , so to finish the simulation , everything is repeated with @xmath3 and @xmath28 swapped . \n the main part of the construction is implementing @xmath36 for @xmath37 . assuming that @xmath36 which decrements @xmath38 exactly @xmath39 times and maintains @xmath40 has been implemented for some @xmath41 , @xmath42 consists of performing the following by means of @xmath38 , @xmath43 and @xmath36 :    * push exactly @xmath39 zeros onto the stack ; \n * keep incrementing the @xmath44-digit binary number that is on top of the stack until no longer possible , and decrement @xmath45 for each such increment ; * pop @xmath39 ones that are on top of the stack , and decrement @xmath45 once more .    by a similar pattern , starting with all counters having value @xmath14 \n , @xmath25 can initialise each auxiliary counter @xmath43 to @xmath39 , and each @xmath28 to @xmath23 , as required . \n let _ leaf - data forests _ be data forests in which data labels are present only at leaf nodes . \n more precisely , they are finite forests such that :    * the root nodes are linearly ordered ; * each node is either a leaf , or its children and their descendants form a leaf - data forest ; * each node has a label from a finite alphabet @xmath46 ; * each leaf node also has a label from an infinite domain ( say , @xmath47 ) \n .    now , let fo@xmath48 denote the two - variable first - order logic on leaf - data forests that has the following predicates :    * a unary predicate for each letter from @xmath46 ; * @xmath49 ( @xmath4 is a child of @xmath3 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath4 is the next sibling of @xmath3 ) ; * @xmath51 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are leaves , and @xmath3 precedes @xmath4 in the document order ) ; * @xmath7 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are leaves with the same data label ) . \n the reachability problem for svas is reducible in logarithmic space to the satisfiability problem for fo@xmath48 on leaf - data forests . \n the proof is based on encoding svas computations as leaf - data forests . in the latter , their tree structure is used to represent the evolution of the stack , and data labels are employed for keeping track of counter values .    more concretely , \n suppose @xmath52 is an svas . \n we show how to compute in logarithmic space a sentence @xmath53 of fo@xmath48 whose models are exactly leaf - data forests that encode in the following manner computations of @xmath52 that halt with all counters @xmath14 and the stack empty :    * the computation that such a leaf - data forest encodes can be obtained by traversing the forest so that each internal node is visited once before its children ( generating a push ) and for a second time after its children ( generating the corresponding pop ) ; * each leaf node is labelled either by a jump command , or by an increment or a decrement , and in the latter cases , mutually distinct data labels are used to distinguish among increments of the same counter and to match them to its decrements ; * each internal node is labelled by a pair consisting of a push command and the pop command that corresponds to it in the computation . \n i am grateful to mikoaj bojaczyk and anca muscholl for outlining to me the reduction from svas reachability to fo@xmath48 satisfiability on leaf - data trees .", "StartTimeOffset": 127562707799, "RequestID": "2415c1c7f93803fb8c06a1100389067f3bb7cd9a", "TotalTokens": 3477}

2 ) to investigate the bimodality of the metallicity distribution , which was seen only in the spectroscopic data of the previous catalog , but not clearly in any photometric data ( barmby et al . 2000 ) ; 3 ) to investigate the difference in mean luminosity between the metal - poor gcs and the metal - rich gcs . \n the present catalog of m31 globular clusters shows that the metal - poor gcs are 0.4 mag fainter than the metal - rich gcs ( barmby et al . \n 2000 , barmby 2001 ) , which is the opposite to the case of the gcs in early - type galaxies and our galaxy ( larsen et al . \n our new catalog will be helpful to resolve this discrepancy ;

{"ContextTokens": 3950, "GeneratedTokens": 90, "SynthesizedBody": "it is our experience that isolated thermodynamic systems would eventually relax to a stationary state called equilibrium@xcite . in thermodynamics , \n this statement is regarded as requirements for the relevant choice of the model and its macroscopic descriptions . \n recently , it is shown that equilibrium states are very popular in the extremely large hilbert space of state vectors for macroscopic quantum systems@xcite . \n the expectation values with respect to a randomly sampled pure state are typically well described by equilibrium ensembles@xcite . and \n it is expected that initial nonequilibrium state approaches to typical state of equilibrium . \n then it is reasonable to explore a dynamical explanation for the macroscopically observed behavior of the relaxation to equilibrium@xcite . indeed \n the coarsgrained macroscopic quantities typically yield a decomposition of the total hilbert space with a subspace of overwhelming dimension which represents equilibrium@xcite . \n based on this property , arbitrary state approaches and stays near equilibrium@xcite , which is a modern version of quantum ergodic theorem@xcite . by assuming the thermodynamically normal fluctuation of the quantities , the approach to equilibrium can be derived@xcite . \n also the reduced density matrix of huge isolated system approaches to time averaged state and stays near equilibrium for almost all the time@xcite . \n description of the relaxation is also important in the context of nonequilibrium theorems@xcite , which relies on the use of thermodynamic ensembles . as for the isolated system \n , the relaxation is not guaranteed for the total density matrix itself . \n indeed the total density matrix does not actually relax to a thermal state in the course of unitary time evolution . \n linear phonons in the initial microcanonical state which are externally perturbed and excites only few modes will not approach to a microcanonical state . for classical systems , there exist integrable systems which do not reach an equilibrium state even after a long waiting time due to the conserved quantities . for isolated quantum systems , there are always conservative quantities such as projection operators on a specific energy eigenstates@xcite . and it has been investigated which conservative quantities would affect the thermalization property@xcite . \n the thermalization of a few body quantities has been established for some nonintegrable systems whose energy spectrum do not tend to degenerate@xcite . \n there are also reports that the reduced equilibrium ensemble average works for spin chains both for integrable and nonintegrable parameters@xcite , which is consistent with the typicality of thermal state@xcite but in marked contrast to @xcite at least for the small system sizes . \n it is possible that there are formulations of relaxation properties which are not very sensitive to the nonintegrability . \n since we assume the initial microcanonical state , thermalization for the expectation values of the conservative quantities is trivial for autonomous systems as explained later on . \n also the evaluation of off - diagonal elements for the nonintegrable case shows quantitatively good agreement with the numerical values , which is a sufficient condition to guarantee the relaxation property . \n we insist that from the uniformly random sampling assumption which holds for nonintegrable cases and the initial equilibrium state , the expectation values of quantities which polynomially depend on the system size typically show relaxation to the equilibrium values . \n especially , it is pointed out that the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix does not contribute to the expectation values . in this article \n , we explain how the statement is made quantitative for the time - dependent unitary time evolution . and \n the explanation is numerically verified for a spin chain with a magnetic field in the nonintegrable regime . \n this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present our model with the precise external forcing procedure . in sec.iii , the relaxation of the expectation values are explained . \n sec.iv is devoted to a summary . \n let us consider a macroscopically large but finite initially isolated system . \n after initial time @xmath0 , an external forcing acts on the system , and the total hamiltonian @xmath1 depends on time . until @xmath0 , the density matrix describing the initial state is assumed to be microcanonical specified by an energy @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of the states . in the course of time evolution , \n the external work is done on the system through the time dependence of @xmath1 . \n the deterministic external forcing acts during the time interval @xmath5 , and switched off for @xmath6 . \n it is expected that after a sufficiently long waiting time , i.e. at @xmath7 , the density matrix reaches a state which yields approximately the same expectation values as the microcanonical ensemble @xmath8 with an energy shift @xmath9 . \n it is our statement that under the uniformly random sampling assumption valid for the nonintegrable cases , the microcanonical ensemble well approximates actual expectation value of quantity @xmath10 whose maximum eigenvalue polynomially depends on the system size @xmath11 this evaluation shows that the relaxation to equilibrium is explained as the property of the expectation values instead of the density matrix . \n note that the initial microcanonical state guarantees that eq.([unitary ] ) holds for the conservative quantities with @xmath12 for autonomous systems irrespective of the integrability . \n an important class of observables is extensive quantities which are sums of local quantities such as total magnetization in a spin chain . \n such quantities mutually almost commute , since the local quantities at spatially different points commute . \n the actual final state is reached by a unitary time evolution @xmath13 where we presented the eigenstate of @xmath14 as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . \n after @xmath18 , the total system is isolated , and evolves by the hamiltonian @xmath14 . on the other hand , for the nonintegrable systems the off - diagonal elements of the physical quantity @xmath10 is negligible compared to the diagonal elements :    * the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath19 of the nonintegrable system is typically negligible in the macroscopic limit . \n physically , this would be reasonable since it means that transition amplitudes between macroscopically different states due to the perturbation @xmath10 are extremely small@xcite . \n we shall give a quantitative explanation of this statement . \n the analysis is based on the high - dimensionality of the hilbert space as in refs.@xcite . \n let us diagonalize the quantity @xmath10 as @xmath20 and define its square root @xmath21 here the spectrum @xmath22 is assumed to be nonnegative . without loss of generality , the operators bounded below such as energy and number of particles can be made into this form . \n we also define state vectors @xmath23 so that the matrix element is expressed as the inner product @xmath24 the states @xmath25 are chosen from the extremely large hilbert space @xmath26 with various directions . \n thus we assume that the sequence of the normalized vectors @xmath27 is regarded as a _ uniformly random sampling _ from @xmath28 dimensional unit sphere as we will confirm for the case of nonintegrable spin chain . \n it is then straightforward to show that the mean square of the inner product is smaller than @xmath29@xcite , which we will show later . here \n @xmath30 is the maximum of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 . \n + let us derive the inequality for the inner product @xmath31 where the bracket shows the average with respect to the uniform random sampling of @xmath32 from the unit sphere . \n uniform random sampling is expressed by the vector representation of @xmath32 in an orthogonal complete basis as @xmath33 with @xmath34 . \n hereafter we use the abbreviated notation for the dimension @xmath35 . \n the angles @xmath36 are uniform random variables on the real axes . \n we are interested in particular cases where @xmath30 polynomially depends on the system size . on the other hand \n , the dimension @xmath37 grows exponentially as the system size increases \n . then inequality ( [ inner ] ) shows that the off - diagonal elements eq.([offdiagonal ] ) is extremely small for the macroscopic system . \n we numerically show that eq.([inner ] ) actually holds and hence random sampling assumption is reasonable for a quantum spin chain . \n the spin chain is regarded as a nice example , since it provides observables , which is a sum of the local quantities . \n the hamiltonian of the spin chain is chosen as @xmath38 where @xmath39 stands for the exchange interaction between neighboring sites , and a constant magnetic field @xmath40 is applied . \n @xmath41 is the @xmath42 component of the pauli matrix at the site @xmath43 . \n @xmath44 controles the nonintegrability . as a macroscopic quantity \n , we consider the square of the @xmath45 component of the total magnetization @xmath46 other choices of @xmath10 are possible , but eq.([quantity ] ) guarantees a well - defined square root @xmath47 . \n for example , if we choose @xmath10 as @xmath45 component of the total magnetization or @xmath48 @xmath49 , we still observe behavior resembles to fig.1 . \n + the system sizes @xmath50 are explored . \n note that the dimension of the total hilbert space is @xmath51 and can be large for relatively small @xmath52 . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix @xmath53 under the periodic boundary condition , \n numerical eigenvectors @xmath54 are obtained , and the absolute values of all the matrix elements @xmath55 are shown in fig.1 . the data are shown only for parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , however , we have confirmed similar behavior for various values of @xmath59 . to verify that eqs.([inner],[product ] ) are satisfied quantitatively , we also show the matrix elements @xmath60 with a fixed value of @xmath61 for @xmath62 . \n the statistical mean value of the off - diagonal elements agrees with the theoretical estimation @xmath63 as shown in fig.2 . \n + this estimation is considered as a generic property of macroscopically different states for the nonintegrable systems , since it is expressed only by the typical value of @xmath10 and the dimension @xmath35 . \n thus for large @xmath64 , the directions of @xmath65 are orthogonal to each other , and are considered to be distributed on the @xmath66 dimensional unit sphere without any bias to a specific direction . \n @xmath67 is immediately derived , since the expectation values of each component are the same and their sum should be unity . since @xmath54 and @xmath68 are normalized , @xmath69 the inequality ( [ inner ] ) derives from eqs.([product],[normalization ] ) . for comparison , the matrix elements @xmath60 at @xmath62 for the integrable case @xmath70 \n are shown in fig.3 . \n as in fig.2 , @xmath71 is explored . for @xmath49 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 behaves as in the nonintegrable cases . \n but for @xmath74 , the smallness of the off - diagonal elements is affected . aside from the dominant contribution from the diagonal element , \n there are subdominant contributions as shown in fig.3 . \n the same tendency takes place also for @xmath49 . \n this shows that the uniformly random sampling assumption is affected at least for the relatively small system size . \n + from eq.([inner ] ) , the coefficient @xmath75 of eq.([evolution ] ) is safely replaced by @xmath76 in the evaluation of @xmath77.the off - diagonal elements of @xmath78 does not contribute to the expectation value of the quantity @xmath10 , since @xmath55 @xmath79 is neglected .. more quantitatively , the error caused by neglect of the off - diagonal elements is indeed negligible by random phase approximation , since there are @xmath80 terms of @xmath81 with various phases . * \n the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath78 is well - approximated by those of a microcanonical state with respect to @xmath14 . \n it is important to note that the initial microcanonical state specifies an energy scale @xmath2 . \n indeed the diagonal elements are expressed as @xmath82 where we introduced the normalized eigenstates of @xmath83 as @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 with an eigenstate of @xmath86 , @xmath87 . \n the set of states @xmath88 and @xmath89 are related by a unitary transformation @xmath90 . in the presence of perturbation , @xmath91 would be non negligible only when the conservation of the energy is well - satisfied after the long waiting time , i.e. @xmath92 with the energy change @xmath9 from the initial to final times caused by external perturbation during @xmath93 . \n + we show a quantitative estimation of @xmath9 . \n the matrix element @xmath94 is evaluated as @xmath95 up to the first order of the perturbation @xmath96 , where the factor @xmath97 would be of order @xmath98 as in eq.([inner ] ) . \n then it is immediately shown that @xmath99 contributes to @xmath94 only when @xmath99 and @xmath100 are sufficiently near @xmath101 , otherwise the ratio @xmath102 is negligible . \n such @xmath103 is expanded as @xmath104 , where the coefficient @xmath105 is non negligible for @xmath100 sufficiently near @xmath99 . \n the energy change @xmath9 is determined as @xmath106 which is almost independent of the suffix @xmath107 . \n here we evaluated as @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the dirac delta in eq.([element ] ) . \n the important property used here is a continuity of the mapping , i.e. when @xmath110 is small enough compared to @xmath111 , @xmath112 is also sufficiently small . \n + therefore the third line of eq.([element ] ) has a sharp peak at @xmath113 as a function of @xmath114 and is proportional to the function @xmath115 as @xmath116 where the density of the states at @xmath117 is determined uniquely from the normalization , and @xmath15 is used . \n the diagonal elements is thus given by the microcanonical ensemble . \n then as far as the expectation value is concerned , the state @xmath78 should be well - described by the microcanonical ensemble @xmath118 . \n in conclusion , by assuming that the initial state is prepared as a microcanonical ensemble and the uniformly random sampling assumption holds as in the nonintegrable systems , the actual state at time @xmath117 can be replaced by another microcanonical ensemble in the evaluation of quantities which polynomially depend on the system size . \n the derivation is based on the high dimensionality of the hilbert space and consequent uniformly random sampling assumption valid for the nonintegrable systems , and restrictions for the system size dependence of observables as well as the perturbative treatment of unitary transformation of the energy eigenstates . \n the validity of the uniformly random sampling assumption for @xmath32 is numerically verified for a nonintegrable spin chain . \n it is also remarked that the initial state can be out of equilibrium , i.e. the initial density matrix is @xmath119 with a unitary transformation @xmath120 , since this can be regarded as the state evolved from an actual initial state @xmath121 . \n the author is grateful to professor a.sugita for fruitful discussions . this work is financially supported by jsps program grant in aid 22@xmath1227744 .    30 r.zwanzig , _ nonequilibrium statistical mechanics _ \n , oxford new york ( 2001 ) j.m.deutsch , phys.rev.a * 43 * 2046 ( 1991 ) s.goldstein , j.l.lebowitz , r.tumulka , and n.zanghi , phys.rev.lett.*96 * 050403 ( 2006 ) s.goldstein , j.l.lebowitz , c.mastrodonato , r.tumulka , and n.zanghi , phys.rev.e * 81 * 011109 ( 2010 ) s.goldstein , j.l.lebowitz , c.mastrodonato , r.tumulka , and n.zanghi , proceedings of the royal society a 466(2123 ) 3203 -

{"ContextTokens": 3617, "GeneratedTokens": 267, "SynthesizedBody": "it is presently accepted that most stars form in clusters , although the details of the cluster - formation process , especially the origin of their structural properties , remain a matter of active research ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? \n * lada & lada 2003 ) ) . \n in particular , a number of structural properties of the clusters have been uncovered that still require an adequate theoretical understanding , such as : i ) the existence of a mass segregation in the clusters , with the most massive stars lying closer to the cluster s center ( ) ; ii ) the distribution of protostellar separations , which appears to have no characteristic scale ( ) ; iii ) the likely existence of an age gradient in clusters , with the youngest stars being located in the highest - density regions ( ) . \n numerical simulations have begun to offer some insight about these properties . have concluded , from a suite of simulations of self - gravitating , decaying isothermal turbulence , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster centers , rather than `` sinking '' there through dynamical interactions in the cluster itself . \n however , they gave no physical explanation as to why the most massive stars should form there . \n more recently , ( * ? ? ? \n * kuhn et al.(2015b ) ) have suggested , by comparing multi - wavelength observations of stellar clusters with numerical simulations , that clusters form by mergers of `` subcluster '' structures , although again no explanation of why such mergers should occur is provided . \n the presence of subunits of somewhat different ages in the clusters has also been pointed out by . \n a physical mechanism capable of providing a unifying scenario to these properties is the one advanced by . \n these authors proposed that , if molecular clouds ( mcs ) are assembled by large - scale colliding streams of warm , atomic gas , they rapidly condense into the cold atomic phase , becoming jeans - unstable and beginning to collapse globally . \n moreover , the collision of the streams causes moderately supersonic turbulence ( ) in the cold gas , which produces a spectrum of density fluctuations , where large - amplitude , small - scale ( lass ) fluctuations are superposed on smaller - amplitude , larger - scale ( sals ) ones ( e.g. , ) . \n since these density fluctuations are nonlinear , the lass fluctuations have shorter free - fall times than the sals ones , therefore completing their collapse earlier . \n this process is therefore similar to fragmentation , except that the density fluctuations are of turbulent origin and are therefore nonlinear . in what follows \n , we will refer to this scenario as `` hierarchical gravitational collapse '' ( hgc ) . \n this scenario also predicts that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in molecular clouds ( mcs ) evolves over time , as a consequence of the evolution of the clouds themselves as they go through global gravitational collapse (; ; ) .    in this contribution \n , we describe results of a model on the evolution of the sfr and of cluster assembly in a numerical simulation of mc formation and evolution , emphasizing the role of hgc in the resulting structure of the cluster . \n several models for the sfr and the core mass function ( cmf ) have been put forward in the last decade ( e.g. , ; ; ) , all based on the notion that mcs are globally supported by supersonic turbulence , and with the sfr given by the collapse of local density fluctuations induced by the turbulence . \n operationally , the computation of the sfr in these models is performed by using the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density field  which is known to have a lognormal form for a non - self - gravitating , isothermal turbulent gas ( ) to compute the mass fraction at densities above a suitably defined density threshold , and dividing it by a timescale characteristic of its density range . \n details of the similarities and differences between these models have been given by . \n models of this kind are intrinsically _ stationary _ , as they assume that the mcs are in approximate virial equilibrium between turbulence and gravity . in these models , \n the main controlling parameters are those characterizing the turbulence  the mach number @xmath0 , the _ virial parameter _ \n @xmath1 ( ) , and perhaps the ratio of compressible to solenoidal energy ( ) . \n however , the basic premise of equilibrium in the stationary models is inconsistent with the scenario of hgc , since in the latter , the cloud is assumed to be in global gravitational collapse . \n a model combining the calculation of small - scale collapse as in the above models with the large - scale collapse of the whole cloud has been presented by and . in what follows \n we will refer to this as `` _ the evolutionary model _ '' . in it , \n in addition to the calculation of the instantaneous sfr as in the models mentioned above , the evolution and collapse of the cloud ( with the associated systematic increase of its mean density ) are also followed in time . \n the cloud is assumed to be formed by the collision of warm atomic streams , and to grow in mass by the continued accretion of this material , which undergoes a phase transition to the cold phase as it enters the cloud . \n the cloud also develops turbulence through a combination of the nonlinear thin - shell instability ( ) and the kelvin - helmholz , rayleigh - taylor , and thermal instabilities ( see , e.g. , ) . because the cloud is collapsing , the instantaneous mass fraction at high densities increases in time , and therefore so does the instantaneous sfr . \n knowing the sfr at all times , the total mass in stars can be computed and , assuming a standard imf , the instantaneous number of massive stars is also computed . \n these feed back on the cloud through ionizing uv radiation , and the rate of ionization can be computed using standard prescriptions ( ) , eventually destroying the cloud . \n contrary to the stationary equilibrium models , in the evolutionary model the turbulence parameters are not free , but rather they are assumed to have the ( fixed ) values typical of the cold atomic medium . \n thus , the turbulence is assumed to be _ moderately _ supersonic , with mach number @xmath2 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? \n * heiles & troland 2003 ) ) . \n the only remaining free parameter is the total mass involved in the cloud - formation and evolution process ( @xmath3 ) . \n figure [ fig : sfr ] shows , in the _ left panel _ , the evolution of the sfr for clouds of various masses according to the model . in the _ right panel _ , this figure shows the histogram of stellar ages in a cluster that evolves according to the evolution of the sfr predicted by the model in a 2000-@xmath4 cloud , 1 and 2 myr before the cloud is destroyed by the ionizing stellar feedback . \n the figure also shows the normalized stellar age histogram in the @xmath5-ophiucus cloud ( ) , showing that the model at 2 myr before destruction matches quite closely the observed histogram . \n the match is expected to occur some time before destruction because the clusters studied by are still embedded in their parent clouds , suggesting that the destruction of the clouds is not completed yet .    , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( black , blue , green and red lines respectively ) . \n the vertical dashed lines represent the time at which the clouds start to form stars . \n the vertical black dotted line represents the time at which accretion onto the clouds from the warm medium stops ( from zv14 ) . \n _ right : _ \n normalized stellar age histograms for a model cloud at 1 ( solid black line ) and 2 ( dashed blue line ) myr before the cloud is destroyed by the ionizing stellar feedback . \n also shown is the corresponding histogram for the embedded cluster in the @xmath5-oph cloud ( dash -

law mass distribution , with a slope consistent with the salpeter value . \n that is , in this simulation , the sink particles correspond to individual stars , with a realistic mass distribution . \n this allows following the cluster dynamics realistically as well . \n the box size is 256 pc , and the initial density and temperature in the box were @xmath10 and @xmath11 k , respectively . \n two colliding streams of gas , of radius 64 pc and length 112 pc and with opposite velocities of magnitude @xmath12 each , were set to collide at the @xmath13 plane in the simulation . \n a turbulent velocity field with a spectrum peaking at wavenumber @xmath14 ( so that the fluctuation size scale is smaller than the radius of the colliding streams ) was applied to trigger instabilities in the compressed layer . for more details , \n we refer the reader to c+13 .    in this simulation , \n three main clusters form , two of which are sufficiently massive to disperse / evaporate the dense gas around them on a timescale of @xmath15 myr . \n stars begin to form at @xmath16 myr , and the first hii  regions appear at @xmath17 myr . at @xmath18 myr \n , the dense gas has been cleared from a radius of @xmath19 pc around the clusters . \n figure [ fig : sim_imgs ] shows , in the _ left panel _ , one snapshot of the simulation , at @xmath20 myr into the evolution , in which the growing hii  regions around the two most massive clusters can be seen as faint shells around the clusters , while the filamentary structure of the cloud is still noticeable in general . \n the clusters themselves have formed along the main filamentary structures in the cloud , and contain @xmath21@xmath22 . \n myr , showing the three clusters that form within filamentary structures . \n the box size is 256 pc and the ruler shows a scale of 159 pc . \n the color bar indicates the local density in @xmath23 . _ \n right panel : _ a zoom -

scale gravitational collapse , funneling gas into the cores within them , as observed by in a numerical simulation of cloud formation and collapse . \n moreover , these authors observed a hierarchy of collapses within the filaments , so that _ small clumps , which are sometimes forming stars already , are falling onto larger - scale ones_. this means that the late - stage clusters are assembled from smaller sub - units that formed in the filaments in the periphery of the trough of the large - scale gravitational potential well . \n this is illustrated in the _ right panel _ of fig . \n [ fig : sim_imgs ] , which shows a zoom - in around the second most massive cluster ( hereafter , `` cluster 2 '' ) of those seen in the left panel , at @xmath24 myr . \n it can be seen that this cluster is actually composed of three groups at this time , which later ( at @xmath25 myr ) merge to form a single larger cluster . operationally defining a group \n is a nontrivial task , because the gas clumps continue to form stars over extended periods of time due to the accretion from the filaments onto them . \n we thus define membership to a group by a sequence of steps . at early times , \n when the groups are clearly distinct by eye , we apply a `` friends - of - friends '' algorithm to the stars to define the groups . \n subsequently , as new stars are formed , we assign them to the groups whose center of mass is closest to the new star . also , we define the radius of the group at each time as the distance from its center of mass to the second most distant star . \n finally , we say that two groups have merged when the distance between their centers of mass is smaller than the larger of the two radii . \n the evolution and assembly of the central group in the _ right panel _ of fig . \n [ fig : sim_imgs ] is illustrated in fig.[fig : cluster_evol ] , which shows the projected positions of the sink particles on the @xmath26 plane at times @xmath27 , 21.44 , and 21.70 myr into the evolution of the simulation in the _ left , middle , _ and _ right _ panels , respectively . \n it is seen that , at the earlier time , the system consists of two subgroups , which approach each other and finally merge . \n in general , we observe this mechanism operating at all scales in our simulation , with groups in turn consisting of subgroups , and so on , implying that the clusters must exhibit a self -

scale , hierarchical gravitational collapse ( hgc ) of the clouds may be responsible for at least three observed properties of open clusters : 1 ) that there appears to be an increase of the sfr , so that the age distributions of clusters generally have a tail of older stars ( 3 - 7 myr ) , while most stars are young ( 1 - 2 myr ; ) ; 2 ) that they appear to have a self - similar structure , observationally manifested in an absence of a characteristic scale in the distribution of protostellar separations ( ) . in our simulation , this is manifested in the hierarchical membership of the stellar units that conform a cluster ; 3 ) that the clusters appear to consist of subunits of slightly different ages that merge to form larger structures ( ( * ? ? ? \n * kuhn et al . \n 2015b ) ; ) . \n these are natural consequences of hgc in globally collapsing clouds . \n the global collapse produces an increase of the sfr . \n the hierarchical nature causes , at large scales , filamentary structures that feed the star - forming clumps for extended periods of time and , at small scales , it produces local star - forming sites that fall into the troughs of the large - scale contracting structures .", "StartTimeOffset": 150383617326, "RequestID": "510bce90dc00cb20b6a0f6103fec5bc4b34d0fad", "TotalTokens": 3884}

giant branch ( sgb ) is actually present , and that the red giant branch ( rgb ) starts rising at @xmath27 , @xmath28 . \n the rgb however is poorly populated . \n a group of stars at @xmath29 , @xmath30 may indicate the presence of a clump . \n + better information can be derived from fig .  4 , where we show the cmds of whiting  1 as a function of the distance from the cluster nominal center . \n here we consider only stars having errors in v - band lower than 0.15 mag ( see sect .  2 ) . \n in the left panel all the stars are plotted , whereas in the middle panel we only plot the stars which lie within the cluster radius ( see sect  3 ) . \n finally , in the right panel we plot the stars outside the cluster region , to show how the galactic field toward the cluster looks like . \n + interestingly , the ms in the middle panel gets much thinner , and we can locate the to at @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the rgb is scarcely populated and the presumed clump disappears . \n most of the stars in the left panel located in the rgb region and in the red edge of the ms come from the field shown in the right panel . in conclusion , \n the overall shape of the cmd in the middle panel is reminiscent of an old cluster . \n in this section we provide estimates of whiting  1 basic parameters . + we start deriving a first guess of the cluster reddening by using firb maps by @xcite . \n we obtain e(b - v ) = 0.026 , a very low value as expected for a cluster located at high galactic latitude . \n + at this point , since we do not have any other information , we have to rely on a detailed comparison between the cmd morphology and theoretical isochrones . in the following analysis we are going to adopt the padova isochrones ( @xcite ) . \n + in fig .  5 and 6 we play with age and metallicity , trying to encounter the best overall fit of the cmd . + in details , in fig .  5 we keep the metallicity fixed to z=0.001 and change the age from 3.8 to 5.6 gyrs \n . in both the cmd the best fit \n is provided by the age of 4.8 gyrs ( dashed - dotted line ) which implies a reddening e(b - v)= 0.04 and e(v - i)=0.05 . \n the older isochrone ( 5.6 gyr ) implies an untenable e(b - v ) = 0.00 , or slightly negative , while the youngest one ( 3.8 gyr ) implies a reddening e(b - v ) = 0.12 , which is still acceptable , but the overall fit of the red part of the cmd looks very poor . + on the other hand , in fig . \n 6 we keep the age of 4.8 gyr fixed and play with metallicity . in this case \n the best fit is provided by z=0.001 . \n the fit with a lower metal abundance is not so bad as well , while the larger metallicity isochrone poorly fits the cmd and implies a negative reddening . \n + from this exercise we infer that the cluster metal abundance is around z=0.001 and the age around 5 gyrs . \n the best fit is therefore outlined in fig .  7 , and from this we derive a distance modulus @xmath33=18.4 and a reddening e(b - v)=0.04 . \n as a consequence , we obtain a heliocentric distance of about 45 kpc . \n the results we achieved are listed in detail in table  3 . \n we have presented the first ccd @xmath0 photometric study of the star cluster whiting  1 . \n the cmds we derive allow us to infer estimates of the cluster basic parameters , which are summarized in table  3 . \n + in detail , we find that :          the combination of age , position and metallicity makes whiting  1 a very puzzling object . \n + we can rule put the hypothesis of an old open cluster , because of the low metal content , and mostly beacuse of its positions . \n + the cluster bears some similarities with palomar  1 ( @xcite ) , an 8 gyr old globular cluster , and other transitional clusters like terzan  7 , ruprech  106 and others mentioned in @xcite . + following the kind of discussion by @xcite \n , we here tentatively propose that whiting  1 is the milky way youngest globular cluster insofar known , although a clear explanation for its formation and evolution remains very challenging . \n dias w.s . , \n alessi b.s . \n , moitinho a. , lepine j.r.d . , 2002 ,   389 , 871 girardi l. , bressan a. , bertelli g. , chiosi c. , 2000 ,   141 , 371 landolt a.u . , 1992 ,   104 \n , 340 patat f. , carraro g. , 2001 ,   325 , 1591 rosenberg a. , saviane i. , piotto g. , aparicio a. , zaggia s. , 1998 ,   115 , 648 schlegel , d. , finkbeiner , d. , & davis , m. ,  , 1998 , 500 , 525 . \n stetson p.b . \n 1987 ,   99 , 191 whiting a.b . , hau g.k.t . \n , irwin m. , 2002 ,   141 , 123", "StartTimeOffset": 176727690618, "RequestID": "95be14b327f41f74d020af61675a14e6c8db4d0b", "TotalTokens": 2755}

board fpgas \n allow local data analysis , based on a trigger level system developed to select candidate events . \n the trigger system is based on the same principles as the one used for the fluorescence detector of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite . \n a first level trigger ( flt ) at the channel level , has been designed to identify peaks in the fadc trace . \n the flt information of all channels is then sent to the trigger master board to perform a second level trigger ( slt ) at the level of the whole camera . \n if the slt condition is satisfied , the system trigger pulse is send to the 4 adc boards for the readout . \n these first and second level trigger conditions are implemented as follows :    flt : a channel is marked as triggered if the running sum of 20 consecutive bins exceeds an adjustable threshold . \n this status is extended for 10 @xmath1s to allow coincidences between channels in subsequent trigger requirements . \n the threshold is continuously regulated to compensate the changing background conditions and to ensure a constant trigger rate per channel of 100 hz . \n the procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig : flt ] . \n slt : the flt information is sent to the master trigger board where another on - board fpga is used to evaluate trigger conditions at the level of the whole camera . the slt block is designed to search for 4-fold patterns of flt channels compatible with an uhecr shower track . \n a slt rate of much less than 1 hz is expected from random coincidences . \n high level trigger conditions have been also developed to deal with the different background conditions . \n for example , the threshold regulation and data acquisition are inhibited when slt rate is higher than a certain limit . \n the daq system is continuosly monitoring the data conditions by recording each second an average baseline ( over 10 ms ) for each channel , the instantaneous threshold and flt rate . figure [ fig : sun ] shows the temporal evolution of the baseline for the central channel of the camera with the adjustable threshold for the same period . \n as it can be observed , the threshold reproduces accurately the baseline profile . \n the large peak shown in the plot is originated by the sun passing through the field of view of the feed . \n the fast peaks in the figure are noise bursts , possible induced by aircrafts , which reduce significantly the duty cycle of the experiment . \n an absolute calibration of the antenna is provided by the sun , whose emission in the frequency of interest is measured every day by several radiotelescopes around the world . \n figure [ fig : sun ] shows the signal in adc counts generated by the sun crossing the field of view of the central channel of the camera . \n the system temperature can then be derived from the difference in adc counts between the peak induced by the sun and the baseline . a patch antenna located at the center of the 4.5 m dish \n is used to generate rf signals of known intensity , thus performing a relative calibration of the individual feed channels . \n also , it allows the study of the relative timing , which was found to be well below the 50 ns sampling .      up to now \n , the telescope has been taking data in stable conditions during 40 days with an average event rate of 0.5 hz . \n a prelimary analysis suggests that data are dominated by noise , both the expected uncorrelated random noise and correlated noise due to fast transient events of unknown origin . \n all channels present a good long term stability with baseline fluctuations smaller than 1 db . physics event search is still in progress . \n events simulations have been also carried out including the measured values of the detector calibration , the noise level and the microwave emission scaled from the laboratory measurements . \n the midas experiment has been assembled and commissioned between october 2009 and february 2010 at the university of chicago . \n the first period of data taking has been focused on the understanding of the detector and of the noise conditions . \n the sensitivity of the prototype was found to be adequate for detection of uhecr . \n some improvements are being implemented to increase the duty cycle to close to 100% . in order to crosscheck candidate events with already established detection techniques , \n we foresee the operation of midas at the southern auger observatory . \n r.  u.  abbasi _ et al . _ [ hires collaboration ] , astrophys . \n j.  * 622 * ( 2005 ) 910 . n.  chiba _ et al . \n meth . a*311 * ( 1992 ) 338 . \n j.  abraham _ et al . _ \n [ pierre auger collaboration ] , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 523 * ( 2004 ) 50 . \n r.  abbasi _ et al . _ \n [ hires collaboration ] , phys . \n * 100 * ( 2008 ) 101101 . \n j.  abraham _ et al . _ \n [ pierre auger collaboration ] , phys . \n * 101 * ( 2008 ) 061101 . \n p.  w.  gorham _ et al . \n rev . d*78 * ( 2008 ) 032007 . \n pierre auger collaboration , `` pierre auger project technical design report '' .", "StartTimeOffset": 198241741378, "RequestID": "0db5a01c116c14d4b4423e5cf9a146f1367a9285", "TotalTokens": 1966}

( 2007 ) ) . \n we utilized the irac 8 microns as it has been demonstrated to be the most stable irac band . due to the brightness of the host star we made the observations in sub - array mode . \n we carried out aperture photometry with a 3.5 pixel radius . due to the small limb - darkening , stable instrument ( thanks to the earth - trailing orbit of spitzer which leads to stable thermal properties and no occultation of targets by the earth , as occurs with hst ) we obtained 0.5% precision per 0.4 second exposure . in the shot - noise limit \n we expect a 3-second precision for transit times . \n figure [ fig01 ] shows a gallery of the transits and secondary eclipses obtained . the strong  ramp \" which causes the flux to change by about 1% is a well known feature of the irac camera when observing bright sources . \n we fit the ramp with the function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the start of the observation and @xmath7 are constants . \n this appears to remove any trace of the ramp in the corrected data . \n we assign each data point an error bar which equals the scatter in residuals of the data outside of transit / eclipse . \n in two initial fits we include one ephemeris for the transits , one ephemeris for the secondary eclipses , and required all other parameters describing the transits and eclipses to be the same for all 10 transits / eclipses to determine their mean values . \n we performed one of these fits with stellar limb - darkening set to zero , while for a second fit we allowed the linear coefficient of the stellar limb - darkening to freely vary ( in all cases we assume the planet to be uniform in surface brightness ) . \n we allowed the ramp parameters to vary independently for each transit / eclipse . \n a sum of the five transits corrected for the ramp is shown in figure [ fig02a](a ) without limb darkening , and figure [ fig02b](b ) with limb darkening . \n the five secondary eclipses are shown in figure [ fig02c ] .    without limb darkening we find a best - fit @xmath8 for 231508 degrees of freedom ( 231516 data points with 8 model parameters ) . with linear limb darkening the @xmath9 \n improves by @xmath10 for 231507 degrees of freedom , with a best - fit limb darkening parameter of @xmath11 ; thus limb - darkening is detected at 12@xmath12 - this can be seen by eye by comparing figures [ fig02a](a ) and [ fig02b](b ) . \n this best - fit value for limb - darkening gives a limb - darkening profile which is very close to that predicted by a kurucz model with parameters appropriate for hd  189733a ( effective temperature @xmath13 k and surface gravity @xmath14 = 4.5 $ ] ) . \n we find a best - fit planet - star radius ratio of @xmath15 , which translates into a best - fit area ratio of @xmath16% , while the best - fit eclipse depth is @xmath17% - note that this is a 72@xmath12 detection of a secondary eclipse ! the errors on these parameters ( and throughout the rest of the paper ) are computed by generating one hundred synthetic data sets from the best fit light curve ( for each model ) added to the residuals shifted by a random number of data points , re - fitting the model to each synthetic data set , and then taking the standard deviation of the 100 synthetic parameter sets to determine each parameter s error . \n we have measured the best - fit ephemeris to our data , separately for the transits and eclipses . \n we find a transit ephemeris of @xmath18 hjd and @xmath19 days , while for the eclipses we find @xmath20 hjd and @xmath21 days , assuming that they occur exactly one half period after primary transit . \n the periods are consistent within @xmath22 , while the central eclipse times differ by @xmath23 seconds , indicating that the secondary eclipses occur later . \n about 31 seconds of this difference can be accounted for by the light travel time across the system , while the other 26 seconds is likely due to a slight orbital eccentricity . \n we have performed a second set of fits allowing the central times of transit / secondary eclipse to vary . \n the transit timing variations are plotted in figure [ fig03 ] for the transits and secondary eclipses , compared to the best - fit transit ephemeris ( and assuming the secondary eclipse is offset by 1/2 an orbit ) . \n we find no significant deviations from a uniform period by more than 5 seconds for either the transits or secondary eclipses ; once the final four data sets are obtained we will carry out a more detailed analysis . \n poster 79 by miller - ricci and poster 87 by neale gibson at this iau symposium also present new transit - timing data for this system . \n in a third set of fits we held the ephemerides fixed , but allowed the depths of secondary eclipse to vary . \n figure [ fig04 ] shows the variations in the five observed eclipse depths in units of the flux of the star . \n we find that the fractional variations in the eclipse depth are smaller than about 10% ; this is about the level of variation predicted by ( * ? ? ? \n * rauscher et al .  ( 2007 ) ) . \n a fit to the eclipse depths assuming a constant depth gives a @xmath24 for 4 degrees of freedom ( 5 eclipses minus one free - parameter , the mean eclipse depth ) . \n once the final two secondary eclipse observations are obtained ( in june and july 2008 ) , a more comprehensive analysis will be carried out of the limits on secondary eclipse depth variation . \n the depth of primary transit we have obtained contains five times as much data as that in ( * ? ? ? \n * knutson et al .  ( 2007 ) ) , providing more precise constraints on the spectral energy distribution in the mid - infrared . \n we have combined this data point with transit depths measured by ( * ? ? ? \n * pont et al .  ( 2008 ) ) in the optical with hst , ( * ? ? ? \n * swain et al .  ( 2008 ) ) in the near - infrared with hst , ( * ? ? ? \n * beaulieu et al .  ( 2008 ) ) at 3.6 and 5.8 microns with irac , and ( * ? ? ? \n * knutson et al .  ( 2008 ) ) at 24 microns with mips ( also knutson et al . , these proceedings ) . \n the data are plotted in figure [ fig05 ] along with the best - fitting model of ( * ? ? ? \n * tinetti et al .  ( 2007 ) ) which does not have enough methane to fit the near - infrared data . \n we find that our 8 micron data point lies above the tinetti model ; as the 8 micron band covers a region in which methane absorption is quite strong ( @xmath25 @xmath26 per molecule ) , the model may be brought back into agreement with the data with a higher abundance of methane , as is already required by the near - infrared data ( ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * swain et al .  2008 ) ) . \n it also clear that the model is a poor fit to the optical data ; the fit may be improved by including rayleigh scattering ( lecavelier des etanges et al . \n 2008 , and these proceedings ) . \n error bars.,width=491 ] \n the five transits we have observed are consistent with no transit timing variations greater than 5 seconds . \n the five secondary eclipses are consistent with no eclipse depth variations at greater than the 10% level . from just an analysis of the lightcurves \n we can place constraints on the eccentricity and longitude of periastron : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; similar to the results of ( * ? ? ? \n * winn et al .

''    over the past decade and a half , the sdss has used a dedicated telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico to obtain digital images over 1/4 of the sky and to map the 3-dimensional distribution of more than 2 million galaxies , 1 million stars , and 200,000 quasars . \n the stars are all members of the milky way at distances of hundreds or thousands of light years ; their separation in time from us is less than a cosmic eyeblink . \n the galaxies , each a collection of tens or hundreds of billions of stars , span a wide range of distances , from thousands of light years to billions of light years . \n quasars are the most luminous objects in the universe , powered by hot gas falling onto supermassive black holes , so they can be seen to very large distances . \n the most distant quasars discovered by the sdss have lookback times of more than 13 billion years , and the light we detect left them less than a billion years after the big bang .    to map millions of galaxies , the sdss observes them using `` fiber plugplates , '' each an aluminum disk @xmath0 in diameter drilled with 640 holes at the locations of objects selected for observation from the digital images . \n each hole is plugged with an optical fiber , and all 640 fibers are fed back into spectrographs riding on the back of the telescope , which disperse the light into its constituent colors and allow astronomers to infer the properties and distance of each object from subtle patterns of dark and bright lines , which are produced when atoms absorb and emit light at particular wavelengths . \n _ the center is everywhere _ utilizes a reproduction of one of the sdss plugplates , number 1945 , replacing each optical fiber with a brass suspension rod whose terminating piece represents the astronomical object that the sdss observed through that hole on this plugplate : small glass spheres for stars in the milky way , lamps for the quasars , glass disks for the flattened , spinning galaxies like the milky way , and larger spheres for the rounded `` elliptical '' galaxies that form when gravity drags disk galaxies together and scrambles their stars onto disordered orbits . \n the length of each rod corresponds to the light - travel distance to the object , with the longest rod in the sculpture representing a light ray that has traveled 12.3 billion years to reach the earth . \n , where @xmath1 is the lookback time and @xmath2 is present age of the universe computed for a cosmology with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . ]    disk galaxies are more common than ellipticals , but the ellipticals are , on average , bigger and brighter , so the sdss telescope can see them to greater distances \n . scanning downwards from the top of _ the center is everywhere _ , a dense pattern of disks gradually gives way to a sparser sprinkling of ellipticals . \n quasars are much rarer still , for while most large galaxies contain supermassive black holes , it is only rare , short - lived events that funnel gas toward them and cause them to flare into brilliance . at the peak of its activity , a quasar can outshine its galactic host by a factor of 1000 , so quasars can be detected to the farthest reaches of the universe . \n the volume mapped by a single plugplate expands like the cone of a lighthouse beam , so at large enough distances it begins to encompass many quasars , rare though they are . \n stars enter the sdss in many ways : some are observed as standard sources to calibrate measurements of galaxies and quasars , some are mapped in a deliberate pattern to reveal the structure of the milky way , and some are `` contaminants , '' stars with unusual colors that allow them to masquerade as quasars until an sdss spectrum reveals their true identity . \n = 12.3truecm 0.15truein = 12.3truecm    even a casual inspection of _ the center is everywhere _ shows that galaxies are not randomly distributed through space . \n the gravity that pulls gas and dark matter into galaxies also pulls the galaxies into groups and clusters , arranged on still larger scales in a web of filaments and walls \n . a defining goal of the sdss is to measure the clustering of galaxies with exquisite precision and detail , measurements that help to reveal the history of galaxy formation , pin down the geometry , matter , and energy content of the cosmos , and probe the physics of the big bang itself . \n the cosmic core sample shown in _ the center is everywhere _ is one small chunk of the sdss map of the universe , a random but representative piece of the whole . \n an individual sdss plugplate covers an area on the sky that is three degrees across , six times the diameter of the full moon , the size of a quarter held at arm s length . \n the circular plates must overlap so that they do not leave gaps between them , and in its original phase ( see appendix a ) the sdss used more than 2000 plates to map 1/4 of the sky , one quarter - sized patch at a time . \n an astute viewer with the patience to count will notice that _ the center is everywhere _ has 306 rods , not the expected 640 . \n the minimum separation of holes in the original sdss plugplate is only @xmath6 , an uncomfortably small size to impose on the cut - glass crystals of a chandelier . _ \n the center is everywhere _ \n circumvents this problem with three compromises : it expands the central region of plate 1945 and trims its edges , it slightly nudges the positions of some holes and the lengths of some rods to create space , and it omits some objects that still ca nt fit .    the full title of mcelheny s sculpture is _ \n study for the center is everywhere_. it is a `` study '' in part because this piece is the first of what may well become a series , with the multitude of sdss plugplates providing an ample library for sculptures that follow common rules but are individually unique . \n but even a series of 50 such sculptures would still be `` a study '' for the much larger work that could be constructed in principle , with 2000 + chandeliers suspended in an arena - like vault , holding a million glass crystals and lamps to represent the celestial objects that have been mapped by the sdss . and \n even this vast conceptual installation would remain `` a study '' : the complete work should take its title seriously and include the maps constructed by astronomers and artists in other , distant galaxies , whose own studies for _ the center is everywhere _ include the milky way as a glimmering disk of glass . \n _ `` nature is an infinite sphere , whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere . '' _ the french philosopher blaise pascal wrote this description ( _ penses , 1669 _ ) centuries before the emergence of the modern cosmological model , or the gravitational theory of einstein on which it is based . \n yet it seems an apt encapsulation of the cosmological principle , of the centerless expansion of the big bang theory , and of our consequent ability to map the universe fairly from an arbitrary point within it . because the universe has a finite age \n about 14 billion years according to recent observations  the size of the _ observable _ universe is , in fact , finite . \n a galaxy or quasar more than 14 billion light years away is beyond the edge of our cosmic horizon , and it will remain so forever . \n but just as the slight curvature of the earthly horizon viewed from a ship bespeaks a world far larger than the sailors can see , so astronomical observations ( which , despite increasingly precise measurements , have detected _ no _ curvature of 3-dimensional space ) tell us that the universe is at least hundreds of times larger than the span of our cosmic horizon , probably much larger , and quite possibly infinite . \n if the cosmological principle holds across an infinite universe , then there are other astronomers mapping their own observable sphere so far from us that we could never communicate , not even in principle . \n pascal s metaphor has a long history , as described by jorge luis borges in his essay _ the fearful sphere of pascal_. one who took it up was the communist revolutionary louis auguste blanqui , who devoted his imprisonment to writing a cosmological treatise , _ eternity through the stars : an astronomical hypothesis _ ( 1872 ) . \n on the first page of his book , blanqui repeats and slightly amends pascal s comment : `` _ the universe is a sphere whose center is everywhere and whose surface is nowhere . _ '' blanqui becomes the first to clearly state one of the most bizarre properties of an infinite universe made of constituent atoms and molecules whose variety and possible arrangements are finite . \n in such a universe , every chance event , and every configuration of matter that can arise from a series of such events , must occur , and not just once , but an infinite number of times . \n if we take the idea of the infinite seriously , then mathematical reasoning leads us to the dizzying notion that the ( very ) distant universe holds replicas of ourselves , reading the same books , speaking the same words , thinking the same thoughts . . . and \n near replicas who do the same thing but in a different language , or with different colored eyes . \n blanqui s thought experiment is like that of the librarians in the borges story _ the library of babel _ , who conjecture that the library is infinite and conclude that its volumes of seemingly random letters must somewhere include all the works of great literature , and of bad literature , in all variations , over , and over , and over . \n computations of probabilities in an infinite universe present conceptual and philosophical challenges even today , forming an esoteric and sometimes controversial thread of discussion among contemporary cosmologists and string theorists . \n the stakes of this discussion are real , for it tells us whether an underlying fundamental theory can , with reasonable probability , explain the world as we see it . \n observations do not tell us whether the universe is truly infinite , nor whether it remains statistically homogeneous far beyond our horizon , so there are avenues of escape from the replicas that blanqui envisioned . \n but the mere possibility that we inhabit an infinite universe stocked with infinite replicas disturbs our already troubled senses of individuality and free will . \n closer to home , our finite observable universe is already enormous , and even the sdss has mapped only a tiny fraction of its contents . \n space is big and time is long , and these vastnesses can be intimidating . \n but one can choose instead to marvel at the particularities of nature , at the intricacy of its structures , at the way that gravity and electromagnetism and nuclear forces weave random fluctuations of primordial atoms into a web of galaxies , stars , and planets . on some of these planets , chemistry and biology and evolution \n organize those atoms into beings who can , from their own center of the universe , map the cosmos and begin to understand it .    * acknowledgment * \n i gratefully acknowledge support from the national science foundation , via grant ast-1009505 . \n i thank josiah mcelheny for permission to reproduce images of _ \n study for the center is everywhere _ , and for the opportunity to participate in a remarkable collaboration . \n the sdss was conceived around 1990 , and it began operation in 1998 after nearly a decade of design and construction . in its initial phase , \n the sdss used the world s largest digital camera and fiber -

{"ContextTokens": 3556, "GeneratedTokens": 105, "SynthesizedBody": "disk accretion is one of the most fundamental processes occurring in a variety of astrophysical objects like accretion powered x - ray pulsars , protostars , cataclysmic variables etc . \n it is observed that the molecular viscosity is too small to account for the observed time scales and luminosities @xcite . to circumvent this problem , shakura and \n sunyaev @xcite made a normalization of the coefficient of viscosity in the theory of turbulent viscosity proposed by heisenberg @xcite and introduced a dimensionless parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 were the sound speed and the disk scale height respectively . \n though , the @xmath3 model is quite successful in explaining many astrophysical observations , a degree of ad - hocness enters the model through the parameter @xmath3 . \n the presence of rayleigh criterion of hydrodynamic stability , i.e. a flow with specific angular momentum increasing monotonically , being satisfied in accretion disk , rules out the hydrodynamic origin of turbulence , though there is literature available @xcite in its favor . \n the origin of turbulence is still a question . \n differential rotation can lead to an instability provided the specific angular momentum decreases outward , a condition generally not satisfied in the accretion disk , though there are reports suggesting such regions being realized locally @xcite . \n a recent work @xcite numerically demonstrated the presence of such regions . though differential rotation alone \n can not lead to instability , inclusion of magnetic field alters the scenario altogether . \n it was well known from the classical works of velikhov @xcite and chandra @xcite that a differentially rotating flow with a negative angular velocity gradient in a weak magnetic field is unstable . \n the presence of this instability in accretion disk was established by balbus & hawley @xcite after three decades that the subthermal fields in the presence of differential rotation can cause magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which can provide the physical basis for the transport of angular momentum in accretion disk . \n it has been computationally shown @xcite that mri is capable of introducing turbulence in the accretion disk . \n it is to be noted that mri is essentially an instability of incompressible flow and its growth starts suppressing as the compressibility seeps in . the earliest attempt to understand the effect of compressibility on the growth of mri was made by blaes & balbus @xcite . \n they concluded that the @xmath4 does not affect the instability . \n later on , the behavior of compressible mri in the mhd flows was addressed by kim & ostriker @xcite . \n it was demonstrated that when the magnetic field strength is superthermal , the inclusion of toroidal fields tends to suppress the growth of the mri , and that for quasi - toroidal field configurations no axisymmetric mri takes place in the limit @xmath5 . in an another work , \n pessah & psaltis @xcite studied the role of toroidal fields in compressible flows . \n it was again demonstrated that the growth rate of mri is affected in the compressible flow and mri stabilizes in superthermal fields . \n clearly , the compressibility plays an important role in the dynamics of instabilities operating in the accretion flow . \n recently , bonanno and urpin @xcite ( henceforth paper i ) studied the effect of compressibility on the instabilities in the presence of magnetic field . \n they considered the magnetic field with non vanishing radial and azimuthal components . \n a new instability was observed which survived for all values of magnetic field , unlike mri which survives only in the weak field limit \n . the maximum growth rate of the reported instability was @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the rotation frequency . \n in a recent work @xcite , we investigated the behavior of above instability for a special case @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being epicyclic frequency , defined as @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the rotational frequency ) . \n an instability with a high growth rate was observed . in an offshoot of this work \n , we investigate the behavior of instability reported in @xcite in the keplerian flow . \n it is to be noted that the only difference between the work carried by bonanno and urpin @xcite and us is the inclusion of parameter space which was not considered in their study . \n the paper is organized as follows : the section ii investigates the growth rate of instability . \n the section iii deals with the results and discussions . finally , we conclude by summarizing the new findings . \n paper i considered an axisymmetric differentially rotating system in the presence of a magnetic field . a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) with s being the radial distance from the rotation axis was constructed . \n unperturbed system was described by ( @xmath15 ) = ( @xmath16 ) . \n furthermore , @xmath11 where @xmath11 being the angular velocity of the astrophysical flow , was taken to be approximately a function of s alone ; i.e. @xmath17 . \n the isothermal flow for a compressible fluid was described by the mhd equations    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the density and fluid velocity , respectively ; @xmath25 is the gas pressure ; @xmath26 is gravity ; @xmath27 is the magnetic field , @xmath28 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath29 is the adiabatic index . \n magnetic field has non vanishing radial and azimuthal components . \n quasistationary state for a differentially rotating flow with magnetic field was considered . \n axisymmetric eulerian perturbations with space time dependence @xmath30 where @xmath31 were introduced in the unperturbed accretion disk and the dispersion relation was obtained for a special case of @xmath32 after neglecting the ohmic dissipation in the induction equation . \n we take the dispersion relation of paper i for determining the stability of axisymmetric short wavelength perturbations . \n the dispersion relation ( eq . \n ( @xmath33 ) of paper i ) is given by the @xmath34 where @xmath35    equation ( [ e : eq1 ] ) is a polynomial of degree five , so five non trivial roots exist . \n we apply routh - hurwitz method ( @xcite ) ( see appendix ) to find the regions describing instabilities . \n this method has been applied in the field of astrophysics very frequently ( @xcite ) instability exist if any of the conditions written below is satisfied . \n @xmath36    from the above inequalities , it is clear that the instability will exist only when @xmath37    it is to be noted that only those perturbations are considered here in which the wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath38 .    let us investigate the growth rate of the hydromagnetic instability . to calculate the growth rate of this instability , it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath39 the polynomial given by eq . \n ( [ e : eq4 ] ) becomes @xmath40    this equation is solved numerically ( see @xcite for details ) by computing the eigen values of the matrix whose characteristic polynomial is given by equation ( [ e : eq5 ] ) for different values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 parameters . \n since we are interested in the instabilities , only real roots ( perturbations @xmath30 ) are considered . \n we consider the parameter space constrained by @xmath44 and investigate the growth of instability for different values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , keeping in mind @xmath45 . \n it is to be noted that this parameter space was not considered by bonanno and urpin @xcite . \n the fig.(1 ) , ( 2 ) , & ( 3 ) shows the dependence of re ( @xmath46 ) for @xmath47 . \n the value of @xmath43 is fixed to @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the values of the parameter @xmath42 is varied for @xmath51 . \n similar trend is observed in all the cases , i.e. the growth rate of instability increases with the decrease in @xmath42 . for a value of @xmath52 , growth rate of the instability at @xmath53 increases from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 respectively . \n as @xmath58 increases further , at @xmath59 , the growth rate of instability increases from @xmath60 for @xmath61 to @xmath62 for @xmath63 to @xmath64 for @xmath65 . \n it is evident that a vigorous instability is operating in the above described parameter space . \n we revisit the problem of hydromagnetic instability in differentially rotating compressible flows and analyze the instability . \n the parameter space described by @xmath45 was investigated and diskovered a vigorous instability . \n the behavior of the instability for a typical value of @xmath43 and @xmath42 ( @xmath66 ) was studied . \n it is observed that the instability growth rate increases with the increase of @xmath43 and it also depends on the wavenumber . \n the growth rate of the instability becomes very high , as high as ( @xmath67 @xmath68 ) for @xmath69 at @xmath70 , @xmath52 ) .    in a recent work , \n bonanno and urpin @xcite carried out the studies for a compressible flow and showed the presence of a new instability . \n the notable point of their instability was that it existed for any value of magnetic field , the only condition being @xmath37 . \n the major difference between the studies carried out by kim & ostriker @xcite , pessah & psaltis @xcite and bonanno & urpin @xcite is that , in the later case , they considered a field with non vanishing radial and azimuthal component . \n we investigated a parameter space and noticed a high growth rate instability in that region . recall that the mri does not exist for @xmath38 . \n since present study was carried out for @xmath38 , mri does not operate in our case . \n it should also be noted that for the incompressible case , i.e . \n @xmath71 , polynomial ( [ e : eq4 ] ) becomes @xmath72 it is clear that the present instability appears only for compressible fluid . \n it is to be noted that the radial component of magnetic field is non zero in the present case . \n radial field in the presence of differential rotation shears into an azimuthal field resulting in an increase in the magnitude of @xmath4 . as an example \n , desch @xcite describes that if @xmath4 = @xmath73 in a keplerian disk at the beginning of one orbit , by the end of the orbit @xmath4 increases to @xmath74 . \n after two orbits , @xmath4 increases even more , to @xmath75 . \n this problem , i.e. the increase in the azimuthal field in the present case was avoided by treating the state as a quasistationary state . \n when @xmath28 is small , one can obtain from eq . \n ( 4 ) that the azimuthal field grows approximately linearly with time , @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the azimuthal field at @xmath79 . as long as the second term on the r.h.s . is small compared to the first one , and @xmath80 stretching of the azimuthal field does not affect significantly the basic state ; @xmath81 is the characteristic timescale of generation of @xmath82 . as a result \n , the basic state can be treated as quasi - stationary during the time @xmath83 . in recent times \n , bonanno and urpin has shown that this instability exists in many cases of interest @xcite . \n the presence of this instability has also been demonstrated in the case of protostellar disks @xcite also . \n it is clear that the instability discussed in the present report appears in many astrophysical situations including protoplanatery disk ( albeit with small growth rate ) . \n this instability is different and independent of the magnetorotational instability . \n the necessary and sufficient condition for this instability to occur is @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath84 ; therefore ,    \\1 ) the instability exists for non vanishing radial and azimuthal component of magnetic field whereas the poloidal component of magnetic field is important for mri to occur . \n mri can exits for vanishing radial and azimuthal fields . \n \\2 ) the instability exists for any differential rotation , i.e. for any sign of @xmath85 whereas mri exists only when the angular velocity in the disk decreases outwards , i.e. @xmath86 . \n \\3 ) the instability exists even in sufficiently strong magnetic field which suppresses the magnetorotational instability . \n mri exists only in the weak field limit . \n a special case was considered in the present report where wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath32 . since the growth rate of mri is directly proportional to the @xmath87 , mri does not exists in this case . \n this is one of the most important differences between the present instability and the mri . \n it is observed that a high growth rate is reached for large values of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . if @xmath90(typical in keplerian disk ) , \n the magnetic energy density is greater than the rotational energy density . \n therefore , the present instability will be operating in a regime where `` magnetic energy density more that the rotational energy density '' can be realized . for an accretion disk , the rotational energy ( essentially by definition ) \n is larger than all other energies thermal , magnetic , radiation . \n so , the rotationally supported accretion disk are out of question to envisage the regions where magnetic energy density is more than rotational energy density . \n one possible realization of such regions might appear when one inches towards the inner most region of accretion disk , where the disk starts truncating / evaporating and the rotational support starts getting diminishing and magnetic field takes over . \n a standard pulsar ( or even more a magnetar ) meets this condition . \n consider a @xmath91 g surface field on a pulsar . \n several scale heights away from the star the density is very small , so the rotational energy density is much less than the magnetic energy density . \n if we consider the low - density regions far above the disk then any magnetic bubble that floats away after reconnection could temporarily have a larger magnetic energy density than rotational energy density . \n the scenario closest to our regime was considered by begelman and pringle @xcite where magnetic pressure exceeds the combined gas + radiation pressure in the disk but not the rotational energy density . for magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in accretion disk , \n the balance is achieved via the joint action of rotation , pressure gradients and magnetic tension . for the regions mentioned above \n , one can not count on rotation . \n it is important to identify a robust equilibrium about which to perturb , perhaps gradients in pressure or radiation pressure could help in the inner disk regions . \n one needs to solve such scenario theoretically . \n we will consider this scenario in a future work . \n in the present report , we have demonstrated the presence of very high growth rate instability in a differentially rotating compressible flows . \n it has been shown that the growth rate of this instability is very high and for a special case considered above , the growth rate increases to as high as @xmath92 for @xmath59 . \n it is observed that the present instability might be operating in regions where magnetic energy density is more than the rotational energy density . \n the author thanks c. miller , v. urpin and b.p.pandey for the insightful discussions . \n the author also thanks both the anonymous referees for their useful comments . \n this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system and arxiv.org e -

lined eclipsing binaries of a - f spectral type observed by gaia will have their orbital separation and masses of both components determined to an accuracy of @xmath31% provided that the spectral dispersion and resolution will be not too far from 0.25  / pix and 0.5  , respectively . \n the baricentric velocities are constrained to better than 0.5 km sec@xmath5 , which is fine in comparison to the accuracy of gaia tangential motions , and also adequate to resolve the internal kinematics of stellar aggregates ( clusters , associations , etc . )        for the program stars we adopted @xmath6 because modeling excluded any eccentricity larger than 0.01 , which can be taken as a rough indication of the accuracy to which eccentricity could be determined by gaia observations . \n periods for the three program stars have been determined to such an accuracy that it would take @xmath7170 years ( on the average ) to bring the ephemeris out of phase for more than 10%  of the orbital period . \n the 5 years of gaia operation ( compared to the time span of 3.36 years for hipparcos data or 1.38 years for the spectral data used here ) , should expand the 10% accuracy horizon of the ephemeris to @xmath7250 years . \n hipparcos has collected about 110 measurements per star . \n if eclipses last for 1/10 or less of the orbital period , one has to expect 10 or less photometric points to be distributed over the eclipse phases . \n gaia will have three lines of view ( at @xmath3120 deg ) . \n if the same set of core photometric bands is present in _ all _ the three channels ( a feature yet to be optimized in the currently baselined gaia design ) , the number of collected photometric points will proportionally increase with great benefit not only to the study of eclipsing binaries but also to variable stars in general . \n effective temperatures and surface gravities are in fact two of the basic output of spectral synthesis analysis ( e.g.  based on kurucz model atmospheres ) . \n the 0.25  / pix dispersion and 0.5   resolution gaia spectra used here are quite adequate to derive temperatures to @xmath830  k and gravities to 0.1 dex ( cf . \n munari and castelli 2000 ) . \n the analysis of gaia spectra of eclipsing binaries ( mainly those obtained at quadratures when spectra of both components are better observed ) would therefore provide these quantities directly .    the effective temperature and surface gravity determined directly from gaia spectra \n could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as inputs in the modeling process to decrease the number of variables . \n a natural check about the goodness of the orbital solution and modeling is to compare the distance to the program stars computed from the modeling parameters in table  4 with the trigonometric parallaxes measured by hipparcos . \n this is done in table  5 , together with the distance to v505  per from the modeling of marshall et al . \n ( 1997 ) . \n the high expected performances of gaia observations are confirmed : ( @xmath1 ) the modeling of photometric lightcurves and radial velocity curves for the three program stars constrains the distance to a better accuracy than hipparcos trigonometric parallax , and ( @xmath2 ) modeling distances and hipparcos parallaxes agree inside the respective errors .    as for the effective temperature and surface gravity , trigonometric parallaxes determined directly by gaia ( at an average 200@xmath9 better precision than hipparcos ) \n could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as an input value in the modeling process itself . \n the unique characteristic of gaia as a single mission which combines astrometry , spectroscopy and photometry appears to offer special advantages compared to the classical ground - based approach to eclipsing binaries . \n the possibility to use effective temperatures , surface gravities and trigonometric parallaxes as fixed input values to the modeling of lightcurves and radial velocities should allow more confident derivation of other parameters , both stimulating a new modeling approach to eclipsing binaries and also granting lower errors to the solution .    by probing all constituents of the galaxy ( halo , disk , bulge ) and detecting eclipsing binaries there \n , gaia can foster an epochal leap in our knowledge of the basic stellar parameters and how they vary with mass , age and chemical abundance . \n this will be true not only on statistical grounds ( given the huge number of observable eclipsing systems ) but also for an object by object approach . \n this paper has in fact shown that an accuracy of 1% in the derived stellar parameters can be achieved by gaia on a fraction of the detached eclipsing binaries observed during the mission . \n andersen j. 1991 , a&a review 3 , 91 carquillat j.m . , nadal r. , ginestet n. , pedoussaut a. 1982 , a&a 115 , 23 castelli , f. , munari u. , 2001 , 366 , 1003 gilmore g. , perryman m. , lindegren l. favata f. , hoeg e. , lattanzi m. , luri x. , mignard f. , roeser s. , de zeeuw p.t . , 1998 , proc spie conference 3350 , p. 541 kallrath , j. , milone , e.f . 1999 , _ eclipsing binary stars : modeling and analysis \n , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 2966, "GeneratedTokens": 280, "SynthesizedBody": "the alice experiment is dedicated to the studies of the properties of the deconfined qcd medium ( quark - gluon plasma , qgp ) by conducting ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the lhc  @xcite . \n a significant increase of the luminosity for heavy ions is expected in run 3 after long shutdown 2 ( ls2 ) , which implies a collision rate of about 50 khz and @xmath0 = 10 nb@xmath1 . \n this luminosity upgrade provides a substantial enhancement of capabilities for measuring observables relevant to the characterization of the qgp at the highest temperatures  @xcite .    in order to exploit the scientific potential of the high - luminosity heavy - ion program in run  3 , alice plans to extend its physics reach by upgrading the alice detector . \n the major goals of the upgraded alice detector are as follows ; precision measurements of heavy - quark and quarkonia production at low transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) to study the mechanisms of heavy - quark thermalization and interactions in the medium , production of low - mass dielectrons to extract information on thermodynamical properties of the medium and to characterize the chiral phase transition , jets and jet correlations to reveal the mechanisms of partonic energy loss in the medium  @xcite . \n the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is one of the main tracking and pid devices in the central barrel of the alice detector . \n it provides precise charged - particle tracking , momentum measurement , and particle identification in very high multiplicity heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . \n the readout rate of the tpc is currently limited by the necessity to prevent ions generated in the the amplification region of the mwpc - based readout chambers from drifting back into the drift volume , which is achieved through active ion gating by operating a dedicated gating grid . \n the relevant ion drift times limit the maximum trigger rate of the tpc to about 3.5 khz . \n operation of the current tpc with the mpwc - based readout scheme and the current active ion gating scheme at 50 khz pb - pb collisions in run  3 can not be possible . \n on the other hand , operation of the current tpc with continuously open gating grid can not be the solution since back - drifting ions from the amplification region will lead to excessive ion charge densities and distortions of the electric field in the drift volume . \n the proposed scheme to acquire high rate operational capability and a small number of back - drifting ions is to replace the existing mwpc - based readout chambers and gating grid system by a multi - layer gas electron multiplier ( gem ) system and to run the tpc in an ungated continuous mode . \n gems have been developed to cope with the stringent requirements for high - luminosity experiments  @xcite and have proven to provide excellent position resolution , to have very high rate capability , and better ion blocking capability compared to mwpc . \n the main considerations for the tpc upgrade and the design requirements are as follows  @xcite :    * the maximum ion backflow ( ibf ) that can be tolerated is about 1% at a gain of 2000 in ne - co@xmath3-n@xmath3 ( 90 - 10 - 5 ) , i.e. 20 back - drifting ions per incoming primary electron ( @xmath4 = 20 ) . * in case of ibf = 1% , space - charge field distortions reach 20  cm and 8  cm in @xmath5 and @xmath6 at small @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the tpc , respectively . in order to preserve the present momentum resolution , online and offline distortion corrections with a precision better than 500  @xmath9 m , i.e. a few times 10@xmath10 , \n are required . * due to the limited bandwidth of the data acquisition system , reduction of data flow size by a factor of 20 is needed in the online reconstruction by finding the clusters associated to tracks . \n * the upgraded tpc must preserve the performance of the existing system in terms of particle identification via d@xmath11/d@xmath12 , implying a local energy resolution better than 12% ( at 5.9 kev ) . \n an extensive r&d program has been started in 2012 to study the performance of gem - based detectors ( ibf , gain stability , discharge probability ) , technology choice ( gem stacks including the combination of gems with different pitches , cobra - gem , 2 gem + micromegas system ) , large prototype production by single mask technology , electronics r&d , and simulation studies to establish the strategy for space - charge distortion corrections . \n our baseline solution comprises stacks of 4 gem layers , where 1st and 4th gems are standard gems with 140  @xmath9 m pitch , 50  @xmath9 m thickness , and 70 ( 50 )  @xmath9 m outer ( inner ) hole diameter , and 2nd and 3rd gems are large pitch gem foils with 280  @xmath9 m pitch , 50  @xmath9 m thickness , and 70 ( 50 )  @xmath9 m outer ( inner ) hole diameter . \n this setup allows to block ions efficiently by employing low / high fields above / below gems and foils with low optical transparency . \n figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the results of the measured ibf and energy resolution at 5.9 kev at a gain of 2000 for a 4-gem system , where the voltage across gem1 increases from left to right along the x - axis . \n it can be seen that an ibf of 0.7% is achieved at an energy resolution of 12% ( at 5.9 kev ) the observed anti - correlation between ibf and resolution is related to the gains of the first two gems : higher electron multiplication at the early stages improves the energy resolution , while it results in larger number of ions escaping into the drift region . \n detailed simulations based on garfield++  @xcite were performed to describe the observed ibf performance . \n it was found that ibf is very sensitive to the alignment of the gem holes in consecutive layers , which can not be controlled experimentally . \n the measured ibf values are best reproduced in simulations , if a random misalignment of the holes is assumed , corresponding to the most probable relative geometrical position of gem foils in a stack . \n /d@xmath12 spectrum of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 measured with an iroc prototype employing a triple stack of large - size gem foils . \n ( y - axis shows the number of counts and x - axis shows d@xmath11/d@xmath12 ( a.u.).,width=330 ]    /d@xmath12 spectrum of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 measured with an iroc prototype employing a triple stack of large -

mask technology developed by the mpgd workshop at cern . \n beam test was carried out at the ps - t10 beamline and the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 resolution was studied as function of the transfer fields and voltages across gems . \n figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 spectra of 1  gev/@xmath13 electrons and pions recorded at a gain of @xmath14 5000 . \n the energy resolution is 10.5% for the ibf - optimized field configurations and the resolution is comparable to the d@xmath11/d@xmath12 resolution of the current tpc .    an alternative solution is a system combining 2 gems with a micromegas detector . \n micromegas ( mm ) provides low ibf due to the larger ratio of the electric field values in the small amplification gap to the drift field above the mm . if the mm employs a fine mesh ( 400 - 1000 lpi ) , ibf is close to the ratio between two fields itself  @xcite . \n the ibf and energy resolution for this hybrid 2-gem + mm system were measured , using a 10 @xmath15 10 @xmath16 prototype detector . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] , where an ibf of  0.2% is reached at an energy resolution of 12% at 5.9 kev . \n a large - scale solution for the inner and outer tpc readout chambers and the operational stability will be verified in the future . \n r73 mm        the new scheme also required the development of new front - end electronics to cope with the reversed polarity , the requirements for continuous readout , and the increased data throughput in high rate pb - pb collisions . \n a new front - end asic called sampa has been developed , which integrates the functionality of the present preamp / shaper and altro adc+dsp ( digital signal processing ) and supports continuous or triggered readout  @xcite . \n first mpw ( multi - project wafer ) submission was done in april 2013 and further developments are ongoing . \n online and offline reconstruction and calibration are very challenging due to the demand of data compression and requirement of the space - charge distortion corrections . \n currently a two - stage reconstruction scheme is under consideration . in the first stage of the reconstruction , \n an averaged space - charge distortion map scaled to the averaged multiplicity for certain time intervals is used for the distortion corrections , and cluster finding and cluster - track association are performed , which leads to a data compression by a factor of 20 . \n full tracking with the external detectors ( inner tracking system + transition radiation detector ) will be performed in the 2nd stage of the reconstruction , where a high - resolution space - charge map being updated every 5  msec is generated for the full distortion corrections . \n figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the expected @xmath2 resolution in 50 khz pb - pb collisions without any space - charge distortions ( left ) , with space - charge distortion and distortion corrections at the first stage ( middle ) , and with space - charge distortion and full distortion corrections at 2nd stage of reconstruction ( right ) . in these calculations , space - charge fluctuations mainly due to the number of pileup events and charged particle multiplicities \n are taken into account . the obtained @xmath2 resolution after the 2nd reconstruction stage is comparable to that without distortions , if tpc - its global tracks are considered . \n to exploit the full potential of the high luminosity of the lhc in run 3 , the alice program for run 3 requires an upgrade of the tpc . \n the heart of the tpc upgrade is to replace the mwpc - based readout chambers by detectors employing micro - pattern detectors including gems to allow tpc operation in continuous mode . \n extensive detector r&d and simulations have been conducted and a baseline scenario for the detector design has been established . \n quadruple stacks of gem layers with different gem pitches provide the required ibf and energy resolution . also a design based on a hybrid configuration of gems and micromegas is studied . \n simulations show that the performance of the present tpc can be retained in 50 khz pb - pb collisions after distortion corrections . \n further studies of the long - term stability , uniformity of the gain and ibf , and discharge probability are being conducted . \n iroc prototypes employing a 4-gem stack and a hybrid 2-gem + mm system are being built and beam tests will be carried out at the ps and the sps in the fall of 2014 . \n alice collaboration , `` the alice experiment at the cern lhc '' , jinst 3.08 ( 2008 ) , s08002 . \n doi : 10.1088/1748 -

therefore , monte carlo transport codes are usually used to simulate impacts associated with fragmentation reactions . \n it is important that available transport codes simulate such reactions as well as possible . \n the los alamos monte carlo transport code mcnp6 @xcite uses by default the latest version of the cascade - exciton model ( cem ) as incorporated in its event generator cem03.03 to simulate fragmentation of light nuclei at intermediate energies for reactions induced by nucleons , pions , and photons , and the los alamos version of the quark - gluon string model ( laqgsm ) as implemented in the code laqgsm03.03 ( see @xcite and references therein ) to simulate fragmentation reactions induced by nuclei and by particles at energies above @xmath1 gev , up to about 1 tev / nucleon . \n generally , both cem and laqgsm assume that nuclear reactions occur in three stages . \n the first stage is the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) , completely different in cem and laqgsm , in which primary particles can be re - scattered and produce secondary particles several times prior to absorption by , or escape from the nucleus . \n when the cascade stage of a reaction is complete , cem and laqgsm use the coalescence model to  create \" high - energy d , t , @xmath2he , and @xmath0he via final - state interactions among emitted cascade nucleons , already outside of the target . \n the subsequent relaxation of the nuclear excitation is treated in terms of an improved version of the modified exciton model of preequilibrium decay followed by the equilibrium evaporation / fission stage of the reaction . \n but if the residual nuclei after the inc have atomic numbers with @xmath3 , cem and laqgsm use the fermi breakup model to calculate their further disintegration instead of using the preequilibrium and evaporation / fission models . thus , for targets with @xmath3 , reactions are assumed to occur only in two stages . \n the `` standard '' version of cem and laqgsm account for possible multiple emission of only n , p , d , t , @xmath2he , and @xmath0he during the preequilibrium stage of reactions ( see ref . \n their latest , `` f '' , version ( see refs . \n @xcite ) considers a possibility of preequilibrium emission of light fragments ( lf ) heavier than @xmath0he , up to @xmath4 mg . \n it also simulates coalescence of lf heavier than @xmath0he , up to @xmath5 , in cem03.03f ( see @xcite ) , and up to @xmath6 , in laqgsm03.03f ( see @xcite ) .    in recent years , mcnp6 , with its cem and laqgsm event generators , has been extensively validated and verified ( v&v ) against a large variety of nuclear reactions on both thin and thick targets ( see , e.g. refs . \n @xcite - @xcite and references therein ) . in ref . \n @xcite , it was tested specifically on fragmentation of light nuclei at intermediate energies . here \n , we present a few results from our recent work @xcite and investigate further the performance of mcnp6 , cem , and laqgsm in simulating fragmentation reactions at intermediate energies and discuss possible ways of further improving these codes . \n figs . 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 show examples of fragmentation reactions on light nuclei simulated by our codes . figs . \n 6 and 4 shows examples for medium targets , @xmath7ca and @xmath8ag . \n many more similar results , their discussion , and useful details can be found in refs . \n @xcite - @xcite and references therein . \n to 50 mm c from p + @xmath9o calculated with cem03.03 using the `` standard '' version of the fermi breakup model ( @xmath10 ) and with cut - off values for @xmath11 of 16 and 14 , as well as with mcnp6 using cem03.03 ( @xmath10 ) compared with experimental data , as indicated . \n experimental data are from the t16 lib compilation @xcite ( see details in @xcite ) . , \n title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]      to 50 mm li spectra at 20 , 45 , 60 , 90 , and 110 degrees by machner et al . \n @xcite ( symbols ) with calculations by the unmodified cem03.03 ( dashed histograms ) and results by cem03.03.f ( solid histograms ) , as indicated ( see more details in @xcite ) . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]          however , mcnp6 is not yet ready to predict well heavy fragments from reactions with heavier nuclei , with mass numbers @xmath12 . \n such nuclear targets are considered too light to fission in conventional codes . \n similarly , the fragments are too light to be produced as spallation residues and too heavy to be produced via standard evaporation and/or preequilibrium models , or via coalescence .    to 50 mm \n ne + @xmath13ne with calculations by laqgs03.03 using its `` standard '' version of the coalescence model ( @xmath14 gev / c for t and @xmath2he ;

body interaction \n is calculated instead of computing all particles for every step in the md simulation . therefore computation time \n we choose the ac@xmath1 t code as the partner of the md simulation for its fast calculation of a location and a velocity of the particle . \n the main problem of hybridization between the two simulation codes is how to define a threshold kinetic energy of the injection particle . for higher kinetic energy of particle \n than the threshold kinetic energy , we calculate the trajectory of the particle by the ac@xmath1 t code . as the kinetic energy \n is dissipated to its surroundings and attaches to the threshold kinetic energy @xmath2 , we give a position and a velocity of the projectile to the md simulation code as the initial condition . \n then we perform the md simulation . generally speaking , \n because a multi - body interaction with the neighborhood of the projectile must be calculated in the md simulation code with the rebo potential , computation time becomes longer than in the ac@xmath1 t code . to make the performance of the simulation better \n , it is necessary to shorten the md simulation and extend the ac@xmath1 t simulation box . \n however , it is known that the ac@xmath1 t code can not calculate exactly the particle motion in a low energy . comparing the md simulation with the ac@xmath1 t simulation , two simulation results are consistent in higher kinetic energy than 200 ev  @xcite . \n thus we set @xmath2=200 ev at which a simulation algorithm changes from the ac@xmath1 t simulation to the md simulation . \n a concept of hybrization between the md simulation and the ac@xmath1 t simulation is that the ac@xmath1 t simulation works when a kinetic energy of a projectile is higher than the threshold energy @xmath3 ev , while the md simulation works when the kinetic energy becomes lower than the threshold energy @xmath2 . \n t - md hybrid simulation of hydrogen injection onto a graphite . ] \n to explain the hybrid simulation more concretely , let s consider a hydrogen atom injection onto a graphite ( fig . \n [ fig03 ] ) . \n an injection kinetic energy of the hydrogen atom is set to 1 kev , which is higher than @xmath2 . while the kinetic energy of the hydrogen atom is higher than @xmath2 , trajectories of the hydrogen atom and the surrounding carbon atoms are calculated by the ac@xmath1 t simualtion . \n the hydrogen atom dissipates its kinetic energy by interacting with carbon atoms in diamond and then the kinetic energy becomes lower than @xmath2 . at that moment , \n the md simulation starts to calculate the motions of the hydrogen and the carbon instead of the ac@xmath1 t . \n some of carbon atoms which collide with the incident hydrogen are kicked out on the way of the ac@xmath1 t simulation . \n the motions of all kicked carbons in the cascade process are solved by the same procedure as the incident hydrogen .    in order to realize the above hybrid simulation , we use multiple program multiple data ( mpmd )  @xcite which was developed to execute different programs parallely in one simulation with synchronizing their data . using the mpmd , we control four programes , i.e. , ( i ) master program , ( ii ) ac@xmath1 t program , ( iii ) md program and ( iv ) splitting program as shown in fig . \n [ fig04 ] . \n the master process is installed between the ac@xmath1 t and md processes for data synchronization . \n after an initialization of each process ( fig . \n [ fig04](1 ) and ( 2 ) ) , the ac@xmath1 t process ( 3 ) is executed until the kinetic energy of the incident hydrogen and all kicked atoms become lower than @xmath2 . \n when the kinetic energies of all atoms becomes lower than @xmath2 , the ac@xmath1 t process sends , to the master process , a list of the position and velocity of the moving atoms as a result of the ac@xmath1 t simulation . the master process ( 4 ) informs the splitter process of the completion of the ac@xmath1 t process with the list of moved atoms . \n the splitter process updates its material data with the list of moved atoms . \n ( 5 ) then , the md simulation box are picked up from the entire target material and they are sent to the md processes . \n the md simulation is started in each md processes . \n ( 6 ) we will explain the algorithm of the ac@xmath1 t simulation , the md simulation and the splitting program in the following subsections . \n t - md hybrid simulation code . ] \n a binary collision between a projectile and a target atom is necessary in the ac@xmath1 t simulation  @xcite . during the binary collision , a total energy , a total momentum and a total angular momentum \n are conserved . due to these conservations , \n the final position and velocity of the projectile and the target atom are obtained analytically on a potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance between the projectile and the target atom . in the ac@xmath1 t code similarly to the acat code , the moliere approximation is adopted and then @xmath4 is given by the thomas - fermi potential as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a screening length , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are atomic numbers of the projectile and the target atom , respectively . unlike the md simulation , the ac@xmath1 t simulation directry gives us the asymptotic trajectory of the projectile collided with the target . in the ac@xmath1 t simulation \n , the projectile hits the target atoms and then it brings about cascade shower in the large simulation box .      the equation of motion in the md simlation \n is written by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the position , momentum and the mass of the @xmath13-th atom . \n the function @xmath14 is total potential energy . in our md simulation \n , the modified rebo potential is used for the potential @xmath14 which is defined as : @xmath15}^{\\rm r}(r_{ij } ) - \\bar{b}_{ij}(\\{r\\ } , \\{\\theta^{\\rm b}\\ } , \\{\\theta^{\\rm dh}\\ } ) v_{[ij]}^{\\rm a}(r_{ij } ) , \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance between the @xmath13-th and the @xmath17-th atoms . \n the functions @xmath18}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] and @xmath18}^{\\mathrm{a}}$ ] represent repulsion and attraction , respectively . \n the function @xmath19 generates a multi - body force . \n the bond angle @xmath20 is the angle between the vector from the @xmath13-th atom to the @xmath17-th atom and the vector from the @xmath13-th atom to the @xmath21-th atom . \n the dihedral angle @xmath22 is the angle between the plane passing through the @xmath21-th , @xmath13-th , and @xmath17-th atoms and the plane passing through the @xmath13-th , @xmath17-th , and @xmath23-th atoms . \n moreover , the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 denote all sets of @xmath27 and @xmath22 , respectively ( for details of the modified brenner rebo potentialm , see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . \n the second - order symplectic integration@xcite is used to execute the time integration of the equation of motion where the time step is set to @xmath28 . \n unlike the acat simulation , the md simulation can not treat a large scale material . to calculate efficiently , local boxs @xmath29 on a side \n are picked up , and the simulation for the atoms in each box is executed in parallel . to obtain precise forces acting on all atoms in the md simulation boxs @xmath29 on a side , the bond energy @xmath30 in eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) is calculated in a larger cubic box @xmath31 on a side . \n furthermore , the function @xmath32 depends on more outer covalent bonds . \n consequently , the md process needs the positions of atoms in a cubic box @xmath33 on a side . \n namely , in the md process , the equations of motions are solved about atoms in the cubic box @xmath29 on a side , and forces acting on the atoms are calculated by aggregating surrounding atoms in a cubic box @xmath34 on a side as shown in fig . [ fig05 ] .          by the mpmd method \n , one cpu is allocated into the md process treating one cubic box @xmath34 on a side . \n however , there is the special case that two or more cubic boxs overlap because the moving particles are close . \n these overlapping boxs are regarded as a combined md simulation box for one cpu process . the determination for the md simulation box \n is carried out by the splitting program ( see fig .  [ fig06 ] ) as follows . \n the simulation box in the ac@xmath1 t code is divided into cubic cells @xmath35 on a side , where @xmath35 is the cutoff length of covalent bond in the rebo potential . \n @xmath36 cells , which are corresponding to the cubic box @xmath33 on side , are marked up . \n only a center cell of the marked cells is a member of the md simulation box , initially . \n the center cell is set to the first target cell and the member of the md simulation box is selected by the following recursive routine : if adjoining cells of the target cell has been marked up , they are added into the member of the md simulation box and become next target cells , while if they have not been marked up , the recursive routine is stopped . \n we demonstrate an ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation for a hydrogen atom injection onto a graphite , whose size is @xmath37 long , @xmath38 wide and @xmath39 depth which consists of 100 graphene . \n periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the horizontal direction . \n the initial temperature of the graphite is set to zero kelvin . \n the hydrogen atom is injected normaly onto the surface at 1 kev . \n .the average of the depth @xmath40 and the horizontal distance @xmath41 of 900 injections . \n @xmath42 trajectories which go out of the target material are excepted . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n +    900 simulations with the same initial material and randomly changed injection position have been performed . as a bench - mark , stand alone ac@xmath1 t simulations have also been performed . \n table  [ tbl1 ] shows the average and the standard deviation of the depth @xmath40 and the horizontal distance @xmath41 from the surface to the final positions in the result of both the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation and the ac@xmath1 t simulation . \n although the averages of depth in the both cases are almost equal , the average and the standard deviation of horizontal distance by the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation are smaller than that of the ac@xmath1 t simulation . \n figure [ fig07](a ) and ( b ) show 30 samples chosen randomly in 900 trajectories calculated by the ac@xmath1 t and the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid code , respectively . \n figure [ fig07](b ) shows the trajectories in the same initial condition calculated by the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation . \n the gray and blue lines in fig . \n [ fig07](b ) show the trajectories of which indicate the ac@xmath1 t contribution and the md contribution , respectively . comparing these two figures \n , it is found that the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation gives shorter trajectories than the ac@xmath1 t simulation does . \n as shown in the trajectory ` a ' in fig . \n [ fig07](a ) , the incident hydrogen atom moved the long distance along the interlayer region of the graphite , because the ac@xmath1 t code does not treat the binding from surrounding atoms . \n the md simulation includes it by the multi - body force . \n therefore , the atom is not possible to move a long distance for low kinetic energy in the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation as shown in fig . \n [ fig07](c ) . in our previous research \n @xcite , it was shown that there is an adsorption site @xmath43 above each of the carbon on a graphene sheet . \n the hydrogen calculated by the md dissipates its kinetic energy quicker than the ac@xmath1 t case and finally be trapped at the adsorption site . \n t code and ( b)ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation , respectively . \n ( c)detailed image of the md simulation part for trajectory ` a ' in ( b ) . ] \n the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation code has been developed to treat large materials , long time and wide range kinetic energy in psi . \n the motion of hydrogen atom is solved by bca method using the ac@xmath1 t code while its kinetic energy is higher than @xmath44 . \n when the kinetic energy becomes lower than @xmath44 , the md code is invoked around atoms moved by the ac@xmath1 t simulation . \n the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation was performed and compared with stand alone ac@xmath1 t simulations of 900 hydrogen atom injections onto a graphite . \n their results suggested that the ac@xmath1t - md hybrid simulation tends to derives a shorter trajectory than the ac@xmath1 t simulation does . \n this fact is caused by the binding from the surrounding atoms , which is ignored in the ac@xmath1 t simulation . \n our deep appreciation should go to prof . \n takahiro kenmotsu of faculty of life and medical sciences , doshisha university . \n numerical simulations were carried out using the plasma simulator at the national institute for fusion science , japan . \n this work is supported by the national institutes of natural sciences undertaking forming bases for interdisciplinary and international research through cooperation across fields of study and collaborative research program ( no . \n nifs09kein0091 ) and grants -

{"ContextTokens": 3157, "GeneratedTokens": 289, "SynthesizedBody": "in disk - dominated cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , mass accretion onto a white dwarf ( wd ) from a relatively normal secondary star is mediated by a disk that extends close to the surface of the wd . \n all cvs vary , but \n the character of the variability probably reflects the time - averaged accretion rate from the secondary ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? \n systems with low accretion rate show semi - periodic outburst of 3 - 5 magnitudes ( in @xmath0 ) and are known as dwarf novae ( dne ) . \n these outbursts are due to a thermal instability that converts the disk from a low temperature , mostly unionized , optically thin ( in the continuum ) state to a high temperature , ionized , optically thick state . during the outburst , the mass transfer rate @xmath1 in the inner disk rises from @xmath2 to , and , in terms of the simplest picture of the system , the dominant source of fuv emission changes from being the wd to the disk . \n by contrast , systems with high mass - transfer rates remain in the high state most of the time , and are known as nova - like variables . \n finally there are `` z cam '' objects , which undergo normal dn outbursts as well as outbursts that stall during the transition to quiescence for weeks to months at an intermediate magnitude ( typically 0.5 - 1 magnitudes below peak ) . \n these are thought to be systems with intermediate rates of mass transfer from the secondary star .    in this review , \n i would like to highlight recent progress toward understanding these systems as a result of observations with , , and the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) . \n as first shown using , the fuv spectra of disk - dominated cvs in outburst show `` blue '' continua that can be reasonably approximated in terms of a weighted set of stellar atmospheres , where the weighting is determined by the temperature and gravity of a steady state accretion disk and where each spectrum is broadened to mimic that of a rotating disk annulus . a modern example using data from  and is shown in fig.[v3885sgr_disk ] . \n when , as in this case , the distance and inclination are known , the fit depends almost entirely on the observed flux . in these cases , the fact that the model qualitatively reproduces many of the features in the spectrum suggests that the derived @xmath1 is close to the correct value . on the other hand , models based on stellar atmospheres \n have generally been shown to fail to reproduce the spectrum over large wavelength ranges , particular if the range spans the balmer limit . \n stellar atmospheres have a pronounced balmer jump in contrast to what is observed in high state disk systems . \n this is surely due to differences between disk and stellar atmospheres . \n ad hoc solutions , such as including a transition region above the surface of the disk , are capable of addressing the problem but do not discriminate between likely mechanisms , which include viscous energy dissipation in or illumination of the disk atmosphere . to date there have been very few published attempts to create more physically correct model disk spectra and perform detailed comparisons to high quality spectra . \n however , this is likely to happen soon . \n the machinery does exist @xcite and model grids are beginning to be created ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? * ) . \n the disk model fits will not provide a complete solution , however , because fuv spectra of high state spectra show clear evidence of winds . \n p cygni like profiles in n v , si iv and ( most commonly ) c iv are observed in some systems , and the centroids of these lines are blue - shifted in others . \n blue edge velocities of 2000 - 5000 @xmath3 are observed . \n recently , a number of systems have been observed in the 900 - 1185   range with . \n these show surprising diversity . in particular , although some systems do show high - velocity wind emission from s vi and o vi , it is common to see relatively narrow lines with small ( 100 @xmath3 ) blue - shifts from intermediate ionization states @xcite . \n the velocity widths of these lines are too narrow for either the disk or the high - velocity outflow represented by c iv in the  range . \n shortly after winds were first discovered in cvs , observations of eclipsing systems showed changes in profiles shapes that indicate substantial rotation , suggesting a disk origin for the outflow @xcite . \n consequently , our basic picture of the high - velocity winds is of a bi - conical flow emanating from the inner disk . \n @xcite were the first to attempt to model the profile shapes of wind lines as observed in high state cvs in terms of a kinematic prescription for a bi - conical wind . \n they found that the -derived ( r=200 ) c  iv profiles of three systems  rw sex , rw tri , and v sge \n could be reproduced with moderately collimated winds with mass - loss rates ( @xmath4 ) of order 10% of the disk accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) and terminal velocities of 1 - 3 times the escape velocity at the footpoint of each streamline . \n subsequently , @xcite succeeded , using a different parametrization for a bi - conical flow , in reproducing the c  iv profile of ux uma though an eclipse as observed at r=2000 with /ghrs . \n this analysis was the first attempt to model changes in the profile through eclipse , and suggested , at least in ux uma , the existence of a relatively dense , high - column - density , slowly outflowing transition region between the disk photosphere and the fast moving wind . \n recently , my collaborators and i have developed a new monte carlo radiative transfer code that invokes a sobolev approximation with escape probabilities to follow photons through an axially symmetric wind . \n `` python '' is designed to produce a complete spectrum of disk dominated cvs @xcite . \n emission sources include the disk , the wd , a boundary layer and the wind itself . \n the flow geometry is defined either in terms of the parametrization of @xcite or @xcite . \n the code consists of two separate monte carlo radiative transfer calculations . in the first \n , the ionization structure of the wind is calculated using a modified on - the - spot approximation . in the second , \n a detailed spectrum is calculate for a specific wavelength range of interest . \n a fair summary of progress to date is as follows : mc methods , such as python , can be used to obtain spectral verisimilitude to individual lines fairly easily . \n an example of this is shown in fig . \n [ ixvel_hut ] . \n systematic searches are now needed to determine whether one can actually model all the lines with a single wind geometry , and to determine how well one can do on average . \n several of us are beginning this effort . \n if this effort is successful , we will be able to determine the basic parameters , such as the mass - loss rate , degree of collimation , and ionization state , of the winds of high state cvs . until this is done , it is difficult to address many of the physical questions that need to be answered , including whether the wind is radiatively - driven , as is usually assumed . \n the observational and theoretical evidence for this is murky . \n if the wind is radiatively driven , one would expect that the wind lines would be strongest when systems are brightest . but @xcite found no correlation between the strength of wind features and continuum brightness in /stis observations of two nova - like variables , ix vel and v3885 sgr . and @xcite and @xcite have argued that the luminosities of cv disks are at best marginally sufficient to accelerate a high - velocity wind . \n hydrodynamical simulations of radiatively - driven cv winds have recently been carried out , but comparisons of the theoretical predictions to observations have produced mixed results ( see e.g. * ? ? ? \n thus , alternative wind - driving mechanisms must be ( re)considered instead of , or in addition to , radiation pressure . \n these include viscous heating of the upper disk atmosphere @xcite , and irradiation of the disk @xcite as well as magneto - centrifugal forces leading to constant angular velocity rotation out to the alfvn surface @xcite . \n knowledge of the kinematic structure of the wind would be a strong discriminant between them . \n the appearance of quiescent systems is quite different from those in outburst , and fairly varied . at one extreme are systems , such as u gem , with  spectra ( fig . \n [ ugem_sscyg ] ) characterized by broad lyman absorption lines and narrower metal absorption features . \n these systems can be modelled , sometimes in great detail , with synthetic spectra of metal enriched wd - photospheres . \n the metal enrichment is understood to be a result of on - going accretion . at the other extreme \n are systems dominated by broad , fairly symmetric emission features . \n spectra of ss cyg , also shown in fig . \n [ ugem_sscyg ] , provide a good examples of this type a system . \n the dominant continuum emission in these systems is not well - understood , although the lines almost surely arise from the disk ( see , e. g. * ? ? ? \n since in quiescence the bulk of the disk is cold and unionized , explanations typically involve surface layers of the disk or a chromosphere , heated via x - ray illumination or magnetic flares in the disk . \n the emission region is unlikely to be optically thick in the continuum since that would limit the physical size of the emitting region to that of the wd . \n most systems , e.g. vw hyi @xcite , lie between the two extremes , with contributions from the wd and from the `` second component '' . \n the basic questions one would like to answer about quiescent systems depends on the nature of the emission . for the wd systems , one would first of all like to establish the fundamental parameters  temperature , radius , abundances , rotation rate , gravitational redshift  of the wd . \n in addition , one would like to explore the effects of accretion onto the wd . \n for the other systems , one would like to understand the real nature of the `` second component '' and what it implies about the structure of the disk ( and the nature of the wd ) .     of about 40,000k to 30,000k . \n [ ugem_sscyg],title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] of about 40,000k to 30,000k . \n [ ugem_sscyg],title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=240 ]    as an example , i would like to describe the analysis of multiple fuv spectra that were obtained of wz sge following its outburst in july 2001 @xcite . \n wz sge , at 42 pc , is the closest known cv , and possibly the closest accretion disk system . among cvs , \n wz sge has one of the shortest binary periods ( 88 m ) , and one of the longest interoutburst periods ( 20 - 30 yrs ) . \n and  observations during the outburst showed a high excitation spectrum dominated by broad o vi , nv , and c iv features , consistent with the high ( 75@xmath5 ) system inclination @xcite . following the outburst , \n the spectrum acquired the characteristics of a wd - dominated system ( fig . \n [ wzsge ] ) . from 2001 \n september to 2003 march , the spectra show a steady decline in the flux , a steady decrease in the color temperature , and a gradual increase in the width of , all of which are consistent with a long term cooling of a wd . \n a detailed analysis shows that @xmath6 declined from 24,300 in 2002 october to 15,900 k in march 2003 . \n the flux level in 2003 was still well above that of the pre - outburst system , indicating that the wd was still cooling . assuming a normal wd mass - radius relationship and a distance of 42 pc \n , it was possible to show that all of the post - outburst spectra are consistent with a wd mass of 0.9 , as had been inferred previously by more indirect means . \n this result is interesting in part , because in some other systems ( e.g u gem ) , simple 1-t models do not produce constant radius with time , which has lead to suggestions of non - uniform surface temperatures of the wd or a declining `` second component '' .      following the 2001 outburst @xcite . [ wzsge],title=\"fig : \" ]    one of the puzzles in the case of wz sge \n is why the post - outburst energy release has been so large ; the post - outburst excess energy release is roughly 15% of the outburst energy . \n there are two basic possibilities . \n first , there could be on - going accretion . \n this is consistent with the fact that we continue to see metal lines in wz sge . \n the time scale for metals to settle in a wd are of order a few days . \n therefore , if the metal lines in wz sge arise from the photosphere , then there must be ongoing accretion . \n secondly , the wz sge outburst both heated and left the wd with extra mass on its surface , leaving the wd out of equilibrium . \n the interior of the star has to respond to these facts , through a process known as compression heating . \n @xcite argued that the cooling that is observed in wz sge could be modelled either as a 1.2 wd which accreted at during the outburst with no accretion afterward , or with a 1 wd accreting at during the outburst and following the outburst . \n the latter possibility is most consistent with other known facts about wz sge . \n the spectra obtained with , , and hut represent qualitative improvements over those that could be obtained with . for the high state spectra , \n the surprise in the spectra is the plethora of lower ionization state narrower lines , especially in higher inclination systems . \n these lines most likely arise from a transition region between the disk and the high velocity wind , another indication that this zone can not be ignored . with it was clear that wds emission dominated the emission from some low state spectra . with  and , it is possible to model not only the temperature evolution of wds , but to determine abundances in the photosphere and to begin to characterize the second component in the emission . \n the existing spectra demonstrate the importance of multiple observations of individual systems . sadly , unless a servicing mission provides  with a revived uv spectroscopic capability or the operations staff \n are able to restore  to operational status , the prospects for obtaining new spectra are modest . \n acknowledgement : this work was supported by nasa through grants associated with analyses of  and  spectra of cvs , specifically go-9357 and go-9791 from the space telescope science institute , and nag5 - 13706 and nag5 - 13717 directly from nasa .", "StartTimeOffset": 330259379623, "RequestID": "0938c531dffc9a8fa87455fd18fc51cc92ef2d08", "TotalTokens": 3446}

tools to derive a fundamental limit on the minimum probability of error of an arbitrary scheme . \n a comparison indicates that although our scheme outperforms the existing ones , its error exponent ( in terms of transmission power ) is larger than our fundamental lower bound , suggesting room for further improvement . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . \n proposed modulation scheme and system model are described in section ii . in section iii performance of different modulation techniques are discussed . \n also in this section a more general molecular communication system is introduced for which a lower bound on probability of error is computed . \n lastly numerical results are presented in section iv . \n the concentration shift keying ( csk ) scheme is inspired by the amplitude shift keying ( ask ) used in the classical communication . in this scheme , \n symbols are encoded in the number of molecules that the transmitter diffuses ; this is called _ diffusion rate _ or _ \n transmission power_. for example , to represent @xmath0 bits , @xmath1 different molecule diffusion rates are utilized . at the receiver , \n the concentration ( number of the received molecules ) is compared with decision thresholds in order to decode the transmitted symbol . \n the molecules from the previous symbol in the last time slot may hit the receiver in the current time slot . \n thus , to reduce the effect of the interference in this method , decision thresholds for the current symbol need to be adapted to the last decoded symbol . \n molecular shift keying ( mosk ) scheme resembles the orthogonal modulation in the classical communications . to transmit @xmath0 bits per time slot , \n @xmath1 different types of molecule are utilized . \n the transmitter releases a specified number of molecules of the type corresponding to the current input symbol . to decode the transmitted signal at a certain time slot \n , the receiver looks for a unique molecule type whose concentration exceeds a certain threshold @xmath2 . \n an error occurs if the concentration of none of the molecule types or more than one molecule type exceeds @xmath2 . \n although interference due to the previous transmission in mosk is less than that in the csk , but it still exists . also using different molecule types complicates the hardware structure at both the transmitter and the receiver as the number of molecule types increases exponentially with @xmath0 . \n the performance of both the mosk and csk schemes is degraded by the interference caused by molecules of previous transmissions . \n in addition csk suffers from propagation of errors since the thresholds for each time slot is adapted to the previously decoded symbols . \n therefore , if the previous symbol is falsely decoded , its error leaks to the current symbol . \n our scheme borrows ideas from csk and mosk . having molecules of types @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the transmitter uses type @xmath3 in odd time slots , and type @xmath4 in even time slots . \n the use of two molecule types resembles mosk but the difference is that the molecule type is not used for signalling . to convey information in each time slot , \n different diffusion rates are used ( similar to csk ) . \n thus , to match each symbol to @xmath0 bits , @xmath1 different propagation rates are utilized in each time slot . as the molecule types are different in two subsequent time slots , ( i ) the previous symbol interference has almost disappeared ( ii ) the decision threshold of the current symbol is independent of the last decoded symbol . since the data is not encoded in the molecule types ( but in the concentrations ) \n , the number of molecule types ( and as a result the complexity ) , does not increase with @xmath0 . \n we refer to this scheme as molecular - concentration shift keying ( mocsk ) . \n in this section we develop a model for a general molecular transmission . \n later we use this model to compare probabilities of error of mosk , csk and mocsk . \n it is assumed that the symbols are transmitted in equal time slots called symbol duration , @xmath5 . \n generally the signal is decoded based on the concentration of molecule types received during a time slot . \n we assume that in a time slot three sources contribute to the received molecules of a specific type : ( i ) molecules due to transmission in the current time slot ( ii ) the residue molecules due to transmission in the last time slot ( the residue molecules from two or more earlier time slots are ignored ) ( iii ) the molecules from other sources as the noise of environment . \n more precisely , each molecule either misses hitting the receiver , or hits the receiver in the current or next time slot . \n let the hitting probabilities in the current and next time slot be @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ( @xmath8 ) . \n we assume intra - molecule collisions have little effect on the molecule s movement .    for each molecule type \n , the transmitter has a storage . \n every storage has an outlet whose size controls how many molecules can exit the storage to be diffused in the environment . \n the distribution of the number of molecules that exit from the storage in a time slot is poisson . \n this follows from the fact that the number of molecules in the storage is large and probability of each passing through the outlet is small . \n we use @xmath9 to denote the number of molecules exiting the storage ( and diffused in the environment ) . \n the parameter @xmath10 is called the diffusion rate and is determined by the size of the opening of the outlet . \n parameter @xmath10 itself is a random variable that is decided by the transmitter based on the message it wishes to transmit . \n assume that the transmitter has chosen diffusion rates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a molecule type like @xmath13 in two consecutive time slots in a modulation scheme . also , consider the environmet noise independent of the source signal as a poisson noise with parameter @xmath14 . \n considering hitting probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and using the thinning property of poisson and the fact that sum of independent poisson rv s is itself a poission , the number of type @xmath13 molecules received within the current time slot ( denoted by @xmath15 ) follows a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath16 where @xmath17 . \n this poisson model has advantages over the binomial model considered in @xcite : ( i ) the poisson model is more realistic and practical in comparison with the binomial model . \n for instance , in binomial model the transmitter needs to count the number of molecules that it diffuses in comparison with the poisson model in which the size of the storage s outlet is controlled ( without counting the exact number of molecule passing through the outlet ) . \n ( ii ) the poisson model is easier to work with analytically because of the nice properties of poisson ( e.g. thinning property , etc . ) .      in the csk method , only one type of molecule for instance @xmath13 is used in all time slots . \n so , the decoding is made by comparing the number of received molecules , i.e. @xmath15 , with the thresholds determined based on the last decoded symbol .    in mosk , as information is encoded in molecule type , if two subsequent symbols are the same , only one molecule type for instance @xmath3 is received , otherwise two molecule types for instance @xmath3 from the current symbol and @xmath4 type from the previous symbol are received . in the former case , \n the symbol is decoded correctly if the total sum of received molecules , i.e. @xmath18 , exceeds the threshold @xmath2 . in the latter \n , decision is made based on @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the threshold @xmath2 .    in the proposed mocsk scheme , as stated above , 2 different types of molecules in 2 subsequent time slots are used . \n as the receiver knows the type of the current symbol , it needs only to compare the number of the molecules of this type with the thresholds to decode the current symbol . \n we now compute the average probability of error for csk , mosk and mocsk .    as in @xcite \n , we only consider the class of simple symbol - by - symbol decoders that are practically appealing . \n comparisons are made consistently for decoders in this class with the same transmission powers . \n for binary csk ( bcsk ) using molecules of type @xmath13 , if the current input symbol is @xmath20 and the last transmitted and decoded symbols are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , the probability of successful decoding is computed as@xmath23where @xmath24 is the decoded current symbol and @xmath25 is the decision threshold corresponding to the value of @xmath22 . \n note that in this equation , @xmath22 is not necessarily equal to the previous transmitted symbol , i.e. @xmath21 . in fact , the decision threshold for the current symbol is determined based on the previous decoded symbol regardless of being decoded correctly or not \n .    for binary mosk ( bmosk ) , assume molecules type @xmath3 and @xmath4 are sent for 0 and 1 , respectively . \n for the current transmitted symbol of @xmath20 , probability of successful decoding for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are computed as follows : + @xmath28 for the proposed binary mocsk ( bmocsk ) , if the molecules of type @xmath13 is used in the current slot , the probability of successful decoding can be computed as follows : @xmath29these conditional probabilities for quaternary and higher modulation level cases can be calculated similarly . \n let @xmath30 be the error event . for bcsk , the average probability of error is equal to @xmath31 . as the decoding of the current symbol is dependent on \n both the last transmitted and decoded symbols in bcsk , we have:@xmath32when @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the probability that the previous symbol @xmath21 is falsely decoded to @xmath22 and can be substituted by @xmath35 . \n so when @xmath36 , @xmath34 will be equal to @xmath37 . therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be computed recursively from ( [ eq : a ] ) which is a system of linear equations . for qcsk ( and higher ) levels , \n the probability of error can be computed similarly . for the mosk , \n the decoding of the current symbol is independent of the previous decoded symbol , i.e. @xmath22 . \n therefore , @xmath40 is obtained as @xmath41    for the proposed mocsk , since the decoding of the current symbol is independent of both the transmitted and previous decoded symbols , @xmath40 is computed as follows @xmath42      in order to determine how well the modulation schemes considered above are , we examine a general molecular communication system with two molecule types @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a memory of only one symbol at the decoder ( since we are considering the class of simple and practical symbol - by - symbol decoders only ) . \n let @xmath43 be the @xmath44 input symbol ( assumed to be i.i.d . and \n uniform rv s over a set @xmath45 ) . \n the encoder uses @xmath46 to determine the diffusion rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 of molecules of type @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively at the @xmath44 time slot . \n thus the actual number of molecules that are diffused would follow independent poisson distributions with parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 . using the thinning property of poisson , the distribution of the numbers of molecules of type @xmath51 \n , @xmath52 received at the receiver in the @xmath44 time slot is @xmath53 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath14 are defined in section ii - c . \n the current input symbol is decoded as @xmath54 based on the @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( the previous decoded symbol ) . \n the average probability of error is : @xmath57using the following lemma , a lower bound on @xmath40 is derived . + * lemma 1 . \n * @xmath58 is bounded from above as follows : @xmath59    the following chain of inequalities proves ( [ eq : lemma]).@xmath60    inequality ( a ) holds because @xmath54 is function of @xmath61 ; ( b ) holds as @xmath56 does not provide further information about @xmath62 conditioned on @xmath63 . equality ( c ) holds because @xmath62 is independent of previous message bits . \n ( d ) holds because of the markov chain @xmath64 .    using the well - known trick of taking a random index @xmath65 uniformly distributed on @xmath66 and independent of previously defined rv s \n , one can show @xmath67 , and the statement of lemma 1 for random index @xmath65 instead of fix index @xmath68 . \n considering constraints @xmath69 and @xmath70\\leq r_{av}$ ] using the upper bounds on the discrete poisson channels derived in @xcite if @xmath71 $ ] we have : @xmath72and if @xmath73 @xmath74where @xmath75 tends to @xmath76 when @xmath77 tends to infinity and @xmath78 is the solution of @xmath79 . denoting the rhs of the upper bound inequality ( [ eq : d ] ) or ( [ eq : e ] ) by @xmath80 , and using the upper bound in ( [ eq : lemma ] ) we have , \n @xmath81using the fano s inequality , @xmath82 and the convexity of entropy function , we obtain : @xmath83where @xmath84 is the size of the alphabet of variable @xmath62 . \n this inequality gives a lower bound on the average probability of error . \n our analysis also extends to @xmath85 types of molecules in a straightforward way ; it is omitted due to lack of space . \n for numerical evaluations , we have assumed the distance between transmitter and receiver and time slot duration are @xmath86 and @xmath87 sec . respectively and hence the probabilities of hitting as @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( unless explicitly stated otherwise as in the description of two of the curves in fig 1 ) @xcite . \n also , we have considered @xmath90 . \n 1(top ) shows the plots of the probability of error versus the average transmission power ( diffusion rate ) per bit for binary and quaternary csk , mosk and proposed mocsk modulations . \n this figure shows that bmocsk substantially outperforms the bmosk , with two types of molecules being employed in the two schemes . \n for the quaternary level , as expected , mosk with more complicated transmitter and receivers employing four molecule types , yields a better performance compared to the proposed quaternary mocsk ( qmocsk ) that uses only two molecules types . \n the same results hold for the radio communication as well , where m - ary orthogonal modulation substantially outperforms m - ary amplitude modulation for @xmath91 , at the cost of higher complexity . \n also , fig . \n 1(top ) shows that mocsk outperforms csk scheme in binary and higher levels . \n further this improvement becomes more significant as we increase the hitting probability @xmath7 . to illustrate this , \n probability of error of csk has been plotted for @xmath92 in binary and quaternary levels in the fig . \n 1(top ) . increasing @xmath7 results in more interference from the previous symbol , thus degrading the csk performance . generally speaking , as the decoding of the current symbol in the mocsk is independent of both the previous transmitted and decoded symbols , this scheme outperforms the csk and mosk schemes in a fair comparison . \n 1(bottom ) compares the probability of error of the proposed bmocsk and the lower bound derived in ( [ eq : lb ] ) versus the maximum transmission power . in the bmocsk , @xmath93 and \n 2 molecule types are used . for a fair comparison , \n the lower bound has been computed for @xmath94 , @xmath93 and @xmath95 . \n it is observed that the gap between the lower bound and the proposed scheme increases rapidly . to see how the lower bound changes with increasing @xmath84 , the lower bound has been also plotted for @xmath96 and @xmath94 .", "StartTimeOffset": 347207502749, "RequestID":

? ? \n * ) . however , since we are now interested in astrophysical variations on @xmath36 hours timescales , this practice risks accidentally cleaning the light curves of outbursts . a more sophisticated approach \n to mitigating the effects of differential extinction should be employed for this reason . \n an effort to carefully reanalyze archival observations of davs for evidence of outbursts is currently underway .    _ \n k2 _ continues to visit new fields every @xmath080 days , increasing the number of objects that we have such extensive data for . \n since outbursts seem to be a fairly common phenomenon in davs , we expect to continue to find new outbursters in upcoming data releases .    in the long term \n , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) promises to observe thousands of outbursting davs , each with at least @xmath01000 visits across six photometric filters . \n we anticipate that this survey will capture a fairly complete picture of outburst statistics and that the color information will reveal the temperature evolution of these events . \n real - time transient alerts from lsst will enable rapid photometric and spectroscopic follow - up of outbursts in progress . \n , m.h.m . , and d.e.w . \n acknowledge support from nsf grant ast-1312983 , the kepler cycle 4 go proposal 11-kepler11 - 0050 , and nasa grant nnx13ac23 g . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through hubble fellowship grant # hst - hf2 - 51357.001-a , awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 . \n this work includes data collected by the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ missions . \n funding for the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ missions is provided by the nasa science mission directorate . \n bell , k.  j. , hermes , j.  j. , bischoff - kim , a. , et al . \n 2015 , , 809 , 14 bell , k.  j. , hermes , j.  j. , montgomery , m.  h. , et al . \n 2016 , , 829 , 82 hermes , j.  j. , montgomery , m.  h. , bell , k.  j. , et al . \n 2015 , , 810 , l5 hermes , j.  j. , mullally , f. , stensen , r.  h. , et al .  2011 , , 741 , l16 howell , s.  b. , sobeck , c. , haas , m. , et al . \n 2014 , , 126 , 398 nather , r.  e. , winget , d.  e. , clemens , j.  c. , hansen , c.  j. , & hine , b.  p.  1990 \n , , 361 , 309 van grootel , v. , dupret , m .- a . , fontaine , g. , et al . \n 2012 , , 539 , a87 wu , y. , & goldreich , p.  2001 \n , , 546 , 469", "StartTimeOffset": 385435899755, "RequestID": "74fc7fa80fdef9c2d60db3fb544c7e4b92cc8e1e", "TotalTokens": 3188}
{"ContextTokens": 3262, "GeneratedTokens": 276, "SynthesizedBody": "in early 2001 , the hubble space telescope obtained the deepest data set ever observed for a globular cluster , an exposure of 123 orbits centered on a field 5@xmath1 from the center of the globular cluster m4 . \n we reported analysis of the lower main sequence of m4 ( richer et al . \n 2002 ) and a determination of the white dwarf cooling age of m4 ( hansen et al . \n the latter is derived from a @xmath2 fit of models to the entire white dwarf luminosity function . \n the derived age of 12.7@xmath3 ( @xmath4 statistical error only ) is consistent with other age determinations for old star clusters , and with the _ wmap _ concordance cosmology age ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .    in a recent contribution \n , de marchi , paresce , straniero and moroni ( 2003 ) performed a reanalysis of the long exposure data from our hst project go-8679 ( richer et al . \n 2002 , hansen et al . 2002 ) and were unable to reproduce results similar to ours . \n in particular their photometry failed to reach as faint as ours by almost a full magnitude . \n this can be seen quite dramatically in figure 1 where we plot our cmd in the white dwarf region from this data set and that of de marchi et al . \n taken from their paper . \n continuing , the authors claim that the only possible age constraint for m4 is that the lower limit for the white dwarf cooling age is 9 gyr , whereas we ( hansen et al . \n 2002 ) derive a cooling age of 12.7 gyr . \n the analysis of de marchi et al . raises distressing questions about our competence both in data analysis and in interpretation . as they have already been cited by others in the literature ( e.g. , moehler et al . \n 2003 ) we believe that it becomes crucial for us to respond . \n the conflict raises two questions . \n first , why do two independent teams approaching the same data set get such different results ? \n second , what is the correct approach to fitting a measured white dwarf luminosity function ? \n we answer the first question in this contribution and the second in detail in hansen et al . \n ( 2004 , in preparation ) and illustrate how the de marchi et al . \n analysis fails on both counts . \n the reason de marchi et al . \n are unable to reproduce the depth and quality of our cmd is purely one of data treatment . \n the hst data set under consideration , go-8679 , contains 98 f606w and 148 f814w images each of exposure 1300 sec . \n a first - epoch set of images taken in f555w and f814w ( go-5461 ) were obtained by us in 1995 ( richer et al . \n 1995 , 1997 ) and were not nearly as deep . \n some care is required in getting the most out of this large and impressive data set .    in our case , after accounting for dithers , those frames corresponding to a particular epoch and filter were averaged together with pixel rejection \n the @xmath5 highest pixels being rejected to eliminate cosmic ray contamination . from the hst wfpc2 manual the mean number of pixels on a given chip affected by a cosmic ray hit in an 1800 sec exposure is about 20,000 . \n hence in a stack of @xmath6 sec exposures we expect @xmath7 pixels at a given position to have suffered a hit . \n taking the dispersion to be @xmath8 and using @xmath9 rejection we find that in combining the 98 f606w images the highest 7 pixels should be rejected while for the 148 f814w images we should eliminate the highest 9 . \n our procedure thus used 93% of the available pixels in constructing the mean . \n by contrast , de marchi et al . \n used image - association stacks produced by the pipeline software developed by the canadian astronomy data centre and the eso space - telescope coordinating facility ( micol & durand 2002 ) . \n this pipeline software essentially takes the median of the available pixel values , and is therefore less efficient in a statistical sense than the scheme we employed as described above . according to zwillinger & kokoska ( 2000 ) the efficiency of the median ranges from 1.000 for @xmath10 , 0.743 for @xmath11 , ... 0.681 for @xmath12 , to 0.637 for @xmath13 . \n hence de marchi et al . effectively used less than 2/3 of the information available in the images . \n we requested from the canadian astronomy data centre the image association stacks that were used by de marchi et al . and compared them to the combined images resulting from our analysis . after allowing for the change in image scale ( we expanded our images by a factor of three in each dimension ) \n , the main difference is that images of faint stellar objects appear perceptibly more diffuse in the pipeline generated associations . \n this has the effect of making the faintest stars difficult to detect in the images de marchi et al \n . used , exactly what is seen in figure 1 . \n we illustrate this by employing the same 2 stars de marchi et al . used to claim that objects fainter than f814w = 27.0 could not be measured on our first - epoch frames \n recall that all we seek from the first - epoch images is a position so that proper motions can be measured . \n all the photometry is carried out on the longer - exposure frames . \n for this reason most of our positional matching comes from the f606w @xmath14 f555w pair as the first - epoch exposures in f555w are actually quite long31.5 ksec . \n figure 2 displays these two images as we produced them with the stars discussed by de marchi et al . \n clearly the lower of the two is easily visible in both frames while the upper of the two is not seen in the shorter exposure first epoch . \n there is , however , a simple reason for this - it is in fact not a star at all , as our deep images clearly show it to be extended . \n this faint galaxy is thus lost in the noisier first - epoch image . some specific numbers for these two objects \n are that each is detected at a @xmath15 of about 8 on the long exposure f606w image , the upper one is not detected on the shorter f555w frame while the lower is detected at @xmath15 of about 5 . \n the lower star has a proper motion completely consistent with cluster membership and its measured magnitudes are f606w = 28.48 , f814w = 27.25 . \n it is a cluster white dwarf and as can be seen in figure 1 we are able to measure stars almost 0.5 magnitudes fainter than this one . \n one crucial point is that our experiment matches long exposures in f606w ( 127.4 ksec ) and f814w ( 192.4 ksec ) with much shorter exposures in f555w ( 31.5 ksec ) and f814w ( 7.2 ksec ) . \n the question thus arises as to how we could measure positions in the earlier epoch data for the faintest stars where the @xmath15 is obviously poor . for a star at f606w = 29.0 the expected @xmath15 ( from the hst etc ) in our deep f606w frames \n is 6.7 while a star at this magnitude on the shorter exposure f555w frames has @xmath15 = 2.5 . \n this is just about what we measured on our frames . \n the reason we can successfully measure positions of such faint objects in the first epoch are twofold .    first , we applied the finding list from the deep frames to the shallower frames . \n if the background noise in an image is gaussian , then a @xmath16 positive deviation will occur in about 6 pixels out of every 1000 . \n if , in a @xmath17 image ( neglecting the vignetted areas at the low - x and low - y sides of the wfpc2 ccds ) , we were to mark all of the @xmath16 peaks as detected astronomical objects , we would expect more than 3,000 false detections . \n however , if we consider only the area within 0.5 pixels radius of an object confidently detected in the long second - epoch exposure , we expect a probability @xmath18 of finding a positive 2.5@xmath19 deviation which is purely the result of random noise in the first - epoch image . that is to say , \n we expect of order 5 false cross - identifications for every 1000 correct re - detections . \n even at @xmath20 , presumed re - identifications will be correct 19 times out of 20 . for this reason , \n the knowledge that an actual astronomical object is present somewhere nearby based upon the long - exposure second - epoch images allows us to be confident that most of the claimed re - detections on the short - exposure first epoch images correspond to true re - detections . \n the first - epoch astrometric positions , then , while poorer than those of the second epoch , are nevertheless good enough to distinguish stars that are moving with the cluster from stars and galaxies that are not . by contrast , \n de marchi et al . made no use of this technique and hence the shorter first - epoch frames effectively set their limiting magnitude . \n we checked the above by rerunning the photometry programs on the wf3 chip using a finding list with star positions generated randomly . \n this list contained the same number of stars as the original finding list . \n we then selected the objects whose photometry had converged on all frames . the resulting proper motion displacement diagram and cmd \n is shown in figure 3 and compared with the one when the true finding list is used in figure 4 . \n there are numerous spurious faint matches in figure 3 , but almost all disappear when the match radius of 0.5 pixels is invoked . \n those objects that lie outside 0.5 pixels are likely random noise spikes which have no correlated positions between frames . \n figures 3 and 4 taken together show that false detections of noise spikes are not a serious source of contamination in our cmds and that the suggestion to the contrary by de marchi et al . \n is incorrect . \n secondly , the proper motions of the m4 stars are actually quite large ( about 1 hst pixel with respect to an extragalactic background over the 6 year time baseline ( kalirai et al . 2003 ) ) . \n while the lower @xmath15 image would not produce good enough photometry , the @xmath15 is sufficient to give the centroid , which is crucial for astrometry . in figure 5 \n we illustrate the quality of the proper motion separation between cluster and field from the long and short images . \n some of the brightest stars do not exhibit clean separation due to their near saturation . \n however , what is clear from this diagram is that most of the field objects can be easily eliminated down to very faint magnitudes ( f606w = 29.0 ) by making the generous proper motion cut within a total value of 0.5 pixel ( @xmath21 mas / yr ) of that of the mean cluster motion over the 6 year baseline of the observations . a disturbing aspect of the de marchi et al . \n paper is that nowhere do they illustrate their displacement measurements .    the analysis techniques of de marchi et al . \n compounded the effect of their somewhat lower quality images . \n their approach uses aperture photometry to measure the stellar magnitudes . \n we employ point spread function fitting , which clearly has the advantage of just using the pixels with the largest signal  thus reducing the sky contribution  a critical issue when attempting to measure faint stars . \n the effect of this is obvious even along the brighter portion of the white dwarf cooling sequence where the de marchi et al . \n diagram exhibits significantly larger scatter ( see figure 1 ) . \n further , as we mentioned above , we use the positional information from the deepest frames in carrying out the photometry on the shorter exposure frames . \n by contrast de marchi et al . made no use of this information . \n _ this has the effect of allowing the depth of the first -

{"ContextTokens": 2516, "GeneratedTokens": 114, "SynthesizedBody": "the harp experiment@xcite was designed to perform a systematic and precise study of hadron production for beam momenta between 1.5 and @xmath3 and target nuclei ranging from hydrogen to lead . \n the detector was located at cern , in the ps beam.the daq recorded 420 million events during the years 2001 and 2002 . \n the physics program of harp includes : a ) the measurement of pion yields for a variety of energies and targets relevant for he design of the proton driver of a future neutrino factory@xcite ; b ) the measurement of pion yields on low @xmath4 targets as well as on cryogenic oxygen and helium targets , useful to improve the precision of atmospheric neutrino flux calculations@xcite ; and c ) the measurement of pion and kaon yields , relevant for the calculation of the neutrino fluxes of experiments such as miniboone@xcite and k2k@xcite . \n harp ( fig . \n [ fig : harp ] ) is a large acceptance spectrometer , with two distinct regions . in the forward part of the apparatus ( up to polar angles of about 250 @xmath2 ) , \n the main tracking devices are a set of large drift chambers . \n magnetic analysis is provided by a 0.4 @xmath5 dipole magnet and particle identification relies in the combination of a threshold cherenkov detector , a time - of - flight wall and an electromagnetic calorimeter . in the rest of the solid angle \n the main tracking device is a tpc , which is complemented by a set of rpc detectors for time - of - flight measurements . \n the target is located inside the tpc . \n in addition , sophisticated beam instrumentation ( including three timing detectors and threshold cherenkov detectors ) provides identification of the incoming particle and allows the interaction time at the target to be measured . \n given the immediate interest of the miniboone and k2k experiments in a measurement of the production cross sections for pions and kaons at the energies and targets relevant for their beam setups , the harp collaboration has given priority to the analysis of those particular data sets . \n in particular , we present in this article an initial result relevant for the k2k experiment . \n specifically , we measure pion yields from proton - nucleus collisions , for a thin al target ( @xmath6 ) and a beam energy of 12.9 @xmath7 . \n the k2k neutrino beam is produced from the decay of hadrons ( primarily pions ) emanating from a @xmath8 al target , at the kek ps proton driver energies of 12.9 gev . \n further details about the motivation of this analysis can be found in ref . \n tracking of forward - going particles is done by a set of large drift chambers(ndc ) placed upstream and downstream of the dipole magnet . \n the chambers were recuperated from the nomad experiment and their properties have been described elsewhere@xcite . \n each ndc module is made of four chambers , and each chamber of three planes of wires with tilted angles @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n the single - wire efficiency is of the order of @xmath12 , and the spatial resolution approximately @xmath13 . \n the performance of the ndc is inferior to the one measured in nomad , where the hit efficiency was close to @xmath14 and the resolution approached @xmath15 . \n this is mainly due to the fact that , for harp , the ndc used a gas mixture and voltage settings different from the ones in nomad , a non - flamable gas mixture . ] .    due to the low hit efficiency , \n the algorithm used in nomad , based in building up space points ( with an efficiency of about @xmath16 ) is not viable ( for harp we would obtain @xmath17 ) . instead , the reconstruction builds @xmath18 and @xmath19 track segments in each ndc module ( 12 hits maximum ) , which are fitted to a straight line model via a kalman filter fit@xcite . \n next , the algorithm attempts all possible combinations ( which include at least a @xmath19 segment ) to connect tracking objects in the modules downstream of the dipole magnet . \n combinations such as @xmath19 + @xmath18 or even @xmath19 + hits  not  associated are valid ways to build longer , @xmath19 segments .    to measure the momentum it is necessary to connect a ( @xmath19 ) segment downstream of the dipole with at least one space point upstream of the dipole . since one can impose the constraint that all tracks emanate from the event vertex in the case of thick target \n , a vertex algorithm will provide the event vertex to a comparable precision.]this point is always known and therefore the necessary and sufficient condition for a particle emanating from the target to have its momentum measured is that a @xmath19 segment can be measured by the combination of downstream ndc chambers . \n a measurement in the first ndc module is not strictly necessary to analyse the track momentum . ideally , one would like , of course , to connect a @xmath19 segment downstream with a @xmath19 segment in the ndc1 _ and _ the vertex point . however , the tracking efficiency of the upstream module is sizeable lower than the efficiency of the downstream modules . \n this is due to , a ) a higher hit density in ndc1 and b ) the lack of redundance due to the fact that there is only a single module upstream of the dipole . \n a too restrictive condition to accept a track such as matching a @xmath19 segment upstream of the dipole with a @xmath19 segment downstream results not only in lower efficiency , but also in a systematic error , arising from the uncertainties in the hit density expected in ndc1 which would be hard to estimate ( hit density depends on factors such as track multiplicity and opening angle , which are model - dependent ) . instead , by building a track _ \n always _ when a @xmath19 segment is present downstream of the dipole , one is practically independent of the tracking efficiency in ndc1 .    in order to quantify these considerations , \n we have considered three different types of tracks , depending on the matching between the downstream and upstream modules . \n type i is a @xmath19-@xmath19 matching . \n type ii matches a @xmath19 ( downstream ) with a @xmath18 ( upstream ) . \n type iii are those where one has been unable to find either a @xmath19 or a @xmath18 segment in ndc1 and thus the track is built using the downstream modules and the vertex constraint . \n particle identification ( pid ) in the forward region of the spectrometer combines the information provided by beam detectors and three systems located downstream the dipole magnet . \n namely , a threshold cherenkov detector ( ckov ) , a time  of  flight wall ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( electron identifier , eid ) . \n these subsystems have been described in ref . \n its combined information results in good pid over the whole range of relevant momenta , as well as redundancy due to overlaps . \n pion / proton separation is provided by tof up to @xmath20 , and by the ckov above @xmath21 . \n electron / pion separation is covered by the ckov below @xmath21 and by the eid above @xmath22 . \n finally the kaon contamination can be estimated with the ckov above @xmath21 and with the ( tof ) below this energy . \n about one sixth ( 1 million events ) of the `` k2k thin target '' data has been analysed . \n the unnormalised pion production differential cross section can be computed as follows :    @xmath23 \\label{eq : cross}\\ ] ]    where the sum runs over track types ( i = @xmath19-@xmath19 , ii= @xmath19-@xmath18 , iii=@xmath19-vertex ) and the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to true and reconstructed @xmath26 bins respectively . \n @xmath27 is the geometrical acceptance , @xmath28 is the tracking efficiency , @xmath29 is the migration matrix from reconstructed bin @xmath25 to true bin @xmath24 , @xmath30 is the pion identification efficiency , @xmath31 is the pion purity and @xmath32 is the observed pion yield . \n the pion purity is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of true observed pions in the bin @xmath25 , and @xmath35 is the number of particles misidentified as pions in the same bin @xmath25 . \n that means that @xmath31 is just the probability of correct identification of a pion . the pion identification efficiency , @xmath30 is the fraction of times that a tracked pion is identified as such . \n [ fig : down_eff_p_th ] shows the spectrometer acceptance . for clarity of ilustration , \n the momentum acceptance has been computed in the region of good angular acceptance , ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and conversely , the geometrical acceptance has been computed in the region of good momentum acceptance ( @xmath38 ) . as it can be seen \n the acceptance is good for pion momenta above 1 @xmath0 , and still acceptable above @xmath39 . as illustrated in ref . \n @xcite this permits the measurement of k2k neutrino fluxes up to @xmath40 , which amply covers the energy region where the atmospheric oscillation affects the neutrino spectrum maximally . \n the angular acceptance is also very well matched to k2k physics requirement .    the tracking efficiency is shown in fig . \n [ fig : track_eff_mc1_normalized_p_th ] as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . \n the contributions of track types i , ii and iii are normalized individually , so that the total efficiency is the sum of the three . notice that the loss in efficiency at low polar angles for tracks of type i ( due to saturation effects in ndc1 ) is largely compensated by tracks of type ii and iii , so that the total tracking efficiency is rather flat . \n finally , the yield must be corrected by the pion efficiency and purity , which is computed from the data themselves , using samples of pions , protons electrons and kaons of various energies tagged with the help of the beam detectors . the pion correction factor defined as the ratio of purity over efficiency \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig : pion_corr_factor ] , for the three track types and for 1.5 , 3 and 5 gev beam particles . \n preliminary studies show an almost diagonal migration matrix , where migration is mainly due to finite momentum and angular resolutions , but not to systematic effects ( momentum and angular biases , etc ) . \n figure  [ fig : cross ] shows the pion yields as a function of momentum after succesive corrections ( e.g. , acceptance , tracking efficiency and pion correction factor ) . \n no attempt to deconvolute the data ( e.g , correct for migrations ) have been done yet , and no absolute normalization is computed . \n we have presented a preliminary analysis of one of harp data samples , corresponding to a thin al target , at beam energies of @xmath43 . \n this analysis is relevant for the k2k experiment and a first step towards an upcoming measurement of the fully corrected production cross section . \n 99 the harp collaboration , cern - spsc/2003 - 027 , spsc - p-325 for a

this is particularly true for spbs/@xmath0doradus stars that share the same typical frequency range . \n however , the data in the exodat catalog should be treated with caution ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . \n it is therefore essential to complement the space data with other ones : colour photometry and high resolution spectroscopy . \n we are in particular part of the proposal concerning the classification of stars using eso s flames instrumenti ( pi : c. neiner , lesia , meudon ) . \n before the frequency analysis , performed both with period04 @xcite and sigspec @xcite , the data set is corrected from the `` flags '' provided by the corot consortium ( saa , orbital eclipses  ) and the hot pixels . \n these latter are particularly tricky since they produce jumps of different amplitudes associated to short - time trends related to the consecutive relaxation . \n the resulting frequency analyses ( performed until the frequency has a significance of 5 in the sigspec frame ) show many frequencies related to the satellite orbit ( in particular at 2.01d@xmath3 and 13.97d@xmath3 ) together with their numerous harmonics / aliases .    once these frequencies ( more than 30 ) \n are removed , there remains a group at low frequency that is usually related to the trends ; these latter are not easily taken into account by the process . \n these trends represent therefore the main difficulty to deduce the intrinsic stellar frequency , since trends frequencies might combine with true ones , even at high values . \n figure[fig2 ] shows a typical frequency map for a hybrid @xmath0doradus star . \n the hybrid status of the star is based on the presence of frequencies that are typical for @xmath0doradus stars together with much higher frequencies , above 20d@xmath3 . \n d@xmath3 ) that still represent the long - term trends of the data despite a correction using spline - functions . \n finally , the remaining frequencies should be intrinsic to the star unless some might be a combination between a real frequency and a low - one corresponding to a trend . \n note that some frequencies are in the typical @xmath0doradus domain , while others are quite high , above 20d@xmath3 . ] \n from the light curve behaviour and the frequency analysis , we are able to classify the sample of the 32 stars in different categories :    * @xmath0dor candidates : 10 ( + 3 uncertain ) * hybrid @xmath2- & @xmath1-mode pulsators : 2 * constant stars : 13 . * unclassified cases : 4 . among these 4 , one might be a rr lyrae star since both the basic and its 2 harmonics dominate the residuals . \n other cases might be related to stellar activity . \n note that these results may slightly evolve through a much powerful treatment of the different trends in particular . \n the number of hybrid should in particular increase , while the number of constant stars should decrease . \n figure[fig3 ] shows the sine - fit of the star corresponding to fig.[fig2 ] . \n in order to manage such an enormous amount of data , it is essential to develop automated procedures to take care of the flags , the trends , the outliers , and , very tricky , the jumps . up to now , \n only part of these tasks are done in an automated way . \n however , a fundamental problem is to be sure that the star is indeed a @xmath0doradus star : the frequency spectrum itself is not enough to conclude to a @xmath0doradus membership ( the confusion with spb stars is obvious ) : complementary observations are required .    in any case , ground based data are requested . indeed , in addition to the location of the star in the hr diagram , other fundamental parameters have to be obtained in order to perform modelling and consecutive asterosismic studies . \n a difficult problem , especially for @xmath0doradus stars , is the knowledge of the stellar rotation . \n indeed , what we measure is the frequency spectrum in the solar frame , that might be completely different from the real one i.e. , in the stellar frame ; the fequency shift depends on the rotation period , the azimuthal number and the whole stellar structure . even considering @xmath2-modes , and a quite low @xmath4-value ( 2 ) , a rotation frequency of 10d@xmath3 \n may shift the considered frequency by 10d@xmath3 ! therefore , the key - objects that are the hybrid stars have to be validated in the correct frame . \n thus , the case given in this paper may also be interpreted through a pure @xmath2-mode pulsator .    therefore , whereas space missions will bring fundamental insights on the precision and the quality of the temporal signal , it is essential to accompany them with complementary observations , especially in order to derive the fundamental parameters of the stars .", "StartTimeOffset": 432857602022, "RequestID": "125b0f7db31fb0642b8133b057ba5903333f4e38", "TotalTokens": 1824}

known effect of the neutrino cherenkov radiation  @xcite . \n there exists also such a well - known subtle effect as the additional energy @xmath6 acquired by a left - handed neutrino in plasma . \n this additional energy was considered in the series of papers by studenikin et al . \n @xcite as a new kinematical possibility to allow the radiative neutrino transition @xmath1 . \n the effect was called the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath7 ) , and later the similar effect `` spin light of electron '' ( @xmath8 ) was discovered . for unknown reasons , the photon dispersion in medium providing in part the photon effective mass , was ignored in these papers . \n however , it is evident that a kinematical analysis based on the additional neutrino or electron energy in matter ( caused by the weak forces ) when the matter influence on the photon dispersion ( caused by electromagnetic forces ) is ignored , can not be considered as a physical approach . \n similarly , in the @xmath8 effect the authors  @xcite considered the matter influence on electron by the weak forces and ignored the electromagnetic interaction , taking the unphysical case of a pure neutron medium . \n it should be noted that even in the conditions of a cold neutron star , the fraction of electrons and protons can not be exacly zero , @xmath9  @xcite . moreover , even if this unphysical case of a pure neutron medium is considered , one should take into account the electromagnetic interaction of electrons with the magnetic moments of neutrons , which can be much more intensive than the weak interaction effects . \n a consistent analysis of the radiative neutrino spin flip transition in medium was performed in our papers  @xcite , where the medium influence both on the photon and neutrino dispersion was taken into account . \n it was shown that the threshold arose in the process , caused by the photon ( plasmon ) effective mass . \n this threshold left no room for the so - called `` spin light of neutrino '' and `` spin light of electron '' in the real astrophysical situations . \n in the series of papers  @xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations including the effective matter potentials .    in this paper , we remind the basic points of our criticism upon the @xmath7 effect , and give some comments on the method of exact solutions  @xcite . \n as it was already mentioned , the effect of the `` spin light of neutrino '' proposed in  @xcite was based on the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 induced by the medium influence . \n just this additional energy provides an effective mass squared @xmath10 to the left - handed neutrino , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino four - momentum in medium , while @xmath13 would form the neutrino four - momentum in vacuum , @xmath14 . \n it will be further seen that the neutrino vacuum mass @xmath15 , a great attention was paid to in the @xmath7 analysis  @xcite , may safely be neglected . \n given a @xmath16 interaction , caused by the neutrino magnetic moment , the left - handed neutrino effective mass @xmath17  ( [ eq : effective_mass ] ) would open a kinematical possibility for the process @xmath18 , if the photon effective mass is less than @xmath17 .    basing the consideration of the `` spin light of neutrino '' on the additional left - handed neutrino energy , the authors  @xcite , nevertheless , did not analyse this value in detail . \n the expression for this additional energy of a left - handed neutrino with the flavor @xmath19 was obtained in the local limit of the weak interaction  @xcite , see also ref . \n @xcite , and can be presented in the following form @xmath20 ,   \\label{eq : enulgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath21 are the number densities of background electrons , protons , neutrons , and neutrinos , and @xmath22 are the densities of the corresponding antiparticles . to find the additional energy for antineutrinos , one should change the total sign in the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) .    as is seen from eq . \n ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) , this value becomes zero in the charge - symmetric plasma . \n this means that the local limit of the weak interaction does not describe comprehensively the additional neutrino energy in plasma , and the non - local weak contribution must be taken into account . \n the analysis of this contribution was first performed for the conditions of the early universe  @xcite .    the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma , which is identical for both neutrinos and antineutrinos , \n can be presented in the form @xmath23 ,   \\label{eq : w_nloc}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy of a neutrino propagating through plasma , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the averaged energies of plasma neutrinos and electrons correspondingly . in a particular case of a charge \n symmetric hot plasma , this expressions reproduces the result of refs . \n @xcite : @xmath27 the minus sign in  ( [ eq : w_early ] ) unambiguously shows that in the early universe the process of the radiative spin - flip transition is forbidden both for neutrinos and antineutrinos . \n the absolute value of the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) grows with the neutrino energy . \n it means that this contribution can be essential at ultra - high neutrino energies . \n to show manifestly that the case considered in the papers by studenikin et al . \n @xcite , with taking the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 in plasma and ignoring the photon dispersion , was really unphysical , let us consider the region of integration for the @xmath28 conversion width . in fig . \n [ fig : disp ] , the photon vacuum dispersion line @xmath29 is inside the allowed kinematical region ( left plot ) , but the plasma influenced photon dispersion curve appears to be outside , if the neutrino energy is not large enough ( right plot ) . \n conversion width with the fixed initial neutrino energy @xmath24 is inside the slanted rectangle shown by dashed line . \n the vacuum photon dispersion ( if the medium influence is ignored ) is shown by bold line in the left plot . \n the photon dispersion curve in plasma is shown by bold line in the right plot . \n , scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for the fixed plasma parameters , the threshold neutrino energy @xmath30 exists for coming of the dispersion curve into the allowed kinematical region . even for the interior of a neutron star this threshold \n neutrino energy is rather large : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the plasmon frequency . \n one could hope that the `` spin light of neutrino '' may be possible at ultra - high neutrino energies . \n however , in this case the local limit of the weak interaction is incomplete , and the non - local weak contribution into additional neutrino energy @xmath6 must be taken into account . \n this contribution has always a negative sign , and its absolute value grows with the neutrino energy . \n one could only hope that the window arises in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath33 . \n for example , in the solar interior there is no window for the process with electron neutrinos at all . \n a more detailed analysis of this subject was performed in our papers  @xcite . \n to construct the amplitudes of the fermion spin - flip conversion processes @xmath0 , it is necessary to know the solutions of the dirac equation including the matter effects . in the series of papers \n @xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations in matter . \n first of all , there is some progress in the last papers  @xcite with respect to the @xmath7 effect . \n namely , the five completely unphysical regions of parameters , which were discussed in details in the previous papers , are removed from the analysis , and only one case of an ultra - high neutrino energy is considered . \n however , an essential threshold effect is still not mentioned at all . \n an incorrect statement is repeated in  @xcite that our results  @xcite for the case of an ultra - high neutrino energy exactly reproduce the results of the authors  @xcite . \n in fact , the width for the process @xmath18 obtained in our papers  @xcite had much more general form being valid for arbitrary neutrino energies above the threshold , while the process width presented in  @xcite could be valid for the neutrino energies much greater than the threshold .    as in the previous papers , the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma is not taken into account in  @xcite , while it is essential at ultra - high neutrino energies . without this non - local weak contribution , the dirac equation in medium for a neutrino is approximate by definition , and the term of an `` exact solution '' becomes dubious .    making an attempt of constructing a new approach to the description of the neutrino and electron processes in matter , the authors  @xcite refer to the method of exact solutions developed for the processes in a strong external electromagnetic field . \n however , it is not a good justification . the strong field influence on the properties of charged particles is the essential non - perturbative effect where the analysis of the quantum processes , based just on exact solutions , is required . on the other hand , the matter influence on the neutrino and electron processes due to \n the weak interaction is essentially perturbative in any conceivable astrophysical conditions . \n moreover , the explicit form of the modified dirac equation is rather simple in the low - energy approximation only , when the modification is caused by the additional left - handed neutrino energy in the form  ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) calculated in the local limit of the weak interaction . as it was mentioned above , for high neutrino energies the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) growing linearly with the neutrino energy , \n appears to be essential . and \n even this non - local term  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) is nothing but the result of the expansion of the @xmath6-boson propagator over the parameter @xmath34 . \n it is obvious that such an expansion has a physical sence for the neutrino energies @xmath35 tev . \n so , if one pretends to describe the additional left - handed neutrino energy in matter for the neutrino energies much higher the threshold energy  ( [ eq : threshold ] ) , an exact calculation is required without expanding the @xmath6-boson propagator . in this case \n the modified dirac equation should take the form of the integro - differential equation . \n without such an analysis , speculations on exact solutions of the modified dirac equation in matter have no ground . \n * we have shown that an approach based on a subtle effect of the medium influence on the neutrino dispersion , when the much more significant influence of the same medium on the photon dispersion is ignored , has no physical sense . * with the photon dispersion taken into account , the threshold neutrino energy exists for the process @xmath18 , which is very large . \n * at ultra -

{"ContextTokens": 4046, "GeneratedTokens": 113, "SynthesizedBody": "dwarf novae ( hereafter dne ) are cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) characterized by periodic outbursts , lasting few days , followed by longer periods of quiescence lasting from few weeks to several months . \n these outbursts ( see cannizzo 1993 and references therein ) are originated by cyclic instabilities in the accretion disk surrounding a hot white dwarf ( wd ) or subdwarf . \n z cam stars form a subclass of dne in the sense that they are characterized by outburst ` standstills ' ( see warner 1995 ) , i.e. by prolonged phases in which their luminosity is halfway between maximum and quiescence . according to osaki ( 1996 ) , in these systems \n the mass transfer rate from the secondary is very close to the limit at which the accretion rate from the secondary ceases to trigger periodic instability episodes in the accretion disk and maintains the disk in a stable state ( frank et al . \n according to the observations , z cam stars are above the period gap ( warner 1995 ) . \n v1101 aql is listed in the _ general catalog of variable stars _ ( kholopov 1987 ) as an irregular variable , although richter ( 1961 ) stated that this object was an rr lyr star . on the contrary , meinunger ( 1965 ) , vogt & bateson ( 1982 ) and \n downes & shara ( 1993 ) classified it as a z cam - type dn . \n this would be confirmed by the observations of pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) , which noticed that the star shows an ultraviolet excess , generally varies in the @xmath0 band between magnitudes 13.8 and 14.8 and has ` algol  like fadings ' down to magnitude @xmath5 ( these might possibly be observations made during the quiescent phase ) . actually , they classified v1101 aql as a cv . \n the same conclusion was reached by downes et al . \n ( 1995 ) from the analysis of spectra acquired on september 1992 and on august 1994 , when the object was at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . \n however , it should be noted that the latter authors find some spectral similarities between v1101 aql and the class of herbig ae / be stars .    in this paper \n we present high  time resolution photometry of v1101 aql obtained on september 1993 and on july 1996 , together with a spectrum secured on june 1996 . \n section 2 will describe the employed instruments and the reduction techniques , sect . \n 3 will analyse the spectrophotometric data and sect . 4 \n will discuss the results . \n finally , sect . \n 5 will draw our conclusions . \n the images of v1101 aql are divided into two data sets . \n the first one has been acquired on september 10 , 1993 with the 0.9 m dutch telescope at la silla . \n this run was composed of 71 @xmath1 and 3 @xmath0 frames . \n the second data set was obtained on july 13 and 14 , 1996 with the 1.2 m telescope of the asiago astrophysical observatory : here , 58 @xmath1 , 2 @xmath0 and 2 @xmath2 frames were collected . \n table 1 reports the log of the observations .    ccccc + date & telescope & filter & number & exp . \n times + & & or passband & of frames & ( minutes ) + & eso 0.9 m dutch & @xmath8 & 3,71 & 2,3 + & asiago 1.20 m & @xmath9 & 2,32,2 & 3 to 10 + & asiago 1.20 m & @xmath1 & 26 & 5 to 10 +   + & asiago 1.80 m & 35006000 & 1 & 30 +    after the standard cleaning procedure for bias and flat field , the frames were processed with daophot ii ( stetson 1987 ) and _ allstar _ inside midas . \n magnitude calibration was performed using the secondary photometric sequence ( stars 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) established by misselt ( 1996 ) . \n the typical error on photometry is @xmath100.02 mag . \n the internal magnitude differences of the comparison stars were nearly constant within the errors ( see fig . \n 3a , b ) : this confirms that only v1101 aql is responsible for the observed variability . \n the observation times at mid  exposure were then converted to heliocentric julian days for each magnitude measurement . \n a single spectrum of the system was taken on june 9 , 1996 with the 1.80 m telescope of the asiago observatory , equipped with a 300 grooves mm@xmath11 grating , ( wavelength range : 35006000  ) , and a slit width of 2 \" ( resolution of 4.3  / pixel ) . \n this spectrum was extracted and reduced with iraf , and calibrated in wavelength with a fe  ar lamp . \n flux calibration was performed with the spectroscopic standard feige 92 . \n on september 10 , 1993 , the mean @xmath1 magnitude of the star was 14.49 , whereas on july 1996 , it was @xmath12@xmath1@xmath13 . \n the @xmath14 color index remained constant , being 0.28 on september 1993 and 0.29 on july 1996 ; the @xmath15 was 0.16 on the night of july 13 , 1996 . \n the search for periodic light variations in the @xmath1 band has been performed with a discrete fourier transform ( dft ) algorithm .    to reduce the noise in the dft power spectrum \n , we have shifted the data points to a common magnitude level , computed by using the mean magnitude for each night . \n this could appear somewhat arbitrary , but is suggested by the fact that we are able to determine the mean luminosity of v1101 aql in both parts of the observing run since we observed the object for more than one orbital cycle ( see below ) during each night . \n the dft power spectrum of the @xmath1 data points ( fig . \n 1a ) shows a series of peaks , the most prominent being at @xmath167 cycles day@xmath11 ( = 0.144193 days , or 3@xmath4.46 ) , with a slight prevalence on its one  day alias at @xmath166 cycles day@xmath11 ( = 0.166809 days , or 4@xmath4.00 ) . \n all the peaks belong to the same family of one  day aliases and are therefore produced by the sampling of one single real periodicity of the @xmath1 lightcurve . \n we therefore applied the clean algorithm ( roberts et al . \n 1987 ) to discriminate the modulation responsible for producing the alias series . \n the results of this analysis , reported in fig . \n 1b , suggest as real period the 3@xmath4.46 modulation . as a further check \n , we subtracted this periodicity with appropriate amplitude and phase to the @xmath1 data set and computed a new dft ( fig . \n 2a ) : its power spectrum peaks at @xmath167 cycles day@xmath11 , but the power of the peak is lower than that of fig . 1a . \n we followed the same procedure using the 4@xmath4.00 modulation ( fig . \n 2b ) : in this case , the dft power spectrum is the same of fig . 1a \n but the peaks had their spectral power doubled . \n finally , we applied two least squares best  fit methods to the @xmath1 data points , i.e. the sterken s ( 1977 ) and the schneich \n lange s ( 1981 ) algorithms , and both methods indicate as best fit the periodicity at 0.144 days . \n the @xmath1 lightcurves folded with the 3@xmath4.46 and 4@xmath4.00 are shown in fig . \n 3a , b , respectively . \n all the images taken at la silla under photometric conditions ( seeing @xmath171\".5 ) seem to reveal around v1101 aql the presence of an asymmetric nebulosity , best seen in @xmath1 ( fig . \n 4a ) rather than in @xmath0 ( fig . \n this feature was not detected in the frames obtained on july 1997 frames due to poor seeing conditions .    to better disentangle the faint nebulosity from the background , we have designed , through daophot ii , the average psf using nearby field stars , and \n then we have subtracted it to the image of v1101 aql . \n the result is presented in fig . \n 5a , b : an underlying bow  shaped nebulosity is visible in @xmath1 ( fig . \n 5a ) and in @xmath0 ( fig . \n 5b ) .      the spectrum secured on june 9 , 1996 , is shown in fig \n . 6 . we can notice the balmer lines in absorption with a small emission core and , perhaps , the presence of a noisy emission of he ii at 4686  . fluxes and ew s of these lines are reported in table 2 . \n h@xmath18 is outside the spectral range as well as the absorption lines and bands of the secondary , possibly present at longer wavelengths .    the nad interstellar absorption at 5890   is also present . \n this line might be possibly contamined by the presence of he i @xmath195876 in absorption ; a double gaussian fit yields ew@xmath20  , which corresponds , according to the relation by barbon et al . ( 1990 ) , to a @xmath21 mag . this value is higher than that ( @xmath220.1 mag ) found by pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) using the ( @xmath23)/(@xmath14 ) color ratio . \n cc|cc|c spectral line & & + & em . & \n + & 7.2 & 18.7 & 1.2 & 2.9 + & 11 & 68.9 & 1.6 & 7.9 + &  & 67.9 &  & 6.8 + & 3.1 & 58.0 & 0.38 & 5.9 + & 4.9 & 81.4 & 0.62 & 7.9 + @xmath195876 &  & 1.8 &  & 0.46 + \n we can interpret the modulation in the @xmath1 lightcurve of v1101 aql as due to the orbital motion of the secondary star around the hot wd ( see warner 1995 and references therein ) . \n the uv illumination from the disk and the wd heats the inner face of the secondary and makes it brighter than the other side . \n this , combined with the orbital motion , produces a sinusoidal lightcurve with the maximum in correspondence of the superior conjunction of the secondary . \n the small amplitude of the modulation also indicates that eclipses are absent , and thus that the inclination of the system must be small . \n the periodic variation of @xmath163@xmath4.5 is consistent with the mean orbital period of z cam stars , which is always more than 3 hours ( warner 1995 ) . \n dne with these periods have early  mid m type secondaries ( ritter & kolb 1995 ) with masses around 0.30.4 @xmath24 . \n this orbital period determination can also lead us to attempt an estimate of the absolute magnitude m@xmath25 of the system and hence its distance . according to warner ( 1995 ) , \n z cam dne with orbital periods around 3@xmath4.5 should have m@xmath26 ( 1@xmath27 ) at standstill . \n if v1101 aql has , at standstill , @xmath28 , ( we assume the magnitude at quiescence to be @xmath29 ; see pastukhova & shugarov 1994 ) we derive , after taking into account the interstellar absorption in the @xmath1 band , a distance of @xmath30 pc . \n this value is about one half the previous estimate given by pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) and , together with the galactic latitude @xmath31 , implies a height on the galactic plane @xmath32 pc .      the spectrum presented in fig . \n 6 shows the presence of absorption balmer lines filled in with emissions , thus supporting , in agreement with pastukhova & shugarov ( 1994 ) , that this system might be a cv . \n concerning the asymmetric nebulosity around v1101 aql , we note that it is more visible in @xmath1 than in @xmath0 ( see fig . \n actually , simple aperture photometry gives @xmath33 and @xmath34 . \n the total angular size of the nebulosity is @xmath166 arcsecs ; this , together with our distance estimate , leads to a linear size of @xmath2210@xmath35 cm . \n we observed long  term variations of v1101 aql in @xmath1 magnitude , very likely triggered by disk activity . \n we have detected @xmath36.46 as possible orbital period of v1101 aql , with an important alias at 4@xmath4.00 . \n the secondary of a dn with such an orbital period should have m@xmath37 ( warner 1995 ) . \n this means that the @xmath1 emission of the uv  heated secondary star is about 25 times lower than that of the whole system ; i.e. , any variation coming from the secondary could modify the total @xmath1 luminosity of the system by a factor @xmath171/25 at most , corresponding to a full amplitude fluctuation of @xmath170.04 mag . \n this is smaller than the amplitude ( @xmath160.1 mag ) of the modulation in fig . \n 3a , b , then indicating an extra contribution of @xmath160.06 mag due to the uv heating of the inner face of the secondary .    the discovery of a z cam \n type dn with an orbital period just above to the 3hr upper limit of the period gap of cvs is consistent with the presence of a sharp ` luminosity bump ' , in the period  absolute magnitude plane of cvs between 3 and 3.5 hr as suggested by zangrilli et al . \n ( 1997 ) .    our results \n then , complemented with data gathered from literature , allow us to set the standstill magnitude of this z cam star close to @xmath28 and to estimate for this system a distance of about 300 pc . \n the spectrum , taken during standstill , seems to confirm the cataclysmic binary nature of v1101 aql , though the discovery of an asymmetric nebulosity , which seems to be associated to the object , does not rule out the possibility , already pointed out by downes et al . \n ( 1995 ) , that v1101 aql could be a herbig ae / be star rather than a cv . in this case , the presence of an associate nebulosity around the object is fully consistent with such a classification . \n however , due to the relatively poor seeing conditions ( @xmath161\".5 ) , we can not rule out that the image of v1101 aql has been contamined by a background object . \n the authors are indebted to the referee f. verbunt for his valuable suggestions . \n this research made use of the simbad data base , operated by centre de donnes stellaires in strasbourg , france . \n we thank h.w . \n drbeck for important comments . \n nm thanks a. bianchini and r. claudi for having given him part of their observational time for the acquisition of the spectrum presented here , and a. aloisi for useful suggestions on the advanced use of daophot ii . \n barbon r. , benetti s. , cappellaro e. , rosino l. , turatto m. , 1990 , a&a 237 , 79 cannizzo j.k . \n , 1993 , apj 419 , 318 downes r.a . \n , shara m.m . \n , 1993 , pasp 105 , 127 downes r. , hoard h.w . \n , szkody p. , wachter s. , 1995 , aj 110 , 1824 frank j. , king a.r . , \n raine d.j . , 1992 , \n accretion power in astrophysics . \n cambridge univ . \n press , cambridge kholopov p.n . \n , 1987 , general catalogue of variable stars , iv edition , vol . \n 3 . nauka , moscow meinunger l. , 1965 , mitt . \n sterne 3 , 110 misselt k.a . \n , 1996 , pasp 108 , 146 osaki y. , 1996 , pasp 108 , 39 pastukhova e.n . , shugarov s.y . , 1994 , perem . \n zvezdy 23 , 233 richter g.a . , 1961 , \n sonneberg 4 , 429 ritter h. , kolb u. , 1995 , a compilation of cataclysmic binaries with known or suspected orbital periods . in : lewin w.h.g . , van paradijs j. , van den heuvel e.p.j . \n x  ray binaries . \n cambridge univ . press , cambridge , \n roberts d.h . , lehr j. , dreher j.w . , 1987 , aj 93 , 968 schneich w. , lange d. , 1981 , astron . \n 302 , 153 sterken c. , 1977 , a&a 57 , 361 stetson p.b . , 1987 , \n pasp 99 , 191 vogt n. , bateson f.m . , 1982 , a&as 48 , 383 warner b. , 1995 , cataclysmic variable stars . \n cambridge univ . press , cambridge zangrilli l. , tout c.a . \n , bianchini a. , 1997 , mnras 289 , 59", "StartTimeOffset": 460630800603, "RequestID": "8575d808edb91fbcb1656920fe38664c5c8bb01b", "TotalTokens": 4159}

we begin by taking @xmath2 to achieve a perfect fit to our data . because of noise \n , this model is extremely complex , containing high frequency oscillations ( in the case of a function @xmath3 fitted to points distributed in @xmath4 ) . \n imagine now receiving a new datum . \n the @xmath0 parameter model will have almost no predictive power for this new datum , since it has fitted all of the noise in the dataset from which it was derived . \n indeed , a far simpler model , with @xmath5 will have far greater predictive power . \n we use this principle by implementing a procedure called ` leave - one - out cross validation ' , where we systematically omit one of the data points and hold it in reserve as a test point , against which different models can test their predictive power . in this way we evaluate the predictive power of models , and find models based on an optimal number of parameters that have the most predictive power . + \n the format of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : dynamo_dataset ] , we present the database used in our analysis . in section \n [ sec : cross_validation ] , we illustrate the method of cross - validation with a toy problem , before going on to apply it to the dynamo problem at hand . \n subsequently , we analyse the scaling laws for heat transport , flow velocity and magnetic field strength using diffusivity - free parameters ( section [ sec : diff_free_scal ] ) and traditional non - dimensional numbers ( section [ sec : trad_scal ] ) . section [ sec : mag_dissipation_core ] is concerned with the scaling of magnetic dissipation time as well as the application of the scalings to the core . \n in the numerical dynamo simulations used in this study , convection is driven by a fixed superadiabatic temperature contrast @xmath6 between inner and outer boundaries of a rotating spherical shell . \n moreover the boussinesq approximation is used , i.e. density variations enter the equations only through a buoyancy term in the momentum equation . \n the standard set of equations consists of five equations describing conservation of momentum ( navier - stokes equation ) , magnetic induction , the transport of temperature and the solenoidal nature of the magnetic field @xmath7 and the velocity field @xmath8 ( cf . \n eq . [ eqn : ns_eq]-[eqn : solenoidal_u ] ) . + these equations can be non - dimensionalised by introducing four independent control parameters . \n their choice is not unique . \n we follow @xcite and use the shell thickness @xmath9 of the outer core , the inverse rotation rate @xmath10 , the temperature difference @xmath6 , and the quantity @xmath11 as fundamental scales for length , time , temperature and magnetic field , respectively ; @xmath12 is the outer core radius , @xmath13 the inner core radius , @xmath14 density and @xmath15 magnetic permeability . \n this leads to the following set of non - dimensional equations for magnetic field @xmath7 , fluid velocity @xmath8 and temperature @xmath16 : @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the unit vector in the direction of the rotation axis . in these equations \n , gravity is assumed to vary proportional to the radius , @xmath23 being the value of gravity at the outer boundary ; volumetric heating is neglected and @xmath24 is the non - hydrostatic pressure . \n the four non - dimensional parameters governing equations [ eqn : ns_eq]-[eqn : solenoidal_u ] are defined in table [ tab : nondim_no ] .        only considering models that lie in the ` earth - like triangle ' for magnetic field morphology in figure [ fig : c116_rm_eketa_triangle ] ( criteria of \n * ) , the dynamo dataset is reduced from 116 to 61 models . \n table [ tab : earthlike_diffless_scalings ] shows the scaling laws that in this case are preferred by loocv under the assumption of equal errors in @xmath25 . \n although the dataset is reduced by almost half , the resulting laws only differ in their exponents ( up to @xmath26 ) , but not in the parameters included ( cf . \n table [ tab : diffless_scalings ] ) . \n christensen , u.  r. & aubert , j. , 2006 . \n scaling properties of convection - driven dynamos in rotating spherical shells and application to planetary magnetic fields , _ geophysical journal international _ , * 166*(1 ) , 97114 . \n de  koker , n. , steinle - neumann , g. , & vlcek , v. , 2012 . \n electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of liquid fe alloys at high p and t , and heat flux in earth s core , _ p natl acad sci usa _ , * 109*(11 ) , 40704073 .", "StartTimeOffset": 476806452211, "RequestID": "33093c01e70aa4a6195c1ad45f48c1e014d7e1d5", "TotalTokens": 2037}

cavity structure consisting of a @xmath8 znte buffer on which a cavity between two dbrs is grown : respectively @xmath11 fold for the bottom dbr and @xmath9 fold for the top one . \n four qds sheets are deposited in the @xmath12 cavity ( fig . \n [ struc ] c ) ) using the same growth parameters as for the structure ( ii ) . \n the microcavities studied comprise dbrs lattice matched to znte . \n the high refractive index layers within the dbr are znte layers . \n the low refractive index layers are obtained by growing a short period , strain compensated znte|mgse|znte|mgte superlattice ( see fig . \n [ haadf ] c ) and e ) ) resulting in a digital alloy.@xcite the substrate temperature for the growth of the dbrs is @xmath13 , whereas the self organized qds are obtained by the deposition of @xmath14 monolayers of cdte at a substrate temperature of @xmath15 . in order to limit the growth interruptions and shorten the overall growth process of cavities embedding numerous qds sheets , the qds formation was not induced by the well established method involving amorphous tellurium@xcite deposition . \n the cdte layer was overgrown without any growth interruptions by znte barrier resulting in the formation of qds with a relatively high planar density@xcite . \n the high annular angular dark field ( haadf ) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) allows to observe the crystalline structure of the qds and barrier ( see fig . [ haadf ] d ) ) .     fold dbr . \n the thickness of the znte barrier is set to form a @xmath10 cavity which top reflector is the znte / air interface . \n c ) full cavity structure : the @xmath16 qds sheets are embedded in a @xmath17 cavity ( 1 qds sheet at each antinode of the electromagnetic standing wave ) . ] \n the samples are characterized by macro - photoluminescence ( macro - pl ) measurements ( diameter of the laser spot on the sample surface : @xmath18 ) to compare the studied structures emission intensities ( fig . \n [ macropl ] ) and by micro - photoluminescence ( @xmath19-pl ) measurements ( size of the laser spot on the sample : @xmath20 ) to observe single qds emission lines ( fig . \n [ micropl ] ) . \n the qds are excited above the barrier by a continuous wave laser beam at @xmath21 .        as seen in fig . \n [ macropl ] , the pl intensity of the qds ensemble in the yellow range ( @xmath22 ) grown on a ten fold dbr is @xmath11 times higher than in the case of qds grown on a @xmath7 znte buffer . \n this intensity enhancement is accounted for a higher extraction coefficient of the light emitted by the qds resulting from the coupling of the emission to the increased density of electromagnetic states ( mode ) of the cavity defined by the bottom dbr and the znte / air interface . in the case of qds on a znte buffer , most of the light emitted towards the substrate or back reflected from the cap / air interface is absorbed by the substrate . \n also in the case of the full cavity structure the macro - pl measurements show a significant enhancement of the pl intensity from the qds ( fig.[macropl ] ) . \n the interpretation here is , however , less straightforward . the cavity quality factor is higher as compared to the case of the half - cavity ( it is high enough to result in mode linewidth narrower than the qd ensemble emission peak , in contrary to the case of the half - cavity ) . on the one hand \n , this increases the effect of cavity enhanced extraction and may account for a net purcell effect on the qd emission . on the other hand , the excitation is less efficient due to absorption of the excitation beam in the top dbr . at the same time , \n not a single qd sheet , but @xmath16 qds sheets ( excited with an unequal efficiency ) contribute to the collected signal . \n the overall emission intensity is a result of the interplay of the above mentioned factors .    . \n ]    the micro - pl measurements reveal that single emission lines of the qds grown on the dbr are strongly broadened as compared to the qds grown on the znte buffer ( fig . \n [ micropl ] ) . as seen in the inset of fig.[mc_dbr ] , \n sharp pl lines related to individual qds are observed for the full - cavity structure although the same procedure for the deposition the cdte qds was used for both structures . \n the cause of the observed broadening can be of structural type ( _ e . \n g. _ , the propagation of stacking faults through the qds sheet ) , of crystalline type ( _ e . g. _ , poor crystalline quality of the qds or matrix in their vicinity ) or of electronic type ( _ e . \n g. _ , accidental doping ) . in the next paragraph , we show that the latter effect is predominant .    , the single qds lines exhibit a fwhm comparable in the case of both structures . ] \n to identify the origin of the qds single lines broadening observed for the structure with a single qds sheet embedded in a half - cavity , imaging with the high angular annular dark field detector ( haadf ) in the scanning transmission ( stem ) mode and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) analysis have been undertaken on a microcavity sample embedding four qds sheets . as shown in fig . \n [ hrtem ] a ) and b ) the the haadf images do not show any structural defects across the cavity or dbrs , like stacking faults or amorphous inclusions . \n this indicates a good crystalline quality of the sample . \n however , an additional layer under the qds sheets can be seen ( fig . \n [ hrtem ] a , and close - up b ) . in this region \n , the presence of zn , te and se is mapped by edx chemical analysis ( fig . \n [ hrtem ] respectively c , d , e ) . \n the mapping shows unequivocally that a thin znse layer ( @xmath23 thick ) has formed . the unintentional deposition of this znse layer occurs while cooling the substrate from @xmath24 ( growth of the ddbr ) to @xmath25 ( growth of the qds ) . because of the higher sticking coefficient of se atoms with respect to te atoms@xcite , the residual se pressure in the growth chamber ( even with the se shutter closed ) is sufficient to result in preferable incorporation of se in place of te when cooling the substrate . \n thick ) layer has been unintentionally deposited during the growth interruption necessary for the growth of the cdte qds . ] \n the recovery of sharp single qds lines in the case of the full cavity structure indicates that the effect of the intercalated se in the form of a znse thin layer in the cavity is a short range type and that it affects only the first qds sheet grown . \n since no structural defects are observed in the vicinity of the unintentional znse layer , we infer that the main influence of this additional layer is a short range , local modification of the electronic environment affecting the optical properties of the nearest qds sheet . \n the non negligible thickness of the znse layer ( @xmath26 ) , being still under the critical relaxation thickness ( @xmath27 for znse on znte@xcite ) suggests that also a local strain could be involved in the broadening of the single qds lines observed for the half - cavity structures with a single qds sheet . \n the znse layer unintentionally forms during the growth interruption introduced to lower the temperature of the substrate prior to the growth of qds . \n thus , in order to assure a good qds optical performance it is crucial to avoid interruptions during the growth . \n this is especially important in the case of the cdte qds embedded in the microcavity . \n this indicates that in growth processes combining selenium and tellurium compounds it is better to grow the cdte qds without inducing their formation by amorphous tellurium . \n the fact that for the half - cavity structure broadened single qds emission lines are observed together with an enhancement of the pl from the qds ensemble suggests that the unintentional znse layer does not introduce any non - radiative exciton recombination channel . \n in this work , we show the enhancement of the yellow emission intensity of self assembled cdte / znte qds embedded in microcavities defined by dbrs involving selenium and tellurium compounds . \n the extraction coefficient of the light emitted by the qds ensemble is @xmath11 times higher for half - cavity structures as compared to qds grown on a buffer . in such cavities the spectrally wide cavity mode is well suited for fundamental investigations on qds , and for applications like solotronics or information storage and processing for which one focuses on the full emission pattern of individual qds . \n we show that the formation of a znse layer ( identified by edx analysis ) in the znte cavity during the cooling of the substrate for the growth of the cdte qds , does not affect the structural and crystalline properties of the sample , as shown by haadf stem imaging . \n however , this additional znse layer may induce a short range modification of the electronic and strain environment affecting the optical properties of the qds in its proximity ( e.g. , broadening of individual qd emission lines ) . since the influence of these effects is of short range type , the growth of a thicker znte layer after cooling of the substrate and before the deposition of the qds allows to cancel them . for the full cavity structure , \n we show the enhancement of the qds ensemble emission without any effects of single qds lines broadening . \n this work was partially supported by the national center for research and development in poland ( project lider ) , the polish national science center under decisions dec-2011/02/a \n / st3/00131 , dec-2011/01/n / st3/04536 , dec-2012/05/n / st3/03209 , dec-2013/09/b / st3/02603 , dec-2013/10/e / st3/00215 , umo-2012/05/b /st7/02155 , and by the foundation for polish science . \n research was carried out with the use of cept , cezamat and nltk infrastructures financed by the european union -

{"ContextTokens": 3800, "GeneratedTokens": 302, "SynthesizedBody": "rxj0720.43125 is a nearby , isolated neutron star ( ins ) originally discovered with _ rosat _ during a systematic survey of the galactic plane by haberl et al . \n a clear modulation of the x - ray intensity is detected at a period of 8.391 s , which identifies the spin velocity of the neutron star . \n rx j0720.43125 is , so far , the isolated neutron star with best studied timing properties . \n its proximity and relatively high brightness made possible not only to measure the spin period , but also to study the period changes over a long - term . \n this is crucial , since the positive detection of spin - up or spin - down phases can shed light on the mechanisms that regulate the neutron star interaction with its surroundings . \n a large positive spin - down can indicate magneto - dipolar breaking , leading in turn to an estimate of magnetic field strength and star spin down age . in the attempt to measure a secular period change , zane et al . \n ( 2002 , hereafter z02 ) recently undertook a comprehensive timing analysis of _ rosat _ , _ bepposax _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data spanning a total period of @xmath4  yrs . independently , a similar analysis based on an additional _ chandra _ dataset , but without the _ xmm - newton _ data , was presented by kaplan et al . \n ( 2002 , hereafter k02 ) . \n although the two studies agreed in their main conclusion that the period change was less than @xmath5 s / s , it was evident that there were inconsistencies in the details of the analysis which have implications for further studies . \n the arrival times computed by the two groups were different . \n k02 also raised theoretical concerns about the validity of the _ coherent _ analysis of the entire dataset carried out by z02 . \n that was the only method that , at that time , permitted the ( positive ) sign of the period change to be constrained . \n in fact , the phase - incoherent analysis presented by kaplan et al . \n ( 2002 ) still leads to a large uncertainty in @xmath6 , and does not permit the discrimination between positive and negative spin - down . \n the above - mentioned inconsistencies have motivated us to undertake a complete revision of the solution . at the time \n z02 was published , timing inconsistencies between _ xmm - newton _ and radio data on other pulsars had come to light ( kuster et al . \n this was traced to an error in the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) task _ barycen _ before version 13.1 [ the spacecraft position vector was constructed as ( x , y , y ) instead of ( x , y , z ) ] . \n although we argued in z02 that any effect on the coherent analysis was small , we nevertheless performed a reanalysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data to check , and also to investigate whether this corrected the inconsistencies with the k02 analysis . \n we found indeed that the effect was negligible . \n the implication is therefore that the inconsistencies between the z02 and k02 analyses remained . \n we have therefore undertaken a complete reanalysis of the dataset to investigate and eliminate these inconsistencies . \n this has brought to light that the times used for the _ rosat _ data in both the z02 and k02 studies are in utc rather than tdb as used for _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ; the times of arrival ( toas ) in k02 are incorrectly calculated ; and that the formula used to calculate the instantaneous phase was incorrect in z02 . \n substantial new datasets are also available from both _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ which permit a more comprehensive investigation into the period evolution . \n we report here the results of this reanalysis . \n we refer the reader to z02 and k02 for the details of the previous observations , and comment here largely only on those aspects which have changed . \n the table of observations is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] . \n [ cols= \" < , \n < , < , < , > , > , < \" , ] \n as we can see , the only scenario compatible with a superstrong field at the star s birth ( @xmath7  g ) is that one involving a very fast decay , i.e. the hall cascade . in this case \n the predicted star s age is @xmath8  yr . although such a young age is only marginally compatible with the absence of a remnant , it is not incompatible with that inferred from the cooling curves ( see figure [ fig : cooling ] ) provided the mass is slightly larger . a slightly larger mass still is required if we allow for the extra - heating due to @xmath9-decay from hall cascade ( geppert & colpi , private communication ) . \n on the other hand , both mechanisms involving ambipolar diffusion predict a magnetic field which is relatively constant over the source lifetime and close to the present value . \n the corresponding star s age is between @xmath10  yr and @xmath11  yr , and is close to @xmath12 . \n we have eliminated the discrepancies between the calculated toas in the k02 paper and those derived from the same data analysed by z02 . \n this invalidated our derived @xmath13 $ ] solutions in z02 ( k02 have also updated their toas ) . in order to correct these solutions , \n we have reanalysed the datasets and taken the opportunity to incorporate significant new datasets from both _ \n chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. at the same time , we have revised the model used by z02 to be fitted to the data to retain the correct phase reference .    taken individually , \n the combination of old and new datasets allow a significantly more accurate @xmath13 $ ] solution to be derived than that in k02 or z02 . \n this _ establishes that rx j0720.43125 is spinning down_.    we have also attempted a phase - coherent analysis of the combined datasets , as in z02 . \n however , we have been unable to find a consistent solution , even when we analyse the data from different satellites separately . in this case \n the _ xmm - newton _ data are not consistent with the other data . \n we have explored the possible reasons for this : they may be intrinsic to rx j0720.43125 ( in which case the constant @xmath6 model is not appropriate ) , or they may result from continuing timing errors in the data we have not succeeded in identifying . \n we present the solutions from the combined _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ data and the _ xmm - newton _ data separately . \n the individual ( incoherent ) @xmath13 $ ] solution is sufficiently accurate to allows us to place strong constraints on the mechanism causing the spin - down . \n the large @xmath14  s / s rules out accretion and propeller origins and points toward an interpretation in terms of magneto - dipolar breaking . \n this in turn constrains the age of rx j0720.43125 and its magnetic field strength .    for a magnetic field as strong as @xmath15  g \n , the electron cyclotron line is unaccessible ( it falls at about 350 kev ) . \n however , a relatively broad proton cyclotron absorption feature is predicted at @xmath16  kev ( zane et al . ,  2001 ) . \n the presence of a cyclotron absorption line at the low energy of the sensitive energy band of the _ xmm - newton _ epic instruments has been indeed recently reported ( see haberl et al . ,  2003a , 2004 ) . \n the feature may explain the observed deviations from a planckian shape at these energies , and possibly also the anticorrelation of the modulation of hardness ratio and total x - ray intensity detected by _ xmm - newton _ \n ( cropper et al . ,  2001 ) . \n our study allows a possible evolutionary link between dim ins and axps ( which relies on the interpretation of the former as warm - out magnetars ) but only if the ins have an age of @xmath1 yr . \n a more conservative interpretation is that rx j0720.43125 was born with a strong , but not superstrong , field [ @xmath17  g ] which is compatible with those of the canonical radio - pulsars . \n similar conclusions have been argued also by k02 , however their measure of @xmath6 has a large error and does not permit the discrimination between this and the separate possibilities that rx j0720.43125 has a more conventional field ( @xmath18  g ) and lower spin - down rate ( @xmath19s / s ) or is even spinning - up . comparing with the radio - active pulsar population , objects with @xmath20  g are rare , but their evidence is rapidly growing ( camilo et al . \n ,  2000 ) . \n the parameters of rx j0720.43125 we have derived are not too dissimilar from those of psr  j18141744 , which has @xmath21  s and @xmath22  s / s . \n one of the most striking mysteries about _ rosat _ isolated neutron stars , axps , soft-@xmath23 repeaters and objects like geminga is why they do not exhibit radio emission . as suggested by motch et al . \n ( 2003 ) , who derived very similar conclusions basing on the proper motion measurement , it could thus be that rx j0720.43125 and several others apparently radio - quiet neutron stars are just radio pulsars with off - axis beam that does not cross the earth . the radio beam narrows with increasing periods ( briggs 1990 ) , making this explanation even more plausible . \n on the other hand , evidence for a population of genuinely radio - silent young neutron stars arises from population synthesis ( neuhuser & trmper ,  1999 ; gotthelf & vasisht , 2000 ; popov et al . ,  2000a , b and references therein ) . \n the group of rosat inss is very homogeneous and they are all relatively close - by ( within 300 - 400 pc ) , making unplausible that all their beams are misaligned . at present , these two possibilities can not be distinguished . \n detailed timing analysis of other _ rosat _ inss is crucial to reach a more comprehensive understanding of the entire population . \n we are grateful to uwe lammers for his reprocessing of the _ xmm - newton _ odfs . \n we thank david kaplan for several discussions regarding the toas and for pointing out the difference between the event timings in his and our bepposax data . \n we thank marco feroci for processing the bepposax data , and tim oosterbroek and gianluca israel for providing information on the intricacies of the time correction in the sax das . \n we also thank werner becker for his insights into the possible sources of error in the _ xmm -

{"ContextTokens": 1704, "GeneratedTokens": 122, "SynthesizedBody": "in this paper , we investigate the problem of mining numerical data . \n this problem arises in many practical situations , e.g. analysis of gene and transcriptomic data in biology , soil characteristics and land occupation in agronomy , demographic data in economics , temperatures in climate analysis , etc . \n we introduce an original framework for mining numerical data based on advances in itemset mining and in formal concept analysis ( fca ,  @xcite ) , respectively condensed representations of itemsets and pattern structures in fca  @xcite . \n the mining of frequent itemsets in binary data , considering a set of objects and a set of associated attributes or items , is studied for a long time and usually involves the so - called `` pattern flooding '' problem @xcite . \n a way of dealing with pattern flooding is to search for equivalence classes of itemsets , i.e. itemsets shared by the same set of objects ( or having the same image ) . for an equivalence class , there is one maximal itemset , which corresponds to a `` closed set '' , and possibly several minimal elements corresponding to `` generators '' ( or `` key itemsets '' ) . from these elements , families of association rules \n can be extracted . \n these itemsets are also related to fca , where a concept lattice is built from a binary context and where formal concepts are closed sets of objects and attributes . \n the present work is rooted both in fca and pattern mining with the objective of extracting interval patterns from numerical data . \n our approach is based on `` pattern structures '' where complex descriptions can be associated with objects . in  @xcite \n we introduced closed interval patterns in the context of gene expression data mining . \n intuitively , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , each dimension corresponding to a range of values of a given attribute ; it is closed when composed of the smallest intervals characterizing a same set of objects .    in the present paper , we complete and extend this first attempt . considering numerical data , some general characteristics of equivalence classes remain , e.g. one maximal element which is a closed pattern and possibly several generators which are minimal patterns w.r.t . a subsumption relation defined on patterns . \n we show that directly extracting patterns data from numerical is more efficient using pattern structures than working on binary data with associated scaling procedures . \n we also provide a semantics to interval patterns in the euclidean space , design and experiment algorithms to extract frequent closed interval patterns and their generators . \n the problem of mining patterns in numerical data is usually referred as quantitative itemset / association rule mining  @xcite . \n generally , an appropriate discretization splits attribute ranges into intervals maximizing some interest functions , e.g. support , confidence . however \n , none of these works covers the notion of equivalence classes , closed patterns , and generators , and this is one of the originality of the present paper . \n the plan of the paper is as follows . \n firstly , we introduce the problem of mining numerical data and interval patterns . \n then , we recall the basics of fca and interordinal scaling . \n we pose a number of questions that we propose to answer using our framework of interval pattern structures dealing with numerical data . \n we then detail two original algorithms for extracting closed interval patterns and their generators . \n these algorithms are evaluated in the last section on real - world data . \n finally , we end the paper in discussing related work and giving perspectives to the present research work . as a complement , an extended version of this paper \n is given in  @xcite , providing algorithms pseudo - code and a longer discussion on the usefulness of interval patterns in classification problems and privacy preserving data - mining . \n we propose a definition of interval patterns for numerical data . \n intuitively , each object of a numerical dataset corresponds to a vector of numbers , where each dimension stands for an attribute . \n accordingly , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , and each dimension describes the range of a numerical attribute . \n we only consider finite intervals and that the set of attributes / dimensions is assumed to bed ( canonically ) ordered . \n a numerical dataset is given by a set of objects @xmath0 , a set of numerical attributes @xmath1 , where the range of @xmath2 is a finite set noted @xmath3 . \n @xmath4 means that @xmath5 is the value of attribute @xmath6 for object @xmath7 .    .a \n numerical dataset . \n [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in both cases , using binary data is better when the minimal support is high ( e.g. 90% ) . for low supports , a critical issue , our algorithms deliver better execution times . \n most importantly , the global redundancy effect discards the use of binary data , e.g. only @xmath8 of all fisg are actually fipg in dataset bl . \n finally , the algorithm _ minintchangeg - t _ outperforms _ minintchangeg - h_. _ minintchangeg - t _ however needs more memory since it stores each closed set of objects as a word in the trie , and to each word the list of associated fipg . \n it is very interesting to analyse the compression ability of closed interval patterns and generators . \n for that , we compare in each dataset the number of those patterns w.r.t . to all possible interval patterns . \n it gives the ratio of closed ( generators ) in the whole search space . in both cases , \n ratio varies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n this means that the volume of useful interval patterns , either closed or generators , is very low w.r.t . \n the set of all possible interval patterns , justifying our interest in equivalence classes for interval patterns . \n we discussed the important problem of pattern discovery in numerical data with a new and original formalization of interval patterns . \n the classical fca / itemset - mining settings are adapted accordingly : from a closure operator naturally rise the notions of equivalence classes , closed and generator patterns , and we designed corresponding algorithms . \n an appropriate semantics of interval patterns shows from a theoretical ( redundancy ) and practical ( computation times ) points of view that mining equivalent binary data ( encoding all possible intervals ) is not acceptable . \n this is due to the fact that interval patterns are provided with a stronger partial ordering than is - itemsets ( classical set inclusion ) , hence pattern structures yield significantly less generators w.r.t . \n their semantics .    dealing with interval patterns has applications in computational geometry , machine learning and data -

{"ContextTokens": 2422, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "a recent frontier in physics is to investigate organic and living matter , trying to formulate models able to capture their main features . \n this investigation has the double mark of being in itself interesting due to the lack of knowledge in the subject and of exploiting wide potentialities in the production of a new generation of electronic devices . as a matter of fact \n , some specific tasks of sensing protein can be reproduced in artificial devices to improve their performances . \n it is the case of nano - biosensors which aim to mimic _ in vitro _ the peculiar sensing abilities shown _ in vivo _ by proteins and organic materials . \n accordingly , much attention has been devoted to transmembrane proteins ( tmps ) , which interface external and internal cell environments . \n specifically , tmps are proteins consisting of one or several helices crossing the cell membrane and able to modify their structure when capturing a specific molecule or a small protein ( ligand ) . among available experiments , here we report on those performed on two different seven - helix tmps , bacteriorhodopsin ( br ) and proteorhodopsin ( pr ) , proteins able to transform energy coming by light in energy useful for the cell survival . \n therefore , they appear very interesting to work out bio - solar - cells and/or bio - diodes . to this purpose , \n recent measurements on the electrical properties of br and pr have revealed the possibility to use them _ in vitro _ like organic transistors . in particular , they are almost insulators at the lowest values of the applied bias , and their conductance suddenly increases for orders of magnitude , above some threshold value where they enter a sharp super - ohmic regime . furthermore , in the presence of green light , i.e. after a conformational change , the conductance exhibits a further increase above the dark value , thus confirming the hypothesis of a structure - mediated charge transfer .    to provide a microscopic model of the main features described above \n , we developed a numerical approach based on the analogy between a single protein and an impedance network . \n the charge transport is obtained by introducing a procedure of stochastic changes of the network impedances . \n the investigations are performed on the br , whose current - voltage ( i - v ) responses were carried out on a wide range of applied voltages @xcite , then extended to pr @xcite , on which experiments are only at the preliminary stage of low applied bias . \n former experiments were carried out on br , probably the best known protein in the seven - helix tmp family . \n samples of br in its natural membrane were used in a metal - insulator - metal structure @xcite and their i - v characteristics measured in dark @xcite and also in green light @xcite . \n the samples exhibited a small conductivity ( less than 1 ps / cm ) at low applied field . \n this conductivity was found to increase as the protein sample is irradiated with green light and/or when the electrical field overcomes a critical value . in particular , green light produces a higher current with respect to dark conditions , as a consequence of the modification of the chromophore - opsin complex @xcite . \n the super - linear i - v characteristics point toward a tunneling charge - transfer mechanism @xcite . in particular , a transition between a direct tunneling ( dt ) regime and a fowler - nordheim ( fn ) tunneling regime is revealed ( see ) \n . first measurements of i - v characteristics in pr were reported in ref . \n the experiment was performed on a thin - film device with a contact distance of 50 @xmath0 , just about @xmath1 times longer than the br nanolayers used in the previous experiments @xcite . \n the film was obtained by dehydrating pr in a buffer solution . \n the protein activity after dehydration was tested by absorbtion measurements that confirmed the preservation of the structure and the function after the treatment . \n accordingly , the experiments performed on br and pr evidence the possibility to obtain , _ in vitro _ like so _ in vivo _ , a significant photocurrent , a result of great interest for optoelectronic applications .            following the indication of experiments @xcite , \n we assume that charge transfer through the amino acids of the single protein is the main mechanism of transport . \n therefore , a microscopic interpretation of experiments is given in terms of the single protein electrical properties , taken as intrinsic characteristics of the protein morphology . \n to this purpose we make use of the impedance network protein analogous ( inpa ) technique already detailed in @xcite . in short , each protein is associated with a topological network , consisting of nodes and links , as pictured in . \n each node corresponds to a single amino acid , and its position is taken as that of the related @xmath2 atom @xcite . \n each couple of nodes is connected with a link when their distance is less than an assigned interaction radius , @xmath3 ( usually in the range @xmath4  ) , so that the network captures the protein topology . \n the graph turns into an impedance network when an elemental impedance is associated with each link . in the present case of a static response \n only resistances are considered . \n accordingly , the elemental resistance between the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th nodes , say , @xmath7 is taken as @xcite : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , is the cross - sectional area between the spheres centered on the @xmath10 nodes , respectively , @xmath11 is the distance between these nodes , @xmath12 is the resistivity . by positioning the input and \n output electrical contacts on the first and last node , respectively , for a given applied bias the network is solved within a linear kirchhoff scheme . by construction , this network produces a parameter - dependent static i - v characteristic . to account for the super - linear current at increasing applied voltages , a tunneling mechanism of charge transfer \n is included by using a stochastic approach within a monte carlo scheme@xcite . in particular , \n the resistivity value of each link is chosen between a low value @xmath13 , taken to fit the current at the highest voltages , and a high value @xmath14 , which depends on the voltage drop between network nodes as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the maximum resistivity value taken to fit the i -

conductance , @xmath27 , is calculated over a large ensemble of configurations , and is taken as a measurable global - quantity and order parameter in recent investigations @xcite . as a further step , \n the conductance fluctuations which emerge as a result of the same numerical simulations are estimated . \n indeed , these fluctuations are essential to determine the average value of the global quantity @xmath28 since they are particularly high close to the transition between the dt and fn regimes , as generally expected near to a phase transition . \n indeed , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of these fluctuations , normalized to its first and second moment , is found to be well described by the generalized gumbel distribution , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a positive number , @xmath32 the variance , @xmath33 with @xmath34 . \n furthermore , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 indicating the gamma , digamma and trigamma function , respectively . finally , @xmath29 is a normalized pdf with zero mean and unitary variance ; it is a skewed function , recently used to describe finite - size systems in both critical and not critical conditions @xcite . \n the numerical value of the shaping parameter @xmath31 is related to the system internal dynamic @xcite . in the present case , the lack of a gaussian behaviour is due to the existence of a low and upper bound on the conductance values @xcite . \n the values of @xmath31 which , in a wide range of applied bias , better describe the pdfs for br and pr , are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( see ) . \n integer values of @xmath31 allow to interpret the @xmath29 as the distribution of the @xmath31-th minimum / maximum of the independent variables , i.e. @xmath39 should be correlated with the existence of a single dominant conductance value . otherwise , the interpretation of on integer @xmath31 value remains an open question . \n microscopic investigations of the i -

{"ContextTokens": 3943, "GeneratedTokens": 159, "SynthesizedBody": "the interest in quantum computation is stimulated by the discovery of quantum algorithms which can solve problems of significance much more efficiently than their classical counterparts . \n quantum algorithms could be implemented using various types of qubits [ 1 ] or quantum simulators [ 2 ] . among important quantum algorithms , \n there exist the deutsch algorithm [ 3 ] , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm [ 4 ] , the shor algorithm [ 5 ] , the simon algorithm [ 6 ] , the quantum fourier transform algorithm , and the grover search algorithm [ 7 ] . \n in addition , proposals for implementing other quantum algorithms have been also presented ( e.g. , see [ 8 ] ) . \n as is well known , the deutsch algorithm and the deutsch - jozsa algorithm were the first two that make use of the features of quantum mechanics for quantum computation . compared with other quantum algorithms , \n these two algorithms are easy to be implemented and thus have been considered as the natural candidates for demonstrating power of quantum computation .    in this article , we restrict ourself to a refined deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) algorithm . we will propose a way to implement a three - qubit _ refined _ dj algorithm . \n as shown below , this proposal is based on the construction of the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates , which employs single - qubit @xmath2 gates and two - qubit _ standard _ controlled - phase ( cp ) gates . to the best of our knowledge , \n our work is the first to consider how to construct the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates using these two kinds of basic gates . \n the construction of the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates here is general , and can be applied to implement the three - qubit refined dj algorithm in a cavity - based or noncavity - based physical system . \n there are several motivations for this work :    \\(i ) in ref . \n [ 9 ] , the authors showed that implementing a one - qubit or two - qubit _ refined _ dj algorithm does not require entanglement between the input query qubits , and thus test of the one - qubit or two - qubit _ refined _ dj algorithm is not meaningful because it can be solved in a classical way . \n however , they showed that entanglement exists between the input query qubits during performing a @xmath3-qubit refined dj algorithm with @xmath4 , and thus the meaningful test of the refined dj algorithm occurs only and only if @xmath5 . \n hence , as far as the refined dj algorithm is concerned , a three - qubit refined dj algorithm ( i.e. , the case for @xmath6 ) is the smallest one that needs to be tested or implemented , in order to demonstrate the full power of quantum computation as applied to the deutsch problem . for a detailed discussion , see [ 9 ] . \n \\(ii ) a second motivation of this work is as follows . \n a single - qubit @xmath7 gate can be easily realized by applying a single classical pulse . \n in addition , it is well known that a two - qubit cp gate ( i.e. , the key element in the construction of the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates , see table ii below ) has been experimentally demonstrated in many physical systems such as quantum dots , trapped ions , atoms in cavity qed , and superconducting qubits / qutrits coupled to a single circuit cavity . \n thus , it is straightforward to implement a three - qubit refined dj algorithm by applying the present proposal . \n \\(iii ) quantum information processing using superconducting qubits coupled to a cavity has attracted considerable interest during the past ten years . \n based on cavity qed , many theoretical proposals have been presented for realizing two - qubit gates [ 10 - 14 ] and multiple qubit gates [ 15,16 ] with superconducting qubits . moreover , \n experimental demonstration of two - qubit gates [ 17 - 20 ] and three - qubit gates [ 21 - 23 ] with superconducting qubits in cavity qed has been also reported . however , after a deep investigation , we noted that how to implement a three - qubit ( original and refined ) dj algorithm with superconducting qubits or qutrits in cavity qed has not been reported in both theoretical and experimental aspects .  as is known , the experimental realization of the three - qubit dj algorithm with a cavity - superconducting - device system is important because it would be an important step toward more complex quantum computation in circuit cavity qed . \n \\(iv ) over the past decade , there has been much interest in quantum information processing with atoms in cavity qed . \n based on cavity qed technique , many theoretical methods have been proposed for implementing a two - qubit cp or controlled - not gate and multiple qubit controlled gates with atoms [ 24 - 28 ] . \n moreover , a two - qubit cp gate between a cavity mode and an atom has been experimentally demonstrated [ 29 ] . \n however , after a thorough search , we found that only several proposals [ 30 - 32 ] were proposed for implementing the original or refined @xmath3-qubit dj algorithm for @xmath5 , using atoms in cavity qed . \n as discussed below , these proposals have some drawbacks . for instances , the one in [ 30 ] \n is incomplete , and the ones in [ 31,32 ] are difficult to implement in experiments when compared with our current proposal . \n the dj algorithm is aimed at distinguishing the constant function from the balanced functions on @xmath8 inputs . \n the function @xmath9 takes either @xmath10 or @xmath11 for the constant function , the function values are constant ( @xmath10 or @xmath12 ) for all @xmath8 inputs . \n in contrast , for the balanced function , the function values are equal to 1 for half of all the possible inputs , and @xmath10 for the other half . using the dj algorithm , whether the function is constant or balanced \n can be determined by only one query . however \n , a classical algorithm would require @xmath13 queries to answer the same problem , which grows exponentially with input size . \n the _ original _ dj algorithm involves the @xmath3 input query qubits each initially prepared in the state @xmath14 and an auxiliary working qubit initially prepared in the state  @xmath15 . \n it operates by : ( i ) applying a hadamard gate on each input query qubit , which results in @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , ( ii ) performing a @xmath0-controlled - not gate @xmath18 and ( iii ) applying a hadamard gate again on each input query qubit followed by a measurement on each input query qubit along the single - qubit @xmath19 base formed by the two states @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the state of the @xmath3 input query qubits with @xmath24 being an @xmath3-qubit binary decomposition , @xmath25 is the state of the working qubit with @xmath26 and @xmath27 means modulo 2 . \n note that the operation @xmath28 results in the following transformation [ 2 ] @xmath29which shows that there is no entanglement between the query qubits and the working qubit in the output of the @xmath28 . \n thus there is no need for any coupling between the query qubits and the working qubit during the entire process . \n hence , in the _ original _ dj algorithm the working qubit is completely redundant . \n -qubit deutsch - jozsa algorithm . here \n , @xmath30 represents a single - qubit hadamard gate on an input query qubit , which results in @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) . \n in addition , @xmath31 indicates a @xmath0-controlled phase gate on the @xmath3 input query qubits , described by eq . \n ( 2).,width=10 ]    the _ refined _ dj algorithm was proposed by collins _ \n et al . _ in 2001 [ 9 ] , which is illustrated in fig .  1 . \n this refined dj algorithm follows a similar pattern of operations as the original dj algorithm , which is described below :    \\(i ) each input query qubit is prepared in the initial state @xmath32    \\(ii ) perform a hadamard transformation @xmath30 on each qubit . as a result , \n the @xmath33-qubit initial state @xmath34 changes to the state @xmath35 ( denoted as @xmath36)@xmath37            \\(iii ) apply the @xmath0-controlled phase shift @xmath31 , described by @xmath38 which leads the state @xmath36 to the state @xmath39 ( denoted as @xmath40 ) . \n \\(iv ) perform another hadamard transformation @xmath30 on each qubit . as a result , \n the state @xmath40 becomes @xmath41    \\(v ) measure the final state of the @xmath3 qubits . \n if the @xmath3 qubits are measured in the state @xmath42 then @xmath43 is constant . \n however , if they are measured in other @xmath3-qubit computational basis states , then @xmath9 is balanced . \n this is because the amplitude @xmath44 of the state @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 which is @xmath47 for a constant @xmath9 while @xmath10 for a balanced @xmath9 . \n one can see that when compared with the original dj algorithm , this refined dj algorithm does not need a working qubit . \n hence , it requires one qubit fewer than the original dj algorithm . \n consequently , its physical implementation requires one fewer two - state system . \n for both of the original and refined dj algorithms , there are a total of @xmath48 balanced functions , among which only @xmath49 balanced functions are nontrivial if the symmetry is taken into account . for the three - qubit dj algorithm , i.e. , @xmath50 there thus exist @xmath51 nontrivial balanced functions @xmath52 ( see table i ) .    a single qubit @xmath2 gate results in the transformation @xmath53 while @xmath54 as is well known , a two - qubit _ standard _ cp gate @xmath55 on qubits @xmath56 and @xmath57 is described as follows @xmath58 which implies that if and only if the control qubit @xmath56 ( the first qubit ) is in the state @xmath59 , a phase flip happens to the state @xmath60 of the target qubit @xmath57 ( the second qubit ) , but nothing happens otherwise . \n the construction for each of the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates is listed in table ii . \n one can see from table ii that the 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates @xmath52 are classified into the following four types : ( i ) type 1 includes seven @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed with single - qubit @xmath61 gates only ; ( ii ) type 2 contains twelve  @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed with single - qubit @xmath61 gates and one two - qubit cp gate ; ( iii ) type 3 has twelve @xmath0-controlled phase gates each constructed by using single - qubit @xmath61 gates and two two - qubit cp gates ; and ( iv )  type 4 involves four @xmath0-controlled phase gates each implemented with two single - qubit @xmath61 gates and three two - qubit cp gates . \n as discussed previously , a single - qubit @xmath61 gate here can be easily realized by applying a single classical pulse , and a two - qubit cp gate ( i.e. , the central element in our gate construction ) has been experimentally demonstrated in various physical systems . \n hence , the gate construction given in table ii is implementable . \n after a thorough search , we found that only several proposals [ 30 - 32 ] were proposed for implementing the original or refined dj algorithm for @xmath5 , using atoms in cavity qed . in the following \n we will briefly introduce these previous proposals and then give a comparison of them with our current proposal . \n \\(i ) the authors in [ 30 ] proposed an _ \n incomplete _ \n scheme for realizing the @xmath3-qubit original dj algorithm using atoms coupled to a cavity , because they only discussed how to implement @xmath62 balanced function , which completes the state transformation from the input state @xmath63 to the output state @xmath64 , as shown in [ 30 ] . \n furthermore , this state transformation can be reached in a classical way , since it can be alternatively achieved by simply performing a single - qubit @xmath65 gate on each of individual qubits of the register . \n \\(ii ) in ref . \n [ 31 ] , a scheme was proposed for the implementation of the @xmath3-qubit original dj algorithm via atoms interacting with a cavity . as discussed there , to implement each of @xmath66 balanced functions \n , this scheme requires @xmath67 different @xmath3-qubit controlled - not gates each with @xmath68 qubits simultaneously controlling a target qubit . for a three - qubit dj algorithm , @xmath69 thus , by applying this scheme to realize each balanced function for a three - qubit dj algorithm , four different three - qubit controlled - not gates ( each with 2 qubits simultaneously controlling a target qubit ) would be required . \n \\(iii ) ref . \n [ 32 ] presented a way for implementing a 3-qubit refined dj algorithm with three atoms in cavity qed . \n this proposal is based on four three - qubit controlled phase gates ( each with 2 qubits simultaneously controlling a target qubit ) . in addition , as discussed in [ 32 ] , it is required to send three atoms through four cavities at the same time , or simultaneously sending the three atoms through a common cavity four times .    from the description given above , one can see that :    \\(i ) the present proposal is different from the previous one in [ 30 ] , since the latter is _ incomplete _ , which only considered realizing one balanced function that can be achieved in a classical way . \n in contrast to [ 30 ] , we have presented a _ \n complete _ protocol for implementing all 35 @xmath0-controlled phase gates for a three - qubit refined dj algorithm . \n \\(ii ) to implement a three - qubit dj algorithm , the proposal in [ 31 ] requires using four different three - qubit gates , and the one in [ 32 ] requires sending three atoms through a cavity four times or needs the use of four cavities . in contrast , it can be seen from table ii that our proposal needs three two - qubit cp gates at most , which can be implemented using a single cavity or resonator only , as discussed below . \n hence , when compared with the previous proposals in [ 31,32 ] , it is simple and easy to implement a three - qubit refined dj algorithm based on cavity qed , by using the present proposal . \n we point out that it is not our intention to cast aspersions on existing approaches [ 30 - 32 ] to the dj algorithm implementation ; rather we simply wish to present a protocol to implement a three - qubit refined dj algorithm .    as relevant to the cavity qed - based implementation of the present proposal , some points may need to be addressed here . \n first , the present proposal can be implemented with three superconducting qubits / qutrits placed in a single cavity or resonator . \n this is because during performing each two - qubit cp gate one can have the irrelevant qubit / qutrit to be decoupled from the cavity by adjusting its level spacings ( e.g. , see , [ 15,16 ] and discussion therein ) . \n second , it can be realized using three atoms plus a single cavity . during performing each two - qubit cp gate on atoms \n , the irrelevant atom can be made to be decoupled from the cavity , for instance , by moving it out of the cavity via translating optical lattices ( e.g. , see [ 16,28 ] ) . \n we have proposed a way to implement the three - qubit refined deutsch - jozsa quantum algorithm . \n the construction of the @xmath0-controlled phase gates can be applied to implement a three - qubit refined deutsch - jozsa algorithm in a cavity - based or noncavity - based physical system . \n this work is of interest because it provides a simple and general protocol for implementing a three - qubit refined deutsch - jozsa algorithm , which is an important step toward more complex quantum computation . \n c.p.y . was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 11074062 , the zhejiang natural science foundation under grant no . \n lz13a040002 , the open fund from the sklps of ecnu , and the funds from hangzhou normal university under grant no . \n q.p.s . was supported by zhejiang provincial natural science foundation of china ( grant no . \n lq12a05004 ) . \n j. q. you , f. nori , nature * 474 * , 589 ( 2011 ) ; physics today * 58 * ( 11 ) , 42 ( 2005 ) ; i. buluta , s. ashhab and f. nori , reports on progress in physics * 74 * , 104401 ( 2011 ) ; p.d . \n nation , j.r . \n johansson , m.p . \n blencowe and f. nori , rev . \n mod . phys . * 84 * , 1 ( 2012 ) ; z. l. xiang , s. ashhab , j.q . \n you and f. nori , rev . \n mod . phys . * 85 * , 623 ( 2013 ) . \n h. wang , l .- a . \n liu and f. nori , phys . rev . \n a * 82 * , 062303 ( 2010 ) ; h. wang , s. ashhab and f. nori , phys . \n a * 79 * , 042335 ( 2009 ) ; phys . \n a * 83 * , 062317 ( 2011 ) ; phys . \n a * 85 * , 062304 ( 2012 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 599564643467, "RequestID": "823c476e8e193b05130aa4a5c02484a64edcd7d3", "TotalTokens": 4102}

on nuclear disk of gas and dust with a diameter of @xmath1 pc , and a large - scale symmetric radio structure which implies that the radio axis is close to the plane of the sky . at an assumed distance of 40 mpc \n , 1 milliarcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to 0.2 pc . \n previous vlba observations of this galaxy revealed a parsec - scale radio jet and counterjet aligned with the kpc - scale jet ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . \n the opening angle of the jets is less than @xmath2 during the first 0.2 pc and @xmath3 during the first 0.8 pc . \n at 8.4 ghz we found evidence for a narrow gap in radio brightness at the base of the parsec - scale counterjet , just east ( left ) of the brightest peak which we identified as the core based on its inverted spectrum between 1.6 and 8.4 ghz ( see the left part of figure  [ fig2 ] , from jones and wehrle 1997 ) . \n we tentatively identified this gap as the signature of free - free absorption by a nearly - edge on inner disk with a width @xmath4 pc and an average electron density of @xmath5 over the inner 0.1 pc . \n we observed ngc 4261 at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz with halca and a ground array composed of 7 vlba antennas plus shanghai , kashima , and the dsn 70-m tidbinbilla antennas at 1.6 ghz ( 22 june 1999 ) and 8 vlba antennas plus the phased vla at 4.9 ghz ( 27 june 1999 ) . during \n both epochs the vlba antennas at st . \n croix and hancock were unavailable , as was the north liberty antenna at 1.6 ghz . \n data were recorded as two 16-mhz bandwidth channels with 2-bit sampling by the mark - iii / vlba systems and correlated at the vlba processor in socorro . \n both channels were sensitive to left circular polarization . \n fringe - fitting was carried out in aips after applying _ a priori _ amplitude calibration . \n for vlba antennas we used continuously measured system temperatures , for the vla we used measured @xmath6 values with an assumed source flux density of 5 jy , and for the remaining antennas we used typical gain and system temperature values obtained from the vsop web site . \n fringes were found to all antennas at 1.6 ghz except halca , but the signal / noise ratio to shanghai and kashima was very low and these data were not used . the _ a priori _ amplitude calibration for tidbinbilla was dramatically incorrect for unknown reasons . \n we calibrated tidbinbilla by imaging the compact structure of the source using vlba data , then holding the vlba antenna gains fixed and allowing the tidbinbilla gain to vary . \n this produced a good match in correlated flux density where the projected vlba and tidbinbilla baselines overlap . at 4.9 ghz fringes \n were found to all antennas , including halca . a similar correction to the _ a priori _ amplitude calibration for halca and the phased vla was applied .    in both observations we found that averaging in frequency over both 16-mhz channels in aips produced large , baseline - dependent amplitude reductions even though the post - fringe - fit visibility phases were flat and continuous between channels . averaging over frequency within each 16-mhz band \n separately fixed this problem . \n difmap was used for detailed data editing , self - calibration , and image deconvolution . \n both 16-mhz bands were combined during imaging . \n imaging within difmap used uniform weighting with the weight of halca data increased by a factor of 500 . \n several iterations of phase - only self calibration , followed by amplitude self calibration iterations with decreasing time scales , resulted in good fits ( @xmath7 ) between the source model and the data . \n although our image at 1.6 ghz does not include data from halca , it does have more than twice the angular resolution of our previous 1.6 ghz image ( jones and wehrle 1997 ) due to the addition of tidbinbilla . \n the previous image showed a symmetric structure , with the jet and counterjet extending west and east from the core . \n no evidence for absorption is seen in this image . \n however , with higher resolution we do detect a narrow gap in emission just east of the core , at the base of the counterjet . \n the width of the gap is less than 2 mas . \n we detected fringes to halca at 4.9 ghz when the projected earth - space baselines were less than one earth diameter . \n the halca data fills in the ( u , v ) coverage hole between continental vlba baselines and those to mauna kea , and also increases the north - south resolution by a factor of two . our 4.9 ghz image is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . \n note that the gap in emission is again seen just east of the peak . \n a careful comparison of brightness along the radio axis at 4.9 and 8.4 ghz shows that the gap is both deeper and wider at 4.9 ghz , as expected from free - free absorption . \n the region of the gap has a very inverted spectrum , the brightest peak ( core ) has a slightly less inverted spectrum , and the distant parts of both the jet and counterjet have steep spectra . \n our observations at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz appear to confirm the free - free absorption explanation for the sub - parsec radio morphology in ngc 4261 . \n measurements of the optical depth in the absorbed region and the distance between the absorption and the core as a function of frequency will allow the radial distribution of electron density in the inner parsec of the disk to be determined . \n we gratefully acknowledge the vsop pro -

{"ContextTokens": 3121, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "as discussed in some other talks in this symposium , low - energy final state scattering parametres have been the target of intense analyses of @xmath0-meson production in recent years . \n mostly the investigations aim at the extraction of the complex scattering length @xmath3 , where the real part is connected to the existence or nonexistence of a bound state . \n the definition common in meson physics @xmath4 requires a negative real part and @xmath5 ( more precisely including also the effective range @xmath6 > 0 $ ] @xcite ) . \n however , unfortunately the scattering cross section data alone can not give just the sign of this quantity . \n nevertheless , the magnitude of the energy of a bound state ( or a virtual state ) can be estimated from final state interaction ( fsi ) effects , though the existence can not . \n this was the original idea of ref . \n @xcite studying the relation in @xmath7he _ provided _ a bound state would exist . \n this work was recently extended to heavier nuclei @xcite , where the existence of bound states is less controversial and experiments are being performed ( see _ e.g. _ talks by gal , machner and wilkin in these proceedings ) . \n particularly suggestive is the possibly rapid change of the scattering lengths in @xmath7he and @xmath8he discussed by machner at the first symposium of this series @xcite . \n there the latter scattering length appears significantly smaller than the large @xmath9 , which would hint to a change of the sign ( of the real part ) , since one would expect more attraction in the heavier nucleus and thus either even larger scattering length ( for the nonbinding situation ) or a binding strength with undetermined size of the cross section and scattering length . \n however , the results seem to depend strongly on whether they are obtained with or without the effective range term of the low - energy expansion . \n this is discussed in subsec . \n [ efrange ]    the aim of this talk is to review and summarize the numerical relation of the complex binding energy to the complex scattering length and effective range . at the end \n some speculative extrapolation possibility is shortly played with . \n the basic idea is to employ various nuclear charge distributions @xmath10 in simple optical potentials @xmath11 where for each nucleus the strength parameters ( @xmath12 ) are freely varied to get a sufficient coverage to present the binding energy and width as contours in the @xmath13 plane . the normalization of the profiles shown in fig . \n [ profiles ] is chosen to the mass number as @xmath14 , so that in the simple impulse approximation optical model the strength @xmath15 would correspond to the elementary scattering length @xmath16 ( @xmath17 given in fm ) . \n however , it should be stressed that no claim is made about any absolute strength of the potential as in microscopic model works . \n the main purpose is to get _ the numerical connection of binding energies and widths to the scattering parameters _ , so that if the latter can be extracted from data , then a preliminary estimate could be obtained for the former . \n possibly this would be useful for planning experiments . in the spirit of the shape independence of @xmath18 forces \n , one might expect a more density profile independent connection between these quantities than in the direct relation to the potential of either of them . \n -wave binding energy @xmath19 contours for 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 mev in the complex @xmath20 plane . \n the solid line shows the zero energy , _ i.e. _ above it there is no binding . below the dashed line @xmath21.,width=472 ]    if the effective range term is included , then also the energy relation should include this and the low ( complex ) energy relation would be @xmath22 with @xmath23 the reduced mass of the system . in comparison with the actual exact results from solving equations of motion this relation \n was found to be much more accurate than keeping the first term alone . for binding energies up to @xmath24 mev and even beyond the accuracy of eq . \n [ relation ] was a few percent for the real part and about ten percent for the imaginary ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 taken from the calculation ) . \n this success can be attributed to the inclusion of a non - zero effective range @xmath26 and can be considered as an indication of the necessity of its inclusion also in data analyses . \n but for the imaginary part of the bound state energies @xmath27 , _ i.e. _ half widths . \n , width=472 ] \n going to heavier nuclei from @xmath7he carbon may be a representative compromise between the experimentally studied helium and magnesium isotopes . \n [ ereal ] shows the binding energy contours for five choices up to 20 mev . \n also shown are the zero energy limit and the borderline where @xmath21 . \n the latter is of interest as a measure of actually distinguishing any peak . to facilitate the complete connection fig . \n [ eimag ] shows also the contours of constant half - widths ( @xmath27 ) . \n the behaviour for a real potential is quite clear and understandable , but some peculiar features appear for strongly absorptive interactions . \n absorption , described by the imaginary part , acts in the bound system like a repulsion eating away the wave function in the attractive region : less wave function @xmath29 less attraction . \n so for increasing absorption the strength of also the attractive real part must be increased to stay on the equal - energy contours . \n however , as shown in ref . \n @xcite the effect of the imaginary part of the potential saturates in the scattering length and @xmath30 is not even monotonously increasing . \n therefore , the calculated points for the equidistant mesh of the potential strength become denser and denser with increasing absorption ( and stronger real part to remain at the same binding energy ) and eventually the contours turn back to left . \n however , in this region the states are so wide , anyway , that they may not be of experimental interest . furthermore , it may be worth noting that in the proximity of zero binding the widths tend to be large , significantly larger than the binding energy for the same @xmath31 without imaginary part at all . \n therefore , near threshold bound states may be hard to distinguish .    to get a more detailed picture of that behaviour and the general trend of increasing binding energies fig . \n [ mini ] shows a magnified detail of fig . \n [ ereal ] . \n it can be seen that the `` weak potential branch '' comes lower and lower in the @xmath30 direction and the opening angle between the `` branches '' decreases until they cross over at about 9 mev binding . \n so the 10 mev contour below the formal strong potential zero line belongs actually to the weaker couplings and 20 mev has gone even further . \n the behaviour seen in figs . \n [ ereal ] and [ eimag ] is very similar to that of @xmath7he @xcite and also @xmath8he and @xmath32 mg @xcite especially for large @xmath33 and `` weak potential branch '' dictated mainly by just the binding energy term in eq . \n [ relation ] . \n the next section discusses the potential dependence through the effective range , which in turn depends naturally on the size of the nucleus . \n , width=472 ]      from relation [ relation ] it is clear that at least with `` realish '' ( dominantly real ) quantities for a negative @xmath25 ( consequently also negative @xmath3 ) and a positive effective range the two terms on the left hand side tend to cancel making @xmath34 smaller and @xmath3 bigger . due to \n this cancellation @xmath3 is quite sensitive on the inclusion of the second term . \n this expectation is actually seen in drastic changes of the data analyses from refs . \n @xcite giving the scattering lengths shown in table [ scattlen ] . clearly leaving the effective range out \n may give scattering lengths even less than one half of their true values and consequently grossly overestimated binding energies . \n this is confirmed in the calculations and by eq . \n [ relation ] .    consequently \n , it is clear that consistency in estimating the possible binding energy from the more advanced scattering analyses needs also the effective range term . \n if one takes for example the scattering lengths for @xmath35he above , leaving that away and making the standard estimate for possible binding energy , the first one ( without @xmath26 ) would give about 4 mev and the second ( with @xmath26 ) 1 mev . \n however , from fig . [ ereal ] the results for \n these two @xmath3 s would be 10 mev and 2 mev , correspondingly , the second being preferable . \n ( the result for @xmath8he , fig . 8 of ref . \n @xcite , is very nearly the same as @xmath2c for such weak binding due to shape independence . \n practically only the region of the `` turning point '' tends to move left towards larger @xmath36 with increasing @xmath37 and right for decreasing . )    because of the apparent importance of the effective range ref . \n @xcite gives a parametrization of the complex @xmath26 in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering length . \n [ scattlen ]    .scattering lengths in fm from data with and without the effective range term . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      although the aim of this talk is not to promote a definite potential model , it may still be tempting to speculate by interpreting the strength parametres @xmath31 and @xmath38 in eq . \n ( [ optical ] ) to be the real and imaginary parts of the basic @xmath39 scattering length @xmath16 in a first order optical potential as done in _ \n e.g. _ ref . \n ( or they might represent some more general strengths perhaps extracted from microscopic nuclear models . ) then the strength @xmath40 fm , @xmath41 fm would support a barely bound state in @xmath8he , which would mean that all standard values of re @xmath16 ranging roughly between 0.4 fm and 0.7 fm could have the potential for binding in this nucleus . for this basic strength \n the binding energy in @xmath2c would be 8 mev and in @xmath32 mg 14 mev . to produce a barely bound state in the three nuclei considered above the fitted strength @xmath42 fm \n would be needed as shown by the squares and the dashed curve in fig . \n [ adep ] ( also @xmath7he is shown ) .    . \n , width=472 ]    however , @xmath16 is complex and as another example , assuming more realistically @xmath43 ( roughly true for most @xmath16 in the literature ) , @xmath44 fm would just bind the @xmath45he system and the corresponding binding energies would be 15 mev and 22 mev for @xmath2c and @xmath32 mg , respectively \n . their half - widths would be about the same as their binding energies ; in the case of @xmath8he the half - width would be 12 mev . in this case \n the barely binding strength could be parametrized as @xmath46 fm ( the circular dots and the solid curve ) . \n it may be of further interest to remind that the depth of a square well potential producing a zero binding energy should behave like @xmath47 . \n in this work a phenomenological connection between the low energy scattering length and the complex binding energy of possible eta - nuclear bound states has been studied in a simple but probably realistic model . \n the hope is that the results could be useful in searches of these bound states , if more easily accessible final state data are available to make predictions where to look for the states . \n the binding energies are explicitly presented as contours in the complex @xmath3 plane for the @xmath2c ( also for @xmath8he and @xmath32 mg in ref . \n it is seen that the connection is very closely the same and systematic for relatively different density profiles , from which it is easy to interpolate and even extrapolate to other nuclei . \n the calculations suggest that for even relatively moderate values of the absorptive potential and of the imaginary parts of the scattering lengths , the states can be wide especially compared with the real depths of the states . in view of also many other theoretical results , starting from the elementary @xmath39 scattering and predicting negative real parts for the scattering length but with rather large imaginary parts , \n the observation of such bound states might be difficult or even impossible . \n however , in the minireview @xcite of the situation a reanalysis of the existing data on @xmath48he final states made very small values of the imaginary part appear plausible , so that also the possible bound states may not necessarily be as wide as most theoretical works would indicate .    in our work for @xmath30 less than 2 fm with @xmath49 larger than , \n say , 5 fm a bound state should be recognizable . in the case of more likely smaller scattering lengths @xmath50 \n fm would be necessary . \n for the assessment of possible distinguishable bound states fig . \n [ ereal ] indicates the region where the half width is less than the binding energy . experimentally in this respect the result @xmath51 fm and @xmath52 fm for @xmath8he of ref . \n @xcite is quite interesting and suggestive . if @xmath53 is really larger than for @xmath54he scattering , it is difficult to see how this could be true for a more attractive but still unbinding system . \n the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath25 is very robust against potential differences even between different nuclides over a wide range once also the non - zero effective range is taken into account . \n therefore , due to this shape independence one may trust the results to be valid by interpolation also for the @xmath55 nuclei of recent experimental interest @xcite . \n + i thank pawel moskal for the invitation and kind hospitality at the symposium and hip for a travel grant . \n 99 a. sibirtsev , j. haidenbauer , j. a. niskanen , u. meissner , _ phys . \n c _ * 70 * , 047001 ( 2004 ) . \n j. a. niskanen , h. machner , _ nucl . \n phys . a _ * 902 * , 40 ( 2013 ) . \n h. machner , _ acta phys . \n polonica b _ * 41 * , 2221 ( 2010 ) . \n j.  smyrski , _ \n _ , _ phys . \n * b 649 * ( 2007 ) 258 .", "StartTimeOffset": 633887580716, "RequestID": "96829f461a0deecaebda0948396bc3ee8f2f2f4c", "TotalTokens": 3250}

on rotating disk . in that case \n the maser brightness at displacements @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the position and velocity of the line - of - sight ( los ) diameter is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the background continuum and @xmath18 the maser ( negative ) optical depth . \n irrespective of the disk annuli where the masers reside , the peak emission will always occur at @xmath19 , which picks out the largest optical depth . \n with brightness temperature of @xmath20  k for the background continuum , the function @xmath21 $ ] is a measured quantity . \n we find @xmath22 and 15.99 for the 6.7- and 12.2ghz masers , respectively . \n consider an edge - on rotating disc at distance @xmath23 and a point at radius @xmath24 along a path with displacement @xmath14 . \n the rotation velocity @xmath25 and its los component @xmath15 obey @xmath26 , the angular velocity . in keplerian rotation @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the outer radius and @xmath30 the central mass . assume a gaussian frequency profile for the maser absorption coefficient and denote the radial variation of its magnitude at line center by the normalized profile @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . \n then where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is distance along the path . the width  is taken as constant , although it could vary with @xmath35 because of temperature variation and maser saturation . \n saturation typically requires @xmath36 1015 across the disc radius , and the broadening of the absorption profile is then proportional to length in excess of this threshold ( @xcite ) . \n if the disc is located in front of the background source then the overall amplification with @xmath37  18 implies an optical depth of only 9 across the radius , too low for saturation . \n if the radio continuum is centered on the star then the optical depth across the radius is  18 and saturation can be expected to have an effect , but only at the very outer segments of the disc where a decrease in temperature could have an opposite , offsetting effect . \n we will consider these effects in a future publication . \n ( see eq . \n [ eq : tau ] ) for a keplerian disc with = 0.40  around a 30  star , viewed edge - on from @xmath23 = 2.7 kpc . \n constant maser absorption coefficient between radii  = 378au ( 014 ) and  = 1080au ( 04 ) . ] \n we parameterize @xmath38 with a power law @xmath39 from an inner radius @xmath40 to . both  and  are set directly from @xmath41 . \n modeling the full @xmath18 requires two free parameters for the integrand ( and @xmath42 ) and two for the integration limits (  and @xmath43 ) . \n figure [ fig : bv_tot ] shows contour plots of @xmath18 for a representative keplerian disc around a 30  protostar with the  determined from the 12.2 ghz data at @xmath44 . \n the system is viewed edge - on at the adopted distance to ngc7538 .    the lowest contour ( 3% ) \n outlines the angular velocity @xmath45 on the disk boundaries . \n the shallow segments of this contour ( lower branch for @xmath46 ) trace out the disk outer radius . \n the steeper ones trace the inner radius when @xmath47 and the mid - line when @xmath48 , where the keplerian @xmath49 is evident . along any path at @xmath50 , \n the velocity varies from  = @xmath51 on  to  = @xmath52 on . \n as long as @xmath53 , the full path remains velocity coherent and the maximal @xmath37 is centered on the velocity determined from @xmath54 . \n this yields @xmath55 where @xmath56 , an average dominated by the high angular velocity of the inner regions ; for example , constant @xmath38 gives @xmath57 . \n the linear relation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 is evident in the uniform inclination of the innermost contours . \n the condition @xmath58 is met at a displacement , and @xmath37 gets contributions from only a fraction of the path when @xmath59 . since the longest coherence is at the outer radius , where @xmath60 is smallest \n , the @xmath37-contours bend toward lower velocities as is evident in the figure around @xmath61 . \n this bending reflects the change from inner - edge to outer - edge dominance of longest coherence . as @xmath14 increases further beyond , the longest coherent segment moves from the outer radius to the disc mid - line . \n the maximal @xmath37 begins to increase , creating the local outer maximum evident in the 50% contours at @xmath62 before final truncation at @xmath63 . \n this discussion shows that the contours of highest amplification , down to 70% of @xmath64 , contain dependence on @xmath42 , @xmath65 and @xmath60 but not on . \n this has two important consequences : ( 1 ) successful modeling of the strongest maser emission requires one less parameter . \n ( 2 ) since @xmath60 involves only the combination @xmath66 , the central mass can not be determined without observations of ( exponentially weaker ) radiation close to the phase - space boundary to determine . \n -variation of frequency - integrated brightness ( left ) and @xmath15-variation of the flux ( right ) . in both diagrams the log of the quantities \n solid lines show the data , dashed lines the model . \n bottom : contour plots of @xmath67 , the data to the left , the model to the right . \n the contours of the model have been obtained from the exponential of eq . \n [ eq : tau ] . \n contours are 5,10,30,50,70,90% of peak . \n the slope of the diagonal line is in /mas . ] \n brightness measurements with dynamic range @xmath68 map the @xmath37-distribution between @xmath64 and @xmath69 . \n with @xmath70 = 15.99 and @xmath71 , the 12.2ghz data traces the @xmath37-contours in down to 70% of peak . \n therefore the data shown in the lower left map of figure [ fig : fit ] cover only the two innermost contours in figure [ fig : bv_tot ] , and if our model is applicable it should require only the three parameters @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath42 . \n in fact , the first two can be determined quite accurately even without detailed modeling since the bend in the @xmath37-contours occurs at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . \n we find directly that @xmath65 = 0.39 and  = 0.037/mas , implying @xmath75 and leaving @xmath42 as the only free parameter to match all other data points in the @xmath76-plane . \n sensible fits to the 12.2ghz data are obtained when @xmath77 and @xmath78 . \n the lower right panel of figure [ fig : fit ] shows the model map for @xmath79 , the top panels show how well the fitting of @xmath18 reproduces the brightness profile and the spectrum . \n the negative @xmath42 means that @xmath38 , i.e. , the maser absorption coefficient , increases with radius . \n the relation between @xmath38 and overall density involves the product of the methanol abundance , the fraction of methanol in the maser system and the fractional inversion . \n any of these factors might give more weight to the disk outer regions . \n considering the simple power law with sharp cutoffs we employ , a 70% increase in @xmath38 across the disk is compatible with a constant density profile . \n our model is equally successful in fitting the main 6.7ghz maser emission , as is evident from figure [ fig : fit_6.7 ] . \n the value of @xmath42 is the same for this maser , the only slightly different parameters are  = 18.32 , @xmath65=0.38 and  = 0.037 km / s / mas . \n the value for was taken from the 12.2ghz maser , which is considered to be more reliable because of the higher spatial resolution . \n good fits of the 6.7ghz data are obtained when @xmath80 and @xmath81 . \n the virtual identity of the disc segments of such different masing transitions is an important challenge for class ii methanol pumping calculations .     for the 6.7ghz maser . ] \n the analysis presented here shows that a keplerian disk explains successfully , down to minute details , the main methanol maser feature in . \n the angular velocity we find implies a disk outer radius of 1000au if the central mass is 30 , as determined by @xcite . \n the methanol maser emission covers a substantial area of the disk , with the radius varying by a factor of 3 . \n the @xmath18-contours display a bend in the position - velocity diagram . since @xmath82 , a straight line in this diagram implies a constant @xmath83 , i.e. , either a single radius or , in the case of an extended region , solid - body rotation . \n our analysis therefore uncovers a unique signature of differential rotation in the disc . \n the emission s smooth structure and the observation s high sensitivity are crucial for this detection , which is made well inside the  1.2  width of the spectral feature ( see top right panels in figures [ fig : fit ] and [ fig : fit_6.7 ] ) . \n these requirements preclude detection of the effect in extragalactic sources and explain why it could not be considered in the analysis of the h@xmath84o maser disc in ngc4258 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n however , a bend in the position - velocity diagram has been found in thermal line emission from low - mass stars and interpreted as steep - gradient solid - body rotation inside a shallow - gradient keplerian outer region ( @xcite ) . since maser and optically thin thermal emission , which is directly proportional to optical depth , \n share the same kinematic structure , our analysis shows there is no need to invoke additional components on top of keplerian rotation . \n our analysis is valid for a radio continuum source placed either behind the maser disc or at its center . \n the latter possibility would fit well in the context of disc photoevaporation models ( @xcite ) . in that case \n , the radial extent of disc photoevaporation by the central star in ngc7538 covers the entire maser region and could activate both methanol formation and the observed outflow , responsible for the radio continuum . \n the maser location at the outflow waistline makes this scenario especially attractive . \n the methanol maser data determines detailed disc properties with high precision yet the central mass remains undetermined since it requires the outer radius . and  is still unobservable because the angular extent of the detected emission does not trace the full disk , instead it is controlled by velocity coherence and the dynamic range of the observations . \n the amplification opacity at the disk outer edge ( see fig .  [ \n fig : bv_tot ] ) is 50% of the central peak level . \n with @xmath37 = 16 ( 18 ) at the center , detection of the outer peak requires a dynamic range of 3000 ( 8100 ) if the radio source is located behind the maser disc , placing it beyond the reach of the current observations by a factor of  30 ( 80 ) . \n the requirements become even more severe if the continuum is centered on the star . \n the 6.7ghz outlier features therefore can not correspond to the outer peak of our model disc . \n instead , these outliers are probably the first detection of enhanced amplification by small inhomogeneities in an otherwise rather smooth disc . \n such non - axisymmetric distortions of the disk surface , and their possible effect on the pumping , have been proposed by @xcite . \n it should be possible , though , to determine  by probing the boundary of the ( @xmath85 ) region at @xmath86 along the @xmath15-axis or another direction such as the normal to . \n we will study these issues in detail in a future publication . \n this study provides one of the few pieces of evidence to date for a compact ( @xmath3 au ) disc around a massive protostar . \n it seems certain , though , that not all class ii methanol masers occur in discs . even in itself , \n the weaker methanol masers to the south , which are associated with other maser species ( oh , h@xmath87o etc ) , are likely to arise from an outflow . \n the interpretation of ordered lines of methanol masers in terms of disc or outflow models must be decided case by case with detailed modeling . \n -3ex m. pestalozzi thanks his fellow phd student rodrigo parra for the useful discussions and for all the useful matlab tricks . \n m. elitzur thanks the nsf for its support and chalmers university for a jubileum professor award that triggered a most enjoyable visit to onsala . \n the reduced 12.2ghz data cube was kindly made available by vincent minier .", "StartTimeOffset": 650273304007, "RequestID": "733727844acfa73428dca6a2e79fee8c4ff62591", "TotalTokens": 4058}
{"ContextTokens": 3623, "GeneratedTokens": 236, "SynthesizedBody": "the prisoner s dilemma game , consisting of cooperation and defection as the two competing strategies , is considered a paradigm for studying the emergence of cooperation between selfish individuals @xcite . since the game promises a defecting individual the highest income if facing a cooperator the prevalence of cooperation within this theoretical framework presents a formidable challenge . \n indeed , the classical well - mixed prisoner s dilemma game completely fails to sustain cooperation @xcite , which is often at odds with reality where mutual cooperation may also be the final outcome of the game @xcite . \n a seminal theoretical mechanism for cooperation within the prisoner s dilemma game was introduced by nowak and may @xcite , who showed that the spatial structure and nearest neighbor interactions enable cooperators to form clusters on the spatial grid and so protect themselves against exploitation by defectors . a decade later , this theoretical prediction has been confirmed by biological experiments @xcite . \n nonetheless , the somewhat fragile ability of the spatial structure to support cooperation @xcite , along with the difficulties associated with payoff rankings in experimental and field work @xcite , has made it a common starting point for further refinements of cooperation facilitating mechanisms . \n in particular , the specific topology of networks defining the interactions among players has recently received substantial attention @xcite , and specifically scale - free graphs @xcite have been recognized as extremely potent promoters of cooperative behavior in the prisoner s dilemma as well as the snowdrift game @xcite . \n although the promotion of cooperation by the scale - free topology has been found robust on several factors @xcite , the mechanism has recently been contested via the introduction of normalized payoffs or so - called participation costs @xcite . moreover , \n the interplay between the evolution of cooperation as well as that of the interaction network has also been studied @xcite , and it has been discovered that intentional rewiring in accordance with the preference and fitness of each individual as well as simple random rewiring of the interaction network might both have a beneficial effect on the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma and the snowdrift game . for a comprehensive review of this field of research see @xcite .    besides studies addressing network complexity as a somewhat direct extension of @xcite , \n several approaches have also been proposed that warrant the promotion of cooperation within nearest neighbor interactions . \n examples include strategic complexity @xcite , direct and indirect reciprocity @xcite , asymmetry of learning and teaching activities @xcite , random diffusion of agents on the grid @xcite , as well as fine - tuning of noise and uncertainties by strategy adoption @xcite . \n the impact of asymmetric influence , introduced via a special player with a finite density of directed random links to others , on the dynamics of the prisoner s dilemma game on small - world networks has also been studied @xcite . \n it is worth noting that stochasticity in general , either being introduced directly or emerging spontaneously due to finite population sizes @xcite , has been found crucial by several aspects of various evolutionary processes .    in this paper , we wish to extend the scope of stochastic effects on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game by introducing the social diversity of players as their extrinsically determined property . \n this is realized by introducing scaling factors that determine the mapping from game payoffs to the fitness of each individual . \n the scaling factors represent extrinsic differences amongst players , and as such determine their social status and the overall social diversity on the spatial grid . \n importantly , the scaling factors are drawn randomly from different distributions and are determined only once at the beginning of the game . \n positive scaling factors increase the magnitude of payoffs a particular player is able to exchange , while negative factors have the opposite effect . \n it is important to note that the average of all scaling factors is exactly zero , so that there is no net contribution of social diversity to the total payoff of the population . \n presently , we consider scaling factors drawn from the uniform , exponential , and scale - free distribution , and thus distinguish three different cases of social diversity . \n we investigate how the introduction of social diversity , and in particular its distribution and amplitude , affect the evolution of cooperation amongst players on the spatial grid . \n we report below that the cooperation is enhanced markedly as the amplitude of social diversity increases , and moreover , that the biggest enhancement is obtained if the social diversity follows a power - law distribution . \n we attribute the enhancement of cooperation to the emergence of cooperative clusters , which are controlled by high - ranking players that are able to prevail against the defectors even if the temptation to defect is large . indeed , the role of these clusters is similar to the role of pure cooperator neighborhoods around hubs on scale - free networks @xcite , or to the part of imitating followers surrounding master players in the enhanced teaching activity model @xcite , as will be clarified later . to highlight the importance of the strongly diverse social rank , we also study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity , and find that the facilitation of the cooperative strategy deteriorates as the correlation length increases . \n thus , a finite spatial correlation of social diversity hinders the formation of strong cooperative clusters , in turn lending support to the validity of the reported cooperation - facilitating mechanism in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . \n section ii is devoted to the description of the spatial prisoner s dilemma game and the properties of scaling factors determining social diversity of players on the spatial grid . in section \n iii we present the results of numerical simulations , and in section iv we summarize the results and outline some biological implications of our findings . \n we consider an evolutionary two - strategy prisoner s dilemma game with players located on vertices of a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions . \n each individual is allowed to interact only with its four nearest neighbors , and self - interactions are excluded . a player located on the lattice site @xmath1 can change its strategy @xmath2 after each full iteration cycle of the game . \n the performance of player @xmath1 is compared with that of a randomly chosen neighbor @xmath3 and the probability that its strategy changes to @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 } \\,\\ \n , , \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 characterizes the uncertainty related to the strategy adoption process , serving to avoid trapped conditions and enabling smooth transitions towards stationary states . \n the payoffs @xmath7 and @xmath8 of both players acquired during each iteration cycle are calculated in accordance with the standard prisoner s dilemma scheme @xcite , according to which the temptation to defect @xmath9 , reward for mutual cooperation @xmath10 , punishment for mutual defection @xmath11 , and the sucker s \n payoff @xmath12 . \n importantly , throughout this work the original prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking ( @xmath13 ) is applicable since the introduction of social diversity via scaling factors only acts as a mapping of the original payoffs to individual fitness , as will be described next .    ) \n originating from the uniformly distributed random variable ( @xmath14 ) . \n the three functions correspond to uniform ( u ) , exponential ( e ) , and power - law ( p ) distribution when @xmath15 . for easier comparison only the @xmath16 $ ] interval of @xmath17 is plotted.,width=321 ] \n to introduce social diversity we use rescaled payoffs of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is either @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a scaling factor drawn randomly from a given distribution for each participating player @xmath1 only once before the start of the simulation . \n note that the minimum of the two random scaling factors involved at every instance of the game is used for payoffs of both involved players @xmath1 and @xmath3 to ensure that the prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking is preserved . \n it is worth mentioning that the maximum of both values would have had the same effect , but below presented results are virtually independent of this technicality , and moreover , it seems reasonable to assume that the higher - ranking player ( the one with the larger value of @xmath17 ) will adjust to the weaker one since the latter simply can not match the stakes of the game otherwise . within this study \n we consider the uniform ( also known as rectangular ) , exponential , and power - law distributed social diversity defined by the following functions : @xmath26 here @xmath14 are uniformly distributed random numbers from the unit interval , and @xmath27 in all cases , so that the average of @xmath17 over all the players is zero . \n it is easy to see that the largest difference between the exponential and power - law function can be obtained if @xmath28 in the latter , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . \n henceforth we use @xmath29 when the power - law distribution is applied . \n the parameter @xmath30 determines the amplitude of undulation of the scaling factors , and hence the dispersion of social diversity , and can occupy any value from the unit interval . \n in particular , @xmath31 returns the original payoffs , whereas @xmath15 is the maximally allowed value that still preserves @xmath32 for all @xmath1 , thus preventing possible violations of the prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking . \n note that @xmath33 could induce @xmath34 , which would directly violate the rules of the prisoner s dilemma game . \n the spatial distributions of the three considered cases obtained by @xmath15 are demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] where cross - sections with linear system size @xmath35 are plotted . \n clearly , the uniform distribution provides the gentlest dispersion of social diversity , whereas the largest segregation of players is warranted by the power - law distributed scaling factors where some values are very high at the expense of extended regions of very small @xmath17 resulting in these players having much smaller payoffs as compared to the non - scaled case . \n the exponential distribution of scaling factors yields a dispersion of social diversity that is between the uniform and the power - law case , as can be inferred from fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , as well as indirectly also from fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] .     when uniform ( u ) , exponential ( e ) , and power - law ( p ) distributed values of scaling factors were used . \n lines show an exemplary cross - section of the two - dimensional grid.,width=321 ]    in order to explain the main features of the reported results , we also use spatially correlated social diversity so that the scaling factors @xmath25 satisfy the correlation function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the spatial correlation length . in this case \n we constrain our study to the case where @xmath25 are drawn from a uniform distribution within the interval @xmath16 $ ] . \n an efficient algorithm for the generation of spatially correlated random numbers with a prescribed correlation length is given in @xcite . \n the effect of different values of @xmath37 on the scaling factors determining social diversity is demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . clearly , the random undulations become more and more correlated across neighbors on the spatial grid as @xmath37 increases .    before the start of each game simulation , both strategies populate the spatial grid uniformly and the scaling factors are drawn randomly from a given distribution to determine the social diversity of participating players . \n after these initial conditions are set , the spatial prisoner s dilemma game is iterated forward in time using a synchronous update scheme , thus letting all individuals interact pairwise with their four nearest neighbors . after every iteration cycle of the game , all players simultaneously update their strategy according to eq . \n [ eq : prob ] . to avoid finite - size effects , \n the simulations were carried out for a population of @xmath38 players , and the equilibrium frequencies of cooperators were obtained by averaging over @xmath39 iterations after a transient of @xmath40 iteration cycles of the game . \n the figures showing values of cooperator densities on the spatial grid ( @xmath41 ) resulted from an average over @xmath42 simulations with different realizations of social diversity as specified by the appropriate parameters . \n these simulation parameters yield at least @xmath43 % accurate values of @xmath41 in all figures .     and spatial correlation length @xmath44 ( bottom ) , @xmath45 ( middle ) , and @xmath46 ( top ) . \n lines show an exemplary cross - section of the two - dimensional grid.,width=321 ] \n next , we study how different distributions of social diversity affect the evolution of cooperation via numerical simulations of the above - described spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n figure  [ fig : fig4 ] features color - coded @xmath41 for all three types of social diversity in the relevant @xmath47 parameter space . \n evidently , regardless of the distribution , increasing values of @xmath30 clearly promote cooperation as the threshold of cooperation extinction increases from @xmath48 in the absence of social diversity to @xmath49 ( uniformly distributed social diversity ) , @xmath50 ( exponentially distributed social diversity ) , and @xmath51 ( power - law distributed social diversity ) . \n moreover , there always exists a broad range in the parameter space within which cooperators rule completely ; a non - existent feature if @xmath31 . \n we argue that the above - reported facilitation of cooperation is due to the induced inhomogeneous social state of players that fosters cooperative clusters around players with the largest values of @xmath25 . indeed \n , as soon as cooperators overtake these prime spots of the grid they start to spread due to their cluster - forming nature . \n note that the latter feature is not associated with defectors who therefore fail to take the same advantage out of social diversity , and are thus defeated . \n a similar behavior underlies also the cooperation - facilitating mechanism reported for the scale - free networks , where the players with the largest connectivity dominate the game . \n since cooperators are much better equipped for permanently sustaining the occupation of hubs , the scale - free networks provide a unifying framework for the evolution of cooperation @xcite . \n an even better similarity can be established with the model incorporating the inhomogeneous teaching activity @xcite . in the latter , \n some players are blocked and therefore unable to donate their strategies , which results in homogeneous cooperative domains around players with full teaching capabilities . \n in the presently studied model , the introduction of social diversity partly results in a similar suppression of selected players , especially so for the power - law distributed case where the majority of players are low - ranking , as demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . \n these players can form an obedient domain around a high - ranking player and so prevail against defectors . on the other hand , \n a high - ranking defector will be weakened by the low - ranking players who follow its destructive strategy . \n the above - described feedback works only if the high - ranking defectors can be linked solely by their follower neighborhoods ; namely there must not be a strong connection with other high - ranking players . in the opposite case \n , the heterogeneous strategy distribution supports the survival of defectors . to support our explanation \n , we study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity on the evolution of cooperation . according to our argument \n , the transition from uncorrelated to spatially correlated diversity should be marked with the deterioration of cooperation . \n we thus introduce spatially correlated social diversity as described in section ii , and study the effect of different @xmath37 on the evolution of cooperation . \n figure  [ fig : fig5 ] features the results . in agreement with our conjecture , \n the facilitation of cooperation deteriorates fast as @xmath37 increases . \n indeed , a near linear decrease of the critical @xmath52 marking the extinction of cooperators can be established , and moreover , by large @xmath37 the cooperators can outperform defectors only for slightly higher values of @xmath52 than in the absence of social diversity ( @xmath31 ) . \n this result supports the validity of the reported cooperation - facilitating mechanism , and hopefully paves the way for additional studies incorporating social diversity into the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory . \n in this paper , we show that social diversity is an efficient promoter of cooperation in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n the facilitative effect increases with the dispersion of social diversity and deteriorates with the increase of its spatial correlation . \n accordingly , spatially uncorrelated power - law distributed social diversity provides the biggest boost to the cooperative strategy . \n we argue that the facilitative effect is conceptually similar to the one reported previously for inhomogeneous teaching activities , and also has the same root as the mechanism applicable by scale - free networks , namely : akin to hubs or players with enhanced teaching activity , in this model , high - ranking players can form robust cooperative clusters with low - ranking obedient neighbors . \n the presented results suggest that the distribution of wealth plays a crucial role by the evolution of cooperation amongst egoistic individuals , and it seems reasonable to investigate further whether a co - evolution of both might yield new insights and foster the understanding of the formation of complex societies . \n this work was supported by the slovenian research agency ( z1 - 9629 ) ( m. p. ) and the hungarian national research fund ( t-47003 ) ( a. s. ) . \n discussions with gyrgy szab are gratefully acknowledged . \n we also thank girish nathan for useful comments .", "StartTimeOffset": 658501830619, "RequestID": "a6f5a712f81ed5e92c0c9ba2c30c68ecf5190c6a", "TotalTokens": 3859}
{"ContextTokens": 3888, "GeneratedTokens": 209, "SynthesizedBody": "a total colouring of a simple graph is a simultaneous assignment of labels to its vertices and edges such that adjacent vertices get distinct colours , adjacent edges get distinct colours and the colour of each edge is distinct from the colours of its endpoint vertices ( or equivalently the colour of each vertex is distinct from the colours of its incident edges ) . \n it is thus a combination of a proper vertex colouring , a proper edge colouring and a further restriction on the interplay between these colourings . \n the notion of total colouring was introduced by behzad [ 2 ] and vizing [ 8 ] and those papers also conjectured that @xmath1 . \n it is immediate that @xmath2 , since a vertex of maximum degree and its incident edges must all get distinct colours . \n a lot of work has been done on total colouring , based on frugal colouring , the list colouring conjecture etc .    in this work \n our aim is not to make headway in the total colouring problem but rather to get a complete characterisation of the class of total graphs of simple graphs . towards this end , we of course need a precise definition of what we mean by the total graph of a given graph , which is an existing concept . \n this also brings along the concept of line graphs . \n the vertex set of the total graph of a simple graph can be partitioned into two sets , one corresponding to the vertex set of the original graph ( inverse total graph ) and the other the line graph of the original graph , with crossing edges between these two vertex sets . \n a result characterising total graphs was obtained by behzad [ 1 ] in 1970 , and earlier works obtained interesting properties on this class of graphs [ 4 ] . \n the fact that any total graph has a unique preimage under the inverse total graph operator was proved by [ 3 ] . \n we obtain a new characterisation of total graphs based on the induced subgraphs on the neighbourhood of maximum degree vertices . \n these characterisations allow us to distinguish vertex vertices from edge vertices among the vertices of maximum degree . using this characterisation \n , we develop an efficient algorithm which iteratively creates the partition of the vertex set of the candidate total graph into its inverse total graph and line graph . \n the paper is organised as follows . \n

sectotalcomplete ] presents our results for special classes , the most elegant among which is the explicit construction for complete graphs . in section  [ sectotgrachar ] \n we present our theorems characterising the two classes of vertices and develop our theorem into an algorithm for reconstructing the inverse total graph of a given total graph . \n we summarise our work and indicate possible future directions for research in section  [ secconcl ] . \n in this section we present the basic definitions and notation we use throughout the paper . \n all graphs we consider are finite , simple , undirected and connected . \n this problem for graphs with more than one component are strsaightforward extensions of the connected case . \n [ deflngr ] the * line graph * @xmath3 of a graph @xmath4 is defined as the graph with vertex set having one vertex corresponding to each edge in @xmath5 and an edge between two vertices of @xmath3 precisely when the edges of @xmath5 that those vertices correspond to , have a common endpoint . \n not all graphs are line graphs of a simple graph ( or for that matter even of a multigraph ) . \n the line graph of a graph is however well defined , and results in a unique graph . \n the concept of line graph can thus be viewed as a non - surjective function from the set of simple graphs to the set of simple graphs . when we limit attention to connected simple graphs , it is further known that this function is almost injective . \n there is only one pair of distinct graphs with the same line graph namely the three vertex cycle @xmath6 and the three leaf star @xmath7 both of whose line graphs are @xmath6 . \n thus it is an interesting question both combinatorially and algorithmically as to which graphs are line graphs of some simple graph , and computing the inverse - line graph ( the preimage under the line graph function ) for those graphs which are line graphs [ 6 ] iterating the line graph operator and its inverse , as well as properties of the resulting sequence of graphs has also been studied extensively in the literature [ 5][7 ]    an obvious application of the concept of line graphs is to translate edge colouring problems into equivalent vertex colouring problems on the line graph . \n similarly , we define the total graph of a graph . again \n , this transformation renders a total colouring problem on a graph into a vertex colouring problem on an equivalent graph . \n the total graph concept can also be viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs . \n it has been established that the total graph viewed as a function from the class of graphs to the class of graphs is injective . \n [ deftotgr ] the total graph @xmath8 of a graph @xmath4 has as vertex set one vertex for each edge and vertex in @xmath5 . \n two vertices in @xmath8 are adjacent precisely when the elements ( vertex or edge ) of @xmath5 they represent are adjacent / incident to each other in @xmath5 . \n [ defnvertcatg ] thus the vertex set of the total graph of a graph can be partitioned into :    1 . \n the vertices of the original graph @xmath9we call such a vertex a * vertex vertex*@xmath10 2 . \n the vertices of the line graph @xmath9we call such a vertex an * edge vertex*@xmath10 . \n [ defmixclq ] a * mixed clique * in a total graph is a clique which has at least one vertex from the set of vertex vertices and at least one vertex from the set of edge vertices in a valid partition of the total graph into the inverse total graph and its line graph . \n [ defnpureclq]a * pure clique * in a total graph is a clique consisting exclusively of vertex vertices or exclusively of edge vertices . \n the vertex set of a total graph @xmath11 has a partition into two disjoint sets , such that the induced subgraph on one part is the inverse total graph @xmath5 and the other is the line graph @xmath3 . in several total graphs , \n this partitioning is non - unique , but the different partitions are all isomporphic to each other . \n these are called the vertex part and the edge part respectively . the bipartite subgraph induced by \n the division as above is 2-regular on vertices in the edge part . \n this is because each edge in the inverse total graph has precisely two endpoints . \n thus an algorithm for computing the inverse total graph of a given graph ( if it is a total graph ) is based on finding such a division or partition of the vertex set . \n [ thmmixedclq ] the largest mixed clique consisting of at least two vertex vertices is in a total graph is of size 3 . \n consider a clique consisting of three vertex vertices . clearly there is no edge in any graph incident to three distinct vertices . \n hence this clique can not be augmented to include any edge vertices , and thus is not the subset of any mixed clique . \n it follows that a mixed clique can consist of at most two adjacent vertex vertices . in this case \n this can be augmented by only one vertex , the edge vertex representing the link between these two adjacent vertex vertices . \n @xmath12    thus a maximal mixed clique is either :    * a vertex vertex and all its adjacent edge vertices ; or * two adjacent vertex vertices and the connecting edge vertex .    in summary , \n a maximal mixed clique is either of size 3 or of size @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the degree of its only vertex vertex in the total graph .      in this subsection \n , we derive results expressing the degree sequence of a total graph in terms of the degree sequence of its inverse total graph . \n [ thmdegvertvert ] the degree of a vertex vertex in a total graph is 2 times the degree of the original vertex in the inverse total graph .    in the total graph \n a vertex vertex is adjacent to vertices corresponding to its original neighbours as well as its incident edges in the original graph . \n see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . \n @xmath12    [ thmdegedgevert ] the degree of an edge vertex in a total graph is equal to the sum of the degrees of the endpoint vertices of the original edge in the inverse total graph .    in the total graph \n an edge vertex is adjacent to its two endpoints ( which are both vertex vertices ) , and the other edges incident to these endpoints ( which are all edge vertices ) . \n thus if its endpoints are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , its degree is @xmath17 . \n see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . \n @xmath12    [ thmdegtotreg ] the total graph of a graph is regular if and only if the original graph is regular . \n this is an immediate consequence of theorems  [ thmdegvertvert ] and [ thmdegedgevert ] . \n @xmath12    [ cliqueververedge ] consider a maximal mixed clique of size 3 in a total graph . \n let the two vertex vertices be of degrees @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . \n then the degree of the edge vertex of this clique is @xmath21 . \n clearly @xmath22 . \n this follows from definition  [ defmixclq ] and theorem  [ thmmixedclq ]    @xmath12    given a vertex vertex @xmath23 of degree @xmath14 in a total graph , its neighbours can be divided into @xmath24 pairs representing :    * its distinct incident edges @xmath25 in the inverse total graph and * the other endpoints of those edges @xmath26 respectively . \n the @xmath24 pairs are @xmath27 . \n see figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . \n the degrees of each pair is related to the degree of the selected vertex vertex according to theorem  [ cliqueververedge ]    @xmath12      here we extend the work of the previous subsection in a natural way obtaining results expressing the number of vertices and edges of a total graph in terms of the corresponding parameters of the inverse total graph . \n [ relation ] let @xmath28 for the given @xmath4 . \n 1 .   @xmath29 2 . \n @xmath30    * the total graph of a given graph contains the original graph and the line graph of the original graph as disjoint induced subgraphs spanning all its vertices . \n the line graph of the original graph g has @xmath31 vertices . \n therefore , @xmath29 * the edge set of the total graph can be partitioned into @xmath32 disjoint sets : 1 .   * a : * edge set of the original graph containg @xmath31 edges . \n * b : * edges which are present between the original graph and its line graph . \n there are @xmath33 such edges . \n + note : the line graph of the given @xmath5 has @xmath31 vertices and each vertex of the line graph is connected to exactly @xmath34 vertices of the original graph . \n * c * : edges which are present within the line graph . \n the number of such edges is @xmath35 * explanation for edges present within the line graph : + the number of edges in the subgraph induced by any subset @xmath36 of vertices of a graph @xmath5 is given by @xmath37 applying this rule , gives us the claimed result for portion * c*. + now the maximum possible degree for any vertex of the given simple connected graph is @xmath38 . \n + thus , + @xmath39 * now the total number of edges in @xmath40 + @xmath41    @xmath12    for instance @xmath42 has 9 vertices and 23 edges . \n these numbers conform to the constraints derived by us above . \n we give explicit constructions for the total graphs of paths , cycles and complete graphs in this section . \n the first result is for cycles . \n [ thmcycles ] a graph is the total graph of the cycle @xmath43 on @xmath44 vertices if and only if :    * it has @xmath45 vertices @xmath46 * contains two vertex disjoint cycles of length @xmath44 each , labeled @xmath47 * contains a hamiltonian cycle edge disjoint with the afore mentioned cycles with the order of vertices being @xmath48 . \n this result is self explanatory . \n see  figure [ hamiltonian ] . \n @xmath12    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ edgevertchar ] given an arbitrary maximum degree vertex @xmath16 , of degree @xmath14 , in a total graph @xmath11 , ( @xmath49 ) it is an edge vertex , if and only if in the subgraph induced on its open neighbourhood : + its neighbours can be partitioned into 2 maximal cliques of exactly @xmath24 vertices each consisting of one vertex vertex and @xmath50 edge vertices . \n the statement follows from an inspection of figure  [ fig : vertexedge ] . \n @xmath12    in 4-regular candadate total graphs ( total graphs of cycles ) , each vertex satisfies the conditions of both the above theorems . \n that is because the two parts of any valid partition are isomorphic to each other . \n given any input ( candidate ) total graph @xmath11 , where @xmath49 , it is indeed a total graph if and only if the graph @xmath51 is a total graph where @xmath52 is obtained from @xmath5 by eliminating a vertex vertex of maximum degree along with all its edge neighbours in @xmath53 .    if the given graph is indeed a total graph , then it has a partition of its vertex set into vertex vertices and edge vertices . \n the algorithmic version of theorem  [ vertvertchar ] allows us to find a vertex vertex of maximum degree as well as identify its edge neighbours . deleting the vertex along with its edge neighbours , \n effectively eliminates the vertex and the incident edges from the inverse total graph . \n we are left with the total graph of the graph with one vertex deleted . \n recursing on the smaller graph , we obtain the partition or conclude that none exists if at some iteration a maximum degree vertex violates both theorems  [ vertvertchar ] ,  [ edgevertchar ] . \n @xmath12    we thus have an algorithm which starts with a candidate total graph of a non - complete graph and decides whether it is indeed a total graph by recursing on the smaller graph or recourse to complete graph theorem . + \n * *    1 . \n check if the given graph is the total graph of a complete graph using algorithm  1 . \n if so augument the vertices of that complete subgraph to the vertices obtained in earlier iterations and return . \n scan the vertices of maximum degree one by one , for conformity to theorem  [ vertvertchar ] until one , say @xmath54 is found . \n if during this process we find a vertex of maximum degree violating both theorems  [ vertvertchar ] ,  [ edgevertchar ] then stop and conclude that it is not the total graph of any graph . \n 3 .   for the vertex @xmath54 , from step 2 , partition its neighbours into vertex vertices and edge vertices by the algorithmic version of theorem  [ vertvertchar ] . \n 4 .   add @xmath54 to the vertex set of the inverse total graph and repeat the steps with the graph obtained by deleting @xmath54 and its edge neighbours . \n return the set of vertices ( and the induced subgraph on them ) accumulated in step 4 over all the iterations . \n we have proved properties of the vertex degrees of total graphs . \n we have developed a precise characterisation of the structure of the neighbourhoods of maximum degree vertices of the total graph of any graph . combining these results \n we have designed an efficient iterative algorithm to compute the inverse total graph of a candidate total graph , or report that the graph is not a total graph . \n we also present a direct construction for the total graphs of paths , cycles and complete graphs .    one interesting direction of future research is to see if a given @xmath44 and @xmath55 pair admits a connected unique total graph if any . \n one can also look at minimum number of dynamic graph operations ( adding / deleting vertices and edges or moving edges around the graph ) to transform a non - total graph into a total graph . \n m behzad . a characterization of total

{"ContextTokens": 3867, "GeneratedTokens": 342, "SynthesizedBody": "a decade of observational and theoretical studies by many astronomers has shown that , over a wide range of effective stellar temperatures , the presence of heavy elements in white dwarf atmospheres is evidence for orbiting planetary systems @xcite . with this relatively recent shift in paradigm , the discovery of the prototype , metal - lined white dwarf by @xcite nearly a century ago  while not a planet detection itself , but the signature of accreted planetary debris  is arguably the first astronomical evidence of the presence of planetary systems around other stars @xcite . \n according to all dynamical models that deliver sufficient planetesimal masses into the innermost system where it can be accreted , each exoplanetary system hosted by a metal - enriched white dwarf must harbor at least a belt of minor bodies and one major planet @xcite . \n the gravitational field of the planet(s ) can perturb the orbits of the planetesimals onto orbits passing near the white dwarf so that they are tidally disrupted . _ \n spitzer _ and complementary ground - based observations have established a firm connection between the atmospheric heavy elements in white dwarfs and the presence of dust and gas within the tidal radius of the star @xcite . \n because the metal - to - metal sinking timescales vary by no more than a factor of a few , the relative , steady - state abundances of the accreted planetary debris can be analytically linked to those observed in the polluted atmosphere @xcite , thus making the stellar surface an effective mirror of planetesimal composition . \n the first detailed abundance study of any metal - enriched white dwarf was carried out for the current record holder for number ( 16 ) of detected heavy elements , gd362 , demonstrating that the debris was broadly terrestrial - like @xcite . since then , the broad pattern of bulk , earth - like compositions has been seen  especially with ultraviolet _ hst _ observations  in several more stars with five or more heavy elements ( o , mg , si , ca , fe ) that indicate melting and differentiation among extrasolar , rocky planetesimals , and a diversity of overall compositions similar to different classes of solar system meteorites @xcite .    importantly , while most polluted white dwarfs appear to be contaminated by debris from parent bodies that were relatively poor in h@xmath5o and other volatiles @xcite , there is at least one case where substantial h@xmath5o can be confirmed in an otherwise volatile- and carbon - poor planetesimal . the debris orbiting and polluting the atmosphere of gd61 originated in a rocky minor planet roughly the size of vesta and containing approximately 26% water by mass @xcite \n . another polluted white dwarf with a substantial oxygen excess is sdssj124231.07 + 522626.6 , where the parent body likely had an even higher water content @xcite . \n such water - rich asteroids are important as potential building blocks of habitable planetary surfaces , especially if most small and rocky planets form dry as did the earth @xcite . \n this paper reports the identification and analysis of h , o , mg , al , si , ca , ti , cr , and fe in the helium atmosphere white dwarf wd1536@xmath1520 . \n these elements are found to be accreting at a rate higher than any yet measured in a white dwarf with relatively short sinking timescales , and producing atmospheric metal abundances comparable to those of the sun . \n the data are consistent with a refractory - rich parent body with a modest fraction of h@xmath5o . \n section 2 presents spectroscopic observations from several facilities that resulted in the detection of all the major rock forming elements , and strong upper limits on key volatiles . \n the atmospheric modeling is discussed in section 3 , along with the determination of stellar parameters , and elemental abundances within the star and the disrupted parent body . \n the paper explores the so - far unique properties of this star as something of a transition object between helium- and hydrogen - rich , polluted white dwarfs , with the conclusions presented in section 4 . \n wd1536@xmath1520 was first identified in the second byurakan sky survey ( sbs1536@xmath1520 ; @xcite ) in 1992 and correctly typed as a dba ( strongest lines hei , weaker lines of h ) white dwarf from a low resolution , @xmath8 spectrum . \n it was spectroscopically observed as part the sloan digital sky survey in 2002 ( sdss153725.71@xmath1515126.9 ; @xcite ) , and exhibits lines of mg , si , and ca in these @xmath9 data @xcite , yielding a full spectral type of dbaz . given that the sdss @xmath10 photometry alone results in a temperature estimate of 22000k @xcite , the presence of these metal absorption features in a modest resolution spectrum is remarkable  at similar @xmath11 and irrespective of atmospheric composition , the detection of atmospheric metals in white dwarfs typically requires powerful , high - resolution spectroscopy with keck or the vlt @xcite . \n the star has an infrared excess detected by _ wise _ \n @xcite at 3.4 and 4.6@xmath12 m , where the data are consistent with passively heated debris orbiting within the roche limit , similar to roughly 40 other metal - enriched white dwarfs accreting from analogous disks @xcite . \n follow up observations were obtained in 2014 april with the mmt using the blue channel spectrograph . \n spectra were taken through a @xmath13 slit with the 832lmm@xmath7 grating in first and second order , covering @xmath14  at 2  resolution and @xmath15  at 1  resolution respectively . the red spectrum consisted of four 900s exposures in clear conditions , while the blue spectrum comprised three 600s exposures but intruding on twilight where significant sky signal was present . \n the blue data are thus of relatively modest quality , while the red spectra are superior and a combined spectrum is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . most important , \n these modest resolution data exhibit a strong oi 7775  absorption feature , in addition to lines of mgii , and siii . \n additional , medium - resolution spectra were taken in 2014 july using the double arm isis spectrograph on the wht . \n simultaneous blue and red spectra were taken through a @xmath13 slit using the r1200b and r1200r gratings , with the 5300  dichroic , resulting in two spectra covering @xmath16  at a resolution of roughly 1 . \n the white dwarf was observed continuously for eight exposures of 900s in good conditions . \n the isis spectra reveal weak alii and siii features in wavelength regions not covered by the mmt dataset . \n lastly , high - resolution observations carried out in 2015 april with the hiresb spectrograph on keck i. the setup was identical to that described in @xcite , covering the range 31305940 . \n the blue cross disperser was combined with a @xmath17 slit resulting in a spectral resolving power of @xmath18 . \n reduction procedures utilized both iraf and makee . \n this dataset reveals multiple lines of mgii , alii , siii , caii , tiii , crii , and feii , a portion of which is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . \n all spectra were reduced in the standard fashion , by average - combining each spectrum after extraction , using variance weighting for sky subtraction and rejection of bad pixels and cosmic rays . \n .stellar parameters for wd1536@xmath1520[tbl1 ] [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     @xmath19 upper limit for feo .    . \n the first five rows assumes oxygen is carried to maximum capacity by all the major rock forming elements , but in fact iron can also be in pure metal or iron - nickel alloy with no oxygen . \n the nominal oxygen budget in the steady state is unphysical unless 100% of the total iron is carried as metal , and the nominal o / si and o / mg ratios are marginally higher than tabulated .    while the range of allowed abundance ratios also permits solutions without any excess oxygen , the striking hydrogen abundance in wd1536 \n must be considered , and which clearly favors a water - rich interpretation . while an early phase of accretion predicts an oxygen excess and thus the need for h@xmath5o within the planetary debris , the heavy element settling times are relatively short , and thus catching the star in this phase is less likely . \n if disks last for at least 10@xmath20yr @xcite , then the probability that wd1536 is not yet in a steady - state phase of accretion is less than 1% . \n the total hydrogen mass within the stellar atmosphere is @xmath21 g , and could have been delivered by an asteroid with total mass a few to several times 10@xmath22 g and which was 510% h@xmath5o by mass . \n this would be consistent with the lower mass limit of @xmath23 g from the heavy elements alone . \n while uncertain , the totality of data discussed in this section favors the deposition of h@xmath5o onto the stellar surface and carried by the parent body whose debris now orbits the star . in the next section , \n the anomalously high trace hydrogen abundance is shown to be transient , thus strengthening this interpretation . \n the mass of the convection zone in wd1536 is tiny \n @xmath24 times smaller than those within the bulk of known polluted white dwarfs with helium atmospheres . \n there are two reasons for this . \n first , the @xmath11 and 60myr cooling age mean the star is experiencing the early stages of convection zone growth @xcite . \n in fact , with @xmath25k this star is the warmest and youngest helium - rich white dwarf to show metals due to ongoing accretion . \n second , the anomalously high fraction of hydrogen leads to a significant reduction in the depth of the outer layers relative to a pure helium composition , by a factor of approximately 30 .    . \n remarkably , wd1536 sits in a region that is otherwise exclusively occupied by stars with hydrogen atmospheres . \n g166 - 58 is the coolest white dwarf with a hydrogen - rich atmosphere and an infrared excess . \n [ fig3],width=317 ]     stars with matching criteria . \n the upper panel demonstrates the anomalous nature of wd1536 , whose h / he ratio is over an order of magnitude higher than any comparable object and second only to gd362 @xcite . \n overplotted in the lower panel are tracks demonstrating the directly proportional change in h / he due to the growth of the convection zone over time in pure helium atmosphere stars @xcite , shown for five orders of magnitude of initial [ h / he ] @xmath26 . these calculations assume complete mixing of the outer layers . \n [ fig4],width=317 ]    these facts conspire to make the stellar atmosphere physically similar to a typical 10000k hydrogen - rich white dwarf , with comparable diffusion timescales . \n figure [ fig3 ] plots wd1536 together with a sample of polluted white dwarfs observed with _ spitzer _ \n , as a function of their inferred accretion rates and sinking timescales based on caii detections @xcite . \n wd1536 lies above three hydrogen - rich stars whose disks have been detected in the infrared @xcite , and has an even shorter sinking timescale than g166 - 58 @xcite . \n this so - far unique position for a helium - dominated star strongly suggests 1 ) it is accreting at a high rate in a steady state , and 2 ) that the older , cooler stars with similar sinking timescales do not often experience similarly high rates of accretion . \n if this interpretation is correct , it would support a decreasing trend of planetary dynamical activity in the post - main sequence , as measured by the mass influx of planetesimals towards the white dwarf host , consistent with theoretical predictions @xcite    figure [ fig4 ] highlights the exceptional h / he in wd1536 . \n the upper panel plots samples of helium - rich white dwarfs with trace hydrogen detected directly through balmer absorption features ( typically only h@xmath27 ) . ] . \n interestingly , a substantial fraction of the plotted stars are also polluted with heavy elements , although a strong bias is present at @xmath28k . in this cooler temperature range , \n hei absorption rapidly becomes too weak to detect in low- and medium - resolution spectra , whereas strong caii absorption can indicate a helium - rich atmosphere @xcite . at the warmer end of the temperatures shown in figure [ fig4 ] , \n the bias towards metal detection is not an issue . \n caution should be used when viewing figure [ fig4 ] ; the plotted stars do not represent an evolutionary sequence , and selection biases play a large role . \n that being said , the cooler stars with substantial hydrogen are either born with substantially more massive reservoirs than can currently be inferred in earlier evolutionary stages , or accrete h - rich planetary material .      assuming complete mixing of the outer stellar layers , the lower panel of fig [ fig4 ] plots tracks of constant hydrogen mass within otherwise - pure helium atmosphere white dwarfs , as a function of temperature @xcite . \n in this simple model where no stratification occurs between hydrogen and helium , the observational signature of most fixed masses of hydrogen at @xmath29k will gradually disappear from white dwarfs with helium - dominated atmospheres . \n the fact that some stars retain ( or re - gain ) substantial hydrogen masses at later times , is a well - known problem in white dwarf atmospheric evolution @xcite . \n while this general topic is beyond the scope of this paper , two distinct possibilities are 1 ) hydrogen is accreted over long timescales , or 2 ) primordial hydrogen floats over a deeper helium reservoir , and is later mixed into the photosphere . in the latter scenario , stars will appear hydrogen - rich at sufficiently warm temperatures and later reveal themselves to be helium - dominated @xcite . currently , there is more observational support for the primordial model , with at least 3/4 of helium atmosphere white dwarfs showing traces of hydrogen @xcite . \n _ thus in the absence of continued accretion wd1536 will have both its metals and trace hydrogen wiped clean from its photosphere_. without the influence of ongoing , external pollution , the heavy elements will completely sink beneath the photosphere within a few 10@xmath30 years at most . \n but over longer timescales , the remarkably high abundance of atmospheric hydrogen will be drowned by the deepening helium convection zone . by the time wd1536 \n has cooled to 15000k in 140myr , the mass of the convection zone will have grown by 4 orders of magnitude and exhibit a trace hydrogen abundance @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath31 . at this stage \n , the star will either appear as a fairly average helium - rich white dwarf , where hydrogen is difficult or impossible to detect in modest resolution spectra due to its apparent faintness relative to the nearby samples shown in fig [ fig4 ] . when the star has cooled to 12000k after another 190myr \n , it will certainly not have detectable hydrogen . \n the unavoidable conclusion is that this white dwarf is being witnessed at a special time , in a transient phase , and the hydrogen is related to the orbiting planetary debris , and thus water is likely present . \n considering that wd1536 may have only accreted @xmath32 g of hydrogen onto its atmosphere and @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath4 , it can be seen that if a significantly larger and water - rich parent body had been deposited , then hydrogen could ( temporarily ) have become the dominant atmospheric constituent . \n for example , the disrupted asteroids polluting gd61 or sdss1242 might have delivered @xmath33 g or @xmath34 g of hydrogen respectively , resulting in abundances of @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath35 and @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath36 . in both cases \n wd1536 would temporarily appear as a hydrogen - rich star despite being dominated by the underlying helium . \n therefore , the accretion of water - rich planetary debris has the potential to have an observable effect on h / he white dwarf spectral evolution . \n the young , helium - atmosphere , white dwarf wd1536 exhibits the highest abundances of heavy elements yet seen among polluted hosts of evolved planetary systems . \n in addition to the broadly solar abundances of the major rock forming elements o , mg , al , si , ca , and fe , this star also has a remarkably high trace hydrogen abundance of @xmath2(h / he ) @xmath4 . \n considering the 1 ) abundance pattern of heavy elements , 2 ) the anomalously high trace hydrogen , and 3 ) the transient detectability of both the metals and the hydrogen , the most realistic conclusion is that the parent body whose debris is both orbiting and polluting wd1536 contained traces of h@xmath5o . \n the thinness of the convection zone is a result of relative youth and relatively high mass of trace hydrogen within a helium - dominated atmosphere . due to these combined facts , \n the outer layers of wd1536 essentially behave as a hydrogen - rich white dwarf , with metal sinking timescales of only a few hundred years at most , hence supporting a steady state interpretation of the metal abundances . if these are indeed in a steady state , then wd1536 has the highest _ instantaneous _ accretion rate yet observed among polluted white dwarfs . \n j. farihi thanks s. desch for feedback on a draft manuscript . \n the authors acknowledge both the mmt and wht ( service program sw2014a39 ) for the expedient use of their directors time , without which these results would not have been possible , and an anonymous reviewer for feedback that improved the quality of the manuscript . \n j. farihi gratefully acknowledges the support of the stfc via an ernest rutherford fellowship . \n this research was supported in part by a nasa grant to ucla , and by an nsf pre -

? ? \n * ) ,  which represents convection with a characteristic length scale . \n the mixing length parameter ( which is the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height , @xmath3 ) sets the specific entropy of the convection zone , which in turn adjusts the stellar radius . \n this provides a means of determining the mixing length parameter for the sun , since we have precise constraints on the solar radius . \n this solar - calibrated value for the mixing length parameter is usually used to model all other stars , but there is evidence suggesting that this is not the case in reality .    even when properly calibrated to the stellar radius , mlt - like treatments of stellar convection fail to accurately represent inefficient convection . \n this failure severely limits the accuracy of the convective envelope boundaries within stellar models . \n one such boundary is the superadiabatic layer ( sal ) , which is a region near the surface of stars with convective envelopes . \n this layer spans several scale heights and encompasses the transition from efficient convective energy transport to radiative . \n radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations of the sal have proven to be a useful tool for studying realistic stellar convection . \n simulations self - consistently couple the convective envelope to the radiative atmosphere , while including important physical processes such as turbulent pressure . \n established by as a feasible technique for studying realistic stellar convection in the sal , rhd simulations have been carried by a number of groups . \n ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * etc . ) . \n efforts to methodically simulate convection in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane reveal a significant and systematic variation in convective properties over a broad range in stellar properties . \n in addition to stellar properties , the convective dynamics near the stellar surface are affected by the chemical composition of the convective envelope . \n the recent observational study by @xcite and theoretical work by @xcite both suggest that the stellar surface convection depends on the chemical composition of the convective envelope . \n similar results are obtained by @xcite . \n @xcite examined helium abundance in 2d simulations , and found that the helium - free case was characterized by larger velocities and flow structures . \n the abundance of helium and its effect on stellar convection , however , has not yet been examined systematically . in this study \n we build upon our previous work by adding helium abundance to the parameter space of our simulation grid , and isolate its effect on convection by fixing the other dimensions of parameter space . \n it is difficult to measure spectroscopically the helium mass fraction present in stars that are cool enough to have convective envelopes . \n asteroseismology permits constraints on the helium abundance through measurements of low degree acoustic modes @xcite , however helium abundance in stars remains largely unconstrained . \n the common practice is to use a chemical evolution formula , such as that of @xcite . quite separately from chemical evolution , the helium content may be enriched or depleted in stellar envelopes through processes such as rotationally induced mixing and meridional circulation . \n for example , the multiple stellar populations present in @xmath6 centauri can be modeled if rather extreme helium abundances are used . \n a recent study by @xcite finds that helium mass fractions in excess of @xmath7 yield the best models for certain ehb stars . \n conversely , helium could be depleted in the outer layers of stars as a result of diffusion from the gravitational settling ( * ? ? ? \n * etc ) .    in sections [ sec : code ] and [ sec : grid ] \n describe the 3d rhd code and the grid of simulations used in this work . \n section [ sec : microphysics ] outlines the changes to the microphysics induced by altering the hydrogen mass fraction , and the expected effect that these changes will have on convective dynamics . \n we then examine in detail the consequences of hydrogen abundance on various properties extracted from the simulations in sections [ sec : salstructure ] through [ sec : spectral ] . \n our code simulates convection by solving the compressible navier - stokes equations with radiative transfer , and has been described in detail in @xcite . \n the code is originally based on that of @xcite and @xcite but has updated physics and numerical schemes . \n the simulation code uses microphysics that are fully consistent with that of the stellar evolution code yrec . \n the equation of state and opacity are taken from the opal tables @xcite and the @xcite opacity tables at low temperatures using the heavy element mixture of @xcite . \n for the simulations in this work , radiative transfer was computed using the 3d eddington approximation @xcite in the optically thin layers , and the diffusion approximation in the deeper optically thick layers , however , as @xcite showed , using a different radiative transfer scheme ( rays with long - characteristics ) does not make a substantial difference in the sal below the photosphere . \n the computational domain is a cartesian box with periodic boundary conditions on the vertical walls , and the top and bottom surfaces are closed . \n spatial curvature and the radial variation of gravity are both negligible . \n the domain spans the sal so the bottom surface is well below the superadiabatic peak , and the top surface is in the optically thin radiative layers of the atmosphere . \n thus , the space between the two surfaces encompasses the transition from fully convective to fully radiative energy transport . \n the strategy for exploring the effect of helium on convection closely mirrors the approach described in @xcite , which dealt only with changes to the mass fraction of metal elements . in this study \n , we construct a grid of simulations that covers a range in helium mass fractions . \n because the effect of helium may differ between metal - rich and metal - poor stars , we compute our simulations with different hydrogen mass fractions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for two different metallicities ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . \n the grid of simulations comprises six sets , each with a different chemical composition . \n the grid is divided into two groups ( each with three sets ) , corresponding to low and high metallicity . \n the sets within a group have fixed metallicity , but different helium abundances . \n the range in helium and metallicity is quite large , covering a factor of three in @xmath13 and a factor of @xmath14 in @xmath15 . while large , the range in helium mass fraction is less extreme than what has been used to model some stellar populations , including that of @xmath6 centauri , which @xcite recently modeled with helium enrichments of up to @xmath7 . \n the grid of 24 simulations is summarized in table [ tab : grid ] . \n the two metallicity groups are denoted with ` a ' and ` b ' for the low- and high - metallicity , respectively . \n surface gravity is held fixed at @xmath16 for the entire grid . \n the effective temperature for each simulation is an output property , and can not be precisely controlled . as such \n , simulations typically can not be directly compared , but each set overlaps in the effective temperature range , allowing for comparisons as a function of radiative flux .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the signature of helium abundance on stellar convection is smaller than that of metallicity , but is nonetheless significant . \n changes to convective properties are primarily caused by opacity . \n the sensitivity of convective properties to helium abundance is because of similar reasons as metallicity described in @xcite , namely , for a given , an increase in opacity in the sal is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in density so that the constant radiative energy flux is maintained . \n our simulations show systematically larger convective velocities and overshoot with hotter , larger @xmath15 and smaller @xmath13 .    while similar , the effect of helium is distinct from that of metallicity because of the way in which it changes the equation of state . \n the mean molecular weight is more sensitive to helium abundance , particularly in the optically thin layers above the maximum superadiabaticity . \n the signature of helium might manifest itself separately from that of metallicity in the details of the velocity field , such as the velocity distribution presented in fig . \n [ fig : velocity ] . \n the key to isolating the effect of helium may be in comparing the hot upflows and cool downdrafts . \n [ fig : velocity ] shows variation in the ` upflow ' peak with @xmath15 , and variation in the extreme edge of the ` downflow ' peak with @xmath13 . \n radiation accounts for most of the energy flux from the hot upflowing granules \n . consequently , the structure and dynamics of the granules are more sensitive to radiative cooling rates , which vary more strongly with metallicity than helium . \n conversely , the downflows are less sensitive to radiative cooling rates , but will be affected by the mean molecular weight . \n it is possible that the signature of helium abundance is observable through its effect on the convective overshoot in the atmosphere . \n in particular , the curvature of spectral line shapes and the absolute shift of the line cores are sensitive to helium abundance . \n provided that the metallicity are well constrained , it might be possible to isolate the effect of helium on the velocity field . \n old metal - poor stellar populations often exhibit signs of @xmath0-element enrichment . using a set of simulations \n separate from our grid , we have carried out tests to measure the magnitude of the effect of changing the heavy element mixture . \n details of the heavy element mixture alter the opacity because of changes in the number of ionized electrons , which affects h@xmath17 opacity . \n our simulations show that the effect is quite small ; considerably smaller than the effect of changing @xmath15 or @xmath13 . while @xmath0-element enrichment may have a more substantial effect in the deep interior of the star \n , we do not measure a significant dependence on the structure of the sal . \n our @xmath0-enhancement tests also verify that the effect of helium could not be accounted for by adjusting the heavy element mixture . \n jt is supported by nasa atfp grant # \n nnx09aj53 g to sb , and acknowledges a pgs - d scholarship from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada . \n this work was supported in part by the facilities and staff of the yale university faculty of arts and sciences high performance computing center .                                                  , \n b. , ludwig , h .- g . \n , & steffen , m. 1999 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 173 , stellar structure : theory and test of connective energy transport , ed . \n a.  gimenez , e.  f. guinan , & b.  montesinos , 225", "StartTimeOffset": 724111829186, "RequestID": "a26f0d1d5da5d6206324f45596f04cd6831e6598", "TotalTokens": 2591}
{"ContextTokens": 2737, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "_ electrical _ spin injection , transport and detection in diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms)-nonmagnetic semiconductor ( nms ) based systems @xcite-@xcite are three crucial prerequisites for the successful realization of semiconductor spintronics . while the spin degree of freedom naturally is important , the charge degree of freedom plays a significant role in semiconductor spin transport as well , through electric field induced effects . \n several experiments@xcite-@xcite have recently shown that the spin injection efficiency is strongly dependent on both applied and intrinsic electric fields , caused by , e.g. , inhomogeneous doping . this was theoretically emphasized by yu and flatte(yf)@xcite within a drift - diffusion model from which it was shown that the magnitude and sign of an electric field strongly influences the spin relaxation length according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a homogeneous electric field , and @xmath2 is an intrinsic ( electric field -

consistent numerical calculations to study the effects of inhomogeneous electric fields . \n we find that , in an analogous drift - diffusion picture , a `` quasi - local '' spin relaxation length in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields can be defined according to @xmath4^{-1}~ , \\label{ldu}\\ ] ] from which a strong electric field gradient dependence becomes evident . \n however , in order to understand the full influence of inhomogeneous electric fields one needs to have access to the self - consistent charge density and electric field profile . \n we have performed such self - consistent numerical calculations using a boltzmann - poisson equation approach for a dms - nms inhomogeneously doped semiconductor from which we demonstrate that electric field gradients indeed can play a crucial role in the propagation of spin polarized electrons . \n our findings may in particular highlight a possible difficulty in obtaining efficient spin polarized propagation at semiconductor interfaces between low - to - high doping concentration regions .    in the following we will show a derivation of the drift - diffusion model leading to eq . \n ( 2 ) ( section 2 ) , followed by our numerical model ( section 3 ) , and a discussion of our results ( section 4 ) . \n the current for spin - up and spin - down electrons can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the diffusion constants and conductivities for the spin - up(down ) species . here , the conductivities refer to @xmath8 , in terms of the mobilities @xmath9 and densities @xmath10 of spin -

diffusion equation for the spin density imbalance @xmath24 and contains terms depending on both the electric field , and the electric field _ \n gradient_. we note that in fact eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) resembles the corresponding equations in refs . \n @xcite , but with an _ additional term proportional to _ @xmath25 . \n similarly to refs . \n @xcite we can use the roots of the characteristic equation for eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) to define up- and down - stream spin diffusion lengths from eq . \n ( [ ddimbalance ] ) leading up to eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) . \n notice that eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) is only defined `` locally '' , over a region where @xmath26 can be considered constant , and where an average value of the electric field is used . \n note also that the above equations are also valid for ferromagnetic semiconductors provided the mobility and diffusion constant are replaced with the ones corresponding to the minority - spin species@xcite .    a comparison between eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) and refs . \n @xcite results in that eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) above contains an additional term @xmath27 in the square root . \n naturally , this term plays an important role in inhomogeneously doped semiconductors . \n we have performed self - consistent calculations and compared them with numerical fits using eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) to verify its applicability . \n our self - consistent approach is based on the solution of the boltzmann and poisson equations using numerical methods developed in ref . \n @xcite . working in a one - dimensional model ( choosing the @xmath28 direction ) , \n the transport of spin - polarized electrons is described by two bte equations according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron distribution for the spin - up ( down ) electrons , @xmath31 is the momentum relaxation time , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the scattering rate for spin - up ( down ) electrons . the first term on the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of each nonequilibrium spin distribution to a local equilibrium ( spin - dependent ) , normalized electron distribution function @xmath34 , where @xmath35 k is the lattice temperature . \n the last term in eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of the spin polarization . from the distribution function @xmath36 \n we calculate the local spin density according to @xmath37 , the total charge density , @xmath38 , and the spin density imbalance , @xmath39 . in order to take into account inhomogeneous charge distributions and electric fields \n we solve eq . \n ( [ bte ] ) together with the poisson equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dielectric constant and @xmath42 is the donor concentration profile , using finite difference and relaxation methods@xcite . \n we have performed self - consistent , numerical calculations for an inhomogeneously doped dms - nms structure schematically depicted in fig . \n [ fig:1 ] using @xmath35 k , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ps , @xmath45 ns , @xmath46 m@xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 m and @xmath50 v.    at the interface between the two doping regions with concentrations @xmath51 and @xmath52 a built - in field is expected due to the diffusion of carriers from the region with higher to the region with lower doping concentration . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig:2 ] where we show the electric field profile , as well as the gradient of the electric field ( inset ) around the interfacial regions , for different doping concentrations @xmath53 . \n the sign and amplitude of the electric field gradients naturally depend strongly on the doping concentration @xmath52 on a length scale of the order of the screening length .    while it is not possible to use eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) directly for a quantitative analysis of the spin transport properties , one can make preliminary estimates of the order of the spin relaxation length around a specific region using linear approximations of the electric field . \n for example , using a linear fit of @xmath1 for @xmath54 @xmath49 m for the @xmath55 curve yields @xmath56 v/@xmath49m@xmath57 . \n furthermore , using a mean value of @xmath58 kv / cm and @xmath59 @xmath49 m we obtain from eq . \n ( [ ldu ] ) a spin relaxation length value @xmath60 @xmath49 m along the ( charge ) direction of transport . \n similarly , it is found that @xmath61 @xmath49 m . in comparison , \n an evaluation of eq . \n ( [ yf ] ) , i.e. without the electric field gradient term , using the same value of the electric field yields @xmath62 @xmath49 m , and @xmath63 @xmath49 m . \n thus , the spin relaxation length in the direction of the charge flow is predicted to be strongly influenced by the inhomogeneous electric field around the doping interface .    in fig . \n [ fig:3 ] , the numerically calculated spin density imbalance , @xmath24 , and total charge density , @xmath64 , are shown for the @xmath55 structure considered in the above estimates . \n the total charge density ( dashed line ) increases monotonically as expected within a screening length from the low to the high doping concentration region . \n the spin density imbalance ( solid line ) follows a similar increase , but is , however , _ \n significantly suppressed _ such that only a maximum of 0.5@xmath52 is reached around the interface region , beyond which @xmath24 decreases exponentially . the observed suppression is a consequence of the inhomogeneous electric fields . \n a crude estimate of the validity of the values for @xmath65 can be obtained by comparing our numerical calculations with @xmath66 $ ] . in fig . \n [ fig:3 ] we show the resulting fits for @xmath67 and 36 @xmath49 m , the first and latter values corresponding to the previously estimated values for @xmath65 and @xmath68 obtained from the numerically calculated electric field profiles . \n we see that the higher values of @xmath68 indeed yield that @xmath69 . \n in contrast , the @xmath68 values 0.16 and 0.3 @xmath49 m , which are of the order of the screening length , yield better fits to the numerically calculated data . \n our results and analysis shows that inhomogeneous electric fields can strongly influence the spin relaxation length , and that significant spin polarization suppression can occur as a result thereof . \n we have also high - lighted a possible mechanism that may inhibit propagation of spin polarized electrons from low - to - high regions of doping concentrations , such as encountered in future semiconductor spintronic devices . \n this work was supported by the indiana 21@xmath70 century research and technology fund . \n numerical calculations were performed using the facilities at the center for computational nanoscience at ball state university . \n 99 r.  fiederling _ et al . \n _ , nature * 402 * , 787 ( 1999 ) ; y.  ohno _ et al . \n _ , nature * 402 * , 790 ( 1999 ) \n . g.  schmidt _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n * 87 * , 227203 ( 2001 ) . \n g.  schmidt _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rev.lett .  * 92 * , 226602 ( 2004 ) . \n van dorpe _ \n et al . _ , appl . \n , 3495 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  kohda , y.  ohno , f.  matsukura , and h. ohno , physica e * 32 * , 438 ( 2006 ) . \n c.  adelmann _ at al . \n _ , j.  vac . \n sci.technol . \n * 23 * , 1747 ( 2005 ) . \n s.  a.  crooker , and d.  l.  smith , phys.rev . \n lett .  * 94 * , 236601 ( 2005 ) . \n z.  g.  yu , and m.  e.  flatt , phys . \n b * 66 * , 201202(r ) 2002 ; _ ibid . \n _ 235302 ( 2002 ) \n . m.  e.  flatt , and j.  m.  byers , phys . \n 84 * , 4220 ( 2000 ) . \n d. csontos , and s. e. ulloa , physica e * 32 * , 412 ( 2006 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 751053991255, "RequestID": "ed339c82063332f694b4e3c02e4a9ac477dc53fe", "TotalTokens": 2848}

body problem @xcite . \n substituting eqs . \n ( [ d12 ] ) and ( [ d31 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ m1-eom - c ] ) , we obtain the angular velocity as @xmath61 where @xmath62 . \n \\label{omega - pn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using @xmath63 , one can immediately show @xmath64 , so that we find @xmath65 for the same masses and @xmath66 . \n in other words , for the same masses and angular velocity , the pn triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one . \n table [ table1 ] shows the relativistic corrections of the distance between each body for lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) of solar system . \n here we choose @xmath27 and @xmath35 as the sun and each planet , respectively . in the case of the restricted three - body problem ( @xmath67 ) , it is convenient to use eqs . \n ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) rather than eqs . \n ( [ d12 ] ) - ( [ d31 ] ) , because it is natural to change not @xmath68 but location of @xmath36 . \n ( [ condition2 ] ) implies that the correction of distance between each planet and lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is approximately @xmath69 of schwarzschild radius of the sun . \n hence , we obtain the same values of this correction for earth and jupiter . \n the similar corrections are mentioned also in the previous paper @xcite . \n the above pn effects , however , are so tiny that they could be neglected in the near - future measurements @xcite .    it is interesting to extend this 1pn work to higher pn orders for the gravitational wave physics ( see @xcite for the equation of motion and compact binaries ) . \n we reexamined the post - newtonian effects on lagrange s equilateral triangular solution for three - body problem . for three finite masses \n , it was found that a general triangular configuration satisfies the post - newtonian equation of motion in general relativity , if and only if it has the relativistic corrections to each side length . \n it was shown also that the post - newtonian triangular configuration is always smaller than the newtonian one for the same masses and angular velocity . studying the correction to stability of this configuration \n is left as future work . \n this work was supported in part ( k. y. ) by japan society for the promotion of science , grant - in - aid for jsps fellows , no . \n in stead of the arithmetic mean of the three side lengths , one might wish to use the geometric mean of them or the triangular area . hence , let us mention briefly these cases . \n the geometric mean of three side lengths by eq . \n ( [ ep ] ) is written up to the 1pn order as @xmath70 + \\mathrm{o}(\\varepsilon^2 ) , \\label{mul}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 denotes the second order of ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , namely at the 2pn order . \n this expression is identical with the arithmetic mean by eq . \n ( [ add ] ) . \n in addition , we can obtain the condition that these means are equal to a side length of the newtonian equilateral triangle as @xmath72    next , we consider a pn triangular area . a triangular area @xmath73 is given by heron s formula as @xmath74 where @xmath75 hence , substitution of eq . ( [ ep ] ) into eq . \n ( [ area ] ) leads to @xmath76   + \\mathrm{o}(\\varepsilon^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the triangular area of each side length eq . \n ( [ mul ] ) . \n therefore , a pn triangular area is equal to a newtonian equilateral triangular one if and only if @xmath77 this is identical with the condition eq . \n ( [ epsilon - total ] ) . \n 99 h. goldstein , _ classical mechanics _ ( addison - wesley , ma , 1980 ) . \n j. m. a. danby , _ fundamentals of celestial mechanics _ \n ( william - bell , va , 1988 ) . c. marchal , _ the three - body problem _ ( elsevier , amsterdam , 1990 ) . \n m. connors , p. wiegert and c. veillet , nature * 475 * , 481 ( 2011 ) . \n e. krefetz , astron . \n j * 72 * , 471 ( 1967 ) . \n t. i. maindl , _ completing the inventory of the solar system , astronomical society of the pacific conference proceedings _ , edited by t.w . \n rettig and j.m . \n hahn , * 107 * , 147 ( 1996 ) . \n h. asada , phys . \n d * 80 * 064021 ( 2009 ) . \n n. seto , t. muto , phys . \n d * 81 * 103004 ( 2010 ) . \n j. d. schnittman , astrophys . \n j. * 724 * 39 ( 2010 ) . \n y.  torigoe , k.  hattori and h.  asada , phys . \n .  lett .   * 102 * , 251101 ( 2009 ) . \n k. nordtvedt , phys . rev . * 169 * 1014 ( 1968 ) . \n t. ichita , k. yamada , h. asada , phys . \n d * 83 * , 084026 ( 2011 ) . c. w. misner , k. s. thorne , j. a. wheeler , _ gravitation _ , ( freeman , new york , 1973 ) . \n l. d. landau and e. m. lifshitz , _ the classical theory of fields _ \n ( oxford , pergamon 1962 ) . \n h. asada , t. futamase , p. hogan , _ equations of motion in general relativity _ \n ( oxford university , new york , 2011 ) . ref . \n @xcite suggests that if two of the masses are finite and equal , and the third one is zero , an equilateral configuration satisfies the eih equation of motion . \n however , the angular velocity of each mass is not the same in this case . \n note that this case is not an equilibrium configuration . \n k. yamada , h. asada , mon . not . \n . soc . * 83 * , 084026 ( 2011 ) . \n t. damour , p. jaranowski , g. schfer , phys . \n d * 63 * , 044021 ( 2001 ) . \n y. itoh , t. futamase , h. asada , phys . \n d * 63 * , 064038 ( 2001 ) . \n k. g. arun , l. blanchet , b. r. iyer , m. s. s. qusailah , phys . \n d * 77 * , 064035 ( 2008 ) . y. itoh , phys . \n d * 80 * , 124003 ( 2009 ) . \n .the corrections for lagrange point @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) of solar system . \n ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) are used for the evaluation . here , we choose @xmath27 and @xmath35 as the sun and each planet , respectively . \n thus , @xmath80 is the distance between the sun and each planet .

{"ContextTokens": 2173, "GeneratedTokens": 54, "SynthesizedBody": "since gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were first discovered [ 1 ] , thousands of bursts have been detected by a wide variety of instruments , most notably , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , which detected 2704 bursts by the end of _ cgro _ s more than 9 year mission in 2000 june ( see , e.g. , [ 2 ] ) . \n however , the distance scale of the bursts remained uncertain until 1997 , when bepposax began localizing long - duration bursts to a few arcminutes on the sky , and distributing the locations to observers within hours of the bursts . \n this led to the discovery of x - ray [ 3 ] , optical [ 4 ] , and radio [ 5 ] afterglows , as well as host galaxies [ 6 ] . \n subsequent observations led to the spectroscopic determination of burst redshifts , using absorption lines in the spectra of the afterglows ( see , e.g. , [ 7 ] ) , and emission lines in the spectra of the host galaxies ( see , e.g. , [ 8 ] ) . to date , redshifts have been measured for 13 bursts . \n recently , [ 9 ] ( see also [ 10 ] ) , [ 11 ] ( see also [ 12 ] ) , and [ 13 ] ( see also [ 14 ] ) have proposed trends between burst luminosity and quantities that can be measured directly from burst light curves , for the long - duration bursts \n . using 1310 batse bursts for which peak fluxes and high resolution light curves were available , [ 9 ] have suggested that simple bursts ( bursts dominated by a single , smooth pulse ) are less luminous than complex bursts ( bursts consisting of overlapping pulses ) ; however , see [ 15 ] . using a sample of 7 batse bursts for which spectroscopic redshifts , peak fluxes , and high resolution light curves were available , [ 11 ] \n have suggested that more luminous bursts have shorter spectral lags ( the interval of time between the peak of the light curve in different energy bands ) . \n using the same 7 bursts , [ 13 ] have suggested that more luminous bursts have more variable light curves . \n these trends between luminosity and quantities that can be measured directly from light curves raise the exciting possibility that luminosities , and hence luminosity distances , might be inferred for the long - duration bursts from their light curves alone .    in this paper \n ( see also [ 15,16 ] ) , we present a possible luminosity estimator for the long - duration bursts , the construction of which was motivated by the work of [ 14 ] and [ 13 ] . \n we term the luminosity estimator `` cepheid - like '' in that it can be used to infer luminosities and luminosity distances for the long - duration bursts from the variabilities of their light curves alone . \n we also present a preliminary application of this luminosity estimator to 907 long - duration bursts from the batse catalog . \n we discuss the construction of our measure @xmath0 of the variability of a burst light curve  2 . in  3 , we discuss our expansion of the original [ 14 ] sample of 7 bursts to include a total of 20 bursts , including 13 batse bursts , 5 _ wind_/konus bursts , 1 _ ulysses_/grb burst , and 1 near / xgrs burst . \n also in  3 , we discuss the construction of our luminosity estimator . \n we present our preliminary application of this luminosity estimator in  4 . \n qualitatively , @xmath0 is computed by taking the difference of the light curve and a smoothed version of the light curve , squaring this difference , summing the squared difference over time intervals , and appropriately normalizing the result . \n we rigorously construct @xmath0 in [ 15 ] . \n we require it to have the following properties : ( 1 ) we define it in terms of physical , source - frame quantities , as opposed to measured , observer - frame quantities ; ( 2 ) when converted to observer - frame quantities , all strong dependences on redshift and other difficult or impossible to measure quantities cancel out ; ( 3 ) it is not biased by instrumental binning of the light curve , despite cosmological time dilation and the narrowing of the light curve s temporal substructure at higher energies [ 17 ] ; ( 4 ) it is not biased by poisson noise , and consequently can be applied to faint bursts ; and ( 5 ) it is robust ; i.e. , similar light curves always yield similar variabilities . also in [ 15 ] \n , we derive an expression for the statistical uncertainty in a light curve s measured variability , and we describe how we combine variability measurements of light curves acquired in different energy bands into a single measurement of a burst s variability . \n we plot the @xmath1 kev light curves of the most and least variable cosmological batse bursts in our sample in figure 1 . \n we list our sample of 20 bursts in table 1 of [ 15 ] ; it consists of every burst for which redshift information is currently available . \n spectroscopic redshifts , peak fluxes , and high resolution light curves are available for 11 of these bursts ; partial information is available for the remaining 9 bursts . \n we rigorously construct the luminosity estimator in [ 15 ] , applying the bayesian inference formalism developed by [ 18 ] . \n we plot the data and best - fit model of the distribution of these data in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane in figure 2 . \n we apply the best - fit luminosity estimator ( figure 2 ) to 1667 batse bursts , which are all of the batse bursts for which the necessary information was available as of the summer of 2000 . to remove the short - duration bursts \n , we conservatively cut the bursts with durations of @xmath4 sec from the sample , reducing the number to 907 . \n we plot the distribution of variability redshifts in figure 3 . \n a rigorous analysis of how statistical and systematic errors affect this distribution will be presented elsewhere , but the largest effect is the statistical uncertainty in the fitted slope of the luminosity estimator . \n we plot how reasonable variations of this slope affect the distribution also in figure 3 . \n although the original distribution has too many low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath5 bursts for comfort , reasonable variations appear to yield at least qualitatively acceptable distributions ( see figure 5 of [ 19 ] ) . \n we plot the joint redshift and luminosity distribution of the qualitatively acceptable redshift distribution of figure 3 ( dashed histogram ) in figure 4 . \n if systematic effects can be ruled out near batse s detection threshold , this distribution suggests that the luminosity distribution of the bursts is evolving , in which case no more than about 15% of bursts have redshifts greater than @xmath6 , in contrast to the results of [ 13 ] and [ 20 ] . \n klebesadel , r. w. , strong , i. b. & olson , r. a. 1973 , apj , 182 , l85 paciesas , w. s. , et al . 1999 , \n apj , 122 , s465 costa , e. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 783 van paradijs , j. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 386 , 686 frail , d. a. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 389 , 261 sahu , k. c. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 476 metzger , m. r. , et al . \n 1997 , nature , 387 , 878 kulkarni , s. r. , et al . \n 1998 , nature , 393 , 35 stern . \n b. , poutanen , j. , & svensson , r. 1999 , apj , 510 , 312 stern . \n b. , svensson , r. , & poutanen , j. 1997 , in 2d integral workshop : the transparent universe , esa sp-382 ( paris : esa ) , 473 norris , j. p. , marani , g. f. , bonnell , j. t. 2000 , apj , 534 , 248 norris , j. p. , marani , g. f. , bonnell , j. t. 2000 , in gamma - ray bursts : 5th huntsville symposium , aip conference proceedings 526 , eds . \n r. m. kippen , r. s. mallozzi , & g. j. fishman ( melville , new york : aip ) , 78 fenimore , e. e. , & ramirez - ruiz , e. 2001 , apj , submitted ( astro - ph/0004176 ) ramirez - ruiz , e. , & fenimore , e. e. 1999 , contributed oral presentation at the 5th huntsville gamma - ray burst symposium reichart , d. e. , et al . \n 2001 , apj , in press ( astro - ph/0004302 ) reichart , d. e. , & lamb , d. q. 2001 , in procs . of gamma - ray bursts in the afterglow era \n : 2nd workshop , in press fenimore , e. e. , et al . \n 1995 , apj , 448 , l101 reichart , d. e. 2001 , apj , in press ( astro - ph/9912368 ) lamb , d. q. , and reichart , d. e. 2000 , apj , 536 , 1 , 1 schaefer , b. e. , deng , m. , & band , d. l. 2001 , apj ( letters ) , submitted ( astro - ph/0101461 )", "StartTimeOffset": 804399679688, "RequestID": "c9ca41647a3f6234775a20e3128dd7c6c8240387", "TotalTokens": 2227}
{"ContextTokens": 3011, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the creation of stellar groupings by spectral characteristics is an often necessary first step in being able to explore underlying physical processes . \n the descriminating , or classification , criteria are often chosen arbitrarily from available observational data and without regard for the physical mechanisms which create them . thus , a single physical process may be responsible for the variation of spectral characteristics over a great range of temperature or luminosity . \n in some sense , the warm chemically peculiar stars may be overclassified . \n various subclasses exist which are loosely arranged by temperature or enhanced element , but they are now beginning to loose their identity and purpose as additional elements and spectral regions are explored . \n we describe here the analysis procedure and early results of a project that has been undertaken to ascertain the extent of common spectral properties amongst warm chemically peculiar star groups . \n our motivation is to test the theoretical hypothesis that diffusive element separation in the stellar atmosphere acts throughout the hgmn and am star temperature range to create the abundance and isotopic anomalies observed ( michaud 1991 ) . \n the concept that the am and hgmn stars may be a related sequence can be traced back to smith ( 1974 ) and perhaps even earlier , and has since been reiterated by others . \n however , an insufficient amount of evidence has been produced to either prove or disprove this assertion . \n the well accepted , but perhaps arbitrary , boundary at spectral type b9.5/a0 separates the hgmn stars from the realm of the cooler , metallic - lined a ( am ) stars . \n the classical am stars are usually limited to spectral types later than a3 . \n more recently the term _ hot - am _ star has found its way into the literature , representing those stars within the a0 - a3 subclasses whose spectra display a certain degree of am star spectral characteristics , most notably an apparent deficiency of calcium and/or enhancements of iron - group element lines . \n we are particularly interested in exploring the a0 - a2 stars for signs of an extension of the hgmn phenomenon to cooler temperatures as well as the b8 - a0 stars as an extension of the am star phenomenon to hotter temperatures . \n if we are to recognize objects exhibiting both the hgmn and am star phenomena we must first consider the defining qualities of each of these classes . \n let us start by ignoring their classic definitions , as these were set up in an era that predates satellite ultraviolet observations , and is solely based upon the blue optical region . \n however , the first and second ions dominate the spectrum for late - b through mid - a type stars , with most of their strongest transitions occurring at ultraviolet wavelengths . \n therefore , our thinking regarding the classification of peculiarity , and its implication for the responsible physical processes , must be expanded to include the clues found at ultraviolet wavelengths . \n for the cooler hgmn stars the defining characteristics must include the great line strength enhancements of the very heavy elements ( vhe ) pt , au , and hg . \n abundance anomalies for other elements , such as p , ga , mn , tl , and bi , have either been identified for a subgroup of stars or have yet to be thoroughly investigated . from a variety of studies \n it can be stated that the iron - group element abundances can be enhanced by up to 1 dex , which is also typical of the iron - group elements among the am stars . \n the identification of rare - earth element ( ree ) lines in hgmn stars has , up to now , received little attention . \n guthrie ( 1985 ) noted the likely occurrence of lines from nd ii , nd iii , and pr iii in the spectrum of hr 7775 , but `` no other rare earths were found in hr 7775 , and no rare earth lines were detected in any of the other hg - mn stars '' .    for the am stars the relative weakness of calcium and scandium lines compared to those of iron , along with the presence of the ree are notable characteristics . \n abundance enhancements for the heaviest elements ( pt , au , hg ) have not been identified in am stars at optical wavelengths , which has lead to the general belief that these elements are not enhanced above solar - system levels .    from these simplistic characterizations \n we have chosen to search for the presence of ree lines in hgmn stars and vhe lines in am stars as indicators of a common , albeit continuously varying , physical process that connects these two stellar groups . \n other common spectral properties are already known , i.e. the abundance levels for light elements ( he , c , n , o ) and iron - group elements , for example . \n the literature provides few explicit examples of stars that display spectrum features common to both groups . \n optical region spectral observations of hgmn , hot - am , and am stars were made at the 2.6-m nordic optical telescope during 1996 november . \n the sofin echelle spectrograph was operated at a resolving power of r = @xmath0@xmath1/@xmath1 = 80000 , with a single grating setting at blue wavelengths including the lines ptii 4046 , 4061 , 4288 , auii 4052 , hgi 4358 , and hgii 3984  . \n each spectral observation consists of partial data from 14 contiguous orders . \n typical signal - to - noise levels in the primary orders of interest were in excess of 100:1 and in some cases as large as 200:1 . \n details of the observations and data reduction will be presented in a later publication . \n we have supplemented the optical data with ultraviolet iue satellite high - dispersion spectra when available . \n the detection and analysis of platinum and mercury lines in am stars depends critically upon the use of synthetic spectra due to the crowded nature of the line spectrum in the blue spectral region . \n the hgii @xmath13984 line is further complicated by being blended with the lines fei @xmath13983.7 and cri @xmath13983.8  . \n the presence of an absorption feature at 3984   can be traced from the hgmn stars through the am stars , but the relative contributions of the mercury , iron , and chromium lines varies with temperature and abundance . \n other mercury and platinum lines have their own blending concerns . for example , the strongest optical ptii line , at @xmath14046  , is blended with a weak line of hgi . \n our line data for the platinum and mercury transitions accounts for their complicated hyperfine and isotopic structures , both from recent wavelength measurements with the lund fourier transform spectrometer ( wahlgren et al . \n 1998a ) and literature sources ( engleman 1989 , kalus et al . \n 1998 ) . \n we have determined the influence of blending lines by analysing the spectra of 68 tau and @xmath2 leo . from iue spectra of hgii @xmath11942 \n one sees that these stars have only weak , if any , contribution from mercury . \n therefore , we do not expect to see the intrinsically weaker , optical region lines of mercury ( or platinum ) . \n the rotational velocity and the abundances of fei and cri were determined from optical lines possessing experimentally determined oscillator strengths . \n these abundances were then used to evaluate the f - values of the blending lines to the optical region platinum and mercury lines .    after establishing the atomic - line data we proceeded to synthesize the spectra of the hgmn and am stars . \n model atmospheres were computed from the code atlas9 based upon stellar atmospheric parameters derived from the uvby photometric calibration of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) . \n the synthetic spectrum program synthe and the atomic line data of kurucz ( 1993 ) were used to compute the synthetic spectra , with the exception of alterations that we have made for the heavy element line data , the hyperfine structure of yii 3982  , and the @xmath3-value for fei @xmath13983.7   ( obrien et al.1991 ) . \n the presence of rare - earth elements has previously been noted in the spectra of the cool , hgmn stars @xmath4 lupi ( wahlgren et al . \n 1994 ) and hr 7775 ( wahlgren et al.1998a ) at optical wavelengths . \n we therefore speculate that other , if not all , cool hgmn stars also display ree lines . \n although it is difficult to assess the exact abundance levels for the ree from their third spectra , due to a lack of oscillator strength data , an abundance enhancement on the order of 1 to 2 dex is obtained from lines of the singly - ionized state . \n this enhancement level is similar to that found in am stars . \n our high - resolution optical spectra have enabled us to study the isotopic shifts in the platinum and mercury lines found in the spectrum of the hgmn star hr 7775 . \n observations of isotopic shifts represent important tests of diffusion theory . \n we were unable to satisfactorily fit the observed mercury lines with synthetic spectra that were computed assuming a mercury isotopic mixture based upon the q - formalism of white et al.(1976 ) . by trial and error selection \n we were able to identify a difference in the isotopic mixture between hgii 3984   and hgi \n 4358  , where the former presents a mixture of @xmath5hg : @xmath6hg = 40:60 and the latter line a terrestrial - like mixture . for each of the three ptii lines an essentially similar isotope mixture of @xmath7pt : @xmath8pt : @xmath9pt = 10:60:30 provided good fits to the observed features . however , this platinum isotope mixture is different from that obtained from ultraviolet transitions by kalus et al.(1998 ) . \n the potential significance of this difference lies in the excitation energies of the transitions studied and the possibility that their isotopic variations ( for pt and hg ) are depth dependent in the stellar atmosphere . \n this would provide strong evidence for the effects of diffusion . \n further details are presented by wahlgren et al.(1998a ) . \n our optical region search for vhe in hot - am stars ( sirius , o peg , hr 3383 , @xmath10 gem ) has not yielded positive identifications . \n the spectrum of hr 3383 did show promise for a mercury enhancement in the hgii @xmath13984 line at the detection limit . \n however , further analysis showed that the enhancement could be reproduced with an abundance variation of 0.05 - 0.10 dex for iron and chromium . \n the calculations show that for the hot - am stars a mercury abundance enhancement of [ hg / h ] = + 3 dex would be easily noticeable in the 3984   feature , with a minimum detection limit set at approximately [ hg / h ] = + 2.5 dex . as a further check on the possibilty of a mercury enhancement in hr 3383 , \n the iue high - dispersion spectrum was investigated . \n the hgii @xmath11942 line is present in hr 3383 at a strength nearly identical to that found in sirius ( [ hg / h ] = + 1.5 , wahlgren et al . \n the three stars sirius , hr 3383 , and o peg ( wahlgren et al . \n 1993 ) all display the hgii @xmath11942 line at a mercury enhancement of 1 - 1.5 dex . \n this value is remarkable for two reasons . \n first , if the abundance enhancement level for the am stars only approaches a level of + 1.0 to + 1.5 dex , then by virtue of the difference in oscillator strength of approximately 1.7 dex between the strong hgii lines at 1942 and 3984  , we would not expect to notice the presence of enhanced mercury at optical wavelengths . \n thus , the b9.5/a0 boundary for the hgmn stars would be applicable as a classification criterion at _ optical _ wavelengths . \n secondly , the solar system abundances for platinum and mercury are poorly defined , the latter only from s - process systematics . \n this therefore raises the question of whether the abundance of platinum and mercury in hot - am stars is a reflection of the galactic abundance at a later epoch of star formation than that of the sun , or the result of a reduced degree of diffusion relative to the hgmn stars . \n engleman , r. jr : 1989 , _ astrophys . \n j. _ , * 340 * , 1140 guthrie , b.n.g . : 1985 , _ mon . not . \n _ , * 216 * , 1 kalus , g. , johansson , s. , wahlgren , g.m . , \n leckrone , d.s . , \n thorne , a.p . , \n brandt , j.c . \n : 1998 , _ astrophys . j. _ \n , in press kurucz , r.l . \n : 1993 , _ synthe synthesis programs and line data _ , kurucz cd -

{"ContextTokens": 3876, "GeneratedTokens": 202, "SynthesizedBody": "as astronomical and cosmological observations always demand higher sensitivities , importance of large focal planes with detectors at cryogenic temperatures ever increases . \n the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization , which is one of the best probes for studying the early universe  @xcite , is an outstanding example where such cryogenic large detector arrays are needed . \n recently , a few cmb polarization experiments have reported the detection of the faint sub - degree - scale b - mode signal , the odd - parity mode of the cmb polarization pattern  @xcite . \n the use of a large array with an order of 10,000 polarization detectors , such as the focal plane of polarbear-2 ( pb-2 )  @xcite , spt-3 g  @xcite , and bicep-3  @xcite , is essential for characterizing the b - mode power spectrum . \n the need of a large focal plane leads to a challenge in the thermal design , as large thermal load is expected from a large optical window . \n @xcite in order to keep the detector sensivitity high enough , efficient infra - red ( ir ) filters should be considered . \n one promising solution to this problem is to introduce an alumina plate as an ir filter with high thermal conductivity  @xcite . \n the alumina filter absorbs the incident ir emission efficiently . \n the absorbed power is conducted from the central region of the filter to the edge , which is thermally connected to the cryogenic stage . \n the thermal conductance of alumina in the temperature range between 50 and 100  k is very high ; three orders of magnitude as large as those of conventional plastic filters , such as ptfe , nylon , and black polyethylene . \n the temperature gradient and optical loading of the alumina plate are thus very small even with a large diameter , which is ideal as the ir filter material . \n a remaining technological challenge on the use of alumina ir filter is to establish ar coatings for a large frequency coverage . \n alumina is known to be highly reflective in the millimeter wavelength . \n we thus need an ar coating on each surface of the alumina disc . \n ar coating on such a large surface is easily peeled off owing to the thermal shock at cold temperatures . the aforementioned next - generation cmb projects demand multi - layer ar coatings on large ir filters with a typical diameter of 500  mm . \n in the previous studies , the polarbear group attempted to develop a two - layer ar coating method with epoxy on an alumina surface , with a diameter of 50  mm  @xcite . however , the epoxy and alumina cracked during thermal cycling . to avoid the cracking , stress - relief grooves were adopted to reduce the stress between alumina and the epoxy layer . \n @xcite this technology was also used in the bicep-3  @xcite group , which succeeded in making an single - layer ar coating with epoxy for a diameter of about @xmath0 . \n however , this method is expensive . also , it is not easy to maintain the thickness uniformity of the ar layers on the thin alumina plate . \n alternatively , the actpol  @xcite group succeeded in making two- and three - layer ar coatings on silicon lenses , whose diameters were approximately 300 mm . \n they tried and succeeded using the technology of subwavelength grating ( swg ) . \n it is theoretically possible to apply this technology to an alumina surface ; however , it is difficult because the dicing blade is subject to wear so that groove pitch and depth are changed . \n it is also difficult to make a large ingot of silicon . \n machining the material is also very expensive . \n yet another method studied for the spider project is a polyimide sheet as an ar coating on the sapphire with a diameter of about 250  mm @xcite . \n the spider method is very easy to perform and less expensive than the method with epoxy or swg . finally , the first application of thermal sprayed mullite as ar coating was made on a 50 mm diameter alumina disc   @xcite . \n it is also possible to tune the dielectric constant of a thermal sprayed layer by spraying microspheres and alumina powder with different ratios . a three - layer thermal sprayed broadband ar coating that achieves over a 100 % fractional bandwidth has been demonstrated on a 50 mm diameter alumina disc  @xcite ..    in this study , we newly employ the polyimide foam coating on the mullite coating described above to establish a two - layer ar coating method . \n we apply this technique to a thin and large alumina disc with a 460 mm diameter as an ir filter , and demonstrate the performance of the ar coating . \n we fabricated a 2 mm thick and 460 mm diameter alumina filter , and demonstrated the performance of the new ar coating . \n our development focuses on the use in future cmb measurements but the method developed can also be used for other applications . in section  [ sec : filterdesign ] we describe the design of a large - diameter alumina ir filter with our new ar coating method . \n section  [ sec : materialproperties ] explains our measurements of material properties . \n the fabrication process is detailed in section  [ sec : fabrication ] . \n section  [ sec : characterization ] shows our characterization of the ar coatings on a large - diameter alumina ir filter . \n we discuss our results in section  [ disc ] and give conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n to be concrete , our ar - coating deveopment targets next - generation cmb experiments , where typical requirements on the ir filter and the ar coating are as follows : @xcite    * the filter diameter must be extendable to 450  mm or larger ; * the ar coating is robust against thermal shock , so that it is usable in cryogenic temperatures ; * the uniformity of the additional optical path length due to the ar coating should be less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wavelength of the incoming electromagnetic wave ; * transmittance should be above 95  % at the detection bands , which we assume 95  ghz and 150  ghz with a @xmath3 fractional bandwidth for each ; * the 3  db cutoff frequency should be below 1  thz . \n the filter diameter requirement satisfies the requirement for a large focal plane with o(10000 ) superconducting millimeter - wave sensors . \n the requirement on robustness against thermal shock is important for use at low temperatures . \n the thickness of the ar coating is designed to be @xmath4 so that the reflected beam is canceled . \n the uniformity must be better than @xmath1 , which corresponds to a transmittance uncertainty of 1  % . \n the requirement on transmittance in detection bands comes from the design sensitivity of experiment . \n the requirement on the cutoff frequency is derived to reduce the ir emission whose main frequency range is 10 - 100  thz . \n figure  [ fig : af_config ] shows a schematic view of two - layer ar coatings on a large - diameter alumina disc . \n the design satisfies the typical requirements mentioned above . \n the ar coatings consist of the thermally - sprayed mullite , which has the index of refraction ( ior ) of 2.5 as the first layer and polyimide foam ( called skybond foam  @xcite hereafter ) as the second layer . \n a thin layer of low - density polyethylene ( ldpe ) is placed in between two ar layers as a glue layer . \n we employ the mullite as the first layer because the coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) is close to that of alumina . \n the idea of using the skybond foam for the second layer is a natural extension of the polyimide sheet adopted by spider , which was explained in the previous section . \n an important advantage of the polyimide foam is that the ior can be controlled by changing the filling factor of the polyimide , which gives us an additional tuning knob to optimize the ar coating properties for given observation frequencies . \n our example design for this study is optimized to achieve the highest integrated efficiency for simultaneous measurements centered at 95  ghz and 150  ghz with a @xmath3 fractional bandwidth for each . here \n we fix the thickness of the alumina and the ior of mullite , while the ior of the skybond foam and the thicknesses of mullite and the skybond foam layers are free parameters . for the design in fig . \n [ fig : af_config ] , the optimized ior for the skybond foam is 1.43 . \n measurements of the properties of each ar layer as well as those of alumina we have used in this study are described in the next section . \n , width=249 ] \n we have measured basic properties of alumina , mullite and the skybond foam . \n the measurements include thicknesses , iors , and the loss tangent values . \n table  [ material ] summarizes our results . \n the ior and the loss tangent are obtained from transmission measurements . \n a detailed description of the measurement system is available elsewhere  @xcite . the beam at millimeter wavelength ( 72 - 108  ghz and 108 - 148  ghz ) is produced by a signal generator with a sixfold and eightfold frequency multiplier@xcite . \n the frequency range of the signal generator is between 12 and 18  ghz . \n the beam is collimated by an ultra - high - molecular - weight polyethylene lens and the measured sample is placed immediately after the aperture . \n the transmitted radiation is detected by a diode detector . \n the signal is chopped at 13 hz for modulation with a lock - in amplifier , and the modulated signal is obtained using a daq . \n the detector is moved along the optical axis for more than a half wavelength to subtract the effect of a standing wave in the measurement setup . \n we measure the power with and without the sample and take the ratio between them to obtain the transmittance . \n the measured transmittance is fitted with the fresnel formula  @xcite . in the following sections , we describe more details on each material .    . \n basic properties of alumina and ar materials . \n the thickness @xmath5 , the ior @xmath6 , and the loss tangent @xmath7 are listed . our measurements for @xmath6 and @xmath7 are carried out both at room temperature and at the temperature of liquid nitrogen , whereas the thickness values are only measured at room temperature . \n the errors include both statistical and systematic uncertainties . \n the systematic errors mainly arise from the uncertainty of the ar thicknesses and temperature variations during the measurements . \n [ material ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we measure the transmittance of the alumina filter with the same setup described in section  [ sec : materialproperties ] at room temperature and at 81  k cooled with liquid nitrogen . since the uniformity measurements at room temperature gurantee that the fabrication process is independent of the size of the filter , to perform measurements with liquid nitrogen , we fabricated a sample with 50  mm in diameter to avoid mechanical conflict with the measurement system . \n figure  [ fig : ar ] shows the result . \n the black lines show fit results with the emt . \n the estimated average transmittances are 95.9  % and 95.8  % in the 95  ghz and 150  ghz bands , respectively .    , width=321 ] \n we estimate the emissivity , @xmath8 , from the following equation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the absorption , the power reflectance , and the transmittance of the filter , respectively . \n the reflectances calculated from the parameters given in table  [ material ] are 2.1  % and 1.1  % at 95  ghz and 150  ghz bands . \n the estimated emissivities are 2.7  % and 4.2  % in the 95  ghz and 150  ghz bands , respectively . \n the transmittance of the alumina filter at sub - millimeter wavelengths is measured using a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) with an insb bolometer . \n a mercury lamp is used as a broadband thermal source . \n the detailed description of the fts is found elsewhere  @xcite . \n the transmittance is measured from 200  ghz to 1,500  ghz at two different temperatures of 19 k and 298 k. we prepare the alumina filters with a diameter of 20  mm for the fts measurements . \n the measured spectrum at 19  k has a higher transmittance than the spectrum at 298  k as shown in fig . \n [ fig : ir ] . \n the 3  db cutoff frequencies of the filter are estimated as 400 and 650  ghz at 295 and 19  k , respectively . \n these 3  db cut off frequencies are sufficiently lower than our design goal . \n , width=359 ] \n we have demonstrated that the ar coating method with mullite and skybond foam satisfies all the requirements listed in section  [ sec : filterdesign ] , which are typical in next - generation cmb experiments . although we have focused on the measurements at 95 ghz and 150 ghz , a future cmb satellite mission litebird  @xcite for example requires wider frequency ranges from 40 ghz to 400 ghz using two telescopes . \n skybond foam is tunable in ior and can thus be considered as a candidate technology for such a space mission . \n we have newly applied the emt in millimeter wave measurements to have the better surface model , which were not adopted in previous works . \n the fit results are in better agreement with data . \n the performances of the new ar coating method described in this study are as good as those with epoxy with grooves . \n the fabrication time of the method with mullite and skybond foam is much shorter than the epoxy coating , which is a clear advantage . \n finally , this method can in principle be applied to curved surfaces , so that applications for lenses should also be considered . \n we have newly introduced polyimide foam ( skybond foam ) as the ar coating material . \n we show that the ior of skybond foam is controlled between 1.1 and 1.7 by changing the filling factor . \n the tunable ior allows us to design a multi - layer ar coating much easier . \n we have made a two - layer ar coating with thermally - sprayed mullite as the first layer and skybond foam as the second layer on a 2 mm - thick alumina plate with 460 mm in diameter . \n we have confirmed that sample uniformity in the ior and thickness is satisfactory for 150 ghz measurements . \n we have also confirmed that the ar coating is robust against thermal cycles . \n the measured transmittances of this filter at 81 k are 95.8  % for 95 ghz and 95.9  % for 150 ghz . \n the measured 3  db cut - off frequency is 650 ghz at 19 k. the results satisfy requirements on ir filters for next - generation cmb polarization measurements where a large focal - plane and a large window are needed . \n we thank hiroshi matsuo and tom nitta for their help with thz measurements . \n we are also grateful to satoru igarashi , iwao murakami , and keishi toyoda for their help in setting up the measurement . \n we would like to express our gratitude to adrian lee , osamu tajima , suguru takada , akito kusaka , hiroshi yamaguchi , junichi suzuki , yuichi watanabe and yuuko segawa . \n we would like to thank the kek cryogenics science center for the support . \n yuki inoue was supported by advanced research cource in sokendai ( the graduate university for advanced studies ) , and by academia sinica under grants no . \n cda-105-m06 in taiwan . \n kek authors were supported by mext kakenhi grant numbers 21111002 , 15h05891 , and jsps kakenhi grant numbers 13j03626 , 24740182 , 24684017 , 15h03670 , 24111715 and 26220709 . finally , this work was supported by the jsps core -

{"ContextTokens": 3211, "GeneratedTokens": 143, "SynthesizedBody": "two - dimensional crystals have been given a large amount of attention since the isolation of one - atom - thick materials by novosolov _ \n et al_.  in 2004.@xcite graphene , a single layer of graphite , has attracted by far the most attention because of the high crystal quality of the graphene samples and its fascinating electronic properties.@xcite these properties make it a promising candidate to use as a basic material for future electronics applications.@xcite however , the use of graphene for applications in electronics suffers from a major drawback : graphene is , in its pristine state , a zero - bandgap semiconductor and this gapless state appears to be rather robust . \n several ways have been explored to induce a finite band gap in graphene . \n it was found experimentally that a band gap can be opened by confining the electrons in nanoribbons @xcite or by applying a potential difference over a graphene bilayer.@xcite    the chemical modification of graphene is another promising way to create a band gap . \n @xcite when radicals such as oxygen , hydrogen , or fluorine atoms are adsorbed on the graphene surface they form covalent bonds with the carbon atoms . \n these carbon atoms change their hybridization from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which leads to the opening of a band gap ( similar as in diamond ) . \n the adsorbed radicals can attach to the graphene layer in a random way , as is the case in graphene oxide ( go),@xcite or they can form ordered patterns . in the last case , new graphene - based 2d crystals are formed with properties that can vary greatly from their parent material . \n this has been found to be the case for hydrogen and fluorine adsorbates . \n the new 2d crystals that are expected to form in those cases@xcite have been named graphane @xcite and graphene fluoride ( or fluorographene)@xcite , respectively .    following this route , \n multi - layer graphene fluoride was recently synthesized , @xcite and its structural and electronic properties were studied . \n a strongly insulating behavior was found with a room temperature resistance larger than 10g@xmath2 , which is consistent with the existence of a large band gap in this new material.@xcite only a partial fluorine coverage of the graphene multi - layer samples was achieved in these experiments . \n the f / c ratio was estimated to be 0.7 in ref . and 0.24 in ref . , according to weight gain measurements . \n an important step forward in creating fully covered two - dimensional graphene fluoride samples was recently achieved in ref . . \n the obtained single - layer graphene fluoride exhibits a strong insulating behavior with a room temperature resistance larger than 1t@xmath2 , a strong temperature stability up to 400 @xmath3 , and almost a complete disappearance of the graphene raman peaks associated with regions that are not fully fluorinated.@xcite the graphene raman peaks do not disappear completely , however , which could be an indication of the presence of defects in the sample , such as a small portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms . \n it was also found experimentally that fluorographene has a young s modulus of @xmath4 100 n / m , and the optical measurements suggest a band gap of @xmath4 3ev .    in ref . \n it was demonstrated that single - side adsorption is also possible and that it probably results in a crystalline c@xmath5f structure with a large band gap .    on the theoretical side , \n first - principles studies on graphene monofluoride started in 1993 , motivated by available experiments on graphite monofluoride . using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , \n it was shown in ref . that the chair configuration of graphene fluoride is energetically more favorable than the boat configuration by 0.145 ev per cf unit ( 0.073 ev / atom ) , while a transition barrier of the order of 2.72 ev was found between both structures . due to the small difference in formation energy and the large energy barrier between both configurations \n , it was argued that the kinematics of the intercalation could selectively determine the configuration , or that there could also be a mixing of both configurations in the available experiments . by using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional a direct band gap of 3.5 ev \n was calculated for the chair configuration in ref . . \n however , it is well known that dft generally underestimates the band gap . \n recent calculations used the more accurate gw approximation and found a much larger band gap of 7.4 ev for the chair configuration of graphene monofluoride ( ref . ) . \n this theoretical value is twice as large as the one obtained experimentally for graphene fluoride in ref . \n , which is @xmath4 3ev . \n the experimental value for the young s modulus as found in ref . \n ( @xmath4 100 n / m ) is also half the value obtained recently from first - principles calculations in ref . \n ( @xmath4 228 n / m ) for the chair configuration of graphene fluoride . \n it is worth noting that the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite values of the young s modulus of graphene only differ in a small percentage . \n possible reasons for the disagreement between the experimental values and the ab initio results for the young s modulus and the band gap of graphene fluorine could be : i ) the presence of a different configuration or a mixture of them in the experimental samples , or ii ) the presence of defects , which could decrease the size of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values .    in this paper , we investigate various possible crystal configurations for both graphene - based two - dimensional crystals , graphene fluoride and graphane , and we examine their structural , electronic , and mechanical properties . in the case of graphene fluorine , we found a new configuration not considered before that has a lower energy than the boat configuration . \n this new configuration , which we call the zigzag configuration , is energetically less favorable than the chair configuration by only 0.073 ev per cf unit ( 0.036 ev / atom ) . \n we calculated the young s modulus and the band gap ( both with gga and in the gw approximation ) for the different configurations . \n the disagreements between experimental and ab initio calculations for graphene fluoride persist independently of the considered configuration . \n these results imply that the available experimental samples probably contain a large number of defects , such as a portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms , that decrease the value of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values . \n the paper is organized as follows : first we describe the computational details of our first - principles calculations \n . then we investigate the stability and structural properties of the different configurations of both graphene derivatives . to conclude , \n the elastic and electronic properties of the different structures are discussed . \n we examine different graphane and graphene fluoride configurations with the use of _ ab initio _ calculations performed within the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism . \n the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite is used for the exchange - correlation functional and a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 40 hartree is applied . \n the sampling of the brillouin zone is done with the equivalent of a @xmath6 monkhorst - pack k - point grid@xcite for a graphene unit cell and we use pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type.@xcite since periodic boundary conditions are applied in all 3 dimensions a vacuum layer of 20 bohr is included to minimize the ( artificial ) interaction between adjacent layers . \n all the calculations were performed with the abinit code.@xcite    the reported quasiparticle corrections for the band gap are obtained using the yambo code.@xcite here the first - order quasiparticle corrections are obtained using hedin s gw approximation  @xcite for the electron self - energy . because we are treating two - dimensional systems , \n the spurious coulomb interaction between a layer and its images should be avoided , as this causes serious convergence problems . \n therefore we use a truncation of this interaction in a box layout , following the method of rozzi _ \n et al._.@xcite the remaining singularity is treated using a random integration method in the region near the gamma point.@xcite nevertheless , a larger separation between the layers is necessary , so a value of @xmath7 bohr is used for these calculations . \n we studied four different stoichiometric configurations for both graphane and graphene fluoride in which every carbon atom is covalently bonded to an adsorbate in an equivalent way , i.e.  every carbon / adsorbate pair has the same environment . \n these configurations are schematically depicted in fig . \n [ fig_conform ] and we will refer to them as the ` chair ' , ` boat ' , ` zigzag ' , and ` armchair ' configuration . the chair and boat configurations have been well investigated before , but the zigzag and armchair configurations are rarely examined for graphane@xcite and we are not aware of any studies for fluorographene . \n the names of these last two configurations have been chosen for obvious reasons ( see fig . [ \n fig_conform](c ) and [ fig_conform](d ) ) . \n after relaxation , the different configurations appear greatly distorted when compared with the schematic pictures of fig . \n [ fig_conform ] , so these figures should only be regarded as topologically correct ( see fig . \n [ fig_superlatt ] ) .      to examine the stability of the different configurations , we make use of the formation energy of the structures and the binding energy between the graphene layer and the adsorbates . \n we define the formation energy , e@xmath8 , as the energy per atom of the hydrogenated or fluorinated graphene with respect to intrinsic graphene and the corresponding diatomic molecules h@xmath9 and f@xmath9 . \n the binding energy , e@xmath10 , is defined with respect to graphene and the atomic energies of the adsorbates and is calculated per ch or cf pair . \n the results are summarized in table [ tab_energies ] . \n .the formation energy e@xmath11 , the binding energy e@xmath12 , and the relative binding energy @xmath13e@xmath11 ( with respect to the most stable configuration ) for different hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene configurations . the energies are given in ev.[tab_energies ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the electronic band structure and the corresponding density of states of graphane and fluorographene in the chair configuration are shown in fig . \n [ fig_bs ] . \n both band structures look similar but there are also some clear differences . in the case of fluorographene the parabolic band at the @xmath14-point , corresponding to quasi - free electron states , is at much higher energies which indicates a larger ionization energy for fluorinated graphene . \n this ionization energy ( ie ) is defined as the difference between the vacuum level and the valence band maximum and an explicit calculation of this energy indicates a difference of about 3 ev between graphane and fluorographene ( see table [ tab_bg ] ) . \n this is a consequence of the negative charges on the fluorine atoms in fluorographene . \n we can also compare the ie values with the work function of graphene which is the same as its ionization potential ( because graphene has no band gap ) and has a value of 4.22 ev from gga ( this is somewhat smaller that the experimental value@xcite of 4.57@xmath150.05 ev ) . \n it can be seen from table [ tab_bg ] that the ionization energies of both graphene derivatives are higher than that of graphene ( @xmath4 0.5 ev and 3.5 ev , respectively ) , although the ionization energy of graphane is rather similar to graphene . \n we investigated different configurations of the graphene derivatives fluorographene and graphane . \n the chair configuration is the most stable one in both cases , but the zigzag configuration has only a slightly higher formation energy and is more stable than the much more studied boat configuration . \n fluorographene is found to be much more stable than graphane which is mainly due to a much higher desorption energy for f@xmath9 as compared to h@xmath9 . \n we also demonstrated that there are structural and electronic differences that are caused by the charged state of the f atoms in fluorographene . \n when our results are compared to available experimental data for fluorographene some discrepancies can be noticed : for all the configurations studied we find much larger band gaps in the electronic band structure and the calculated young s modules is much larger . \n this might indicate that the experimental samples still contain appreciable amounts of defects . \n the nature of these defects requires further investigation , but one can speculate that these defects consist of missing adsorbates , partial h / f coverage , or mixed configurations . \n this work was supported by the flemish science foundation ( fwo -

{"ContextTokens": 4043, "GeneratedTokens": 315, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become a powerful cosmological tool with applications in various astrophysical scenarios . \n recently , the wmap team has determined the main cosmological parameters from the cmb temperature field with unprecedented accuracy @xcite . \n this temperature field is composed of primordial anisotropies , generated at the last scattering surface , and secondary fluctuations , which arise as the cmb photons travel to the observer . among these secondary anisotropies , we shall concentrate on the so called thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( hereafter tsz , @xcite ) , associated with the distortion of the black body spectrum of the cmb photons due to compton scattering on fast moving thermal electrons . \n this spectral distortion is independent of redshift and proportional to the integrated electron pressure along the line of sight . \n it has been detected in the direction of several galaxy clusters @xcite . \n this makes the tsz effect an useful tool for the detection of ionized hot gas . \n recently , @xcite have argued that about 90% of all baryons are in the form of intergalactic plasma , not dense and hot enough to be detectable as x - ray sources except in clusters and groups of galaxies . at low redshfits , 30% of all baryons could be in the form of ly-@xmath4 absorbers @xcite , but a large fraction of them has not yet been accounted for observationally . \n most models of structure formation predict baryons to be located in filaments and sheets , associated to galaxy overdensities @xcite . \n @xcite show evidence of filamentary x - ray emission at the core of the shapley supercluster , whereas @xcite report a detection of diffuse x - ray emission by warm gas ( @xmath5k ) associated with an overdense galaxy region . \n the aim of this _ letter _ is to use the tsz effect to detect directly the diffuse warm baryon component in the local universe . \n the analyses of the first year wmap data have indicated that a small contribution due to the tsz induced by clusters is present in the data ( @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite claimed a tsz detection at small angular scales but did not clarify the nature of the astrophysical sources associated with it . \n @xcite analysed the angular extension of the tsz signal in the w band of wmap by examining the cmb map in the direction of the largest galaxy groups and clusters found in the catalogues of @xcite ( hereafter aco ) , @xcite ( hereafter apm ) and the 2 micron all sky survey extended source catalogue , @xcite . \n their analyses showed evidence for diffuse tsz emission up to an angular scale of @xmath6 , which implied a baryon fraction larger than the wmap estimate . \n if baryons are distributed like the dark matter on scales comparable to the virial radius of galaxies @xcite , the projected density of galaxies on the sky will correlate with the tsz signal , _ independently _ of whether galaxies form clusters , groups or filaments . in this _ \n , we shall carry out a pixel - to - pixel comparison of wmap w band data with templates constructed from the 2mass galaxy catalogue , to test the distribution of hot gas in the local universe . \n in sec.2 we describe the pixel to pixel comparison method employed to estimate the tsz signal and the data used in the analysis . in sec.3 \n we present and discuss our results , and we conclude in sec.4 . \n the brightness temperature measured by a cmb experiment is the sum of different components : cosmological @xmath7 , tsz , instrumental noise @xmath8 and foreground residuals @xmath9 . \n if the tsz signal is well traced by a known spatial template , denoted here as @xmath10 and built for example from a galaxy catalogue , the total anisotropy at a fixed position on the sky can be modelled as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 measures the amplitude of the template induced signal and @xmath13 denotes the spatial average of the template . \n if all other components have zero mean and well known correlation functions , then it is possible to use a pixel to pixel comparison to estimate @xmath12 ( see @xcite for details ) . \n if @xmath14 denotes the correlation matrix of the cmb and noise components ( foregrounds residuals will be discussed later ) then the estimate of @xmath12 and its statistical error are @xmath15 since our galaxy template @xmath10 will be positive by construction , this equation demands that cmb and noise fields have zero mean . \n we impose the average of all pixels outside the kp0 mask to be zero . \n we checked that our results were insensitive to this requirement by carrying out a similar analysis usig the more conservative kp2 mask . in all cases our results changed by less than a few percent . \n notice that our method requires the inversion of the correlation matrix , a computationally expensive procedure . \n to speed up the process we will carry out the analysis in pixel subsets as described below . \n we checked with monte carlo simulations that @xmath16 is an unbiased estimator of the error . \n we centered our analyses on wmap w band , which has the highest angular resolution . in this band , \n the instrumental noise shows almost no spatial correlation and its position dependent amplitude is determined by the number of observations @xcite . \n the tsz template was built from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalogue @xcite . \n this catalogue contains about 1.5 million galaxies , extending up to redshift @xmath17 ( 400 mpc ) , detected in the near - infrared ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands ) . in order to build a tsz template ( @xmath10 ) , \n all 2mass galaxies were projected onto the sphere using the healpix pixelization @xcite with the same resolution as the cmb data . \n the amplitude in every pixel was made proportional to the number of galaxies . \n the template was then convolved with the window function of the noise weighted average beam of the four difference assemblies ( da s ) corresponding to the wmap w band ( clean map ) , and multiplied by the kp0 mask , like the cmb data . since our method requires the cmb and noise components to have zero mean , we substracted the map average outside the kp0 mask . \n pixels were sorted in sets of size @xmath21 , denoted as @xmath22 , where the superscript index @xmath23 indicates galaxy density , in such a way that low @xmath23 corresponds to higher projected galaxy density . for patches of @xmath242048 , \n the average projected galaxy density for @xmath251 was @xmath3 420 galaxies per square degree , whereas for @xmath25500 the density dropped to @xmath3 44 galaxies per square degree , which roughly coincides with the average projected density outside the kp0 mask . \n @xmath21 ranged from 64 to 2048 . \n the pixel to pixel comparison was then performed on each of these subsets : we compared _ all _ pixels in @xmath22 to their counterparts in the cmb map . \n our working hypothesis is that galaxies are fair tracers of the gas density and within each set electron temperature is similar , that is , in those pixels galaxies trace the electron pressure . within each subset @xmath26 , \n the galaxy density remained roughly constant , so our method returned @xmath4 as a weighted mean of the measured temperature in those pixels . \n if no tsz signal is present , then @xmath4 will scatter around zero , as a consequence of cmb and noise being random fields of zero mean . \n fig .  ( [ fig : allpxls ] ) summarizes our main results : fig . \n ( [ fig : allpxls]a ) shows the estimated @xmath4 s for the sets having the highest projected density of galaxies . in abscissas we give the set index ( @xmath23 ) . \n crosses , filled circles , triangles and diamonds correspond to @xmath24 256 , 512 , 1024 and 2048 , respectively . \n symbols are slightly shifted for clarity , error bars denote 1@xmath27 confidence levels . at wmap instrumental frequencies , the tsz effect causes temperature decrements , i.e. , template and cmb data should anticorrelate giving negative @xmath4 s , as found . \n sets 1 and 2 of size @xmath28 correspond to the first set of @xmath29 and similarly for all other sizes and sets . \n consistently , @xmath4 of a larger set is always bracketed by the @xmath4 s measured from its subsets . \n the largest signal comes from the densest 256 pixels but the highest statistical level of significance is achieved for @xmath30 ( @xmath31k at the @xmath32 detection level ) , since the error bars shrink due to the higher number of pixels contributing with tsz signal . in fig.([fig : allpxls]b ) the same data sets are plotted versus the average projected galaxy density , i.e. , the average number of galaxies per square degree within each subset , as seen by the w band beam . \n the symbol coding is identical : first sets of @xmath24 256 , 512 show a projected galaxy density as high as 420380 galaxies per square degree , whereas the 6th set for @xmath24 2048 contains around 140 galaxies per square degree .    in order to evaluate the significance of the previous results , we repeat the analysis for pixels of intermediate and low projected density of galaxies . in fig . \n ( [ fig : allpxls]c ) diamonds correspond to sets of size @xmath30 with @xmath33 $ ] , whereas filled circles correspond to indices @xmath34 $ ] . \n the shaded area limits the 1@xmath27 error bar for diamonds , that is about a factor of 1.2 bigger than for filled circles . \n while the latter scatter around zero with the expected dispersion , diamonds are clearly biased towards negative values : besides the first patch ( @xmath35k ) , there are _ seven _ other sets above the 2@xmath27 level , one of them at @xmath36 . \n we also tested the consistency of our results with respect to frequency . in fig . \n ( [ fig : allpxls]d ) we estimate @xmath4 by cross - correlating the densest pixel set ( @xmath30 , @xmath37 ) with all wmap bands : k ( 23ghz ) , ka ( 33ghz ) , q ( 41ghz ) , v(61ghz ) and w(93ghz ) . \n diamonds give the obtained @xmath4 s from _ raw _ maps , whereas triangles refer to analyses performed on _ foreground cleaned _ maps available in the lambda site . \n note that the wmap team only provided clean maps for the three highest frequency channels . in all maps , \n the signal is compatible with being due to tsz . \n a more quantitative comparison is not straighforward since the maps have different angular resolution and galactic contamination . \n when compared in pairs , all @xmath4 s are within 1@xmath27 of each other and they are all within 2@xmath27 of the expected frequency dependence of the tsz effect , whose best fit for the cleaned q , v and w band maps is plotted as a solid line . \n we measure the extent of the tsz regions by rotating the template around the z - axis ( perpendicular to the galactic plane ) and cross - correlating the densest 2048 pixels . in fig . \n ( [ fig : rottest ] ) squares give @xmath4 versus the average angular displacement of the pixel set . \n error bars are again 1@xmath27 . \n the solid line represents the gaussian approximation of the w - band beam . \n the size of the tsz sources is typically 2030 arcmins , slightly bigger than the beam but remarkably smaller than the values obtained by @xcite from rich aco clusters . \n actually , when one studies the angular distribution of the 2048 densest pixels , one finds that they are associated in groups of typically 34 members , and that the groups are uniformly distributed on the sky .    by comparing , in fig . \n ( [ fig : allpxls]d ) , results from the raw and _ cleaned _ maps built from the w band , one can conclude that foregrounds will have little impact on our results . \n we made a more detailed study using monte carlo simulations : we performed 100 simulations of the cmb and w - band noise components and added and removed a foreground residual template . \n as a conservative model for foreground residuals left after cleaning the w - band , we took the sum of the dust , free - free and synchrotron emission maps for the w band released by the wmap team . in each simulation \n we ( i ) added and ( ii ) substracted _ the whole foreground template_. in fig . \n ( [ fig : rottest ] ) we plot the average @xmath4 s for these simulations , after adding ( dotted line ) and substracting ( dashed line ) the residuals for several angular displacements . \n the shaded bands display the 1@xmath27 dispersion areas . \n the errors practically equal the statistical estimates of eq . \n ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) . to summarize , foregrounds do not significantly affect our estimated amplitude of the tsz contribution .    finally , we removed from our galaxy template all those pixels that were associated with known galaxy clusters . \n we used the aco and apm catalogues of optically selected clusters and the xbc @xcite , de grandi @xcite , noras @xcite , rosat - pspc @xcite and vogues @xcite x - ray cluster catalogues . \n we excised from the analyses all pixels lying within a virial radius of the cluster center ( taken to be ten times the core radius ) . for clusters without measured core radius but with known redshift \n , we assumed a virial radius of 1.7 mpc , and removed all pixels within that distance . \n for the rest ( the majority ) , we conservatively removed all pixels within a circle of 30 arcmin from the cluster centre . out of the 2048 pixels for @xmath37 , \n 1681 were eliminated . \n for the patches with @xmath38 , i.e. , the next @xmath360,000 densest pixels in fig.([fig : allpxls]c ) , a large fraction of them were also associated to known clusters and were eliminated with the excising . in fig.([fig : diffuse ] ) we show the cross correlation of these remaining pixels outside known clusters with the clean w band map . \n note that here patch sortening has been regenerated using surviving pixels . for the densest sets of @xmath24 64 ( filled circles ) , 128 ( triangles ) and 256 ( diamonds ) \n , we still find evidence of tsz , but at much lower level of significance . \n for the densest 64 pixels , subtending @xmath39 square degrees on the sky , we obtain @xmath40k , at @xmath41 significance level . \n the signal gets dilluted rapidly as more pixels are included in the analysis : @xmath42k and @xmath43k for @xmath24 128 , 256 , respectively . out of the 64 densest pixels , 54 pixels \n are in the zoa , and 45 of them coincide with five different cluster candidates in the ciza @xcite catalogue , ( ebeling , private communication ) . \n the remaining group of pixels are not associated to any known galaxy cluster . in fig . \n ( [ fig : mappxls ] ) we plot the location of those pixels in the sky . \n the shaded area correspond to the kp0 mask , that also remove many point sources outside the galactic plane ( dark grey dots ) . \n the 64 pixels are ploted as big white circles for convenience . \n under the assumption that galaxies trace hot gas , we have used the 2mass galaxy catalogue to search for tsz signal present in wmap data . in @xmath44 square degrees on the sky we have found a contribution of average amplitude -35 @xmath0 7 @xmath1k , spectrally compatible with tsz , and mostly generated by aco clusters of galaxies . \n our study , based on a pixel - to - pixel comparison , reaches the highest sensitivity level reported so far . \n compared with methods based on power spectrum or correlation function analysis , our method gives a larger level of significance since we restrict the analysis to the regions of the sky where the tsz contribution is expected to be the largest . \n we have found that the typical angular extension of this signal is somewhere between 2030 arcmins . \n furthermore , once all known clusters of galaxies are excised from the analysis , we are left with @xmath39 square degrees with an average amplitude of @xmath45k : those pixels fall mostly in the zoa and after performing our analyses we found that 45 of them are associated to five different galaxy clusters in the ciza catalogue . \n we have found no conclusive evidence that , in the volume probed by 2mass , structures less bound than clusters contribute to the tsz signal present in the wmap data . \n we thank r.rebolo and j.a.rubiomartn for enlightening discussions . \n we also thank h.ebeling for comments on the ciza catalogue and an anonymous referee for useful criticism . \n c.h.m . acknowledges the financial support from the european community through the human potential programme under contract hprn -

{"ContextTokens": 2046, "GeneratedTokens": 69, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation of traffic jams is one of the fundamental problems of traffic flow theory . \n traffic jams can form spontanously as well as due to hindrances , e.g. road works or slow cars . \n although these hindrances often cover only a small part of the road , they can cause large jams , or , in a more physical language , one observes macroscopic effects due to local defects in the system . \n this behaviour is one of the characteristic properties of nonequilibrium systems . in the context of driven lattice gases one can distinguish in principle two types of defects : 1 ) lattice defects , e. g. sites where the mobility of particles is reduced , and 2 ) particle defects , for example slow particles .    for the simplest model for a driven lattice gas in one dimension , the asymmetric exclusions process ( \n asep)@xcite , it has been shown that both types of defects can cause phase transitions . \n slow particles , i.e. particles with a reduced hopping rate , determine completely the flow at small densities . moreover , if the distribution of the hopping rates fulfills certain conditions , one can show analytically that the variance of the distance distribution has a logarithmic divergence at the transition density @xcite .    also lattice defects in the asep \n have been investigated extensively @xcite . implementing lattice defects one can observe three different phases : a high and a low density phase , where the average flow of the homogeneous system is recovered , and a segregated phase at intermediate densities , where the flow takes a constant value . despite extensive effort \n , exact analytical results exist only for a special type of update @xcite , but approximative descriptions are in reasonable agreement with simulation results .    in this work \n we generalize the results of the asep to the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model of traffic flow ( for a detailed explanation of the model see @xcite ) . compared with the asep , \n the particles ( cars ) can hop more than one site in a single update step and the update rules are applied in parallel to all cars . \n therefore slow cars can be considered in two ways . \n first , one can think of cars with a smaller maximum velocity and second , of cars with an enlarged braking probability . \n this has been done very recently and analogous results to the @xmath0 case have been found @xcite . \n in contrast to @xcite we discuss the case of two different maximum velocities in the third chapter . in the next chapter \n we show simulation results for the nasch model with defect sites , implemented as sites where the braking probability of cars is higher compared to the rest of the lattice . \n an alternative choice has been used in @xcite , where a speed limit in a part of the lattice has been considered . \n as already mentioned above , in this chapter we show simulation results of the nasch model on a lattice with defect sites .    fig . \n [ single_fund ] shows the fundamental diagram of a system with a _ single _ defect site . \n obviously we can distinguish three different phases depending on the density . \n in the high and low density phases the average flow of the defect systems takes the same value as in the homogeneous system . for intermediate densities \n the flow is constant and limited by the capacity of the defect site . \n this behaviour of the average flow can be explained looking at the density profile . in the high and low density phase only local deviations from a constant profile \n can be observed , but at intermediate densities one observes a separation into macroscopic high and low density regions . changing the global density within the segregated phase , \n the bulk densities in the high ( @xmath1 ) and low density region ( @xmath2 ) remain constant , only the length of the high and low density region changes . \n consequently the average flow is constant in the segregated phase , because the average density in the vicinity of the defect site does not depend on the global density . \n near the average position of the shock the density profile decays exponentially from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . therefore one can introduce a length scale @xmath3 , which corresponds to the magnitude of the fluctuations of the shock position . \n for @xmath4 we found numerically that @xmath5 for all densities in the segregated phase we took into account . \n this scaling behaviour is already known for the asep at @xmath6 . \n the modified scaling behaviour @xmath7 at @xmath8 was not found for @xmath9 . \n this confirms the picture that the reduction of fluctuations is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry @xcite . \n a good estimate for the plateau value of the flow for the case of @xmath0 can be obtained using the assumption that the system is separated into two regions of constant density , where the results from the homogeneous system can be used . using an argumentation similar to @xcite we \n obtain the plateau value of the average flow :    @xmath10    the bulk value of the density in the high ( low ) density region the density is given by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \n the shock is located at @xmath15 if @xmath16 or at @xmath17 if @xmath18 . \n this approximative treatment of the defect system is in a resonable agreement with the simulation results for large system sizes ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) . in principle \n one could treat higher velocities in the same way , but unfortunately no exact analytical description of the homogeneous system has been found by so far . \n in order to study the effect of slow cars on the throughput of single lane traffic , we discuss a system which consists of fast cars with maximum velocity @xmath19 _ and _ one slow car with @xmath20 .    in fig . \n [ slcfund ] the fundamental diagram of this system is compared with the fundamental diagram of the analogous homogeneous systems . obviously for low densities \n the flow is given by @xmath21 in a agreement with the homogeneous system with @xmath22 . compared to the homogeneous system one \n observes the linear density dependence also for larger values of the average density . \n the average flow depends linearly on the global density if @xmath23 holds , where @xmath24 denotes the stationary flow of the homogeneous system with fast cars . \n deviations from this form that are observable near the intersection point of @xmath25 and @xmath24 , are due to the finite size effects . \n the reason for the stability of the free flow regime in the mixed system is the gap in front of the slow car in the stationary state . in fig . \n [ slcprof ] the density profile relative to the position of the slow car is shown . \n obviously a large jam behind the slow car appears and the density in front of the slow car vanishes . \n therefore the slow car can move with its free flow velocity @xmath26 . \n this velocity determines the velocity of the whole jam and therefore the average velocity of the cars is simply given by @xmath25 . \n this is one possible simple scenario for the occurance of moving jams that are well known from measurements . \n in addition to the macroscopic form , two details of the density profile have to be discussed . behind the slow car one \n observes an oscillating amplitude of the density profile . \n these oscillations are well know from the spatial correlation function of the homogeneous system for small @xmath27 and densities near @xmath28 @xcite . \n obviously the slow car synchronizes the motion of the faster cars . \n furthermore we want to discuss the decay of the density profile at the end of the jam . for finite values of the braking probability \n the jamlength is fluctuating . \n these fluctuations are responsible for the finite size effects discussed above , because temporarily the gap in front of the slow car vanishes due to fluctuations of the jam length \n . measurements of the jamlength show that the fluctuations scale according to @xmath29 . due to the subextensive scaling of the fluctations the segregated states are observable up to @xmath30 if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the bulk density of the jam . \n the investigation of local defects in the nasch model has shown that these defects can change the macroscopic properties of the model . in the case of lattice defects \n three phases occur analogous to the asep ( i.e. @xmath33 ) with continuous time update . \n the segregated phase also exists for higher maximum velocities , but some details of the density profile are changed . in the low density regime one observes an oscillating profile as a consequence of the parallel update . \n the anomalous scaling of the fluctuations of the shock position found for the asep at @xmath34 is absent for @xmath9 , for all parameter combinations that have been taken into account . \n this result confirms the picture that the particle - hole symmetry is essential for the reduction of fluctuations . \n particle defects also produce phase separated stationary states at low densities . \n these states consist of a large jam behind the slowest vehicle and a large gap in front of the slowest car . \n the velocity of the moving jam is completely determined by the free flow velocity of the slow car . \n the formation of large clusters due to slow cars can also be observed in two - lane traffic , but due to lane changing the lifetime of the large clusters is finite ( at least for low densities ) . \n nevertheless it has been shown , that already a small concentration of slow cars changes leads to a drastic reduction of the average flow at low densities @xcite . \n our results show that the system poperties can change completely , if local disorder is taken into account . these results might also be important for an understanding of the behaviour of real traffic which are often determined by imperfections. such imperfections are not only the defects considered here , but also other deviations from an ideal system , e.g. ramps or a finite system size .", "StartTimeOffset": 882351351648, "RequestID": "bfa5a9953ebb729a450a0c6df94784c1a164b06f", "TotalTokens": 2115}

hermes - bca ] and [ fig : gk - clas - bsa ] show the comparison of the predictions of the gk model ( no parameter was tuned ) to a selection of dvcs measurements . \n the model is in good agreement with the data , the agreement being better at small @xmath3 ( which is the kinematic domain where the model was optimized for dvmp ) . \n we computed the real and imaginary parts of the cff @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath64 in units of @xmath41 ) at lo and nlo on a wide kinematic range ( skewness varying between @xmath65 and 1 ) . \n special attention was paid to the validation of the numerics : two independent codes were systematically compared and an accuracy of 0.1  % has been achieved in the range under scrutiny .    in all cases we have plot the lo cff , and the nlo result with quark contributions only , or both quark and gluon contributions . \n the results are shown from figs . \n [ fig : dvcs_re ] to [ fig : tcs_im ] . \n we observe large nlo corrections , mostly due to gluon gpds . \n surprisingly these corrections are maximal in the kinematic region of hermes and compass . in all our calculations , \n we choose @xmath66 . \n the size of the corrections may depend on that choice , and this will be the subject of further studies . also the choice of a particular scale needs some theoretical justification .                      the effects of nlo corrections shown in fig . \n [ fig : clas12-dvcs - cross - section ] are quite large in both considered gpd models although the value of @xmath3 is rather large . \n in particular we see that the gluon contributions is by no means negligible . \n the @xmath38-dependence of the interference term allows for an access to the real part of the cff @xmath67 . from fig . \n [ fig : tcs_re ] we know that this quantity is subject to large nlo corrections . on fig . \n [ fig : clas12-tcs - cross - section ] we indeed compare the pure bethe  -  heitler term , and the pure bethe  -  heitler term augmented by its interference with tcs at lo and nlo .          from fig . \n [ fig : compass ] we observe that nlo effects should be highly visible at compass which probes a kinematic region populated by sea quarks and gluons . \n deeply virtual compton scattering , both in its spacelike and timelike realizations , is the golden channel to extract gpds from measurements . using model - dependent evaluations we have demonstrated here , in the case of medium energy kinematics which will be explored in the near future at jlab and compass , that the inclusion of nlo corrections to the coefficient function could be an important issue . \n the difference of these corrections between the spacelike and timelike regimes is so sizable that they can be promoted to the status of direct tests of the qcd understanding of the reactions . considering cff fitting , global fits of dvcs and tcs data will be needed to separate quark and gluon contributions and allow an accurate interpretation of extracted data .    finally , let us emphasize that we do not consider as a weakness of the current physics program the apparent importance of nlo contributions to compton form factors and dvcs or tcs observables . although it certainly opens the way to a challenging verification that nnlo corrections are either under control or subject to a legitimate resummation procedure @xcite , it points to the very positive fact that the compass - ii and jlab12 experiments may constrain gluon gpds . the 3d tomography of the gluonic structure of the nucleon may thus be scrutinized through the @xmath29-dependence of compton form factors extracted from near future experimental data .", "StartTimeOffset": 901129078634, "RequestID": "cac8a0c24d8cc630924ea1c6388edd66b867e0e9", "TotalTokens": 2955}

{"ContextTokens": 4028, "GeneratedTokens": 291, "SynthesizedBody": "the isogal survey ( see omont , this volume ) has covered a large number of heavily obscured fields in the inner galaxy in the mid - infrared , using the isocam filters lw2 ( 5.58@xmath5 m ) and lw3 ( 1218@xmath5 m ) . \n very little information is available concerning individual stars in most of the survey areas and it was decided to include the relatively well - studied baade s windows ( bw ) of low obscuration , namely ngc6522 ( @xmath6=+1@xmath7 , @xmath8=3.8@xmath7 ) and sgri ( @xmath6=1.37@xmath7 , @xmath8=2.63@xmath7 ) , whose @xmath9 is about 1.5 , for comparison purposes . \n the m - type stellar content of the ngc6522 field has been surveyed by blanco , mccarthy and blanco ( 1984 ) and blanco ( 1986 ) . \n frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) have presented near - ir photometry of many stars . \n the census of mira ( @xmath10 amplitude @xmath11 2.5 mag ) variables in these fields is complete and their periods have been found by lloyd evans ( 1976 , photographic infrared ) and glass et al . \n ( 1995 , _ jhkl _ region ) . \n the @xmath12 and bolometric magnitudes of the miras obey period - luminosity relations . \n no carbon - type agb stars have been found in these fields . \n the results of the isogal bw survey have recently been presented by glass , ganesh et al . \n in the two isogal fields , each of 15 @xmath13 15 arcmin@xmath14 , a total of 1,193 objects were found . \n the survey is believed to be complete to a level of 5mjy in both bands , corresponding to [ 7 ] = 10.64 and [ 15 ] = 8.99 mag . \n the photometric errors are @xmath15 0.2 mag for bright sources , rising to @xmath15 0.4 mag for faint ones . \n the sensitivity and spatial resolution of isocam are about two orders of magnitude better than with iras . at the faint end , \n the density of sources approaches the confusion limit . \n the principal conclusions of the survey are illustrated by fig .  1 . \n there is a continuous sequence of increasing [ 15 ] mag with [ 7 ]  [ 15 ] colour . \n much of the scatter is due to the distribution in depth of the bulge , as found for the mira log @xmath16 \n @xmath12 relation ( @xmath17 = 0.35 ; see glass et al . , \n 1995 ) . making use of the known spectral types of many objects , \n the data are interpreted as evidence for increasing dust emission with increase of stellar luminosity and decrease of temperature . \n substantial numbers of stars in these fields have luminosities and mass - loss rates similar to those of the shorter - period miras . \n m flux ( flux arising in part from dust emission ) with [ 7][15 ] colour ( i.e. , dust relative to photosphere ) , starts at the tip of the rgb in the bottom left corner and ends with the miras at top right ( solid points ) . \n many other stars in the diagram , such as those with crosses , have luminosities and mass - loss rates similar to the shorter - period miras . \n there is some contamination from foreground stars with small [ 7 ] - [ 15 ] colour . ] \n the isogal 7@xmath5 m flux of a late - type star with an optically thin dust shell arises from its photosphere , while the 15@xmath5 m flux arises from a combination of the photosphere and the dust . \n this is illustrated in fig .  2 , an opacity - sampled stellar atmosphere calculation including  astronomical silicate \" dust , taken from aringer et al .  ( 1999 ) . \n the bandpasses of the isocam lw2 and lw3 filters are superimposed . \n it will be noticed that the 7@xmath5 m band is hardly affected by dust emission , but exhibits absorption features , probably due to water vapour and sio . \n the 15@xmath5 m band , on the other hand , may be dominated by silicate emission , which can greatly exceed that from the photosphere in this region . \n m isogal filter mainly measures a photospheric flux , while the 15@xmath5 m filter is mainly sensitive to dust.,scaledwidth=60.0% ] \n the baade s windows fields form part of the bulge area that was surveyed nightly for six seasons of @xmath4 250 days by the macho gravitational lensing project . \n the macho observations were made in two bands , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at effective wavelengths around 500 nm and 700 nm , and were transformed using formulae from alcock et al . \n ( 1999 ) to kron - cousins @xmath20 . \n the completeness and sensitivity to small - amplitude variations of macho and similar ccd - based surveys is much greater than in all previous work which depended on photographic techniques . \n in particular , large numbers of small - amplitude srvs in the solar neighbourhood might be found if data of macho quality were available . \n counterparts of the isogal sources were sought within a radius of 3 arcsec of their nominal positions . since it is known that the isogal sources are red giants , or else very bright early - type stars , only macho stars with @xmath10 @xmath15 13.5 + 4.67@xmath21 were considered as candidates , with @xmath21 taken to be 0.5 in cases where only one colour was available . \n this left 40,000 objects in the two fields to select from . \n there were 904 positional matches . \n the distributions of distance residuals for the two fields , together with , as a test , random matches produced when the macho star coordinates were displaced by 15 arcsec , show that spurious matches should not exceed about 10% in ngc6522 and about 20% in sgri , which is a denser field . \n sources which were not matched fell on gaps in the macho detector mosaic or , in a few cases , were too bright to be included in the macho database . \n a total of 332 stars had photometry at @xmath10 , @xmath22 , 7@xmath5 m and 15@xmath5 m and these were analysed further . \n almost all the 332 selected counterparts show variability at some level , and may be classified as semi - regular variables . \n twenty - eight stars , most of them foreground bright objects , were rejected for saturation effects in their macho lightcurves ( these included two miras ) . \n five of the @xmath414 known miras in the isogal fields ( see glass , ganesh et al . , 1999 ) \n were recovered ; the remaining 7 had already been rejected at the matching stage . \n fourier amplitude spectra were calculated for all 332 members of the sample . in general , a short period ( 15 to 200 days ) could be identified , but , for many sources , slower variability , not necessarily periodic , was also evident . \n because of the seasonality of the data , each season was also analysed separately and the fourier amplitude spectra were summed before searching for the most significant periods . \n work is continuing on the period - finding , which may still be subject to revision .        , [ 7 ] plot for cross - identified objects . \n the open points are the main periods identified . \n open triangles are separately identified long periods and solid triangles are mira ( large - amplitude ) variables , some of which were saturated in the macho data . \n periods for these cases were taken from glass et al . \n the periods in the hatched area may be subject to some revision.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the light curves ( see fig .  3 ) and \n periods are similar to those found by wood et al ( 1999 ) for agb stars in the large magellanic cloud . as in the lmc , \n the srvs outnumber the miras by a large factor ( @xmath4 20 in this case ) . \n however , although most srv light curves show clear evidence for variability in the 15200 day range , as stated , only a few also show the longer periods around 300400 days that seem to be common in the lmc ( type d in fig .  2 of wood et al . \n 1999 ) .    in the log @xmath16 , [ 7 ] diagram ( fig . \n 4 ) , a clear period - luminosity correlation is seen for the srvs ( periods below log@xmath16 = 2.2 ) with a steeper slope for the miras . \n the stars with periods longer than 200 days include the miras , which do not show simultaneous shorter periods . \n one star shows a single period of around 300 days and a 7@xmath5 m luminosity appropriate to a mira , but is not a mira . \n the group of three stars around log @xmath16 = 2.35 and [ 7 ] = 8.4 show no evidence for short periods . on the other hand , \n there are three low points with log @xmath16 @xmath232.6 which clearly show other periods around 5060 days , allowing them alternative locations in the more heavily populated part of the diagram . \n there is no clear period clumping among the srvs . \n instead , there seems to be a continuous progression , apart from the change in slope , in stellar luminosity , from the shortest period srvs to the miras . \n solar neighbourhood srvs with periods in the range 100 - 140 days show population i kinematics that are similar to those of miras with @xmath16 @xmath11 300 days ( feast , 1963 ) , although shorter - period miras fall into population ii . \n also , s - process elements are sometimes detected in both these sets of stars ( little , little - marenin & bauer , 1987 ) . \n this has led to suggestions that at least some of the srvs are related to the long - period miras , but pulsating in higher overtones . \n the amplitudes of most of the srvs are below 0.5 mag at @xmath22 . \n the five miras with macho light curves have amplitudes in the range 2.54 . \n a few of the srvs in the range 150200 days have amplitudes of about 1 mag . \n about two thirds of the light curves show persistent periodicity without much change in amplitude and could be classified sra . \n the remainder , although they usually show persistent periodicity , also show slow random or very long - period level - shifts and are classified as srb . however , it should be noted that these classsifications are subjective at best . \n kerschbaum & hron ( 1992 ) classify o - rich srvs as  blue \" or  red \" , according to their @xmath10  [ 12 ] and iras colours . \n probably the blue srvs correspond to those stars with [ 15 ] @xmath24 8 and [ 7 ]  [ 15 ] @xmath4 0 , while the red srvs are more luminous at 15@xmath5 m and have dust emission ( see below ) . \n for an order - of - magnitude estimate of the mass loss associated with a given star , we can estimate its 15@xmath5 m flux excess due to dust emission by assuming that the photospheric flux can be extrapolated as a rayleigh - jeans tail from the 7@xmath5 m measurement , which should be almost entirely free of dust emission . the result \n is shown in fig . \n m fluxes in mjy , beyond what is expected by assuming a rayleigh - jeans photospheric energy distribution fitted to the 7@xmath5 m fluxes , shown plotted against log period . having a period @xmath16 @xmath11 60 days seems to be a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for significant mass - loss.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the mass - loss rates for the srvs overlap those of the shorter - period miras and clearly do not depend on amplitude of pulsation . the lack of measurable mass - loss for stars with @xmath16 @xmath15 60 days accords with the finding of kerschbaum , oloffson & hron ( 1996 ) that mass - loss from stars having 0 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 75 days could not be detected in co radio emission , while those in the range 75 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 175 days had a 50% detection rate . \n jura ( 1987 ) gives for the mass - loss from an agb star : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gas outflow velocity in units of 15 kms@xmath2 , determined from co observations , @xmath22 is the distance to the star in kpc , @xmath27 is the stellar luminosity in units of 10@xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the flux from the object at 60@xmath5 m and @xmath31 is the mean wavelength of light emerging from the star in units of 10@xmath5 m . \n we take @xmath18 to be 8 km sec@xmath2 , the average value determined for semi - regular variables by kerschbaum , olofsson & hron ( 1996 ) , @xmath22 @xmath4 8.2 kpc , and @xmath27 = 0.3 , from the bolometric magnitude of a 200-day mira ( glass et al . \n 1995 ) . to relate the given 15@xmath5 m flux to the 60@xmath5 flux required \n , we very tentatively take the relation by jura ( 1986 ) , intended for carbon stars ( but see also the values of @xmath32 for astronomical silicate grains ; draine & lee , 1984 ) , namely @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 . \n if the excess 15@xmath5 m flux is 100 mjy , we obtain m = 1.3 @xmath13 10@xmath3 @xmath1 yr@xmath2 . \n excess , an indication of mass - loss , vs log [ 7 ] flux , an indication of bolometric mag . \n below the dashed line the data may be subject to photometric errors , exaggerated by taking logarithms . \n the slope is about 2.6.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      mass - loss in srvs is apparently a function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath16 . \n because high luminosity in lpvs is also associated with low temperatures , it is unclear how these quantities separately affect @xmath38 . considering @xmath37 as an independent variable , from fig .  6 \n we see that mass - loss increases with luminosity according to the approximate relation @xmath39 where we have assumed that @xmath38 is proportional to the 15@xmath5 m flux excess and the bolometric luminosity of the star is proportional to the 7@xmath5 m flux ( note that in the case of miras dust emission may also contribute to the 7@xmath5 m band , leading to an over - estimate of photospheric luminosity ) . \n finally , the reader interested in the general properties of srvs should remember that we have discussed so far only those stars which were detected in both macho and both isogal bands . \n a preliminary glance at the light curves of the stars seen by isogal only at 7@xmath5 m indicates that most of them are also srvs , but presumably with mass - loss rates too low for 15@xmath5 m detection . \n alcock c. et al ( macho collaboration ) , 1999 , pasp ( in press ) aringer b. , kerschbaum f. , hron j. , posch t. , windsteig w. , jorgensen u.g . \n , hfner s. , 1999 in iau symp 191 , asymptotic giant branch stars , ed le bertre t. , lbre a. , waelkens c. , astronomical society of the pacific , san franscisco blanco v.m . , 1986 , \n aj , 91 , 290 blanco v.m . , mccarthy m.f . , blanco b.m . , 1984 , \n aj 89 , 636 draine b.t . \n , lee h.m . , \n 1984 apj , 285 , 89 feast m.w . , 1963 , mnras , 125 , 367 frogel j.a . \n , whitford a.e . , 1987 , apj , 320 , 199 glass i.s . , whitelock p.a . , \n catchpole r.m . \n , feast m.w . , \n 1995 mnras , 273 , 383 glass i.s . , ganesh s. , alard c. , blommaert j.a.d.l . \n , gilmore g. , lloyd evans t. , omont a. , schultheis m. and simon g. , 1999 , mnras 306 , 127 jura m. , 1986 , apj , 303 , 327 jura m. , 1987 , apj , 313 , 743 kerschbaum f. , olofsson h. , hron j. , 1996 , a&a , 311 , 273 kerschbaum f. , hron j. , 1992 , a&a , 263 , 97 little s.j . \n , little -

{"ContextTokens": 1887, "GeneratedTokens": 283, "SynthesizedBody": "evolutionary stellar population synthesis , i.e. modelling spectral energy distributions emitted by evolving stellar populations , is a natural approach to studying the stellar content of different galaxies \n . one of the main ingredients of these models are the stellar libraries , which can be empirical or theoretical . \n stellar population models usually consider only the total metal content of stars and , therefore , ignore the different chemical abundance patterns that are present in individual stars . \n however , different chemical abundance patterns have a strong influence on the shape of the spectra . \n in particular , it is well known that stellar population models based on empirical libraries ( which are mostly composed of solar neighbourhood stars ) can not reproduce the high values of mg abundances found in giant elliptical galaxies . \n this is commonly interpreted as a consequence of high [ mg / fe ] in these systems , most likely due to a rapid star formation history compared to the more quiet one of the solar neighbourhood ( tinsley 1980 ) . \n an obvious solution , explored recently by several authors ( e.g. coelho _ et al . \n _ 2007 ; walcher _ et al . \n _ 2009 ; lee , worthey & dotter 2009 ) , would be to use theoretical libraries with the desired coverage in chemical abundances . \n however , while theoretical libraries have improved dramatically in the last few years ( chavez , malagnini & morossi 1997 ; murphy & meiksin 2004 ; rodriguez - merino _ et al . \n _ 2005 ; munari _ et al . \n _ 2005 ; martins _ et al . \n _ 2005 ; coelho _ et al . \n _ 2005 ; frmaux _ et al . \n _ 2006 ; bertone _ et al . \n _ 2008 ) , they still do not reproduce real stars of all spectral types , with especial problems depending on the wavelength range ( i.e. martins & coelho 2007 ; bertone _ et al . _ 2008 ) . \n some of the remaining problems are the incompleteness of the atomic and molecular line opacity lists in the blue region of the spectrum and for cool stars ( t@xmath1 @xmath2 4500 k ) as well . \n another approach is to compute , with the help of model atmospheres , response functions to characterise the variation of specific spectral characteristic ( usually lick indices ) to variation of different elements ( see trippico & bell 1995 ;

section 3 shows the mg abundance measurements from the miles spectra ; section 4 compiles the miles [ mg / fe ] catalogue and analyses its coverage over the library parameter space ; section 5 compares our stellar data with predictions of theoretical models focusing on the behaviour of some lick indices with [ mg / fe ] ;

{"ContextTokens": 3168, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "atomic resonance/ fluorescence lines may be linearly polarized when anisotropic optical pumping produces an anisotropic angular momentum distribution ( `` alignment '' ) within the ground state @xcite ( hereafter yl06,yl07,yl08 ) . \n this occurs if the pumping photon rate is greater than the collision rate , for instance within 1 - 10 pc of an ob star . in the presence of a magnetic field , `` magnetic realignment '' then occurs when the larmor frequency is greater than the photon rate . for the `` saturated '' case ( valid in the diffuse ism , where any field @xmath0 @xmath1gauss causes realignment ) , the polarization depends on the 3d geometry of the magnetic field , the ion ground state configuration and sometimes on the pumping spectrum . in circumstellar matter , @xmath2 @xmath1gauss \n is required for realignment , and the polarization can depend also on the field strength . \n related effects have been seen in the sun @xcite , but have not yet been demonstrated elsewhere . as a diagnostic of the magnetic field , \n magnetic realignment is potentially more powerful than the 21 cm zeeman effect , since it is sensitive to weaker fields and works in hot gas , and more powerful than dust alignment , since it is sensitive to 3d geometry , gas properties and velocity . \n this paper explores observational aspects of this effect . \n figure 1 shows the observational geometry . \n a gas cloud with a magnetic field at an angle @xmath3 from the line of sight is illuminated by a nearby star ( the `` pumping star '' ) at an angle @xmath4 from the field ( @xmath5 from the line of sight ) . in the absorption case , \n flux from a star behind the cloud ( the `` target star '' , which may be the same as the pumping star ) is absorbed by ions in the cloud . \n if the ions are aligned , the resultant absorption line is linearly polarized , with a position angle either parallel or perpendicular to the projected magnetic field , and a degree that depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for absorption , yl06 \n show that a non - zero polarization requires ions with at least three fine states in the ground level @xmath6 . in neutral gas , the most common ions are ni , oi , sii , and feii . the spectral resolution required is @xmath7 , to resolve the interstellar lines . \n since the absorption lines are almost entirely in the fuv , this requires a high resolution fuv spectropolarimeter @xcite .    in the emission case , \n the observed light is light from the pumping star which is scattered into the line of sight . \n the unique polarization signature of magnetic realignment is a distortion of position angles of the scattered emission lines from the centrosymmetric pattern expected for pure reflection polarization . yl07 and \n yl08 show that ions need at least three fine _ or hyperfine _ states in the ground level ( @xmath8 ) for a nonzero magnetic field effect . \n this adds the resonance lines of nai , ki , and alii to the roster . \n also , transitions that do not return to the ground state ( fluorescence ) exhibit the effect , thus opening up numerous targets in the visible and nir . \n the spectral resolution required is more modest : for sensitivity against scattered dust continuum @xmath9 is adequate . \n thus in principle , this effect can be observed with a ground - based moderate - resolution spectropolarimeter . \n this paper describes the beginnings of such an investigation , targeted at fluorescence lines in the visible . \n visible - wavelength fluorescence of oi , ni , and siii has been observed in hii regions and planetary nebulae @xcite . however , these lines are faint compared to the recombination and collision - excited lines in these regions , and the existence of alternate excitation mechanisms confuses their use . \n a better environment for the exploration of these lines is the neutral medium , for instance the gas within reflection nebulae , where photoexcitation is the sole excitation mechanism . \n a rough calculation suggests that the lines should be visible above the dust - scattered continuum with an equivalent width of @xmath10 , so should be visible with moderate resolution . \n no such observations have been published : we here report a pilot spectroscopic investigation of the bright rn ngc2023 . \n observations were obtained on 25 - 27 oct , 2006 as a part of `` performance verification '' on the new robert stobie spectrograph @xcite on the southern african large telescope , a new 10m - class telescope ( buckley , swart , & meiring 2006 ) . a north -

wavelength emission : ni , oi , mgii , alii , siii , ari , tiii , crii , mnii , feii , and niii . \n we observe ni , oi , siii , feii , and possibly tiii and crii . \n the observed equivalent widths are adequately predicted by a simple shell illuminated by a b1.5v star , @xmath37 mag , @xmath38 km / s , and no h@xmath39 absorption : the ratio of the predicted to observed equivalent widths are given in table 1 and shown in figure 2b . \n all the predicted lines for our wavelength coverage are seen to within a factor of two of prediction , except for oi @xmath186048 , which may in fact be feii , and for the mgii lines @xmath408115/8120 , which are not seen , perhaps due to additional depletion . outside of our wavelength coverage , we predict a detectable line of alii at 8641   and two very strong lines of mgii at 9221 and 9244 @xmath21 ( table 1 ) . \n we have not yet made predictions for tiii , crii , and feii , because their non - ls coupling results in far more complex pumping . \n we can now predict polarization signals from the lines seen and predicted for ngc2023 . \n the polarization is the sum of the reflection polarization - the polarization expected from an unaligned ( `` thermalized '' ) ground state - plus that due to ground state alignment . \n @xcite gives the reflection polarization , @xmath41 where @xmath5 is the scattering angle and @xmath19 is the `` polarizability '' , which depends only on the angular momentum @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) of the ground , upper and final levels ( table 1 ) . \n the polarization position angle is centrosymmetric : either perpendicular or parallel to the scattering plane . \n the maximum polarization is @xmath44@xmath19 at @xmath45 ; @xmath46 corresponds to thompson scattering . \n the alignment polarization will be nonzero only for alignable ions , where the ground state is aligned by pumping via all the possible uv resonance transitions . \n addition of the alignment to the reflection polarization changes both the degree of polarization _ and the position angle _ , depending on the scattering angle and the 3d magnetic field orientation . \n this results in a position angle that is no longer centrosymmetric , a feature unique to this process ( see figure 3a ) . \n a useful measure of this signal is the deviation @xmath47 from centrosymmetric , expressed as a polarization , @xmath48 .    a plot of  @xmath49(max ) _ vs _ @xmath19 ( table 1 ; figure 3b ) for each line is useful to plan the analysis . of the ions we see or predict , two are not alignable ( mgii and siii ) , and 5 are ( oi , alii , tiii , crii , and feii ) . to deduce the magnetic field geometry at any position in a nebula , we need first to estimate the scattering angle @xmath5 . for this \n we use lines of nonalignable ions with large @xmath19 , like mg ii @xmath189218 ( @xmath50 ) with equation ( 1 ) to derive @xmath5 . \n lines with zero polarizability ( mgii @xmath189244 , si ii @xmath185979 ) are used to measure and subtract foreground interstellar polarization . \n finally , to derive the magnetic field map , we use the map of @xmath51 for lines of alignable ions like oi @xmath187995 and alii @xmath188641 . \n ( if there is significant variation in @xmath5 along the line of sight , a more complex model will be required ) . \n a important consideration is the role of optical depth of the uv pumping lines . \n if the pumping line is `` trapped '' ( return is much more probable to the ground state than to an excited state ) , then when @xmath52 the excitation will be dominated by diffuse trapped light , which is no longer anisotropic ; any fluorescence from this level will be unpolarized , and the ground state can not become aligned . \n on one hand , most fluorescent exciters are never trapped , because the fluorescent transition itself has sufficiently high probability that the exciting radiation is rapidly destroyed : the maximum number of scatterings @xmath53(escape prob ) @xcite . \n ( in the simple model for ngc2023 above , the fluorescence intensity is modeled as being proportional to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , whichever is smaller ) . \n thus the reflection polarization of fluorescent lines should not usually be depolarized by a large factor . on the other hand , many alignable ions have lower lying trapped resonance lines that dominate the pumping of the ground state , whose effect is then to depolarize the _ alignment _ polarization . \n remedies for this situation are to look at thinner nebulae , and to look at ions which do not have trapped resonance lines , such as feii . \n we plan spectroscopy of ngc2023 and other nebulae to look for the predicted mgii and alii lines , followed by slit spectropolarimetry to find the best lines . \n the new fabry - perot polarimetry mode of the salt rss spectropolarimeter will then be used for construction of a magnetic field map . \n modeling improvements will include an feii realignment calculation and fluorescence model . \n buckley d.a.h . , \n swart g.p . , meiring j.g . , 2006 , proc spie , 6267 gatley , i. , hasegawa , t. , suzuki , h. , garden , r. , brand , p. , lightfoot , j. , glencross , w. , okuda , h. , & nagata , t. 1987 , 318 , 73 grandi , s.a . 1976 , 206 , 658 hummer , d.g . \n 1964 , 140 , 276 kobulnicky , h.a . , \n nordsieck , k.h . , \n burgh , e.b . , \n smith , m.p . , \n percival , j.w . , \n williams , t.b.and odonoghue , d. 2003 , proc spie , 4841 , 1634 nordsieck , k.h . , jaehnig , k.p . , \n burgh , e.b . , \n kobulnicky , h.a . , \n percival , j.w . , & smith , m.p . \n 2003 , proc spie , 4843 , 170 stenflo , j. o. 1994 , solar magnetic fields ( dordrecht : kluwer ) yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2006 , , 653 , 1292 yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2007 , , 657 , 618 yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2008 , , 677 , 1401", "StartTimeOffset": 984694909504, "RequestID": "8f41b229dac1045d4d39cf7e6497cd9e820cf596", "TotalTokens": 3317}
{"ContextTokens": 1835, "GeneratedTokens": 164, "SynthesizedBody": "most black hole x - ray binaries are transients . they spend years to decades in a very low state , and then increase in luminosity over a few days by as much as eight orders of magnitude . the outbursts \n last for weeks to months before the source returns to quiescence . \n quiescent black hole binaries ( hereafter qbhbs ) , have optical / ir emission dominated by the companion star , which can be used to precisely determine the orbital parameters , including the mass of the black hole ( see @xcite for details and a discussion of potential errors ) . \n but there is also emission from the residual accretion flow and from jets , which plays an important role in understanding the changes in accretion state during the outburst . finally , the inferred demographics of x - ray binaries , which have assumed a heightened importance in the dawning era of gravitational wave astronomy ( @xcite ) , depend critically on the duration of quiescence . \n observational astrophysicists commonly employ a variety of metaphors in explaining the importance of their work . \n accordingly i will organize the rest of this paper by means of three of the more common metaphors , whose literal manifestations are shown in figure 1 . \n i will take as an example the prototypical black hole x - ray transient a0620 - 00 ( hereafter a0620 ) , which underwent a huge outburst in 1975 ( @xcite ) reaching a peak flux of over 50 crabs . and \n has been in quiescence ever since . \n a `` smoking gun '' is an observation that confirms something that was already suspected to be true . in the case of qbhbs \n , the confirmed truth is that the accreting object in many x - ray binaries is a black hole . \n the companion stars which dominate the optical / ir light in qbhbs have optical absorption spectra similar to those of ordinary main sequence or giant stars . by applying traditional binary star techniques to these stars , the orbital parameters of the system can be robustly obtained . in many cases , \n the mass of the compact accreting star can be shown to be greater than @xmath0 , the upper limit on the mass of a neutron star . \n such objects are sometimes referred to as `` dynamically confirmed black hole candidates '' . \n the radial velocity curve of the companion can be used to determine the mass function @xmath1 , which is a strict lower limit on the mass of the compact object . \n the first mass function greater than @xmath0 was obtained by @xcite for a0620 ; since then better data have been obtained for a0620 ( @xcite ) and over a dozen other systems have been observed ( @xcite ) . \n the radial velocity curves are beautifully sinusoidal , as expected from tidally circularized systems , and there is little doubt that they represent the true motion of the companion star .    to obtain a mass , rather than a mass function , for the compact object \n , information about the orbital inclination @xmath2 must be obtained . \n this is generally done by studying the ellipsoidal variations of the companion star , caused by the tidally distorted shape of the companion , which results in changes in the cross - sectional area of the star as a function of orbital phase . \n the interpretation of such observations requires accounting for the contribution of the accretion flow to the observed flux ( e.g @xcite for a0620 ) . \n when this is done , the derived binary parameters fix the geometric size of the companion quite precisely , and the observed colors and absorption spectrum fix the temperature \n . therefore the intrinsic luminosity of the companion is well - determined , leading to robust determinations of the distance . \n one relevant case is that of gro j1655 - 40 , which shows very clearly defined ellipsoidal variations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n the well - determined physical size and temperature of the companion require a distance of @xmath3 kpc . \n an alternative distance of @xmath4 kpc ( @xcite ) would require the companion star to underfill its roche lobe by a factor of 2 , which would result in a nearly spherical star that can not produce the observed ellipsoidal variations . \n the lower distance estimate is based on the assumption that the observed spectral type implies a star with mass and radius similar to those of isolated field stars . \n but the evolution and surface gravity of a star losing mass through roche lobe overflow differ dramatically from those of isolated stars , and the observed masses and radii of qbhb companions differ from field stars of similar spectral type in many well - studied systems , including a0620 ( @xcite ) and v4641 sgr ( @xcite ) , as well as gro j1655 - 40 . \n a  rosetta stone \" is an observation that connects two hitherto disparate phenomena . \n qbhbs may provide such a connection between accretion physics and jet outflows .        during the transition from quiescence to outburst and back , \n x - ray binaries change not only the amount of accretion , but the nature and state of the accretion flow . \n these so - called `` state changes '' have been the subject of considerable recent work . the general consensus ( see @xcite for a review ) is that there is a low - hard state , with a power - law x - ray spectrum and radio emission from a jet , and a high - soft state , in which the x - ray luminosity is dominated by a thermal accretion disk , which quenches the jet . \n there are also a variety of intermediate states . \n the presence of a jet in the low - hard state has led to a scenario in which the accretion in that state is in the form of a radiatively inefficient radial flow , which allows the formation of of a jet ( @xcite ) . \n but it should be noted that the empirical support for such accretion - jet scenarios rests on the radio / x - ray correlation . \n the possibility that there might be a `` universal '' correlation in which @xmath5 , and , with suitable correction for the mass of the accretor , extends to the agn , generated considerable excitement ( @xcite ) . \n observations of a0620 ( @xcite ) held down the low luminosity end of this correlation nicely . however , further investigation revealed multiple correlations and branches , and a recent reobservation of a0620 has shown that the source has moved in the @xmath6 plane in a direction perpendicular to the general correlation ( see figure 2 ) . \n so the connection between accretion and jet physics is not yet as empirically well - founded as one might have hoped . \n the `` tip of the iceberg '' is an object or observation which implies the existence of a large unseen population . \n the current set of observed x - ray transients is certainly the tip of the iceberg of many currently unobserved galactic black hole binaries . \n x - ray transients are generally discovered during their brief outbursts , which requires that the outburst occur at a time when it can be observed . \n since x - ray astronomy is only @xmath7 years old , objects that have not gone into outburst during that time can not have been identified . \n many objects have been observed in outburst only once , which implies the existence of objects that havent gone into outburst at all . \n if such objects are common , the number of qbhbs in the galaxy will scale with the typical outburst recurrence time , a quantity for which there is currently no empirical constraint . \n theoretical arguments can be made regarding the outburst recurrence time based on assumptions associated with the disk instabilities responsible for the outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n however the variable recurrence timescales displayed by objects that have multiple outbursts demonstrate that we still have much to learn about these instabilities . \n but we now have decades of monitoring of qbhbs , and we can begin to see how they evolve as the disk builds up toward its next outburst . \n recently , a decade - long brightening trend has been found in nova muscae 1991 ( @xcite ) . \n it is also notable that the passive quiescent state in a0620 ( @xcite ) has disappeared over the past ten years in favor of the brighter active quiescent state . \n we therefore examined all of the quiescent data from a0620 accumulated since 2003 . \n as can be seen in figure 3 , the initial finding was very encouraging  however when data from 2015 -

{"ContextTokens": 3311, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "the advances in the comprehension of the physical properties of manganese perovskites have been given in two main boosts . \n the first one started in 1950 , when these materials were first considered by jonker and van santen . \n @xcite in that period , that spanned over more than a decade , the basic mechanisms governing their magnetic and transport properties were defined , giving rise to the description of the double exchange interaction.@xcite the second one took place last decade , after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite ( although a high mr had already been observed experimentally before , first by searle and wang@xcite and later by kusters _ \n et al._@xcite ) . during this period , in which we are still immersed \n , the research activity reached a magnitude that made the topic a starring one in the community of condensed matter physics , and the current opinion about the state - of - the - art underwent several changes . in the first few years after the description of cmr \n , explanations were tried on the basis of double exchange,@xcite but it was demostrated soon that such effect alone could not explain the magnitude of cmr.@xcite later , certain evidences in favor of the existence of an inhomogeneous electronic state in these materials started to appear.@xcite this tendence continues nowadays after the conclusions of many groups that found -and are still finding- that the homogeneous description of the magnetic and electronic state of manganites is almost ruled out .    in order to establish the basis for such behavior the idea of phase separation , i.e. \n , the coexistence of regions of localized and itinerant carriers within the same crystallographic structure , has been proposed.@xcite in this framework , dagotto , hotta and moreo@xcite proposed in a recent review the existence of a temperature window where coexisting metallic and insulating clusters appear above the curie temperature , @xmath3 , when this transition is first - order and there is a source of disorder . \n this temperature window would extend up to @xmath4 , where these clusters dissociate to form two - mn zener polarons ( or small polarons ) . \n the aim of the present work is to find experimental evidence of such temperature @xmath6 . for this purpose , ultrasonic attenuation and phase velocity measurements \n were carried out in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . \n this technique is proved to be a very sensitive tool not only for studying defects and microscopic processes in solids , but also for probing systems undergoing magnetic and structural phase transitions.@xcite \n samples were prepared by solid state reaction of la@xmath7o@xmath2 , cao or srco@xmath2 , mno@xmath7 and mno ( at least 99.995 @xmath8 in purity ) , which were heated in air in two steps ( 1100@xmath9c 70 hours , 1200@xmath9c 27 hours ) and pressed into disks . \n the temperature was slowly ramped at 5@xmath9c / min , and cooled down to room temperature at 2@xmath9c / min . \n intermediate grindings were made . \n pellets were finally pressed at 7 ton/@xmath10 and annealed at 1300@xmath9c for 100 hours , with an intermediate grinding at 30 hours . \n the nominal oxygen content was almost stoichiometric as determined by iodometric analysis . \n x - ray powder patterns were collected at room temperature using a philips pw1710 diffractometer , working with @xmath11 radiation . \n the lattice parameters , derived by rietveld analysis , are in agreement with those reported in the literature . \n cylindrical pellets , with a diameter of 10.0 mm and heights 2.4 mm ( lacamno ) , and 3.1 mm ( lasrmno ) were used to perform ultrasonic measurements . \n the two opposite faces of each sample were polished so that the difference between two points in each surface was not more than 1 @xmath12 m . \n the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements were performed on a matec-6600 series by means of the conventional pulse - echo technique . \n y - cut quartz transducers of 5 mhz fundamental frequency were used for transverse ultrasonic excitation . \n they were coupled to the sample surface with a grease for high temperature uses ( leak point 550 k ) . \n the sample was coupled at high temperature , and then cooled until 200 k and maintained at this temperature for 15 minutes before measurementes were carried out . \n the ultrasonic elapsed time for a pulse round trip ( transit time ) was obtained with the pulse - echo - overlap technique at the initial temperature . \n then , time variation with temperature was automatically monitored with a sensitivity of 0.05 ns at 5 mhz . \n the experiment was taken in a closed - cycle refrigerator ( janis ) and the temperature of the sample was varied at a rate of about 0.5 k / min . \n in fig . [ un](a ) we show ultrasonic velocity vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and attenuation vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , obtained with 5 mhz transversal waves between 220 and 400 k. for lasrmno it was impossible to measure the attenuation because its high value allowed to obtain only two echoes at room temperature ( at higher temperatures the second echo became negligible ) . \n the transit time was measurable at room temperature , and then time variations were measured with our automated improved matec system . \n the influence of thermal expansion has not been taken into account , because it is negligible : if ( @xmath13@xmath14)/l=@xmath15 we have that for our sample , with @xmath14= 2.4 mm thick ( 4.8 mm microwave path ) and a velocity of about 2500 m / s , @xmath16 ( @xmath17=time ) is @xmath18 s and therefore , at t@xmath19 , the associated variation of velocity is far smaller than the one we measured .    in our original ultrasonic velocity data , an approximately linear increment with temperature \n was observed at temperatures above 350 k for both samples . at this temperature range \n no mechanism related with magnetic phase transitions is expected , and this variation should be attributed to another mechanism , as the produced by crystalline defects present in the material.@xcite the resonant mechanism associated to dislocation lines is well known from crystalline metals . as moreno - gobbi and eiras@xcite , working on crystalline copper , have shown , it gives a term proportional to t for velocity and proportional to t@xmath20 for attenuation . \n the coefficient of proportionality depends on @xmath21 for velocity and @xmath22 for attenuation , where @xmath23 is the average free length of the segment of dislocation lines . in the present paper \n we assume a background of this kind in order to take into account the variation of velocity at high temperatures . \n the velocity background was fitted to the high temperature region of velocity vs. temperature curves , and then substracted from original data . \n these fits gave a term @xmath24 t for lacamno and @xmath25 t for lasrmno . \n the so - corrected velocity data are presented in fig . \n [ un](b ) . \n the differences between the numerical values of the coefficients of proportionality have their origins in the different values of @xmath23 expected for different materials.@xcite    the ultrasonic velocity for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 presents two clear anomalies : an abrupt hardening at about 250 - 260 k , and another lesser at about 350 - 360 k. the first one marks the t@xmath19 of this system@xcite ( t@xmath19= 260 k ) . \n the behavior is similar to that found at mhz frequencies by other authors,@xcite and at khz frequencies by cordero _ \n al_.@xcite the abrupt decay of the curve at t@xmath19 signals the first - order character of this transition,@xcite an interpretation that is in agreement with results obtained from other techniques.@xcite the decay in velocity is accompanied by a peak in the attenuation curve at t@xmath19 . \n this peak is asymmetric , in agreement with the results of cordero _ \n et al._,@xcite who explain it invoking the presence of inhomogeneous phases below t@xmath19 in a similar way to relaxor ferroelectrics.@xcite    the second anomaly takes place above t@xmath19 , showing a hardening process at @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k ( fig . [ dous ] ) . in fig . \n [ un ] it is also observed a very large attenuation peak at 320 k accompanying this velocity anomaly . \n this was not observed by cordero _ \n et al . _ at khz frequencies , but is clearly observed in our mhz measurements . \n the reason lies on the higher sensitivity of mhz techniques to small inhomogeneities , as magnetic clusters , due to the shortest wavelength ( approximately 0.5 mm at 5 mhz for transversal waves ) .    in figs . \n [ un ] and [ dous ] it is also observed that the only noticeable anomaly in the utrasonic velocity curve of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 is a hardening process beginning at about 370 k ( in the order of that of lacamno in the same temperature region ) , that is coincident with the second - order phase transition point of this compound , clearly observed by magnetization measurements ( t@xmath27 370 k).@xcite in the explored temperatures , no more transitions were detected . \n based on this behavior we can perfectly associate the process of hardening observed at 370 k to this second - order phase transition . \n one of the open issues in the comprehension of the physics of ferromagnetic manganese perovskites at present is to determine the nature of the magnetic phase above @xmath3 . from our ultrasonic velocity data \n it seems that this phase is different in the two systems considered . \n first of all , whereas lacamno displays a first - order transition at @xmath3 , lasrmno presents a second - order one . \n this difference , that has already been highlighted by magnetic measurements,@xcite and attributed by mira _ \n et al._@xcite to a change in the crystal symmetry , from orthorhombic to rhombohedral , seems to have further implications . \n magnetoresistance , thermal expansion , magnetovolume and magnetocaloric effects experience a considerable change when moving from one compound to the other.@xcite also , calorimetric data showed evidence for an anomaly at a similar @xmath6 in those manganites la@xmath28(ca , sr)@xmath29mno@xmath2 with a first - order transformation at @xmath3,@xcite in agreement with the ultrasonic data presented here that show the existence of a transition point at @xmath30 in lacamno . \n it is worth mentioning that our @xmath6 is similar to the point at which both the volume thermal expansion deviates from a gruneisen fit and the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates from a curie - weiss fit , after results of de teresa _ \n _ in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( ref . \n @xcite ) . supporting our results , we have to mention that neutron diffraction studies@xcite in the paramagnetic region of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 show differences with respect to la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 . \n we want also to call the attention on the similar values of the temperatures of the second - order transitions , @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xmath26 370 k for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . in some sense \n , it leads to think that the magnetic interaction between the mn atoms is of the same strength in both compounds and only the occurrence of the first - order change in lacamno is breaking the long - range order at a temperature below @xmath6 . \n after rder , zhang and bishop,@xcite this might be due to lattice effects , that would decrease the t@xmath19 associated to the de coupling . \n the anomaly at @xmath6 shows that the magnetic phase transition is not from ferromagnetism to a purely paramagnetic state , but some sort of magnetic structure is present . \n such idea is in accordance with the theoretical results of moreo _ \n et al._,@xcite who have proposed , after computer simulations , that large coexisting metallic and insulating clusters of equal electronic density are generated in manganese oxides with first - order magnetic transitions . \n et al._@xcite have qualified these compounds as relaxor ferromagnets , with a relaxation from one phase to the other . \n the fluctuations between both phases have been seen by transmission electron microscopy by podzorov _ \n et al._.@xcite in such a case , after kimura _ \n et al._@xcite the transition would be diffuse , like the one observed by us at @xmath6 . \n nowadays there is being growing experimental work that leads to assume the electronic phase - separated nature of such materials , and now it is well established that this phase separation is not due to chemical inhomogeneities or to the existence of phases with a different chemical composition.@xcite although this approach is quite recent in manganese perovskites , it had already been proposed by sears rodrguez and goodenough@xcite to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of sr - doped cobalt perovskites , thinking of a percolative transition at t@xmath19 .    in summary \n , we consider that our data confirm the existence , in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , of the temperature window @xmath31 proposed by dagotto , moreo and hotta@xcite , where probably the coexistence of a phase separated regime of metallic and insulating regions could be taking place . \n such window is not observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , a material with a conventional second - order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition at its curie temperature . \n the dgi of the ministry of science of technology of spain is acknowledged for financial support under project feder mat2001 -

{"ContextTokens": 1874, "GeneratedTokens": 96, "SynthesizedBody": "inclusive charged particle distributions have been studied for a long time to derive the general properties of hadronic interactions at high energies . \n a large body of the experimental data on charge particle production spectra in baryon - baryon , gamma - baryon and gamma - gamma collisions has been accumulated during last forty years . however , the underlying dynamics of hadron production in high energy particle interactions is still not fully understood . \n recently , a new unified approach to describe the particle production spectra shape was proposed  @xcite . \n it was suggested to approximate the charged particle spectra as function of the particle s transverse momentum by a sum of an exponential ( boltzmann - like ) and a power law statistical distributions : @xmath0 where @xmath1 with m equal to the produced hadron mass . \n @xmath2 are the free parameters to be determined by fit to the data . the detailed arguments for this particular choice are given in  @xcite . \n for the charged hadron spectra a mass of hadrons is assumed to be equal to the pion mass . \n therefore , the hadroproduction process in baryon - baryon high energy interactions could be decomposed into at least two distinct parts . \n these parts are characterized by two different sources of produced hadrons . the first one is associated with the baryon valence quarks and a quark - gluon cloud coupled to the valence quarks . \n those partons preexist long time before the interaction and could be considered as being a thermalized statistical ensemble . when a coherence of these partonic systems is destroyed via strong interaction between the two colliding baryons these partons \n hadronize into particles released from the collision . \n the hadrons from this source are distributed presumably according to the boltzmann - like exponential statistical distribution in transverse plane w.r.t . the interaction axis . \n the second source of hadrons is directly related to the virtual partons exchanged between two colliding partonic systems . in qcd \n this mechanism is described by the bfkl pomeron exchange . \n the radiated partons from this pomeron have presumably a typical for the pqcd power - law spectrum . \n schematically figure  [ fig ] shows these two sources of particles produced in high energy baryonic collisions . \n this explanation is qualitative , however .      in this paper \n an attempt to study hadroproduction in heavy - ion collisions according to the introduced model is taken . in these collisions , due to a large number of colliding partons , extremely high energy densities , comparing to those in @xmath3-collisions , can be obtained . \n the experimental data measured in auau collisions at @xmath4 gev / n by phenix  @xcite and pbpb collisions at @xmath5 tev / n by alice  @xcite are considered here . since the centre - of - mass energies per nucleon in these experiments are varied by a factor @xmath6 , a unified approach considering the energy density is suggested . \n the energy density in heavy ion interactions is known to depend not only on the centre - of - mass energy , but also on the centrality of the collision . \n hence , while the energy densities that can be reached at rhic  @xcite and at lhc  @xcite differ significantly , the energy density in central collisions at rhic might be of the same order as that in peripheral collisions at lhc .    therefore , we use a simple parameterization  @xcite for the initial energy density which is motivated by several model calculations . \n @xmath7 where @xmath8gev/@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 gev  @xcite . here \n the second factor is responsible for the incident energy dependence , @xmath13 is the c.m . \n collision energy , and the third one shows the dependence on the number of binary parton - parton collisions @xmath14 which is related to the centrality of the collision .    according to the introduced model , the exponential term stands for the radiation of thermalized particles with distributions similar to boltzmann - like thermodynamics . \n fitting the introduced formula ( eq .  [ eq : exppl ] ) to the measured experimental data allows to extract only the boltzmann - like statistical distribution from the whole statistical ensemble of produced hadrons . \n this exponential distribution is characterized by a parameter @xmath15 analogous to the temperature in classical thermodynamics , which value is obtained from the fit . \n therefore , it is interesting to study , how this temperature @xmath15 vary with the energy density obtained in the collision . \n figure  [ tee ] shows this temperature @xmath15 as function of energy density . \n as it was expected , the energy density obtained in central collisions at rhic is similar to those in peripherial collisions at lhc , therefore a smooth transition between these two experiments is observed . \n one can notice the interesting behavior of the temperature as function of energy density ( @xmath16 ) , which is in a good agreement with the stefan - boltzmann law . \n another observation on the temperature of the final state particles is that for high energy densities @xmath15 reaches a certain limit . \n this can be explained from qgp theory that considers the phase transition temperature @xmath17 from qgp to hadrons : the system cools until it reaches the critical temperature , thus , the temperature of the final state should be always below @xmath17 . indeed , for high values of @xmath18 one can notice , that the oberved critical temperature is @xmath19 mev , that is similar to previous theoretical observations  @xcite .    in conclusion , \n the experimental results on charged hadron production in heavy - ion collisions obtained in the phenix and alice experiments have been analyzed in the framework of the new approach . \n this approach allows to extract a part of the whole statistical ensemble of produced hadrons , those described by the boltzmann - like statistical distribution only . \n this exponential distribution is characterized by a parameter @xmath15 analogous to the temperature in classical thermodynamics . \n it is found that the parameter @xmath15 depends universally on the collision energy density rather than on the collision energy . \n finally , the observed behavior of @xmath15 is formally similar to the stefan - boltzmann law well known in classic thermodynamics .    99 a.  a.  bylinkin and a.  a.  rostovtsev , `` systematic studies of hadron production spectra in collider experiments .

{"ContextTokens": 3697, "GeneratedTokens": 163, "SynthesizedBody": "supernova ( sn ) 1987a occurred in the large magellanic cloud . \n it has been extensively studied in all wavelengths from radio to @xmath1-ray . \n the initial short outburst of radio emission @xcite is attributed to the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated by the sn shock propagated in the free wind of presupernova star , which was the blue supergiant ( bsg ) @xcite . \n after about 3 years radio emission was detected again @xcite as well as the monotonically increased x - ray emission @xcite . \n this second increase of emission is attributed to the entrance of the outer sn shock into the thermalized bsg wind and then in the h  ii region occupied by much more dense matter , consists of the swept up wind of red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor star @xcite .    to describe the observed properties of nonthermal emission of sn  1987a we use here a nonlinear kinetic theory . \n it couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite . \n therefore in spherically symmetric approach it is able to quite definitely predict the evolution of gas density , pressure , mass velocity , together with the energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of cosmic ray ( cr ) nuclei and electrons at any given evolutionary epoch @xmath4 , and the properties of the nonthermal radiation produced in snrs due to these accelerated crs . \n the application of this theory to individual snrs ( see * ? ? ? \n * for a review ) has provided the explanation of the observed snr properties under the assumption of strong interior magnetic field . \n it was also shown that this strong field leads to the concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the shock . \n recent observations with the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray telescopes in space make it possible to resolve such filamentary structures , which are the result of strong synchrotron losses of the emitting multi - tev electrons in strong magnetic fields downstream of the outer sn shock @xcite . \n application of the nonlinear theory to sn  1987a @xcite explained the properties of the observed radioemission . \n it predicted also the continuous increase of radioemission with roughly constant rate during the period from 1999 to 2006 yr , which was confirmed by further measurements @xcite . \n we analyze here radio data for more extended period of observation @xcite together with the chandra measurements of x - ray emission @xcite which provides a strong constraint on the amount of the nonthermal synchrotron emission at the same energies 0.5 - 10  kev . it is demonstrated that this constrain gives the evidence of strongly enhanced ( amplified ) magnetic field inside the snr , that in turn provides a better fit of radio data than in our previous study . \n we use canonical values of stellar ejecta mass @xmath5 , distance @xmath6  kpc , hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath7  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n during an initial period the shell material has a broad distribution in velocity @xmath8 . \n the fastest part of this ejecta distribution can be described by a power law @xmath9 . \n we use a value @xmath10 appropriate for sn  1987a @xcite . \n the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) creates a strong shock there which heats the thermal gas and accelerates particles diffusively to a nonthermal cr component of comparable energy density . \n strongly nonuniform csm is a result of interaction of progenitors winds : dense slow rsg wind and subsequent fast and diluted bsg wind . during initial period after the explosion the sn shock propagated in the free bsg wind and reached after about a day @xmath11 the termination shock in bsg wind , situated at the radial distance @xmath12  cm @xcite . \n after that the sn shock propagates in the thermalized bsg wind of density @xmath13 \n . considerable rapid decrease of the sn shock speed occurred during the days @xmath14 @xcite showed that sn shock entered the h  ii region of density @xmath15 . \n therefore we model the csm density distribution at distances @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18  cm is the contact discontinuity between two winds , @xmath19 is the scale of the smooth transition between them . \n the analysis of the rapidly increasing x - ray emission provides the evidence that h  ii region in turn is not uniform : at day @xmath20 the sn shock begins to interact with the dense inner ring . \n its radial behavior can be represented in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22  cm , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . \n such a gas radial profile is close to what was extracted from the above analysis @xcite . \n we adopt here for the gas number density @xmath25 the following values : @xmath26  @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xmath27 and @xmath29  @xmath27 . here \n @xmath30 is the mass of proton . \n the value @xmath28 \n @xmath27 which is by a factor of 1.5 lower than was used in our previous study @xcite , provides a good compromise between the sn shock dynamics seen in radio and in x - ray emissions ( see below ) . \n note , that the actual structure of the h  ii region , especially the dense inner ring , is essentially nonspherically symmetric . \n nevertheless since our spherically symmetric theory reproduces the sn shock evolution @xmath31 consistent with the existing data , one can expect that it gives a good estimate for the production of crs and their subsequent nonthermal emission . \n a rather high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg is needed to reproduce the observed steep radio spectrum @xcite . \n we believe that the required strength of the magnetic field have to be attributed to nonlinear field amplification at the sn shock by cr acceleration itself . according to plasma physical considerations @xcite , the existing csm magnetic field \n can indeed be significantly amplified at a strong shock by cr streaming instabilities . \n in fact , for all the thoroughly studied young snrs , the ratio of magnetic field energy density @xmath33 in the upstream region of the shock precursor to the cr pressure @xmath34 is about the same @xcite . here \n @xmath35 is the far upstream field presumably amplified by crs of highest energy , @xmath36 is the total shock compression ratio . within an error of about 50 percent we have @xmath37 cr pressure in young snrs \n has a typical value @xmath38 , therefore we adopt here upstream magnetic field @xmath39 since the process of magnetic field amplification is not included in our theory we simply postulate the existence of far upstream field @xmath40 given by eq.(3 ) . \n the spectrum of crs produced by strong modified shock is very hard so that crs with highest energies have a largest contribution in their energy content . \n these the most energetic crs produce field amplification on their spacial scale that is the precursor size . \n therefore crs with lower energies already see the amplified field @xmath40 . \n we will argue that such a high field , that is by a factor of ten larger than used in our previous study @xcite , is indeed required to fit the x - ray data . \n it also gives a better fit of radio data . \n we start our consideration from the snr evolutionary epoch @xmath41  d , when the outer sn shock has a radius @xmath42 and speed @xmath43  km / s . \n these values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 according to our calculations @xcite correspond to the end of sn shock propagation in the free bsg wind region @xmath46 . \n we neglect the contribution of crs accelerated in the region @xmath46 , because due to a high gas density the number of crs produced in the region @xmath16 very soon becomes dominant . \n calculated shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath45 shown in fig.[f1]a as a function of time are in satisfactory agreement with the values obtained on the basis of radio and x - ray measurements . \n note that radio data compared with x - ray data gives larger shock size at any given time @xmath4 and calculated radius @xmath31 goes between these two sets    to fit the spectral shape of the observed radio emission we assume a proton injection rate @xmath47 , which is a fraction of gas particles involved into the acceleration at the from of sn shock . \n this leads to a significant nonlinear modification of the shock : as it is seen in fig.[f1]b total shock compression ratio @xmath48 is essentially larger and a subshock compression ratio @xmath49 is lower than classical value 4 .    since the sn  1987a is very young crs despite of very efficient acceleration \n accumulated only 7% of the explosion energy @xmath50 ( see fig.[f1]c ) . \n note that the injection is expected to be strongly suppressed at the quasiperpendicular part of the shock , therefore one should renormalize the results for the nucleonic spectrum , calculated within the spherically symmetric model . \n the lack of symmetry in the actual snr can be approximately taken into account by a renormalization factor @xmath51 , which diminishes the nucleonic cr production efficiency , calculated in the spherical model , and all effects associated with it ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . with this renormalization \n the crs inside sn  1987a already contain @xmath52 since during the last 15  yrs the shock speed and the gas density are almost constant cr energy content grows roughly linearly with time . \n it gives the natural explanation of the linear increase of the radio emission detected during this evolutionary period . \n strongly modified sn shock generates cr spectrum @xmath53 , which is very steep at momenta @xmath54 , with index @xmath55 . \n cr electrons with such a spectrum produces synchrotron radioemission spectrum @xmath56 with spectral index @xmath57 , that very well corresponds to the experiment , as it is seen in fig.[f2 ] , where we present synchrotron energy spectra @xmath58 , calculated for five subsequent epoch together with the experimental data . \n note that cr spectrum has a concave shape : it becomes flatter at higher momenta @xmath59 . as a consequence synchrotron spectrum @xmath60 \n is also concave as it is clearly seen in fig.[f2 ] at @xmath61  hz . \n radio data reveal this property in good consistency with theoretical prediction .    strong downstream magnetic field @xmath62  mg , that corresponds to the upstream field @xmath63  mg ( see fig.[f1 ] ) , provides synchrotron cooling of electrons with momenta @xmath64 that in turn makes synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies @xmath65  hz very steep ( see fig.[f2 ] ) . concave shape of electrons continuously produced at the shock front together with their synchrotron cooling lead to a formation of two peaks in synchrotron energy spectrum @xmath58 . \n the first one at @xmath66  hz corresponds to cr electron momentum @xmath67 above which synchrotron energy looses are relevant , whereas the second peak at @xmath68  hz corresponds to the maximum momentum @xmath69 of accelerated electrons . under this condition calculated synchrotron flux at frequency @xmath70  hz , which corresponds to the photon energy @xmath71  kev , \n is below the measured flux at the epochs @xmath72  d. since the contribution of the nonthermal radiation in the observed x - ray emission of sn  1987a is not very well known ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , the observed x - ray flux has to be considered as the upper limit for the expected nonthermal emission . at early epoch @xmath73 \n d however the calculated flux exceeds the measured one ( see the curve , corresponding @xmath74  d in fig.[f2 ] ) . \n this can be considered as indication , that the actual magnetic field @xmath40 is few times larger then given by the eq.(3 ) . \n to illustrate the situation expected at considerably lower magnetic field we present in fig.[f3 ] synchrotron energy spectra calculated at the same set of parameters as before except magnetic field , which was taken @xmath75  @xmath76 g independent of time . \n since the interior magnetic field @xmath77  mg ( @xmath78 ) is essentially lower in this case , synchrotron losses of high energy cr electrons are considerably smaller compared with the previous case . \n due to this fact synchrotron spectra considerably exceeds at any given epoch the measured chandra flux . \n therefore we can conclude , that the actual interior magnetic field strength is not lower than @xmath79  mg . \n projected radial profile of the nonthermal x - ray emission at high interior magnetic field @xmath80  mg is characterized by an extremely sharp peak of thickness @xmath81 just behind the sn shock . since the thermal x - rays have much wider radial distribution it provides the possibility for experimental determination of the nonthermal x - ray contribution in the observed emission . \n experimental determination of the x - ray spectrum at @xmath82  hz ( @xmath83  kev ) is the another possibility to discriminate the nonthermal emission . \n such kind of measurements can be done with space instrument suzaku . \n completely different possibility to have the synchrotron flux , which fit the radio data and goes below chandra data , is low field scenario , when the magnetic field is as low as @xmath84  @xmath76 g . in such a case \n the cutoff frequency of synchrotron spectrum @xmath85 is lower than @xmath86  hz and calculated fluxes go down exponentially at @xmath87 below chandra points . \n however the value @xmath84 \n @xmath76 g is unrealistically small for such a dense medium , which we have in sn  1987a . \n in addition the effective energy of electrons @xmath88 which radiate at @xmath89  ghz in the interior field @xmath80  @xmath76 g is about 5  gev . \n the electron spectrum at gev - energies is characterized by a power low index @xmath90 that is considerably smaller than what is required for the observed radio spectrum . note that as it is seen in fig.[f3 ] even the field @xmath91  mg is too small to have a good fit of radio data as in fig.[f2 ] . therefore low field scenario should be rejected . \n calculated @xmath1-ray integral flux shown in fig.[f4 ] at all energies is dominated by the @xmath92-decay component . \n since the sn shock is strongly modified @xmath1-ray spectrum at energies @xmath93  tev is very hard : @xmath94 . at the current epoch \n the expected @xmath1-ray energy flux at tev - energies is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3s ) and during the next four years it expect to grow by a factor of two . \n this flux is by a factor of five lower compared with our previous prediction @xcite , because we use here renormalization factor @xmath96 , which reduces the number of accelerated crs calculated within spherically symmetric approach . \n the existence of strongly asymmetric csm structure , which is dense inner ring , makes our prediction of @xmath1-ray flux uncertain . \n according to the rough estimate this uncertainty is not very large , about a factor of two , due to the stronger sn shock deceleration in denser medium . at the moment \n there are only upper limits of tev emission obtained by cangaroo @xcite and hess @xcite instruments ( see fig.[f4 ] ) . \n the kinetic nonlinear model for cr acceleration in snrs has been in detail applied to sn  1987a , in order to compare its results with observational properties.we find that quite a reasonable consistency with most of the observational data can be achieved . \n the evidence of the efficient cr production leading to a strong shock modification comes from radio data . \n significant shock modification leads to the steep and concave cr spectrum which very well fits the observed radioemission spectrum , under the condition of extremely high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg . to be consistent also with the chandra measurements of the x - ray flux , which has to be considered as an upper limit for the nonthermal x - ray emission , even larger interior field \n @xmath0  mg is needed . \n such a high field provides a strong synchrotron losses of cr electrons emitting nonthermal x - rays , that makes the high frequency part of the synchrotron spectrum much more steeper and provides a consistency with the experiment . \n the expected @xmath92-decay @xmath1-ray energy flux at the current epoch is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3  s ) at energies @xmath97  tev . \n therefore the detection of @xmath1-ray emission at these energies would imply clear evidence for a hadronic origin and for a strong magnetic field amplification inside sn  1987a .", "StartTimeOffset": 1045824848272, "RequestID": "339ca2cf096dcf21f54502d986521736d910f15e", "TotalTokens": 3860}

de haas(sdh ) oscillations . \n the zo period allows one to extract the carrier density , whereas the temperature dependence of the zo amplitude is similar to that for sdh oscillations and gives the correct value of the carrier effective mass . \n in contrast to sdh oscillations , zo are skew - symmetric . the amplitude and the phase shift of the zero oscillations depend on a chosen contact pair . \n moreover , for a certain contact pair , the zo shape is strongly affected when other sample leads are connected to(disconnected from ) the measuring circuit[6 ] . \n we emphasize that the effects observed are , in general , universal and are observed in various 2deg systems and for arbitrary sample configuration . \n the basic idea put forward in refs.[3,5 ] in order to explain the nv and zo consists in the possible rectification of the input noise by the 2d-3d schottky diodes formed at the sample contacts . as demonstrated in refs.[3,5 ] , a careful screening of the circuit diminishes the amplitude of the rectified voltage . \n then , shunting of the sample contacts by a capacitance suppresses [ 5 ] the dc potential as well . in order to quantitatively \n examine the influence of the noise , both the voltmeter and the ac generator playing the role of the noise source were attached to same sample contacts(see fig.1 , contacts 1,2 ) . \n the experimental data demonstrate that the amplitude of the rectified voltage is @xmath4 to the ac voltage applied by the generator . \n this finding is rather puzzling as regards the rectification consept proposed in refs.[3,5 ] . in the present paper , we suggest a phenomenological analysis of the experimental findings and then explain the important specific features of the effect . \n setup configuration . \n the noise is simulated by the ac generator . ] \n we further use the simplest model of a current - voltage characteristic of the 3d-2d schottky contact[7,8 ] . in the thermionic diode approximation at finite temperatures , \n the current is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the backward saturation current ; @xmath7 , equilibrium contact potential ; and , @xmath8 , voltage drop across the contact . \n then , @xmath9 is the richardson constant for the thermionic emission , and @xmath10 is the quantum well width . \n we emphasize that the schottky diodes at the left ( fig.1 , index 1 ) and right ( index 2 ) contacts have the opposite polarity and , in general , are different from each other . \n therefore , the relationship between the total voltage drop across the sample , @xmath11 , and the current , @xmath12 , reads : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dimensionless voltage ; @xmath15 , current scaled with respect to reverse saturation current(@xmath16 ) of the left - contact diode ; and , @xmath17 , asymmetry parameter of the contacts . \n then , @xmath18 is the dimensionless resistance of the 2d electron gas , and @xmath19 is the 2deg resistance . \n current - voltage characteristics(panel a ) specified by eq.(2 ) for a contact - asymmetry parameter @xmath20 and a 2deg resistance @xmath21 . \n the dashed line represents the low - field ohmic dependence . \n the low - voltage(bold line ) and high - voltage(thin line ) ac input signals are represented in panel b. the respective responses are shown in panel c. ]    we are primarily interested in the low - current case @xmath22 and , therefore , linearize eq.(2 ) with respect to the current as @xmath23 as expected , the current - voltage characteristic exhibits the ohmic behavior @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the zero - field total resistance of the sample , and @xmath27 are the schottky resistances of contacts 1 and 2 , respectively . in the opposite case of a high applied voltage , \n the current - voltage characteristic is strongly nonlinear . indeed , in this case , the forward and reverse currents are limited ( see fig.2,a ) by the schottky diode saturation currents @xmath28 and @xmath16 , respectively . \n let us first seek the response of the 3d/2deg/3d system to an applied ac voltage @xmath29 . \n the ac voltage is provided by the generator shown in fig.1 . at low voltages \n @xmath30 , eq.(3 ) allows one to extract the current as @xmath31 where @xmath32 . according to eq.(4 ) , the in - phase response of the system to the applied ac voltage consists of the ohmic contribution and an , additional part , because @xmath33 . \n thus , we conclude that the widely used lock - in ac measurement method give [ 3 ] a sample resistance that is somewhat different from zero - field sample resistance @xmath34 .    we now intend to resolve the primary problem formulated in the present paper . \n let us investigate the dc response of the circuit(see fig.1 ) to an applied ac voltage . \n we emphasize that the second - order in voltage term in eq.(4 ) describes the rectification properties of the 2deg sample at @xmath35 . \n equation 4 yields the time - averaged current @xmath36 and , then , the voltage drop measured by dc voltmeter is given by : @xmath37 the polarity of the measured dc voltage is determined by the contact asymmetry . as expected , the transmission characteristic @xmath38 is quadratic law at @xmath39 . in the opposite case of a strong ac excitation @xmath40 , the dc response can be found qualitatively with the help of fig.2,c . \n indeed , the rectified current can be regarded as a rectangular meander sequence with linear fronts . \n the higher the applied ac voltage , the sharper the front of the current pulse . \n after simple averaging , we obtain the dc current and , finally , the rectified voltage as @xmath41 . \n \\label{average - high}\\ ] ] at a high input ac signal @xmath42 , the measured voltage saturates @xmath43 . \n one could expect that , at a moderate ac signal level @xmath44 , the low and high ac input cases merge , and , consequently , there could exist a certain part of the transmission characteristic which could be associated with a linear dependence[3,5 ] .    to confirm our qualitative predictions , we present in fig.3 the result of our numerical calculations . \n we use current - voltage characteristic specified by eq.(2 ) . reversing this equation with respect to current , \n we find numerically the dependence @xmath45 . \n the successive averaging of the current caused by the input ac signal gives the related dc voltage drop across the sample , and , hence the transmission characteristic . \n as expected , the transmission characteristic follows the asymptote given by eq.(5 ) at low excitations . at a high - level ac input @xmath40 , \n the dependence @xmath38 can be approximated with eq.(6 ) , and then levels - off . for intermediate voltages @xmath46 , \n the transmission characteristic exhibits a nearly linear behavior @xmath47 in accordance with the experimental findings[5 ] . \n main panel : the transmission characteristic for contact asymmetry @xmath20 and 2deg resistance @xmath21(upper curve ) . dotted lines a and b represent the low and high - voltage approximations specified by eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) , respectively . \n the dashed line demonstrates a nearly linear dependence reported in [ 5 ] . \n the lower curve corresponds to the case of voltmeter connected to 1 - 3 contacts ( see fig.1 ) when @xmath48 . \n inset : the observed [ 5 ] transmission characteristics correspond to those in the main panel . ] \n it is instructive to note that , in ref.[5 ] , the dc voltmeter was connected to the 1st(basic ) and intermediate probe contacts ( see contact 3 in fig.1 ) as well . in this case \n , the transmission characteristic must be multiplied by the factor @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the asymmetry of the intermediate contact with respect to the 1st one , and @xmath51 is the partial resistance of the 2deg related to the intermediate contact position . we emphasize that the lower the partial resistance @xmath51 , the smaller the differential slope @xmath52 of the transmission characteristic(see the lower curve in fig.3 , main panel ) . \n we now estimate the actual parameters of 3d/2deg/3d system experimentally studied in ref.[5 ] . for n - algaas \n / gaas sample ( 2deg density @xmath53@xmath54 , dielectric constant @xmath55 , effective mass @xmath56 ) we find the fermi energy as @xmath57mev , whereas the bohr energy @xmath58mev . as demonstrated in ref.[9 ] , the thermionic diode approximation is well justified when @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . at @xmath61 , the tunneling current across the schottky diode becomes higher than the thermionic current . \n for the typical equilibrium contact potential @xmath62ev and zero diode bias @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64k , and , hence , the observed data[5 ] can not be analyzed directly in terms of the thermionic mechanism[7 ] . \n nevertheless , even at low temperatures the current - voltage characteristic behaves similar to that described by eq.(1 ) . \n hence , the main assumption that the nonzero voltage results from rectification of the ac noise remains justified . \n we now estimate the resistance of the schottky contact . using the data from [ 5 ] , we find the total low - field resistance of the sample @xmath65 . \n then , in the insert of fig.3 we reproduce the transmission characteristic data[5 ] for the dc output measured across 1 - 2(upper curve ) and 1 - 3(upper curve ) contacts . \n both curves demonstrate a puzzling threshold behavior , which can be , in principle , attributed to the possible voltmeter zero - point shift . \n consequently , the low - voltage part of these curves can be approximated by the following equations @xmath66=-0.0002 + 12u^{2}_{0}[v]$ ] and @xmath67 respectively . \n note that , irrespective of the actual form of @xmath68 dependence , these curves differ by the factor @xmath69 which is equal to the ratio @xmath70 found above by fitting . assuming that the contact asymmetry is small , i.e. , @xmath71 we obtain the schottky contact resistance @xmath72 . \n we argue that the zero - oscillations observed in 2deg in strong magnetic fields originate from the noise rectification as well . \n indeed , at a fixed magnetic field strength , the transmission characteristic observed [ 5 ] for the zo amplitude is analogous to that reported for @xmath73 . \n we remind that the sign of the rectified voltage depends on the asymmetry of the schottky diode contact pair . if the the reverse current @xmath74 of the schottky contact oscillates in the magnetic field , the rectified dc voltage(zo ) will oscillate as well . \n the detailed examination of the zo oscillations will be made elsewhere . \n we demonstrate that the dc voltage observed at low - temperatures in a 2d electron sample @xmath0 external excitation is caused by the noise rectification by schottky diodes formed at the sample contacts . at low noise level the rectified voltage as a function of the noise amplitude follows the usual quadratic law . at higher noise magnitudes , \n the rectified voltage exhibits a nearly linear behavior , and , finally saturates . \n the rectified voltage is shown to depend on the contact pair asymmetry . \n we suggest that the shunting of the sample contacts by a capacitance is a powerful tool for suppressing the rectified voltage . \n veselago , v.n . \n zavaritskii , m.s . \n nunuparov and a.b . \n berkut , pisma zh . \n . fiz . * 44 * , _ 382 _ ( 1986 ) [ jetp lett . * 44 * , 490 ( 1986 ) ] . \n saidashev , i.g . \n savelev , and a.m. kreshchuk , pisma zh . \n teor . fiz . * 45 * , 95 ( 1987 ) [ jetp lett . * 45 * , 120 ( 1987 ) ] . \n kopev , m.yu . \n nadtochii , and v.m . \n ustinov , fiz.tekh . \n * 23 * , 1110 ( 1989 ) . \n . semicond . \n * 23 * , _ 694 _ ( 1989 ) ] . \n kadushkin , fiz.tekh . poluprovodn . * 26 * , 806 ( 1992 ) . \n v.i . kadushkin and s.i . \n fomichev , fiz.tekh . poluprovodn . * 26 * , 811 ( 1992 ) . m.i . \n dyakonov and m.v . \n cheremisin , unpublished . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , fiz.tekh . \n * 23 * 1113 ( 1989 ) [ sov . \n * 23 * , _ 696 _ ( 1989 ) ] . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , zh . \n . fiz . * 96 * 2229 ( 1989 ) [ sov.phys.jetp * 69 * , 1261 ( 1989 ) ] . \n l.v.asryan , s.g . \n petrosyan and a.ya . \n shik , sov . \n . semicond . \n * 24 * , _ 1316 _ ( 1990 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1055387200493, "RequestID": "f1fa3d32dcd4ed7ac371ba09e7885c0b8fb533bc", "TotalTokens": 3290}

dominated equation of state . \n the assumption of spherical symmetry is well justified for large fluctuations in a gaussian distribution @xcite , reducing the problem to one spatial dimension .    for our simulations , we chose the formulation of the hydrodynamical equations by hernandez and misner @xcite as implemented by baumgarte et al . \n @xcite . based on the original equations by misner and sharp @xcite , \n hernandez and misner proposed to exchange the schwarzschild time variable , @xmath10 , with the outgoing null coordinate , @xmath11 . in so doing , \n the hydrodynamical equations retain the lagrangian character of the misner  sharp equations but avoid crossing into the event horizon of a black hole once it has formed . covering the entire space \n time outside while asymptotically approaching the event horizon , the hernandez \n misner equations are perfectly suited to follow the evolution of a black hole for long times after its formation without encountering coordinate singularities . \n this allowed us , in principle , to study the accretion of material onto newly formed pbhs for arbitrarily long times ( in contrast with earlier calculations @xcite ) . since the expanding outer regions of our simulated piece of the universe are most conveniently tracked in a comoving numerical reference frame , the lagrangian form of the hernandez \n misner equations is their second major asset . \n it also provides a simple prescription for the outer boundary condition , which is defined to match the exact solution of the friedmann equations for a radiation dominated flat universe . \n hence , the pressure follows the analytic solution @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the proper time of the outermost fluid element ( corresponding to the cosmological time @xmath10 in a friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) universe ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the initial values for pressure and proper time . \n we studied the spherically symmetric evolution of three families of curvature perturbations . \n initial conditions were chosen to be perturbations of the energy density , @xmath16 , in unperturbed hubble flow specified at horizon crossing . \n the first family of perturbations is described by a gaussian -

electric circuit networks of the rlc resonant oscillators in which voltages play role of quantum wave function . \n specifically we considered the electric networks with the dirichlet boundary conditions which are equivalent to the quarter of the bunimovich quantum billiard . \n in fact , the electric circuit network has three features which can make a difference if to compare with the quantum billiards . \n these are a discreteness of resonance circuits , tolerance of electric elements , and resistance of inductors . \n we showed numerically that the first two features are conceal each other . \n the resistance of the electric network gives rise to a heat which can be described locally by the heat currents . \n assuming that the wave function in the billiard can be given as the complex random gaussian field we derived the distribution of the heat power which well describe numerical statistics .    the third feature of the electric network , resistance has principal importance . \n the resistance of the electric network is originated from inelastic interactions of electrons with phonons and other electrons which give rise to irreversible processes of decoherence . \n with growth of the resistance the wave function is becoming localized . \n we studied as the probability density and the probability currents evolves with increasing of the resistance . \n therefore we can conclude that the resistance violates the equation @xmath88 . \n in fact fig . \n [ streamline ] demonstrates unusual behavior of quantum streamlines @xcite with growth of the resistance . \n one can see that the quantum streamline are terminating at the vortex cores . \n the vortices serve as sinks for the probability density shown in fig . \n [ streamline ] ( top ) as

particle production in ( most central ) heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc agrees with the formation of hot strongly - interacting matter with hydrodynamical properties ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) , which absorbs energetic quarks and gluons due to their multiple scattering and medium - induced energy loss ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . within such paradigm , a number of questions on heavy flavor production arises . \n are heavy quarks thermalized in quark - gluon plasma ? what is the mass dependence of in - medium quark energy loss ? \n are charmed hadrons in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium ? how the specific pattern of quarkonium suppression is related to the interplay between thermal and non - thermal mechanisms of @xmath1-meson production ? in this paper , some results of the phenomenological analysis of lhc data on momentum spectra and elliptic flow of charmed hadrons ( d , @xmath1 ) in pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev within two - component model hydjet++ are presented . the comparison with rhic results is also discussed . \n hydjet++ is the model of relativistic heavy ion collisions , which includes two independent components : the soft hydro - type state ( `` thermal '' component ) and the hard state resulting from the medium - modified multi - parton fragmentation ( `` non - thermal '' component )  @xcite . \n the soft component represents the hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parametrization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted event generator fast mc  @xcite ) . \n hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value , which is supposed to be proportional to a number of participating nucleons for a given impact parameter of an aa collision . to simulate the elliptic flow effect , \n the hydro - inspired parametrization is implemented for the momentum and spatial anisotropy of a thermal hadron emission source . \n the approach used for the hard component is based on the pyquen partonic energy loss model  @xcite . \n the simulation of single hard nn sub - collision by pyquen is constructed as a modification of the jet event obtained with pythia@xmath36.4 generator  @xcite . \n it takes into account medium - induced rescattering , collisional and radiative energy loss of hard partons in the expanding quark - gluon fluid , realistic nuclear geometry and nuclear shadowing effect . \n the mean number of jets produced in an aa event is calculated as a product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions at a given impact parameter per the integral cross section of the hard process with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath4 . \n the partons produced in hard processes with the momentum transfer lower than @xmath4 , are considered as being `` thermalized '' . \n so , their hadronization products are included `` automatically '' in the soft component of the event . \n the input parameters of the model for soft and hard components have been tuned from fitting to heavy ion data on various observables for inclusive hadrons at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite . \n charmed meson production in hydjet++ includes soft and hard components as well . \n thermal production of @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 hadrons is treated within the statistical hadronization approach  @xcite . \n momentum spectra of charm hadrons are computed according to the thermal distribution , and the multiplicities @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are calculated through the corresponding thermal numbers @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the charm enhancement factor ( or charm fugacity ) , and @xmath12 is the number of charm quarks in a hadron @xmath13 . \n the fugacity @xmath11 can be treated as a free parameter of the model , or calculated through the number of charm quark pairs obtained from pythia and multiplied by the number of nn sub - collisions . \n non - thermal charmed hadrons are generated by pyquen taking into account in - medium energy loss of heavy ( b , c ) quarks within `` dead - cone '' generalization  @xcite of bdmps model  @xcite for radiative loss and high - momentum transfer limit  @xcite for collisional loss . \n some time ago it was demonstrated in  @xcite that if @xmath1-mesons are produced in hydjet++ at the same freeze - out parameters as for inclusive ( light ) hadrons , then simulated @xmath0- and @xmath14-spectra in 20% of most central auau collisions at rhic energy @xmath15 gev are much wider than ones measured by phenix  @xcite . \n however the assumption that the thermal freeze - out for @xmath1-mesons happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) allows hydjet++ to reproduce the data . \n it turned out that the similar situation holds at the lhc . \n figure  [ jpsi_temp ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectrum of @xmath1-mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev . \n one can see that if thermal freeze - out for @xmath1 s happens at the same temperature as chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities ) , then simulated spectra match the data up to @xmath16 gev/@xmath17 . \n the discrepancy at high @xmath0 may indicate on the necessity to tune pythia for charmonium production in this kinematic domain . \n the @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 measured by alice  @xcite is also reproduced by hydjet++ simulations in such a case ( figure  [ jpsi_v2 ] ) . \n the contribution of non - thermal component is important at high @xmath0 . \n thus we conclude that @xmath1-meson production in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc may be reproduced by hydjet++ model under the assumption that thermal freeze - out of charmonia happens appreciably before thermal freeze - out of light hadrons  @xcite , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) . \n our interpretation of this is that the significant part of @xmath1-mesons ( up to @xmath16 gev ) is thermalized , but without being in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium . \n elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of @xmath1-mesons at rapidity @xmath20 for 2040% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev . \n the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ] \n elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of @xmath1-mesons at rapidity @xmath20 for 2040% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev . \n the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ] \n elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of d@xmath22-mesons at rapidity @xmath23 for 1030% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev . \n the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ] \n elliptic flow coefficient @xmath19 of d@xmath22-mesons at rapidity @xmath23 for 1030% centrality of pbpb collisions at @xmath21 tev . \n the points are alice data  @xcite , histograms are simulated hydjet++ events ( blue  soft component , red  hard component , black - both components ) . ] \n at first we have checked that @xmath0-spectrum of d - mesons measured by star  @xcite in 10% of most central auau collisions at @xmath15 gev is reproduced by hydjet++ simulation with fugacity @xmath24 and the same freeze - out parameters as for @xmath1-mesons ( but not for inclusive hadrons ) . \n it means that d - mesons like @xmath1-mesons are not in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium at rhic . \n however the situation gets changed dramatically at the lhc . \n figure  [ d_pt ] shows the comparison of hydjet++ simulations with the alice data  @xcite for @xmath0-spectra of d@xmath22 , d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 mesons in 20% of most central pbpb collisions at @xmath2 tev . \n the freeze - out parameters as for inclusive hadrons have been used , the fugacity value @xmath27 being fixed from @xmath1 yield . \n the model results are close to the data within the experimental uncertainties . \n note that @xmath0-spectra and nuclear modification factors @xmath28 ( the ratio of particle yields in aa and pp collisions normalized on the mean number of nn sub - collisions ) of d - mesons are reproduced by hydjet++ up to very high @xmath0 . \n so the treatment of heavy quark energy loss in hard component of the model ( pyquen ) seems quite successful . \n in addition , hydjet++ is able to reproduce the alice data  @xcite on @xmath0-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath18 ( figure  [ d_v2 ] ) . \n thus in contrast to rhic , thermal freeze - out of d - mesons at the lhc happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons . \n therefore the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev/@xmath17 ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium . \n momentum spectra and elliptic flow of d and @xmath1 mesons in pbpb collisions at the lhc are reproduced by two - component model hydjet++ including thermal ( soft ) and non - thermal ( hard ) components . \n thermal freeze - out of d - mesons happens simultaneously with thermal freeze - out of light hadrons . \n thermal freeze - out of @xmath1-mesons happens appreciably before freeze - out of light hadrons , presumably at chemical freeze - out ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) . \n thus the significant part of d - mesons ( up to @xmath29 gev / c ) seems to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the medium , while @xmath1 mesons are not . \n the production of charmed mesons at high transverse momenta is determined by non - thermal charm production mechanism and medium - induced heavy quark energy loss . \n discussions with l.v . \n bravina , v.l . \n korotkikh , l.v . \n malinina , a.m. snigirev , e.e . \n zabrodin and s.v . \n petrushanko are gratefully acknowledged . \n we thank our colleagues from alice and cms collaborations for fruitful cooperation . \n this work was supported by the russian scientific fund under grant no . \n 14 -

{"ContextTokens": 3389, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of wealth and income distributions has a long history . \n pareto @xcite proposed in 1897 that wealth and income distributions obey universal power laws . \n subsequent studies have often disputed this conjecture ( see a systematic survey in the world bank research publication @xcite ) . \n mandelbrot @xcite proposed that the pareto law applies only asymptotically to the high ends of the distributions . \n many researchers tried to deduce the pareto law from a theory of stochastic processes . \n gibrat @xcite proposed in 1931 that income and wealth are governed by multiplicative random processes , which result in a log - normal distribution . \n these ideas were later followed , among many others , by montroll and shlesinger @xcite . however , already in 1945 kalecki @xcite pointed out that the log - normal distribution is not stationary , because its width increases in time . \n modern econophysicists @xcite also use various versions of multiplicative random processes in theoretical modeling of wealth and income distributions .    unfortunately , numerous recent papers on this subject do very little or no comparison at all with real statistical data , much of which is widely available these days on the internet . in order to fill this gap , we analyzed the data on income distribution in the united states ( us ) from the bureau of census and the internal revenue service ( irs ) in ref . \n we found that the individual income of about 95% of population is described by the exponential law . \n the exponential law , also known in physics as the boltzmann - gibbs distribution , is characteristic for a conserved variable , such as energy . in ref . \n @xcite , we argued that , because money ( cash ) is conserved , the probability distribution of money should be exponential . \n wealth can increase or decrease by itself , but money can only be transferred from one agent to another . \n so , wealth is not conserved , whereas money is . \n the difference is the same as the difference between unrealized and realized capital gains in stock market . \n unfortunately , we were not able to find data on the distribution of money . \n on the other hand , we found data on wealth distribution in the united kingdom ( uk ) , which are presented in this paper . also presented \n are the income distribution data for the uk and for the individual states of the usa . in all of these data , \n we find that the great majority of population is described by an exponential distribution , whereas the high - end tail follows a power law . \n in this section , we discuss the cumulative probability distribution of wealth @xmath0=(the number of people whose individual wealth is greater than @xmath1)/(the total number of people ) . \n a plot of @xmath2 vs.  @xmath1 is equivalent to a plot of person s rank in wealth vs. wealth , which is often used for top reach people @xcite . \n we will use the power law , @xmath3 , and the exponential law @xmath4 , to fit the data . \n these distributions are characterized by the exponent @xmath5 and the `` temperature '' @xmath6 . \n the corresponding probability densities , @xmath7 , also follow a power law or an exponential law . \n for the exponential law , it is also useful to define the temperatures @xmath8 ( also known as the median ) and @xmath9 using the bases of 1/2 and 1/10 : @xmath10 . \n the distribution of wealth is not easy to measure , because people do not report their total wealth routinely . \n however , when a person dies , all assets must be reported for the purpose of inheritance tax . using these data and an adjustment procedure , the british tax agency , the inland revenue ( ir ) , reconstructed wealth distribution of the whole uk population . in fig . \n [ fig : ukwealth ] , we present the 1996 data obtained from their web site @xcite . the left panel shows the cumulative probability as a function of the personal total net capital ( wealth ) , which is composed of assets ( cash , stocks , property , household goods , etc . ) and liabilities ( mortgages and other debts ) . \n the main panel illustrates in the log - log scale that above 100  k@xmath11 the data follow a power law with the exponent @xmath12 . \n the inset shows in the log - linear scale that below 100  k@xmath11 the data is very well fitted by an exponential distribution with the temperature @xmath13  k@xmath11 ( @xmath14  k@xmath11 and @xmath15  k@xmath11 ) . \n the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : ukwealth ] shows the so - called lorenz curve @xcite for wealth distribution . \n the horizontal and vertical coordinates are the cumulative population @xmath16 and the cumulative wealth @xmath17 : @xmath18 the points represent the actual data , whereas the solid line is calculated for a purely exponential distribution @xcite : @xmath19 one can see that the data systematically deviate from the exponential law because of the wealth concentrated in the power - law tail ; however , the deviation is not very big . \n the so - called gini coefficient @xcite , which measures the inequality of wealth distribution , has increased from 64% in 1984 to 68% in 1996 @xcite . \n this value is bigger than the gini coefficient 50% for a purely exponential distribution @xcite . \n the inequality of the us income distribution was also increasing during that time period @xcite . \n we obtained the data on the yearly income distribution in the uk for 1997/8 and 1998/9 from the web site of the ir @xcite . the data for 1994/5 , 1995/6 , and \n 1996/7 were taken from the annual abstract of statistics derived from the ir @xcite . \n the data for these 5 years are presented graphically in fig . \n [ fig : ukincome ] . in the upper inset of the left panel , \n the original raw data for the cumulative distribution are plotted in log - linear scale . for not too high incomes , \n the points form straight lines , which implies the exponential distribution @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for income ( revenue ) , and @xmath22 is the income `` temperature '' . however , the slopes of these lines are different for different years . \n the temperatures for the years 1994/5 , 1995/6 , 1996/7 , and 1997/8 differ from the temperature for 1998/9 , @xmath23  k@xmath11 ( @xmath24  k@xmath11 and @xmath25  k@xmath11 ) , by the factors 0.903 , 0.935 , 0.954 , and 0.943 . to compensate for this effect , \n we rescale the data . \n we divide the horizontal coordinates ( incomes ) of the data sets for different years by the quoted above factors and plot the results in log - log scale in the main panel and log - linear scale in the lower inset . \n we observe scaling : the collapse of points on a single curve . \n thus , the distributions @xmath26 for different years @xmath27 are described by a single function @xmath28 . \n the main panel shows that this scaling function @xmath29 follows a power law with the exponent @xmath30 - 2.3 at high incomes . \n the lower inset shows that @xmath29 has an exponential form for about 95% of individuals with lower incomes . \n these results qualitatively agree with a similar study by cranshaw @xcite . \n he proposed that the @xmath31 data for lower incomes are better fitted by the gamma distribution @xmath32 . for simplicity , we chose not to introduce the additional fitting parameter @xmath33 \n .    we must mention that the individuals with income below a certain threshold are not required to report to the ir . \n that is why the data in the lower inset do not extend to zero income . \n we extrapolate the straight line to zero income and take the intercept with the vertical axis as 100% of individuals . \n thus , we imply that the ir data does not account for about 25 - 27% of individuals with income below the threshold . \n the lorenz curve for the distribution of the uk income is shown in the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : ukincome ] . \n we treat the number of individuals below the income threshold and their total income as adjustable parameters , which are the horizontal and vertical offsets of the coordinates origin relative to the lowest known data point . \n these parameters are chosen to fit the lorenz curve for the exponential law ( [ eq : yx ] ) shown as the solid line . \n the fit is very good . \n the horizontal offsets are 28 - 34% , which is roughly consistent with the numbers quoted for the lower inset of the left panel . \n we obtained the data on distribution of the yearly individual income in 1998 for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia that constitute the usa from the web site of the irs @xcite . \n we plot the original raw data for the cumulative distribution of income in log - linear scale in the upper inset of the left panel of fig.[fig : usincome ] . \n the points spread significantly , particularly at higher incomes . for example , the fraction of individuals with income greater than 1  m$ varies by an order of magnitude between different states . however , after we rescale the data in the manner described in the preceding section , the points collapse on a single curve shown in log - log scale in the main panel and log - linear scale in the lower inset . \n the open circles represent the us average , obtained by treating the combined data for all states as a single set . \n we observe that the distribution of higher incomes approximately follows a power law with the exponent @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 variation includes 70% of all states . on the other hand , for about 95% of individuals with lower incomes , the distribution follows an exponential law with the average us temperature @xmath36  k$ ( @xmath37  k$ and @xmath38  k$ ) . \n the temperatures of the individual states differ from @xmath39 by the amounts shown in table [ table ] . \n for example , the temperature of connecticut ( ct ) is 1.25 times higher and the temperature of west virginia ( wv ) is 0.78 times lower than the average us temperature . \n @*17c@ ct & nj & ma & md & va & ca & ny & il & co & nh &    ak & dc & de & mi & wa & mn & ga + [ -0.5ex ]    25% & 24% & 14% & 14% & 9% & 9% & 7% & 6% & 6% & 5% &    5% & 5% & 4% & 4% & 2% & 1% & 0% + tx & ri & az & pa & fl & ks & or & hi & nv & nc &    wi & in & ut & mo & vt & tn & ne + -1% & -3% & -3% & -3% & -4% & -5% & -6% & -7% & -7% & -7% &    -8% & -8% & -9% & -9% & -9% & -11% & -12% + oh & la & al & sc & ia & wy & nm & ky & i d &    ok & me & mt & ar & sd & nd & ms & wv + -12% & -13% & -13% & -13% & -14% & -14% & -14% & -14% & -15% &    -16% & -16% & -19% & -19% & -20% & -20% & -21% & -22% +    [ table ]    the lorenz plot for all states is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : usincome ] together with the solid curve representing eq.([eq : yx ] ) . the majority of points are well clustered and are not too far from the solid curve . \n the exceptions are wyoming ( wy ) with much higher inequality and the washington state ( wa ) with noticeably lower inequality of income distribution . \n the average us data , shown by open circles , is consistent with our previous results @xcite . unlike in the uk case \n , we did not make any adjustment in the us case for individuals with income below the threshold , which appears to be sufficiently low . \n we found scaling in the cumulative probability distributions @xmath40 of individual income @xmath21 derived from the tax statistics for different years in the uk and for different states in the us . \n the distributions @xmath26 have the scaling form @xmath28 , where the scale @xmath41 ( the temperature ) varies from one data set @xmath27 to another , but the scaling function @xmath29 does not . \n the function @xmath29 has an exponential ( boltzmann - gibbs ) form at the low end , which covers about 95% of individuals . at the high end \n , it follows a power ( pareto ) law with the exponents about 2.1 for the uk and 1.7 for the us . \n wealth distribution in the uk also has a qualitatively similar shape with the exponent about 1.9 and the temperature @xmath42  k@xmath11 . \n some of the other values of the exponents found in literature are 1.5 proposed by pareto himself ( @xmath43 ) , 1.36 found by levy and solomon @xcite for the distribution of wealth in the forbes 400 list , and 2.05 found by souma @xcite for the high end of income distribution in japan . \n the latter study is similar to our work in the sense that it also uses tax statistics and explores the whole range of incomes , not just the high end . \n souma @xcite finds that the probability density @xmath31 at lower incomes follows a log - normal law with a maximum at a nonzero income . \n this is in contrast to our results , which suggest that the maximum of @xmath31 is at zero income . \n the disrepancy may be due to the high threshold for tax reporting in japan , which distorts the data at the low end . \n on the other hand , if the data is indeed valid , it may reflect the actual difference between the social stuctures of the us / uk and japan . \n the income temperature for the uk in 1998/9 was @xmath44  k@xmath11 and for the us in 1998 was @xmath36  k$. using the exchange rate as of december 31 , 1998 to convert pounds into dollars @xcite , we find that the uk temperature was @xmath45  k$ , which is 1.87 times lower than the us temperature . \n the difference in temperatures indicates nonequilibrium , which can be exploited to create a thermal machine @xcite . \n the gain ( profit ) produced by such a thermal machine is proportional to the difference in temperatures . in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics \n , money would flow from a high - temperature system to a low - temperature one . \n this may explain the huge trade deficit of the usa in global international trade with other , lower - temperature countries . \n the variation of temperatures between different states of the usa is shown in table [ table ] . \n we are grateful to ted cranshaw , who kindly sent us his unpublished study of income distribution in the uk @xcite and data @xcite , and bertrand roehner , who suggested to study income distributions in the states of the usa and sent us link @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1096019694727, "RequestID": "427b5fcf71486ccd945338ffe0bfae719b07276b", "TotalTokens": 3526}

energy particles . \n tes arrays have been used as radiation detectors in a large variety of wave lengths , from 3 - 5 mm ( as in the cmb experiments @xcite ) up to gamma ray @xcite . \n the x - ifu detector , under development at sron / vtt and gsfc / nist , consists of an array of 3840 tes - based microcalorimeters read out by superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) using 96 channels of 40 pixels each multiplexed in frequency domain in the mhz bandwidth . \n the anti - coincidence detector is part of the x - ifu focal plane assembly and it is currently under development at inaf / iaps - roma and infn - genova @xcite . \n tes based devices are thermal equilibrium detectors where the incoming energy is absorbed and converted into equilibrium excitations @xcite . \n they generally consist of a very sensitive thermometer coupled to an efficient radiation absorber . \n the thermometer is made of a superconducting film operated in the sharp transition between the normal and the superconducting state where the film resistance varies between zero and its normal value , typically of the order of tenths to hundredths of @xmath2 . \n a tes is generally made of thin film superconducting bi - layer like tiau , moau or mocu deposited on a sin thin membrane . \n the critical temperature @xmath3 can be accurately chosen by exploiting the proximity effect between the superconducting ( ti , mo ) and normal ( au , cu ) materials . \n the tes variable resistance is part of a superconducting bias circuit . \n the increase of the detector temperature caused by the absorbed radiation leads to an increase of the tes resistance which is measured as a reduction of the bias current . \n voltage biasing of a tes leads to so - called electro - thermal feedback ( etf ) @xcite which counteracts excursions from the set point . \n etf increases the thermal response speed and linearises the output signal . \n biasing can be realised using a dc - voltage source or using an ac - source ( as in the case of fdm)@xcite . \n typical operation temperatures are around 100 mk . tes based detectors can be operated as bolometers to measure power or as calorimeters to detect energy of single photons . \n extremely high sensitivity has been demonstrated with single pixels : for example , a dark noise equivalent power of @xmath4 with tiau tes bolometers fabricated at sron @xcite and an energy resolution of @xmath5 at @xmath6 with moau tes micro - calorimeters fabricated at nasa - gsfc @xcite . \n when operating as a microcalorimeter for soft x - ray spectroscopy , like in the x - ifu instrument , the tess are strongly thermally coupled to a free hanging absorber designed to optimize the quantum efficiency and the filling factor in a pixels array . \n the tes - absorber system is weakly coupled to the thermal bath via thermal conductance @xmath7 . a schematic diagram of a tes microcalorimeter pixel and an optical micro - graph of a @xmath8 pixels array under development at sron are shown in figure [ fig : array ] . \n tes array fabricated at sron ]    the energy @xmath9 deposited by a photon in the absorber with heat capacity @xmath10 increases the detector temperature of @xmath11 . \n the temperature excursion will then decay exponentially back to equilibrium with a time constant @xmath12 . \n the sensitivity of a tes microcalorimeter is limited by the thermodynamic energy fluctuations present in the system . \n in the small signal limit and in the case of strong etf , considering just the thermal - fluctuation and the tes johnson noise , the fwhm energy resolution can be approximated as @xmath13 , where the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the dependency of the tes resistance on temperature @xmath16 and current @xmath17 @xcite . \n it becomes clear then that to achieve high energy resolution one should operate the detector at low temperature , using low heat capacitance absorber material and a tes with a steep resistive transition ( high @xmath18 ) and a low current dependence ( small @xmath19 ) . \n one should be aware however that a small heat capacitance and a steep transition can be achieved at the cost of a reduced detector dynamic range . \n an optimisation of the parameters exists as described in @xcite . \n typical parameters for tes microcalorimeter are : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in spite of the fact that tes detectors have been developed for more than two decades now and are operational in many instruments , the fundamental physics that describe these devices has only been recently better understood . \n it has been observed that tes devices behave as superconducting weak - links due to the longitudinally induced superconductivity from the superconducting nb leads via the proximity effect @xcite . \n the dependence on the perpendicular magnetic field coupled into the tes has also been thoroughly investigated only in the few past years @xcite . by applying the standard resistively shunted model developed for josephson junctions and superconducting weak links @xcite , it is possible to calculate the resistive transition r(t , i ) of a tes @xcite . in figure \n [ fig : rti ] the model of the resistive transition for a tiau tes bolometer developed at sron @xcite is shown .     of a tes bolometer fabricated at sron calculated using the resistevely shunted junction model . \n ]    the josephson current has been directly observed in tes - bolometers operating in a frequency domain multiplexer and biased by ac voltage at mhz frequencies @xcite . the recent development in understanding the physics of the tes s \n is considered as an important step forward in the optimisation of the performance of a single pixel and a large array of pixels . \n the pixels array for x - ifu , based on moau tes s and au - bismuth absorbers is currently under development at nasa - goddard @xcite . \n sron is developing the back - up array using tiau film technology . \n the limited cooling power available on a space - based instrument and the harness complexity makes the readout of each individual pixel of the array by its own squid amplifier impossible and squid multiplexer schemes such as time domain multiplexing ( tdm ) @xcite and fdm are being developed . \n tdm is the most mature technology at the moment @xcite , however fdm has potentially several important advantages over tdm such as a better use of the available bandwidth resulting in a larger multiplexing factor , a smaller thermal load on the cooling chain and an easier implementation of the cold electronics on the focal plane assembly . \n sron - vtt is developing the frequency domain multiplexing and the squid read - out for the x - ifu microcalorimeters array . \n fdm requires amplitude modulation of the tes signal , which can be achieved by biasing the microcalorimeter with an ac voltage source . \n changes of the tes resistance modulate the amplitude of the ac bias current , following the thermal signal . in practice the tes signal is moved up to a frequency band around the carrier signal which is typically in the range between 1 and 5mhz . \n each pixel is separated in the frequency space by high-@xmath24 superconducting lc filters @xcite connected in series with the tes resistance . \n the current through each tes is coupled to the squid amplifier input coil through a superconducting summing point . \n the multiplexing factor depends on the available read - out bandwidth and the detector signal speed . for slow detectors like the low - g bolometers under development at sron for the future infrared space mission @xcite a multiplexing factor of 160 pixels per squid channel \n has been shown @xcite . \n for the faster x - ray microcalorimeters the current baseline x - ifu design calls for a multiplexing factor of 40 pixels per squid channel which implies a separation of 100 khz between each pixel in a read - out bandwidth between 1 to 5 mhz@xcite .    to improve the limited squid dynamic range baseband feedback ( bbfb ) @xcite is used to cancel the signal at the sum - point . \n the signal at the output of the room temperature low noise amplifier ( lna ) is demodulated by digital electronics to extract the signal information from the tes , re - modulated and fed back to the squid feedback coil . \n the x - ifu instruments read - out requires squid amplifiers with low input inductance , low flux noise , high - dynamic range and low power consumption . we have recently demonstrated nearly quantum - limited sensitivity with the two - stage squids amplifiers developed at vtt and optimised for the read - out of large array of infrared bolometers and x - ray microcalorimeters . \n we measured an open - input flux noise at @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 and an input current noise of @xmath27 , which corresponds to a coupled energy resolution of @xmath28 over the whole interesting frequency range from 2 to 5 mhz @xcite . \n an fdm prototype with 13 active resonators coupled to a nasa - goddard tes 8x8 array is shown in figure [ fig : fdmprototype ]        an extended study of the single pixel performance under mhz bias of the nasa - goddard tes microcalorimeters@xcite is on going at sron @xcite . \n we have shown an x - ray energy resolution of @xmath29 and @xmath30 at @xmath31 with single pixels read out respectively at a frequency of 2.3 and @xmath32 @xcite . \n we are currently optimising a prototype for the first fdm demonstration of gsfc array up to 18 pixels . the first demonstration model for the x - ifu instrument with 40 pixels multiplexing and 4 squid channels read - out is scheduled for the coming year . \n another challenging development for the x - ifu instrument is the design and fabrication of the focal plane assembly ( fpa ) which hosts at a temperature of @xmath33 a large - format array of tes s , a large array of lithographic lc filters , a large amount of squid amplifiers and the tes based anti - coincidence detector . \n the fpa is suspended from a temperature level of @xmath34 to @xmath35 , with an additional thermal interface at an intermediate temperature of @xmath36 . \n key - technologies are under development such as magnetic shielding , high density superconducting interconnects and thermal insulating suspension . \n a cross - section of the fpa is shown in figure [ fig : fpa ] together with a picture of the mechanical assembly of the nb shield . \n a detailed description of the fpa development can be found in @xcite . \n the magnetic shielding design is driven by the following two requirements : the absolute static normal magnetic field component over the tes array is less than @xmath37 and the maximum normal magnetic field noise over the tes array is less than @xmath38 . \n this implies having a magnetic shielding factor as a large as @xmath39 over the whole array size . \n an on - axis shielding factor exceeding @xmath40 has been measured in a demonstrator with a combination of cryoperm and nb shields . @xcite . \n we are currently developing a novel superconductive technology for the interconnection between the tes array and the cold electronics using transformed based coil coupling , an unique feature of the frequency domain read - out . \n if proven successful this technique will allow high - density connections and easy replacement of the pixels array during the development and engineering phase of this very complicated space instrument . \n in the current design each pixel is fanned - out to a superconducting coil at the edge of the tes wafer . \n the mating interconnect pieces contain the secondary coils which form a transformer once assembled . \n they are fabricated by spinning and patterning of polyimide on a si wafer after that nb tracks are deposited using standard lithographic processing . in a final drie step the interconnect \n are etched from the rest of the si wafer leaving a flexible free standing membrane @xcite . \n the mechanical support of the detector stage and the 300 mk level has to fulfil stringent requirements on position stability of the detector array over multiple cool downs , compactness in terms of space , modularity in assembly and sufficient thermal isolation between the stages . \n a kinematic suspension design using kevlar cords have been chosen and is currently under development and test @xcite . \n _ athena _ has been selected by esa as its second large - class mission . \n the future european x - ray observatory will study the hot and energetic universe with its launch foreseen in 2028 . \n microcalorimeters based on superconducting transition - edge sensor ( tes ) are the chosen technology for the detectors array of the x - ifu instrument on board of athena sron / vtt , gsfc / nist and inaf(italy ) are developing the first demonstration model for the x - ifu instrument with 40 pixels multiplexing and 4 squid channels read - out and the anti - coincidence detector . \n the extended activities include the fabrication and the testing of the large array of high energy resolution x - ray tes microcalorimeter , the cold electronics for the frequency domain multiplexing , the tes based anti - coincidence detector and the key - technologies for the focal plane assembly . \n h.a . was supported by a grant - in - aid for japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) fellows ( 22 - 606 )      d.  bennett , et -

{"ContextTokens": 3906, "GeneratedTokens": 101, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last years , tremendous progress has been achieved to firmly establish the nature of neutrino oscillations using neutrinos from the sun @xcite as well as neutrinos produced in the earth s atmosphere @xcite . however , with oscillation parameters accessible to accelerator based experiments , the situation remains unsettled . \n there is one evidence for oscillations in the appearance mode  from the lsnd experiment which is ruled out in part by other experiments such as karmen , nomad and nutev .    in this paper \n , we summarize the status of the search for appearance of  ( ) from  ( ) sources indicating the flavor oscillation  ( ) . restricting the discussion to this oscillation channel , we can simplify the 3-dimensional neutrino mass and mixing scheme to a 2-dimensional one which leads to an oscillation probability @xmath0 for the appearance of  in a pure  beam of @xmath1 as can be seen from equ . \n [ equ : p -

energy high intensity neutrino sources ( lansce , isis ) are based on accelerators with a proton kinetic energy of 800mev and a beam stop or neutrino production target of high - z material . due to the massive target ( e.g. copper , tantalum or uranium ) , the resulting neutrino fluxes arise from  and  decays at rest ( dar ) and hence are well understood . @xmath5 and @xmath6 that stop are readily captured in the high - z material of the beam stop . \n the production of kaons or heavier mesons is negligible at these proton energies . \n the flux is calculated to be only @xmath7 as large as the  flux , so that the observation of a  event rate significantly above the calculated background would be evidence for  oscillations .    _ , \n width=453 ]    figure  [ fig : karmenflux](a ) shows the  spectrum from  dar ( solid line ) together with the  contribution . \n the absolute flux corresponds to the neutrino production of the isis accelerator with 200@xmath8a proton current and a ta \n d@xmath9o target . \n if the time structure of the proton pulses is significantly smaller than the muon lifetime of 2.2 , the neutrinos show the corresponding exponential decrease ( as in fig . \n [ fig : karmenflux](b ) , an important feature to suppress cosmic induced background ) . otherwise , as for lansce with its 600  long proton pulses , \n neutrinos are almost constantly produced during beam -

integer dimensions between 2 and 3 . \n the condensate and superfluid fraction are obtained as functions of temperature and dimensions at various values of the coupling strength . \n we have shown that the generic splitting behavior of the superfluid density universal for superconducting films may originate from the geometric nature of the films and detailed nature of the superconducting mechanism plays a much less prominent role than generally believed . \n cherny a y and shanenko a a 1998 _ phys . lett . \n a _ * 250 * 170 moroni s , conti s and tosi m p 1996 _ phys . \n b _ * 53 * 9688 alexandrov a s , beere w h and kabanov v v 1996 _ phys \n b _ * 54 * 15363 strepparola e , minguzzi a and tosi m p 2001 _ phys . rev . b _ * 63 * 104509 fisher d s and hohenberg p c 1988 _ phys \n b _ * 37 * 4936 kim s -

and @xcite , which consider them as indications of bipolar jets . \n we suppose that all components indicating high velocities appear in bipolar outflow from the outbursting hot object . \n the 2006 outburst of z  and is a first one , when optical bipolar outflow from this system was observed . \n our note is devoted to this phenomenon , where preliminary results of one study of the h@xmath0 line are treated . \n the region of the line h@xmath0 was observed on eight nights in july , august and september 2006 with the photometrics ccd camera mounted on the coude spectrograph of the 2 m rcc telescope of the national astronomical observatory rozhen . during the last of these nights besides the region of the line h@xmath0 , that of h@xmath12 was also observed . \n the spectral resolution was 0.2 px@xmath1 on all occasions . \n some of the exposures were comparatively long to obtain better ratio signal to noise of the continuum although the central emission component of the h@xmath0 line was saturated in some cases ( table 1 ) . \n ever when we made more than one exposure per night , the spectra were added with the aim to improve the signal to noise ratio . \n the iraf package was used for data reduction . \n the additional emission components were fitted with a gaussian to measure their radial velocity and equivalent width . \n it was made only for those spectra where they are intensive enough ( table 2 ) . \n the inner uncertainty of the equivalent width in these cases is not more than 50 per cent . \n the h@xmath0 flux was obtained using the equivalent width and the @xmath13 flux supposing that it is practically equal to the continuum flux at the position of this line . for this aim \n we used the @xmath13 magnitudes of @xcite and @xcite taken very close to the time of our observations . \n the uncertainty of the continuum flux is not more than 10 per cent and that of the line flux  not more than 50 per cent . \n the fluxes were corrected for an interstellar extinction of @xmath14 according to the approach of @xcite . \n it was used the ephemeris @xmath15 , where the orbital period is based on both photometric and spectral data @xcite . \n .journal of observations . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]     this value is too great compared with the observed mass - loss rate of the hot compact component of the symbiotic systems during their active phases , which is most frequently about 10@xmath16 10@xmath17 m@xmath5yr@xmath1 @xcite . \n the great value follows from our assumption for spherical symmetry of the outflowing material and the observed high velocity \n . it can be in reasonable limits if the material does not flow in all directions , but only in some of them , related to areas with small angular sizes . \n the material can flow mainly in the polar areas , if it is prevented in equatorial one for example by an accretion disk . in this case \n the velocity in the polar areas increases to provide the mass ejection there . \n this supposition can be related to the existence of two kinds of absorption components indicating very different expansion velocities . \n we can assume that the dip feature of h@xmath0 is due to mass flow in the orbital plane with a moderate velocity . \n the flowing material , however , is prevented by the accretion disk and the direction of its motion changes . in this way it is ejected in a direction , perpendicular to the plane of the disk , like the gas flowing in that direction . \n all of the material gives rise to the high velocity components of the h@xmath0 line . \n thus the blue shifted absorption indicates motion probably in the front part of the wind which is projected on the stellar disk . \n then we can suppose that the weak emission feature with a velocity of 1500 kms@xmath1 appears in the nonocculted part of the back component of the wind .    as it is seen from the evolution of the spectrum in figs . \n [ ha_log ] and [ abs - em ] the blue - shifted absorption component disappears and an emission rises . \n thus two emission components on the two sides of the central peak form in july . the disappearance of the blue - shifted absorption and the rise of an emission is most probably due to decrease of the flow rate and/or increase of the number of the emitting atoms in that part of the wind which does not project on the stellar disk . \n if the absorption is related to the inner part of the wind and the emission  to its outer one , not projecting on the stellar disk , the evolution of the spectrum shows that the velocity in the front wind component ( stream ) decreases with the distance to the star . \n it is seen in fig . \n [ ha_log ] that the emission on the long - wavelengths side of the central peak increases compared to the continuum . \n it is seen also in the figure that the velocity of the line decreases from about 1500 kms@xmath1 to about 1200 kms@xmath1 . \n taking into account the fact that the distance covered by the emitting gas increases with time it can be concluded that the velocity in the back stream decreases with the distance to the star too . \n the h@xmath12 line had similar emission components , as it is seen on the unique frame taken in its region in september .    to know the energy emitted in the h@xmath0 high velocity components as well as the quantity of the emitting gas we calculated their line flux and emission measure . \n the emission measure was obtained supposing that the gas medium is optically thin and has a constant density . \n it is not possible to obtain the electron temperature and the electron density in the region where the outflow components are emitted from observation since we have no indication about the appearance in this region of certain lines giving information for these parameters . \n we suppose that the electron temperature is 20000 k and the mean electron density is about 10@xmath18 @xmath3 in the nebular portion of the streams . \n then we

the system of 1.5 kpc according to @xcite . \n for the calculation of the emission measure we need to know the state of ionization of helium in the emitting region . \n the line 4686 was very weak (

basis of the greatest emission measure observed on august 12 . \n it turned out to be about 8@xmath4 m@xmath5 for the front stream and 6@xmath4 m@xmath5 for the back one . \n we present results of high resolution spectral observations carried out in the region of the line h@xmath0 of the spectrum of the symbiotic binary z and close to the light maximum of its 2006 optical brightening . \n the

{"ContextTokens": 2450, "GeneratedTokens": 191, "SynthesizedBody": "the 511 kev emission from the galactic bulge @xcite observed by integral / spi @xcite could be the signature of light ( 1 - 100 mev ) dark matter particles @xcite . \n such particles could annihilate throughout the galactic bulge into positrons ( and electrons ) which , after losing energy , annihilate into 511 kev gamma - rays @xcite . \n note that the spi observation implies an injection rate of about @xmath0 positrons per second within the galactic bulge . \n it seems difficult to account for such an injection rate and to reproduce the morphology observed by integral / spi by standard astrophysical scenarios such as type ia supernovae @xcite . \n however astrophysical scenarios can not be ruled out and more evidence is needed to further motivate the light dark matter annihilation hypothesis . in this context , @xcite have proposed to test the light dark matter hypothesis on the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sdg ) , a closeby galaxy dominated by dark matter . \n a large dark matter annihilation rate is predicted from this galaxy and as it contains comparatively few stars , the detection of a substantial 511 kev emission line from sdg would provide a strong evidence for the light dark matter hypothesis . \n indeed sgr is a good place to search for the effect of pure dark matter since star formation has virtually stopped due to the lack of gas and thus supernovae and hypernovae should be essentially absent . assuming that :    * all the 511 kev photons observed in the bulge of our galaxy are the signature of dark matter annihilation * the spatial distribution of the sdg diffuse halo gas is less than 2 degrees * the shape of the dark matter halo profile for the sdg is similar to that of draco , another dwarf galaxy * the hydrogen density in the sdg halo is of the order of   @xmath1 * the annihilation occurs directly on dust grains    @xcite found a predicted flux at 511 kev from sdg : ( 1 - 7)@xmath2 . \n this work presents attempts to search for light dark matter annihilation in the sdg with spi / integral . \n the sdg is one of the most recently discovered members of the local group , and is currently in a very close encounter to our galaxy . \n its distance is approximately 25 kpc . \n it is apparently in the process of being disrupted by tidal gravitational forces induced by its big massive neighbor in this encounter . \n figure  [ fig : expomap ] shows the position and the spatial distribution of the sdg . \n the size is apparently big : 3@xmath38@xmath4 in the sky . \n the core of the galaxy is located at @xmath5=5.6@xmath4 and @xmath6= -14.0@xmath4 . \n @xcite found that sdg orbits the milky way galaxy in less than one billion years . because it must have passed the dense central region of our galaxy at least about ten times , \n it is surprising that the dwarf has not been completely disrupted so far . \n they suspect that this fact is an indication of significant amounts of dark matter within this small galaxy , which ties the stars more strongly to the galaxy by its gravity . \n the data analyzed in this work were accumulated during the two galactic centre deep exposures , executed as part of integral s guaranteed time observation . during these two programs , \n the sdg was in the instrument field of view at the occasion of several successive pointings . \n note that none of these pointings aimed exactly at the direction of the sdg . \n however , taking into account the wide spi fully coded field of view ( 16 degrees ) , we selected 121 of them with an average exposure of 1400 seconds per pointing \n . figure  [ fig : expomap ] shows the integral / spi exposure map in the region of the sdg for the two gcdes . \n we note that the total effective observation time at the position of the sdg core is approximately 80  ks . \n [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table ]    we assume that the spatial distribution of the source is less than 2 degrees . thus , the source can be then considered as a point like source for spi . \n the standard deconvolution method spiros is used for the extraction of spectral information . \n the spiros method is described in @xcite . \n first , we run spiros in the imaging mode . \n this first step did not succeed to reveal any source . \n then we built an input catalogue with only one source at the position of the sdg , and we run spiros in the spectral mode using the catalogue as an input . the combination of source intensity and background parameters , which best matches the data is found in each energy bin .    in order to cross \n check the spiros results , we analyzed again the data using the model fitting method developed for the mapping of the galactic center . \n the data preparation and analysis are described in @xcite and @xcite . in this study , \n the spatial model used includes two components : a gaussian bulge component with a 10@xmath4 fwhm , centered at @xmath5=0 and @xmath6=0 , and a point source component located in @xmath5=6@xmath4 and @xmath6=-14@xmath4 . \n the intensities of the components are fitted to maximize the likelihood provided by the spatial model and the background model to the observed distribution of counts for each 0.5 kev energy bin , each detector and each pointing . \n along with the model intensities , 19 background model - scaling factors have been adjusted for the line component by the fit . \n the flux in the line is then derived by fitting a 3.7 kev fwhm gaussian to the spectrum resulting from the model fitting .    in both approaches \n , we do not detect the source . \n the results are presented in table [ tab : table ] . \n the upper limits are computed at a 2@xmath7 confidence level , for a line width of  3.7 kev ( the instrumental width of the galactic center 511 kev line as measured by spi ) . \n even if spi did not detect any 511 kev emission from the sdg , it should be remembered that the effective observation time accumulated during the two gcdes is only 80 ks . \n thus , the flux upper limits derived on the sdg are still above the predicted fluxes .    at this point \n it should be noted that the predicted fluxes are very optimistic . \n the calculation has been indeed performed assuming the most favourable hypotheses :    \\1 ) @xcite consider that the spatial extension of the sdg halo is less than 2 degrees and the shape of the halo profile for sdg is similar to that of draco . we know that the sdg is disrupted by tidal gravitational forces and that the visible matter has an extent of 3@xmath38@xmath4 . in this context , the profile of the dark matter halo and the extent of the gas where the positrons annihilate can be much larger than anticipated by the authors , leading to a size of the 511 kev source probably bigger than 2 degrees . \n in such a context , we can not further consider it as a point like source in our data analyses , the flux extraction will be more difficult , and the detection less favorable . \n \\2 ) @xcite choose an hydrogen density in the sdg of the order of @xmath8  @xmath9 . \n this parameter is critical for the computation of the thermalization time . \n the kinetic energy of the positrons is directly linked to the mass of the dark matter . for a dark matter mass greater than 10 mev \n , the thermalization time could be larger than the age of the sgd . \n \\3 ) in @xcite , the annihilation is supposed to occur directly on dust grains . if there is no dust , the line will be broadened and the line width will be equal to 10 kev @xcite . in this case again , the detection is less favourable . \n another interesting target would be palomar-13 @xcite provided this remote ( 24.3 kpc ) globular cluster is not in a process of tidal disruption . \n the expected flux of 511 kev photons normalized on the galactic bulge emission using different dark matter distribution , is sufficiently high to be detected with integral if palomar-13 is really a dense clump of dark matter . \n after two galactic center deep exposures , we have not detected a 511 kev emission from sdg , but this non - detection can not exclude the light dark matter hypotheses . \n the spi / integral effective observation time is today not sufficient to reach the adequate sensitivity . in the following months and years , by accumulating the data , the spi sensitivity in the direction of the sdg will reach the predicted fluxes . in this study we considered the 511 kev source as a point like source ( less than 2 degrees ) , in the future we will search for different source extent . \n moreover two parameters are very important for the prediction of the 511 kev emission as a signature of the light dark matter : the hydrogen density within the sdg and the dust fraction . \n future observations from fuse will provide a more accurate value of the gas density . with more spi data and more accurate parameters , the observation of the sdg in the 511 kev energy range could permit to put a relevant constrain on the mass of the light dark matter . \n atti , d. , cordier , b. , gros , m. , laurent , ph . , \n schanne , s. et al 2004 , a&a 411 , l71 boehm , c. , hooper , d. , silk , j. , casse , m. , & paul , j. 2004 , phys . \n 92 , 101301 cass , m. , cordier , b. , paul , j. , schanne , s. 2004 , apj , 602 , l17 hooper , d. , ferrer , f. , boehm , c. , et al 2004 , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 2969, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies form a sample of small galaxies which , due to their relatively nearby locations and close association with the milky way could in principle furnish crucial observational and theoretical information on a range of astrophysical phenomena . as these systems are eventually disrupted and incorporated into the milky way they illustrate locally one of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for the build up of large galaxies . thus comparing their stars and those now found in our galaxy we can obtain a first estimate of the relevance of late mergers ( unavane et al . \n dynamical studies of their stars have yielded valuable constraints on the nature and structure of dark matter halos at the smallest scales ( lin & faber 1983 , gerhard & spergel 1992 ) . \n their orbits probe the galactic halo in a range of distances not sampled by any other objects and can thus be used to study the outer galactic halo . \n additionally , their small sizes make them in principle the simplest galactic systems , where key processes such as star formation and gas flows can be studied under relatively well defined conditions . \n however , this situation is complicated by the fact that we not only lack a theoretical understanding of these systems , but also an observational record of their evolution ; only a present day snapshot of their physical parameters is available , as is the case with most galactic systems . whilst high redshift observations have recently opened up new areas of research as they begin to yield an statistical description of the evolution of bright galaxies , such an approach is likely to remain out of reach for these small systems for some time . \n fortunately , their neighboring locations allow the study of their individual stars , which offers the possibility of directly probing their evolutionary histories by inferring star formation rates as a function of time , @xmath2 . \n the recent availability of detailed colour - magnitude diagrams for several nearby systems has prompted the development and allowed the application of careful statistical methods aimed at reconstructing the star formation histories of these objects ( e.g. chiosi et al . \n ( 1989 ) , aparicio et al . \n ( 1990 ) and mould et al . \n ( 1997 ) using magellanic and local clusters , and mighell & butcher ( 1992 ) , smecker - hane et al . \n ( 1994 ) , tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , aparicio & gallart ( 1995 ) and mighell ( 1997 ) using local dsph s ) . \n although much has been learnt of the complex @xmath2 of these systems , existing studies have lacked two major ingredients : a homogeneous set of observations including several of the dsph galaxies does not exist , and different data sets are generally analyzed using different techniques . \n these two points make comparisons between the derived @xmath2 at best risky . \n a further difficulty lies in the fact that the available rigorous statistical studies approach the problem parametrically , which is something one should try to avoid when the actual structure of the function one is trying to recover can be crucial , as is the case when the underlying physics is unknown . \n an example of this last point is the case of the carina dwarf . \n hurley - keller et al . ( 1998 ) solve for the best fitting three discrete bursts solution to the @xmath0 and conclude that star formation has proceeded spasmodically , whilst mighell ( 1997 ) uses a non parametric star count approach , albeit not a fully consistent statistical method , to obtain a more gradual solution for carina s @xmath0 . \n in this paper we have attempted to improve on the determination of the star formation histories of local dsph systems by addressing the two points mentioned above . \n we use recent hst observations of the resolved populations of a sample of dsph galaxies ( carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco ) uniformly taken and reduced , to recover the @xmath0 of each , applying a new non - parametric maximum likelihood method . \n this allows meaningful comparisons to be made , as any systematics , at any level , will affect all our galaxies equally . \n the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss the observations , in section 3 we include a brief outline of our method , which was introduced in our paper i ( hernandez et al . 1999 ) . \n the results are presented in section 4 , and in section 5 we summarize our results . \n the main requirements of our observations were that they should comprise a homogeneous sample of local dsph galaxies , mostly in terms of the data reduction . \n only such an internally consistent data set allows robust comparisons between different galaxies , once uniform data reduction and analysis methods are adopted . \n we extracted available archive hst data for the carina , leoi , leoii , ursa minor and draco galaxies , and used standard data reduction methods and standard hst calibration numbers throughout the sample ( e.g. elson et al . \n 1996 ) . \n the currently available data cover only small ( and variable ) sections of the total extent of these systems . \n this fact clearly limits the inferences which can be drawn to the small observed fractions , the star formation histories of these regions might not by representative of the average for a whole galaxy . \n while this limitation introduces an extra uncertainty to our results , it highlights the interesting possibility of studying spatial variations in the evolutionary histories of dsph galaxies , if comprehensive hst studies where undertaken . in the above sense \n , our results for the different galaxies refer in the strictest sense only to the fractions covered by the observed fields .    as we did not require the hr diagrams to extend much fainter than the oldest turnoff points ( @xmath3 ) , or to be complete into the faintest limits ( the faintest stars were in fact excluded from the analysis ) the data reduction was straightforward . \n our resulting cmds do not show any systematic difference from comparable published ones for the galaxies we study . \n the technical details of the images used appear in the appendix . \n in this section we give a summary description of our hr diagram inversion method , which was described extensively in our paper i. in contrast with other statistical methods , we do not need to construct synthetic colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for each of the possible star formation histories being considered . \n rather we use a direct approach which solves for the best @xmath0 compatible with the stellar evolutionary models assumed and the observations used .          as the weak metallicity dispersions measured in the galaxies we are studying ( around 0.3 dex ) are comparable to the errors in the metallicity determinations themselves , we have not attempted to introduce any enrichment histories for any of our galaxies . \n in fact , as small internal metallicity spreads present in these galaxies would introduce only small differential age offsets in our inferred @xmath0 ( see table i ) , we shall in all cases use single metallicity isochrone sets . \n once a metallicity has been selected , we use the latest padova isochrones ( fagotto et al . \n 1994 , girardi et al . \n 1996 ) together with a detailed constant phase interpolation scheme using only stars at constant evolutionary phase , to construct an isochrone library having a chosen temporal resolution .    in this case \n we implement the method with a resolution of 0.15 gyr , sufficient for our present problem . \n it is one of the advantages of the method that this resolution can be increased arbitrarily ( up to the stellar model resolution ) with computation times scaling only linearly with it . \n our only other inputs are the positions of , say @xmath5 observed stars in the hr diagram , each having a colour and luminosity , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . starting from a full likelihood model , we first construct the probability that the @xmath5 observed stars resulted from a certain @xmath0 . \n this will be given by :        in the above expression @xmath10 is the density of points along the isochrone of age @xmath11 , around the luminosity of star @xmath12 , and is determined by the assumed imf together with the duration of the differential phase around the luminosity of star @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a maximum and a minimum time needed to be considered , for example 0 and 15 gyr . \n @xmath15 is the amplitude of the observational errors in the colour of the stars , which are a function of the luminosity of the stars . \n this function is supplied by the particular observational sample one is analyzing . \n finally , @xmath16 is the colour the observed star would actually have if it had formed at time @xmath11 \n . we shall refer to @xmath17 as the likelihood matrix , since each element represents the probability that a given star , @xmath12 , was actually formed at time @xmath11 . since the colour of a star having a given luminosity and age can sometimes be multi - valued function , in practice we check along a given isochrone , to find all possible masses a given observed star might have as a function of time , and add all contributions ( mostly 1 , sometimes 2 and occasionally 3 ) in the same @xmath17 . in this construction we are only considering observational errors in the colour , and not in the luminosity of the stars . \n the generalization to a two dimensional error ellipsoid is trivial , however the observational errors in colour dominate the problem to the extent of making this refinement unnecessary . \n although the amplitude of luminosity errors is only a factor of @xmath18 smaller than colour errors , as can be inferred from the fact that cmd diagrams typically display a range of luminosities 5 times larger than in colour , in discriminating between isochrones , errors in colour are @xmath19 times as important as errors in luminosity . \n the absence of a colour dependence from @xmath10 is a direct consequence of having neglected errors in the luminosity of the stars . \n a star of a given observed luminosity and assumed age will thus have a colour determined by the isochrones used . \n equation ( 2 ) is essentially the extension from the case of a discrete @xmath0 used by tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , to the case of a continuous function ( continuous in time , but obviously discrete with respect to the stars ) in the construction of the likelihood . \n the challenge now is to find the optimum @xmath0 without evaluating equation ( 2 ) i.e. without introducing a fixed set of test @xmath0 cases from which one is selected . \n the condition that @xmath20 has an extremal can be written as @xmath21 and a variational calculus treatment of the problem applied . \n firstly , we develop the product over @xmath12 using the chain rule for the variational derivative , and divide the resulting sum by @xmath22 to obtain :                this in effect has transformed the problem from one of searching for a function which maximizes a product of integrals ( equation 2 ) to one of solving an integro - differential equation ( equation 4 ) . \n we solve this equation iteratively , with the boundary condition sfr(15)=0 . \n details of the numerical procedure required to ensure convergence to the maximum likelihood sfr(t ) can be found in our paper i , where the method is tested extensively using synthetic hr diagrams . \n the main advantages of our method over other maximum likelihood schemes are the totally non parametric approach the variational calculus treatment allows , and the efficient computational procedure , where no time consuming repeated comparisons between synthetic and observational cmd are necessary , as the optimal @xmath0 is solved for directly . \n the lower main sequence region of the cmd diagram is totally degenerate with age , and contains the lower brightness stars , where the errors are larger . \n we have seen from using synthetic hr diagrams that excluding this region produces a faster and more accurate convergence of the method , and have in analyzing real galaxies excluded stars of magnitudes fainter than @xmath28 . \n this last cut together with the fact that our isochrones only extend out to the tip of the red giant branch ( to go further would necessitate combining results from different physical models , which we preferred not to do ) leaves us with a mass range which actually varies as a function of time . \n to include also the fraction of the @xmath0 outside this region , we apply a minor correction factor to the result of equation ( 4 ) , which accounts for the fraction of mass outside the sampled range , as a function of time , as given by the imf used . \n .age offset in gyr between simulated and recovered populations as a function of input age ( in gyr ) and metallicity ( in solar units ) , for a @xmath29 0.2 dex metallicity mismatch [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                  the reddenings used are refined iteratively after the fitting of isochrones to the ms region . \n note , however , that because the reddenings are small , and the reddenings are restored to the data afterwards , even if the initial guess for the reddening is wrong by a substantial amount , very little effect is seen in the final photometry . \n ( e.g. a change of the reddening by 0.1@xmath34 changes photometry by less than 0.005@xmath34 . )      as holtzman et al . \n ( 1995 ) point out , there remain some aspects of the photometric calibration of wfpc2 which are uncertain . \n for example , holtzman et al.(1995 ) note discrepancies of @xmath35 0.05 magnitudes between long and short exposures , which are not understood . \n several more minor systematic and random effects at the level of a few percent ( corresponding to a few hundredths of a magnitude ) are not well understood . \n furthermore , the conversion that has been made here to standard v and i colours , introduces more minor uncertainties . \n it must be noted that the systematic effects in zeropoints may be as large as 0.1 magnitudes . \n any such uncertainties appear as an offset primarily in adopted distance modulus , and would affect most cmds in the same way . \n differentially , any effects should be minimal .", "StartTimeOffset": 1225055125273, "RequestID": "2988d7d0d92a3464a92eda764da061107d488308",

{"ContextTokens": 2767, "GeneratedTokens": 234, "SynthesizedBody": "asteroid dynamical families are groups of asteroids in orbital element space ( gradie , chapman & williams 1979 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 , valsecchi _ et al . \n this clustering was first discovered by hirayama ( 1918 , for a review see binzel 1993 ) , who also proposed that families may be the remnants of parent bodies that broke into fragments . \n about half of all known asteroids are believed to belong to families ; recent work ( zappal _ et al . \n _ 1995 , hereafter z95 ) , applying a hierarchical clustering method to a sample of 12,487 asteroids , finds over 30 families . \n the contrast between families and the background is especially strong in the space spanned by the so - called _ proper _ orbital elements . \n these elements are nearly invariants of motion and are thus well suited for discovering objects with common dynamical history ( valsecchi _ et al . \n _ 1989 , milani & kneevi 1992 , hereafter mk92 ) . \n the current asteroid motion is described by _ osculating _ \n orbital elements which vary with time due to perturbations caused by planets , and are less suitable for studying dynamical families . \n asteroid clustering is much weaker in the space spanned by directly observed osculating elements than in the space spanned by derived proper elements . \n figure 1 compares the osculating ( top panel , bowell 2001 ) and proper ( bottom panel , mk92 ) orbital inclination vs. orbital eccentricity distributions of 1,720 asteroids from the outer region of the main asteroid belt ( proper semi - major axis larger than 2.84 au ) . \n this region contains all three major asteroid families : eos , koronis and themis , with approximate ( @xmath3 ) of ( 3.0 , 0.18 , 0.08 ) , ( 2.9 , 0.03 , 0.05 ) and ( 3.15,0.02 , 0.15 ) , respectively . here \n @xmath4 is proper semi - major axis , @xmath5 is the sine of the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath6 is eccentricity . \n the proper elements are derived from the osculating elements by an approximate perturbation method ( mk92 ) , and it is possible that the overdensities evident in the bottom panel are at least partially created by that algorithm ( valsecchi _ et al . \n _ 1989 , bendjoya 1993 ) . a firm proof that families are real therefore requires their confirmation by a method that is _ not _ based on dynamical considerations , for example , that dynamically selected groups have distinctive colors . while there is observational evidence that at least the most populous asteroid families have characteristic colors ( degewij , gradie & zellner 1978 , chapman 1989 ) , even the most recent studies of the colors of asteroid families include fewer than 50 objects per family ( florczak _ et al . \n _ 1998 , doressoundiram _ et al . \n _ 1998 , florczak _ et al . \n _ 1999 ) . the large number ( about 10,000 ) of color measurements for catalogued asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) recently made available by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york _ \n et al . _ 2000 ) allows a detailed investigation of this question . \n the sdss is a digital photometric and spectroscopic survey which will cover one quarter of the celestial sphere in the north galactic cap and produce a smaller but much deeper multi - epoch survey in the southern galactic hemisphere ( stoughton _ et al . \n the survey sky coverage will result in photometric measurements ( smith _ et al . \n _ 2002 , hogg _ \n 2002 ) for about 50 million stars and a similar number of galaxies , and spectra for about 1 million galaxies and 100,000 quasars . \n although primarily designed for observations of extragalactic objects , the sdss is significantly contributing to studies of solar system objects , because asteroids in the imaging survey must be explicitly recognized to avoid contamination of the quasar samples selected for spectroscopic observations ( lupton _ et al . \n _ 2001 ) . the sdss will increase the number of asteroids with accurate five - color photometry ( fukugita _ et al . \n _ 1996 , gunn _ et al . \n _ 1998 ) by more than two orders of magnitude ( to about 100,000 ) , and to a limit more than five magnitudes fainter than previous multi - color surveys ( ivezi _ et al . \n _ 2001 , hereafter i01 ) . \n most of the asteroids observed by the sdss are new detections , because the sdss finds moving objects to a fainter limit ( @xmath7 ) than the completeness limit of currently available asteroid catalogs ( @xmath8 ) . \n however , sdss observations , which are obtained with a baseline of only 5 minutes ( lupton _ et al . \n _ 2001 , i01 ) , are insufficient to determine accurate orbits , and we consider only objects that have previously determined orbital parameters . \n the details of the matching procedure and a preliminary sample are described by juri _ \n _ 2002 ( hereafter j02 ) . \n here we extend their analysis to a significantly larger sample , and introduce a new method for visualizing the distribution of asteroids in a multi - dimensional space spanned by orbital parameters and colors . \n the currently available sdss moving object list ( ivezi _ et al . \n _ 2002 , hereafter sdssmoc ) includes over 58,000 observations ; 10,592 are detections of unique objects listed in the catalog of known asteroids ( bowell 2001 ) , and 2,010 detections are multiple observations of the same objects . for a subset of 6,612 objects from this list , \n the proper orbital elements are also available ( mk92 ) and are analyzed here . \n these samples are about an order of magnitude larger than used in previous studies of the colors of asteroids , and also benefit from the wide wavelength range spanned by sdss filters band extends to the near - infrared range and allows efficient recognition of vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 ) . ] \n ( gunn _ et al . \n _ 1998 ) . \n sdss colors can distinguish asteroids of at least three different color types ( i01 , j02 ) . using four of the five sdss bands , \n we construct the color - color diagram shown in figure 2 . \n the horizontal axis color . ] is and the vertical axis is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 are the asteroid colors measured by sdss ( accurate to about 0.03 mag ) . \n each dot represents one asteroid , and is color - coded according to its position in this diagram ( note that these colors do not correspond directly to asteroid colors as would be seen by the human eye ) . as discussed by i01 , \n the asteroid distribution in this diagram is highly bimodal , with over 90% of objects found in one of the two clumps that are dominated by rocky s type asteroids ( @xmath12 ) , and carbonaceous c type asteroids ( @xmath13 ) . \n most of the remaining objects have @xmath14 color similar to s type asteroids , and distinctively blue @xmath9 colors . \n they are dominated by vesta type asteroids ( binzel & xu 1995 , j02 ) . \n figures 3 and 4 show two two - dimensional projections of the asteroid distribution in the space spanned by proper semi - major axis , eccentricity , and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 . \n the vertical bands where practically no asteroids are found ( at @xmath4 of 2.065 , 2.501 , 2.825 and 3.278 au ) are the 4:1 , 3:1 , 5:2 , and 2:1 mean motion resonances with jupiter ( the latter three are the kirkwood gaps ) . \n figure  5 is analogous to the bottom panel in figure  1 . \n a striking feature of figures 3 , 4 and 5 is the color homogeneity and distinctiveness displayed by asteroid families . \n each of the three major hirayama families , eos , koronis and themis , and also the vesta family at ( @xmath3 ) of ( 2.35 , 0.12 , 0.09 ) , has a characteristic color . \n this strong color segregation provides firm support for the reality of asteroid dynamical families . \n the correlation between the asteroid colors and their heliocentric distance has been recognized since the earliest development of asteroid taxonomies ( chapman , morrison & zellner 1975 , gradie & tedesco 1982 , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 , gradie , chapman & tedesco 1989 ) . \n our analysis indicates that this mean correlation ( see e.g. figure 23 in i01 ) is mostly a reflection of the distinctive colors of asteroid families and their heliocentric distribution . \n when only orbital elements are considered , families often partially overlap each other ( z95 ) , and additional independent information is needed to improve their definitions . with such a massive , accurate and public database as that discussed here ( sdssmoc ) , it will be possible to improve the classification of asteroid families by simultaneously using both the orbital elements and colors . \n for example , the sdss colors show that the asteroids with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.65 , 0.20 ) are distinctively blue ( figure 3 ) , proving that they do not belong to the family with ( @xmath15 ) about ( 2.60 , 0.23 ) , but instead are a family in their own right . \n while this and several similar examples were already recognized as clusters in the orbital parameter space ( z95 ) , this work provides a dramatic independent confirmation . \n figures 3 , 4 and 5 suggest that the asteroid population is dominated by families : even objects that do not belong to the most populous families , and thus are interpreted as background in dynamical studies , seem to show color clustering . using the definitions of families based on dynamical analysis ( z95 ) , and aided by sdss colors , \n we estimate that at least 90% of asteroids are associated with families .    proper orbital elements ( mk92 ) are not available for asteroids with large semi - major axis and orbital inclination . \n in order to examine the color distribution for objects with large semi - major axis , such as trojan asteroids ( @xmath16 ) and for objects with large inclination , such as asteroids from the hungaria family ( @xmath17 ) , we use osculating orbital elements . \n figure 6 shows the distribution of all the 10,592 known asteroids observed by the sdss in the space spanned by osculating semi - major axis and the sine of the orbital inclination angle , with the points color - coded as in figure 2 . \n it is remarkable that various families can still be easily recognized due to sdss color information . \n this figure vividly demonstrates that the asteroid population is dominated by objects that belong to numerous asteroid families . \n we are grateful to e. bowell for making his astorb file publicly available , and to a. milani , z. kneevi and their collaborators for generating and distributing proper orbital elements . \n we thank princeton university for generous financial support of this research , and m. strauss and d. schneider for helpful comments . \n the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is a joint project of the university of chicago , fermilab , the institute for advanced study , the japan participation group , the johns hopkins university , the max -

component _ polarization vector _ \n @xmath0 is assigned to each particle and characterises completely the polarization state of any lepton or photon . \n for the simulation of polarized media , a possibility to assign stokes vectors to physical volumes has to be provided in geant4 . \n this is handled by a new class , the so - called _ \n polarization manager_. it also allows the evaluation of stokes vectors in different frames of reference . \n the general procedure is very similar to the polarization extension to egs by flttmann @xcite . \n any interaction is described by a transfer matrix @xmath1 , which characterises the process completely . \n it usually depends on kinematic variables like energy and angle , but it can also depend on polarization states ( e.g. of the media ) . the final state polarization @xmath0 is determined via matrix multiplication with the incoming stokes vector @xmath2 , @xmath3 the components @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the incoming and outgoing intensities , respectively . in this framework \n the transfer matrix @xmath1 is of the form @xmath6 the matrix elements @xmath7 can be identified as ( unpolarized ) differential cross section ( @xmath8 ) , polarized differential cross section ( @xmath9 ) , polarization transfer ( @xmath10 ) , and ( de)polarization ( @xmath11 ) . in the flttmann extension the elements @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been neglected , thus concentrating on polarization transfer only . \n using the full matrix takes now all polarization effects into account . \n the structure is illustrated with a few examples in the following section . \n here , some preliminary results shall illustrate the field of application . \n the first process studied is compton scattering . \n this process possesses all basic features : a polarization dependent differential and total cross section , polarization transfer and depolarization effects . \n compton scattering is of great importance in polarimetry .    in figure \n [ fig : compton ] the angular distribution of the scattered photon is presented . for this simulation a 100% circularly polarized photon beam and a 100% \n longitudinally polarized iron foil is assumed% . ] . when flipping the electron spin from an anti - parallel configuration with respect to the photon spin ( blue ) to a parallel orientation ( red ) , the distribution changes drastically , and the total cross section decreases . for illustration , \n the case where both , target and beam , are unpolarized is also plotted ( black ) . \n a comparison with an analytic formula ( solid lines ) shows perfect agreement in all cases .    in a next step a more realistic simulation of target properties \n will be performed to study the effects of different polarized processes . \n the polarization transfer in a undulator based positron source has been investigated . since the target is unpolarized , the total cross section , \n i.e.  the interaction length , does not depend on the photon polarization . \n consequently it is sufficient to concentrate on the polarization transfer from incoming photons to outgoing positrons .    50 gev , undulator period @xmath122.4 mm and undulator strength parameter @xmath130.17 . \n the peak of the first harmonic ( dipole ) radiation is at 9.62 mev.,width=264 ]    the setup of the simulation consists of an incoming photon beam with the characteristic energy spectrum of a _ helical undulator _ , cf . \n fig.[fig : gammaenergy ] . as a first approximation \n , the polarization of the photon beam is assumed to be 100% . \n the degree of polarization of the positrons created in pair production depends also on the energies of the incoming photon and the outgoing positron . in general the degree of the positron polarization \n is increasing with the energy fraction of the created positron , see figure [ fig : posipol1 ] .    . \n each dot corresponds to a single answer of the transfer matrix . \n the mean degree of polarization is plotted as the ( blue ) profile histogram.,width=294 ]    a simple first check of the polarization routine is provided by assuming an equal mixture of left and right circularly polarized photons as incoming beam . in this case one expects to obtain an unpolarized positron beam . \n indeed , in figure [ fig : posipol2 ] this behaviour can be observed . \n now the polarization spectrum of the _ helical undulator _ as plotted in figure [ fig : gammapol ] will be included in the study . \n the simulation shows the marginal influence on the obtained degree of positron polarization . \n in particular , high energy positrons are nearly 100% polarized , see figure [ fig : posipol3 ] .        for a realistic simulation of a polarized positron source based on a _ helical undulator _ the effects of bremsstrahlung , multiple scattering , coulomb and screening correction have to be taken into account . in figure [ fig : posienergy ] \n the influence of these processes on the obtained positron energy spectrum is investigated . \n it is shown , that only a small fraction ( green ) of all produced positrons ( blue histogram ) will escape from the target . \n the energy spectrum of positrons that leave the target is shifted to lower values in comparison to their spectrum at the creation point ( red ) . \n consequently , the target acts as a filter for high energy positrons and the created positrons have suffered a substantial loss of energy . \n the effect of bremsstrahlung and multiple scattering on the degree of polarization of the produced positrons will be the subject of further investigations . \n in this report the current status of a project to implement polarization into the framework of geant4  has been presented . \n for this task the stokes formalism is employed , providing a systematic approach for a consistent treatment of polarized leptons and photons . \n some preliminary results demonstrate the applicability of this new extension to polarimetry ( compton scattering ) and polarization transfer studies ( positron source ) . \n these analyses represent the first steps toward a realistic target simulation of an undulator based positron source for the ilc . \n the authors are indebted to a.  stahl as the initiator of this project , and also like to thank t.  lohse for fruitful collaboration , and s.  riemann , p.  starovoitov and j.  suarez for helpful discussions . \n k.l . and a.s . \n are grateful for the assistance by k.  flttmann and j.  c.  liu concerning the egs polarization extension . \n r.d .  acknowledges support by the european community ( eurotev contract number rids  011899 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1282088783060, "RequestID": "edde1082df8ef1ae1e31ab3b761aa2f0e307361e", "TotalTokens": 2360}

arcseconds . \n the two micro images formed by the lens can not be resolved , but the light centroid is displaced with respect to the source position by the angle ( cf . \n g , novikov & polnarev 1995 , miyamoto & yoshi 1995 , walker 1995 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the source and the lens , and the lens is assumed to be dark . \n the maximum displacement is @xmath21    for @xmath22 the light centroid corresponds almost exactly to the position of the dominant image ( cf . \n paczyski 1996b ) . \n note , that if the lensing star is invisible , as assumed , then the source position can be measured with respect to any nearby star . \n in this section we present a few examples of the displacement trajectories to illustrate the principle of the phenomenon , and to demonstrate that the lens mass and parallax have distinct effects which should be readily measurable with the sim . \n let us consider a microlensing event with a time scale @xmath23 50 days and maximum magnification @xmath24 , which corresponds to the impact parameter @xmath25 . \n we adopt the source distance to be @xmath26 kpc , and consider three different cases of the lens distance : 10 , 30 , and 45 kpc , with identical lens mass of @xmath27 . \n the corresponding einstein ring radii are @xmath28 mas , respectively . finally , the relative proper motion is @xmath29 , for these three cases . \n for our example we adopt @xmath30 , which is reasonable for a star in the lmc , and we arbitrarily take @xmath31 , where ( @xmath32 ) are the ecliptic longitude and latitude , respectively . \n the relative parallax is equal @xmath33 mas for the three cases , respectively . finally , we chose the maximum magnification and the smallest angular separation between the lens and the source to be at the time when the star is at the largest angular separation from the sun . \n the three examples of astrometric effects of microlensing a star in the lmc are presented in figure 1 , which shows the relation between the displacements in the two ecliptic coordinates , ( @xmath32 ) . \n all lines in fig.1 begin 18 months before the maximum of photometric magnification , and they end 18 months after that maximum . both ends are close to @xmath34 . \n the largest curve corresponds to the lens distance @xmath35 kpc , the smallest to @xmath36 kpc . \n note , that the largest displacement is proportional to the einstein ring radius , with @xmath37 ( cf . \n the relative proper motion of the lens with respect to the star is given as the ratio : @xmath38 . \n the determination of the relative parallax requires model fitting , but this should be feasible . the dashed curve in figure 1 shows the displacement of the image centroid for the case when the lens is at @xmath35 kpc , but the earth orbital motion is artificially suppressed . \n the difference between the solid and the dashed lines is shown in figure 2 . \n this is the complicated effect of the earth motion , and its scale is such that the sim should be able to measure it readily . \n therefore , if the machos responsible for microlensing of the lmc stars are located in the galactic halo then their distances and masses will be determined with the sim astrometry . \n the masses and distances to the galactic bulge lenses will be even easier to measure as their parallaxes are relatively large . \n note , that @xmath39 astrometry will provide accurate astrometric determination of the macho mass , as shown with the scale of the figure 2 , however , a much lower precision of the roemer mission ( cf . \n g , novikov & polnarev 1995 ) , or of the gaia project ( lindegren & perryman 1996 ) will not provide a useful macho mass determination .    there is a region of parameter space in which the effects of acceleration in earth s orbital motion are too small for the sim to measure ( cf . \n boden et al . \n this includes very short events with @xmath40 year , and the case when the relative parallax @xmath16 is very small . \n so , if the lenses responsible for the lmc lensing are in the lmc itself ( sahu 1994 ) then the astrometric effects are so small ( cf . \n figure 1 ) that it will be impossible to determine their masses and distances accurately \n . however , it will be still possible to establish that they are close to the sources , i.e. within the lmc rather than in the galactic halo . \n all classical microlensing searches monitor millions of stars to detect a few events which come at random time . \n miralda - escud ( 1996 ) and paczyski ( 1995 , 1996b ) pointed out that there is a very different regime of microlensing when we begin not with the sources but with the lenses . \n this works best when the lenses are selected as stars with very large proper motions , indicating they are relatively nearby , and therefore their angular einstein ring radii are relatively large ( cf . equation 1 ) . \n the astrometric effects have a large effective cross - section . \n for example , the barnard s star ( van de kamp 1971 ) has a parallax of @xmath41 , and a proper motion of @xmath42 per year . if we adopt its mass to be @xmath43 , we obtain for its einstein ring radius @xmath44 a position of a distant background star passing by at an angular distance of @xmath45 is displaced by lensing by 100 @xmath46  a huge effect for the sim , which in this case could determine the mass of barnard s star with @xmath4 accuracy . \n the large proper motion combined with the large astrometric cross section implies that the useful background stars may be looked for in a large area in the sky . \n adoptic 3 years as a pessimistic life span for sim implies that the barnatd s star alone will cover an area @xmath47 in the sky . \n a lower limit to the number of lensing events for which the sim will be able to make accurate mass determination for the lenses can be obtained using hipparcos catalog ( perryman et al . \n there are 12,204 stars in the catalog with the distance less than 100 pc and proper motion @xmath13 larger than @xmath48 . \n their masses can be estimated with the mass - luminosity relation , and therefore the corresponding einstein ring radii can be calculated . adopting @xmath49 as the required astrometric displacement @xmath50 due to lensing , the minimum impact parameter @xmath20 can be calculated with eq . \n 5 . combining all these data it is possible to calculate the time scale for lensing event , @xmath51 , and the area of the sky swept by each star during a three year time interval : @xmath52 . \n the total area swept by all 12,204 stars is @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 of the whole sky . as stars within 100 pc \n are distributed isotropically in the sky , we may expect to find @xmath55 stars brighter than @xmath56 , mag and @xmath57 stars brighter than @xmath58 mag ( cf . \n table 4.2 of mihalas & binney 1983 ) in the total area swept by these stars during three years . a median time scale for the microlensing events , weighted by the area in the sky swept by the stars , turns out to be a convenient 7 months , with \n 80% of event time scales expected in the range 2 months - 2 years . for each of the events a @xmath59 astrometric accuracy implies 1% accurate mass determination . \n note , that in this case the lensing star is bright , and the lensed source is faint , but clearly resolved with the sim . \n the relative astrometry of the two stars will provide the relative proper motion @xmath60 , the relative parallax @xmath16 , and the einstein ring radius @xmath61 from the analysis of displacements @xmath50 as given with eq . \n ( 5 ) , which in this case refers to the dominant image of the source . \n the lens mass follows from eq . \n if the gravitational displacement requirement is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath62 , then the total area swept by the 12,204 high proper motion hipparcos stars in 3 years increases to @xmath63 , i.e. it is larger by a factor 3.3 compared to the previous case , and the number of possible events increases by the same factor . a median time scale increases to 1.6 years . \n this shows the importance of a precise astrometry : the higher the accuracy , the more lensing events can be used for accurate mass determination .    obviously , there are many more stars which are too faint to be in the hipparcos catalog , but which have large proper motion ( e.g. luyten 1976 ) , and will be suitable for accurate mass determination \n . it would be very interesting to have the entire sky searched for faint , ( 20th mag ) high proper motion ( @xmath64 1/year ) stars , as some of them may turn out to be brown dwarfs , the difference between a star and a brown dwarf is best established with an accurate mass determination , and this will be possible with the sim . \n when the angular impact parameter is smaller than the angular source radius then an accurate microlensing light curve can be used to obtain the ratio of the two angles . \n if the effective temperature of the source is estimated from its color and/or spectrum then its surface brightness can also be estimated ; combining this with the observed flux can be used to determine the source angular diameter , and the angular einstein ring radius . \n finally , the relative proper motion is obtained by dividing the einstein ring radius by the event time scale , hence the name : ` proper motion event ' ( cf . \n gould 1996 , and references therein ) . \n it may be useful to reverse this process as stellar effective temperatures are not known all that well . \n sim s astrometry of microlensing events will provide accurate measurements of the relative proper motions between the lens and the source . combining this with an accurate light curve of a ` proper motion event ' \n will give the angular stellar radius , which in turn will be used to determine the effective temperature of the lensed star . \n the first spectacular example of a microlensing event of this type was recently provided by the macho alert 95 - 30 ( alcock et al . \n the ratio of the angular impact parameter to the angular source radius was determined to be @xmath65 . \n had the einstein ring radius been measured with sim - like astrometry the angular diameter of the lensed star would have been known to @xmath4 accuracy , comparable to the best existing stellar measurements . of course , accurate astrometry was not available , and the source colors and spectra were used to estimate stellar radius , and the proper motion with a precision of only @xmath66 . \n the example of macho alert 95 - 30 demonstrates that the accuracy of stellar radii determination with @xmath67 astrometry of resolved microlensing events is comparable to that achieved with the best detached eclipsing binaries ( cf . \n andersen 1991 ) , or the best interferometric measurements ( shao & colavita 1992 ) . \n once the angular stellar radius is measured , the determination of the effective temperature is a standard procedure . \n a @xmath67 astrometry of microlensing events can be used to determine the lens masses and the source radii ( and hence their effective temperatures ) , but it requires target of opportunity mode of operation . in order to be useful the space interferometry mission ( allen , shao , & peterson 1997 , boden , shao & van buren 1997 ) would have to respond to ground based alerts within a few weeks .    the only way to measure masses of single objects with an accuracy of @xmath4 is with gravitational lensing . \n lensing events caused by nearby high proper motion stars passing within @xmath68 of distant background stars , can be predicted many years into the future , making it possible to prepare the sim s observing program ahead of time , with no need for the too operation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1297011567688, "RequestID": "b13090c07d56d0255c0457dad7703e978f3fdf65", "TotalTokens": 3948}

[ \n fig : vlaxmm ] ) . \n we used different techniques to obtain the radio light curves in both bands and to check their consistency . \n figure  [ fig : vlaxmm ] shows the x - ray pn light curve for events from 0.25 to 8  kev ( panel a ) and a light curve of a hardness ratio ( panel b ) defined here as the ratio between the count rates in the hard band ( @xmath14  kev ) and the soft band ( @xmath15  kev ) . \n the x - ray eclipse is almost absent , with a local x - ray minimum about an hour _ after _ the optical eclipse of the k3 subgiant . \n the light curve modulation suggests , instead , the presence of extended x - ray sources which are not significantly eclipsed and are rotationally modulated ( e.g. , in particular in the phase range @xmath16 ) . \n it could also reflect the evolution of active regions in rz cas . \n a flare was observed at @xmath17 , i.e. , at the time of the eclipse of the primary a3  v star . \n however , the synchronous rotation of the stars does not suggest that @xmath17 should be a special orbital phase for flares . \n we found also that rz cas significantly became significantly and steadily hotter in the second half of the observation , as shown in the hardness ratio light curve . \n no obvious flare can explain such hardening , therefore we hypothesize that hot , active regions rose in this time span , probably due to some reconfiguration of the magnetic topology in rz cas .    the radio light curves in x and c bands are also shown in figure  [ fig : vlaxmm ] in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . \n a similar flux level was observed in both frequencies . \n panel ( e ) of fig . \n [ fig : vlaxmm ] shows a light curve of the spectral index @xmath3 ( assuming a power law for the radio spectrum , i.e. , @xmath18 ) . \n the shaded time ranges in the radio light curves correspond to time spans when an accurate calibration could not be obtained . \n the index @xmath3 appears to be shallow ( @xmath19 ) between 4.9  ghz and 8.4  ghz . \n this is consistent with the core - halo model proposed by @xcite for rz cas . \n the radio light curves show a steady flux increase , an a possible shallow eclipse is observed about 1.5  hours _ before _ the optical secondary eclipse . \n the spectral index @xmath3 possibly flattens during the radio eclipse . \n the marked difference in i ) eclipse timing , and ii ) in flux modulation in the x - rays and radio strongly suggests that the emitting sources are not co - spatial , at least during this coordinated campaign . \n this does not support the findings of @xcite . \n in addition , the shallow eclipses preclude compact sources in both wavelength regimes . \n furthermore , the absence of eclipse at phase @xmath17 indicates that the primary a - type star does not emit significant x - rays . finally , \n the lack of significant eclipses at both primary and secondary eclipses precludes intrabinary ( or accretion spot ) x - ray and radio emissions in rz cas . \n instead , the light curves imply rotational modulation of extended sources and active regions rise in the second half of the x - ray observation . \n -4 mm    figure  [ fig : rgs ] shows the average _ xmm - newton _   rgs spectrum of rz cas . \n strong emission lines of o  viii , ne  x , ne  ix , and several fe l - shell lines can be observed on top of an underlying continuum . \n the high ne  x / ne  ix and o  viii / o  vii ratios indicate a dominant hot plasma in rz cas s corona . \n the faint o  vii triplet suggests a high intercombination - to - forbidden line ratio , albeit with a large error bar . \n although such a ratio could be indicative of a high - density ( @xmath20  @xmath21 ) plasma , it is in fact artificial and due to the strong uv field from the early - type primary ( see @xcite ) . \n the poor signal - to - noise ratio in the triplet prevented us from obtaining a phase - dependent line ratio , which would have confirmed the influence of the uv field ( minimal close to @xmath22 , maximal close to @xmath17 ) . \n we performed a multi-@xmath23 fit of the rz cas data using both mos spectra in the @xmath24     range and both rgs spectra above @xmath25   . \n we also discarded several wavelength ranges of the rgs data to avoid bias from poorly known l - shell lines of low - z ions ( see @xcite ) . \n a 4-@xmath23 model fits the data adequately ( @xmath26 for 1202 d.o.f . ) , with @xmath27  mk , @xmath28  mk , @xmath29  mk , @xmath30  mk , @xmath31 @xmath21 , @xmath32  @xmath21 , @xmath33 @xmath21 , @xmath34  @xmath21 . \n coronal abundances ( relative to the solar photospheric abundances ;

{"ContextTokens": 3736, "GeneratedTokens": 166, "SynthesizedBody": "more than 150 molecules have already been detected in interstellar space @xcite . \n the number of atoms in by now discovered interstellar molecules is in the range from two to more than ten . \n broad absorption spectral structures have been observed in the near - uv , visible , and near - ir spectra of some stars . \n they are called diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) @xcite . up to now , around 300 dibs have been measured . \n although the first such lines were detected almost ninety years ago , their carriers are still unknown . \n many dibs carriers have been suggested , but two main groups are processes on the astrophysical dust grains and molecular transitions . \n the molecular origin of dibs is more dominant hypothesis in the recent literature . \n various simple or complex carbon containing molecules have been suggested as possible dibs carriers . \n for example , small linear carbon chains , fullerenes , and especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) have been investigated as candidates for dibs carriers @xcite . \n although various neutral and ionized pahs , small and large ones , have been extensively studied , the analysis still did not unambiguously confirm agreement between any specific pahs spectra and dibs . \n a few narrow dibs have been observed in the red rectangle nebula @xcite . \n substructures in prominent bands of some narrow dibs have been seen @xcite . \n features in these resolved profiles are consistent with rovibrational transitions in organic molecules . \n it is also important to study various molecules where atoms of other chemical elements substitute c and h atoms in pahs . \n nitrogen is a very important component of biological materials , and it is one of the most abundant chemical elements in the universe . \n several molecules that contain nitrogen have already been detected in meteorites , interstellar dust particles , and space , or they have been analyzed by computational methods @xcite . \n proflavine , c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2 ( 3,6-diaminoacridine ) , is a molecule well known in molecular biology @xcite . \n this molecule interacts with nucleic acids , intercalates into dna , and blocks activities of many viruses . \n c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2 is a typical example of amino - acridines which have been tested and used as anticancer drugs . \n it has been suggested that proflavine is one of molecules which may act as `` midwifes '' @xcite . \n it is possible that this type of molecules increased a probability of dna and rna synthesis when biological matter was formed . \n for example , proflavine increases thousand times a kinetics of the synthesis of two small dna or rna molecules into larger one . \n therefore , proflavine is one of the candidates for molecules which induced the origin of life on earth @xcite . \n optical spectra present an efficient way to detect proflavine , its ions , and derived nanostructures in biological materials and processes . in a comparison with pahs ( for example oligoacenes ) , available experimental and theoretical data for proflavine are scarce . in ref \n 3 it has been suggested that dyes are good candidates for studies of a dibs problem and , as a support of this idea , it was stated that proflavine absorbs at 445 nm in water at ph 7 . however , existing measurements of proflavine spectra are done in aqueous and other solutions @xcite . \n it has been found that the optical spectrum of proflavine is very sensitive to the type of a solvent and ph factor @xcite . \n there is a possibility that spectra of proflavine and its ions in vacuum and under astrophysical conditions are substantially different from ones in solutions . \n in addition , it is known that many materials from the group of organic dyes show strong lines in a visible spectrum . \n for example , absorption lines of basic dyes such as methylene blue , thionine , neutral red , safranine , acridine orange , acridine yellow , and proflavine are all in an interval from 400  to 800  @xcite . \n although many organic dyes are good candidates for dibs studies , because of a `` midwife '' idea @xcite and possible applications in astrobiology , we have selected proflavine for our study . \n it is known that many molecules in interstellar space exist in its ionized state . \n it has been found that positive and negative ions of pah molecules play an important role in the chemistry of diffuse interstellar clouds @xcite . \n therefore , it is also important to analyze ions of proflavine . \n we use pseudopotential density functional ( dft ) methods to compute the ground - state properties of proflavine and its ions , as well as the pseudopotential time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) to calculate their optical spectra . \n pseudopotential methods are computationally less demanding than all - electrons methods and offer a possibility to study larger systems . \n methods based on the pseudopotential dft are now substantially developed to provide reliable results for structural , electronic and optical properties of various materials @xcite . \n tddft @xcite is recently used to describe optical properties of many materials @xcite . \n it is known that electronic spectra of pahs are in the uv and visible part of the spectrum . \n optical spectra of pahs and many other organic molecules in this region of the spectrum are well described by tddft @xcite . \n the ground - states of all proflavine related molecules are optimized independently using the quantum espresso program package @xcite . for a majority of optical spectra we use a real - time propagation method within tddft as implemented in the octopus code @xcite . \n the first step is to calculate the ground state . \n then , the system is perturbed by a small time - dependent potential @xmath3 . \n this perturbation is turned off , and the time - evolution of the system is followed . \n if the dipole momentum of the system is @xmath4 , then its dynamical polarizability is obtained from @xmath5dt$ ] . \n optical spectrum is calculated from @xmath6 the real space method and the spacing of 0.13  are used . \n the simulation box is formed by adding spheres of the 4  radii around each atom . \n the time - dependent equations are integrated using the time step of @xmath7 @xmath8/ev . \n the time evolution of @xmath9 7.9 fs is followed . \n the approximated enforced time - reversal symmetry algorithm is applied @xcite . \n we use the tdlda approximation and the perdew - zunger exchange - correlation functional @xcite because of its good numerical stability in the pseudopotential tddft method . \n the troullier - martins pseudopotentials are used @xcite . \n it is known that hybrid functionals in all - electron dft methods produce results which are often in better agreement with experiments than those obtained using lda and gga @xcite . \n in contrast to all - electron codes , applications of hybrid functionals in the plane wave pseudopotential dft methods are still in development . \n this is even more pronounced for pseudopotential tddft methods . \n we compare structural parameters of neutral proflavine calculated in lda with those obtained using the blyp functional in the quantum espresso @xcite . \n we also calculate optical properties of neutral proflavine using the b3lyp functional in the latest version of the octopus code , where hybrid functionals are still in development , and find an agreement between lda and b3lyp optical spectra . \n however , because of much better numerical stability , as well as availability and reliability of corresponding pseudopotentials , we present results for the tdlda functional . \n it has been shown that the tdlda pseudopotential approximation in a time - dependent evolution gives optical properties in agreement with experiments and other calculations , even for complex biological molecules such as the green fluorescent protein @xcite and dna bases @xcite . \n we also compare optical spectrum of proflavine calculated by the octopus code with one obtained by the tddft module @xcite of quantum espresso @xcite . \n this module presents a new algorithm for the time dependent density functional perturbation theory . \n a susceptibility is determined as an off - diagonal matrix element of the resolvent of the liouvillian superoperator . \n computations are done using a lanczos continued fraction method . \n the optical spectrum of proflavine is calculated using the ground state computed in the quantum espresso package . \n periodic boundary conditions and the tetragonal simulation cell of sides length 30 a.u . and 16.7 a.u . \n a local density perdew - zunger exchange - correlation functional @xcite , and ultrasoft pseudopotentials of the rrkj type @xcite are applied . \n the kinetic energy cutoff of 25 ry for wavefunctions , and 200 ry for the charge density are used . \n the convergence properties in the lanczos method are checked and the optical spectrum for 3500 recursion steps , and with the broadening of 0.01 ry is shown in this work . \n the structure and electron density of proflavine molecule is shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . it is found that different exchange functionals and corresponding pseudopotentials produce results for geometry parameters which are sufficiently close to each other . \n for example , in proflavine molecule average n - c distances are 1.365  for lda and norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite , 1.349  for lda and ultra - soft pseudopotentials @xcite , 1.371  for the blyp functional @xcite . \n average c - c distances are : 1.395  for lda and norm - conserving pseudopotentials , 1.396  for lda and ultra - soft pseudopotentials , 1.413  for the blyp functional . \n this should be compared with computationally generated data available in the nist database @xcite : 1.365  for average n - c , and 1.406  for average c - c distances . \n isovalues , where @xmath10 is the bohr radius , and @xmath11 is the electron charge . \n the figure is prepared using the xcrysden package @xcite . ] \n it is calculated that the lda kohn - sham homo - lumo gap for neutral proflavine is 2.240 ev . \n the quasiparticle corrected homo - lumo gap is obtained using two formulae @xcite . from @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total energy of n - electron system , the value of 4.509 ev is obtained . the second formula for the quasiparticle corrected homo - lumo gap @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the i - th eigenvalue of the j - electron system , produces the value of 4.511 ev .    optical spectra of proflavine and its ions \n are shown in fig . \n it is found that the overall spectra are rather similar to each other . \n however , differences in the position and shape of lines exist . \n optical transitions in ions occur at lower energies than in a neutral proflavine molecule . \n the same relation between spectra has been found for neutral and charged pah molecules @xcite . \n we find that the first pronounced absorption peak in spectra of proflavine and its ions appears at @xmath16 ev . \n the first absorption peak in pah anthracene ( with the same number of cycles ) is at 5 ev @xcite . \n figure [ fig3 ] compares spectra of neutral proflavine calculated by two exchange - correlation functionals in the octopus code @xcite with the same result obtained by the tddft module @xcite of quantum espresso @xcite . \n although numerical algorithms and pseudopotentials used in these methods are different , the agreement between shapes of the spectra and positions of lines is good . \n it has been measured that a position of a visible absorption line of proflavine in water at room temperature changes from 444 nm to 394 nm when ph changes between 7.0 and 14.0 @xcite . \n these authors concluded that the value of 394 nm corresponds to the neutral form of proflavine in water . \n the same line is at 397 nm for proflavine in purified toluene @xcite . \n the value for the maximum of the absorption spectrum of proflavine in water reported in ref . \n @xcite is 400 nm . \n the comparison of calculated lines and corresponding dib lines @xcite is presented in table [ pfdib ] . \n data for a visible spectrum show that only line of a neutral molecule is within fwhm of known dib lines . \n positions of the uv line nearest to the visible spectrum , as well as of a characteristic strong line which appears in all spectra between 8.35 ev and 8.55 ev , are also shown in table [ pfdib ] . \n many organic molecules exhibit absorption lines in the uv spectrum . \n therefore , the measurements and identification of uv spectral features are important for organic materials in space . for example , the interval between 1320  and 1440  in the uv spectrum measured by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) has been analyzed @xcite . \n the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) , recently installed on the hubble space telescope , will provide new data for spectra of organic molecules in uv @xcite . \n calculations based on a model of the state of hydrogenation and the degree of ionization in the diffuse interstellar medium have shown that small pahs with 15 - 20 carbon atoms are destroyed in the uv field @xcite . \n although proflavine and its ions are rather small , there is a possibility that they exist in space adsorbed on suitable grains , or as intercalators in some bigger molecules . that could even change their optical spectra and give line positions in better agreement with dibs . \n h@xmath1n@xmath2 , ( b ) c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2@xmath17 , ( c ) c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2@xmath18 , ( d ) c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2@xmath19 . ]    ) and visible ( @xmath20 ) region calculated by three pseudopotential tddft methods : ( a ) the tdlda real - time propagation method @xcite , @xmath21 nm , @xmath22 nm , ( b ) the tdb3lyp real - time propagation method @xcite , @xmath23 nm , @xmath24 nm , ( c ) the lanczos chains method @xcite , @xmath25 nm , @xmath26 nm . ] \n we calculated optical spectra of proflavine , its anion , cation , and dication using pseudopotential density functional theory methods . \n a comparison of three tddft pseudopotential methods shows that they produce spectra of proflavine which qualitatively agree well , and line positions differ 0.14 ev , at the most . the difference of an average result ( calculated by three tddft methods ) for a visible line position and a corresponding average experimental value for a neutral proflavine molecule in water @xcite is also 0.14 ev . the shapes of spectra for proflavine and its ions are rather similar to each other , but the change in the line positions induced by a different charge is apparent . \n uv lines are characteristic for spectra of proflavine and its ions and give an efficient way for their detection , either in space , meteorites , astrophysical dust particles , or in biological processes . \n however , the uv spectral region is much less studied than visible one . \n it is important to analyze available data and to perform new studies of substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . \n we hope that our work will generate an interest for measurements of optical spectra of proflavine and other organic dyes in the gaseous phase and under various astrophysical conditions . \n we are grateful to the hr -

lived deconfined phase , due to an excess yield of photons[23 ] . \n based on the present ratio of @xmath66   ( stat ) it is very difficult to conclude anything regarding the formation of a deconfined qgp phase . \n in the present work we have reported priliminary star results on @xmath5 within @xmath10 for au+au collissions at @xmath67 gev . for top 5% central events @xmath68 has been estimated to be 450 @xmath69  ( stat ) gev . \n the value of @xmath70 has been found to be @xmath71  ( stat ) gev . \n knowing that the observed @xmath5 is lower than the initial values [ 6,9,24 ] , the present value of @xmath71  ( stat ) gev may be considered as a lower bound only . the initial energy density estimated within the framework of boost - invariant hydrodynamics , as given by @xmath72 , has been found to be @xmath73 which is well above that required for the deconfinement phase transition as predicted by lattice qcd[20 ] . \n the electromagnetic fraction of the total transverse energy for central events is found to be @xmath74  ( stat ) , consistent with the fact that the final state is dominated by mesons . \n finally , this method of independent measurement of @xmath40 and @xmath49 gives an unique opportunity to study event by event fluctuations in these observables and in their ratios . \n the correction factors and the systematic errors are yet to be calculated for this analysis . \n we thank the rhic operations group and rcf at bnl , and the nersc center at lbnl for their support . \n this work was supported in part by the henp divisions of the office of science of the u.s . \n doe ; the u.s . \n nsf ; the bmbf of germany ; in2p3 , ra , rpl , and emn of france ; epsrc of the united kingdom ; fapesp of brazil ; the russian ministry of science and technology ; the ministry of education and the nnsfc of china ; irp and ga of the czech republic , fom of the netherlands , dae , dst , and csir of the government of india ; swiss nsf ; the polish state committee for scientific research ; staa of slovakia , and the korea sci . & eng . foundation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1377454389115, "RequestID": "89affcffcd3212a6fa362e8fee1f08d4c5719aea", "TotalTokens": 3220}

{"ContextTokens": 3341, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "thales of miletus ( 6th century b.c . ) made the first observations of electricity by rubbing pieces of amber being biological in origin , thanks to macroscopic charge separation . \n spontaneous charge separation appears also with ferroelectric materials , where at the molecular level the positive charge center is shifted relative to the negative charge distribution . \n the perfect alignment of these individual electric dipoles gives rise to the ferroelectricity . \n thus , the ferroelectric state exhibits spontaneously a macroscopic electric dipole moment even in the absence of an external electric field . \n this occurs below a characteristic temperature , the curie temperature t@xmath0 , where the individual electric dipoles of the molecules get spontaneously aligned ; for comparison , to polarize a dielectric material to a similar value , one needs electric fields of the order mv / cm to gv / cm , and this distinguishes ferroelectricity . \n the consequence of the coherent single dipole alignment is the appearance of unpaired positive and negative bound charges on the two end - faces along the direction of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization @xmath1 . in the ideal case , a piece of ferroelectric material is equivalent to an empty capacitor of the same dimensions , each plate being charged with @xmath2 . \n assuming @xmath3 values by factor @xmath4 below those encountered often with crystals , the associated surface charge density ( @xmath5 ) can still be as much as @xmath6 charges/@xmath7 charges/@xmath8m@xmath9 . \n the maximum electric field strength inside matter is given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the dielectric constant of the medium . \n for example , for @xmath12=1 mc / m@xmath9 only , the associated electric field is of the order of @xmath13mv / cm . \n such electric fields exist only transiently , and , they can give rise even to the self - emission of energetic electrons ( @xmath14 kev electrons have been measured ( s. gundel et al . , 1989 ) ) ; depending on the actual conditions those electrons might ionize the surrounding , or , they can cause other related effects .    in this section , we present in short the main properties of ferroelectricity , \n a phenomenon which is also described in the text books , but we also refer to a few related articles , which can be read actually by non - specialists ( zioutas @xmath15 daskaloyannis , 1985 , gundel et al . , 1989 , riege , 1994 ) , or , modern theoretical ones ( resta , 1997 ) . \n it is worth remembering that ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism have at first sight many common properties . comparing both types of materials , the main difference comes from the ( at least practically ) non - existence of magnetic monopoles . \n the ubiquitous electric charges compensate the large polarization electric fields , and , they determine the transient ferroelectric behaviour during polarization change . \n thus , the ferroelectric state is completely described by its widely known static properties as well as its dynamical behaviour associated with a temperature change , or , applying externally pressure and/or electric pulses . \n in fact , every ferroelectric material is also piezoelectric and pyroelectric , but not _ vice versa_.    obviously , any change of the intrinsic spontaneous ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath16 is associated with a corresponding surface charge change ( @xmath17 ) . \n these bound polarization charges attract ( either from the surrounding or from the ferroelectric medium itself ) an equal number of charges , but opposite in sign , since no environment can stand those electric fields . in short , a ferroelectric in its static state \n consists of a polarized crystal or polycrystalline medium , and , quasi free screening surface charges , which partly migrate into the bulk of the ferroelectric . \n the time period needed , for this charge neutralization to be completed , defines the dynamical behaviour of ferroelectrics . in general , this transient time is much longer than the preceding switching time . \n depending on the applying electric field , temperature and the ferroelctric compound itself , transient times can be in the @xmath18sec to sec region . \n many ferroelectric properties during polarization change appear much more pronounced compared with those we know in the static case . \n for example , the dielectric constant takes enormous values around the phase transition temperature . \n in fact , a ferroelectric sample in its static state might remain unnoticed at first sight . \n it is only the change of its spontaneous polarization vector ( @xmath1 ) , which makes actually ferroelectricity visible . \n we mention here a few mostly encountered cases when working with such materials . \n * a ) *   let the temperature increase from the ferro- to the paraelectric state . during the phase transition , \n the intrinsic polarization disappears , and , one is left suddenly with the unpaired screening charges on each end - surface , which must be screened so to say , because of the associated strong electric fields . \n since those charges are quasi - free , the result will be : either a current flow through the bulk of the ferroelectric material with both charge polarities compensating each other , or , for sufficient high intrinsic resistance of the sample , those almost unbound charges will be removed from each end - surface by their own repulsive coulomb force ( i.e. self - emission ) .  * b ) *   in the opposite process , i.e. by lowering the temperature from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric state , the onset of the spontaneous polarization attracts screening charges from the surrounding , because usually those transient electric fields are far above the electrical breakdown limit of any material , including the ferroelectric sample itself , if one should consider this to happen in space .  * \n c ) *   reversal of the spontaneous polarization takes place , for example , by applying an external electric field ( @xmath19kv / cm is usually sufficient ) , being either alternating or pulsed . \n thus , during a hysteresis loop measurement two polarization reversals occur per cycle . in a complete reversal of the intrinsic spontaneous polarization , \n the new bound polarization charges on each end - face of the sample have the same polarity as the previous screening charges . \n this makes the associated transient electric fields even stronger than those appearing in the first two cases mentioned before . \n the result is finally a complete rearrangement of the old screening charges , giving rise to a more pronounced dynamical behaviour , depending on the conductivity of the sample and other factors . \n finally , we mention in short a few other known effects , which occur when changing the polarization vector by @xmath20 , or , much more enhanced during phase transition , which afterall can be of relevance for similar phenomena with the predicted _ biological _ ferroelectrics . \n these are : the flow of pyroelectric current through the sample , which occasionally takes the form of spikes ( barkhausen pulses ) , similarly to the self - emission of energetic electrons , or , bursts of microwave radiation ( caspers , riege @xmath15 zioutas , 1988 ) . \n we also like to mention here the antiferroelectric state , which is possibly of not minor importance . \n this is a peculiar polarized state , since it consists of quasi infinite many 180@xmath21 domains of opposite alignment each , which does not require screening charges . \n however , the transition ferroelectric@xmath22antiferroelectric gives also rise to a similar dynamical behaviour as for the mentioned paraelectric@xmath22ferroelectric phase transition . \n we like to focus now on a very specific family of hydrated ferroelectric crystals , with the widely investigated potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate ( k@xmath23fe(cn)@xmath243h@xmath25o ) , in short kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) , taken to be a representative case . \n we think that this type of ferroelectricity might serve as a model configuration in biology , with emphasis given to the microtubules , which no doubt play a fundamental rle in cell s functioning . \n in fact , these subcellular constituents have attracted the recent years the particular interest of biophysicists . \n microtubules have been predicted to posses oriented dipoles , assuming ferroelectric phase , which appears to be optimal for microtubule signaling and assembly / disassembly ( sataric et al . , 1993 , tuszynski et al . , 1995 ) . \n such processes are obviously of basic importance . in the light of previous work ( mavromatos and nanopoulos 1997,1998 ) , relating the ferroelectric properties to the appearance of mesoscopic quantum - coherent states in internal regions of the microtubule cylinders , playing the rle of ( thermally isolated ) electromagnetic cavities \n , ferroelectricity may also be important for quantum mechanical aspects of microtubular arrangements in the cell . \n specifically , it was suggested in [ mavromatos and nanopoulos 1998 ] that ferroelectricity in the dimer medium , strengthens isolation of the ` cavity regions ' , thereby leading to a larger probability for the coherent states to form and live long enough , so as to transport information and energy across the microtubular arrangement . \n the rle of the surrounding water molecules for the ferroelectricity in the dimer medium was emphasized .    in this latter respect \n we now mention that the interesting property of kfct is the origin of its ferroelectricty . \n in fact , the alignment of the water molecules by the surrounding crystalline structure ( @xmath26 ) causes the measured macroscopic spontaneous polarization @xmath27mc / m@xmath9 , which is compatible with the known microscopic water dipole configuration in kfct ( helwig , klpperpieper , @xmath15 mser , 1978 ) . to be more specific , \n the onset of ferroelectric behaviour is connected with the ordering of the hydrogen - bonded water - molecules ( taylor , mller , hitterman , 1970 ) . \n thus , one is tempting to conclude from this particular ferroelectric crystal that a similar mechanism might be at work with the microtubules . \n indeed , a typical microtubular arrangement consists of a quasi solid cylinder of tubulin dimers , which are arranged in 13 arrays ( protofilaments ) . \n the interior of the microtubules , of cross - section diameter @xmath28 , is filled with water molecules , being ubiquitous in biology . \n the dimers ( of extent @xmath29 in the direction of the protofilament axis ) are believed to have unpaired ( mobile ) electric charges , which lead to electric dipole moments ( sataric _ et al . \n _ , 1993 , tuszynski _ et al . \n _ , 1995 ) . \n in ( mavromatos and nanopoulos , 1997 , 1998 ) it was further conjectured that there are thin layers in the interior of the cylinders , of a thickness ranging up to few atomic scales ( angstrms ) , fairly isolated from their environment , which operate as cavities sustaining mesoscopic quantum coherent modes . in this scenario , \n the importance of the water molecules lies in the provision of the necessary coupling with the quantized elecgromagnetic radiation in the cavity , via their electric dipole moments , so that : ( i ) coherent modes appear in the interior of the cavity ( dipole quanta ) ( del giudice _ et al \n . _ 1988 ) , and ( ii ) a coupling exists between these coherent modes and the dimer dipole quantum oscillation modes ( mavromatos , nanopoulos , 1997 ) . \n the latter leads to coherent solitonic modes along the protofilament dimer chains , which have been argued to be responsible for dissipationless energy transfer across the microtubule .    in view of the existence of the afore - mentioned hydrated ferroelectric compounds \n , we may now conjecture that such configurations favour an alignment of the water molecules ( actually , not necessarily only those inside the tube ) . \n then , the sofar speculated polar properties of microtubules , and their connection to quantum physics , might exist in reality . \n because of the importance of such a ferroelectric property for these subcellular constituents , the next step is to establish or exclude it experimentally . a suggested sensitive experimental method to confirm the predicted ferroelectric behaviour of microtubules is via the four probe ac impedance spectroscopy ( z(@xmath30 ) ) \n . this technique is based on the measuremnt of the ac voltage to current ratio using 4-electrodes ( figure 1a ) in a quite broad frequency interval ( the so called _ frequency domain technique _ ( figure 1b ) ) . \n the experimental set up for the ac impedance measurement of the microtubules in liquid suspension is shown in figure 2 . \n this method has been recognised already as a valuable tool in the study of similar electrochemical systems ( macdonald , 1987 ) . \n there are practical advantages of this technique compared to the more simple and old one working in the so called _ time domain _ , which applies either pulse or step source signals ( macdonald , 1987 , bottelberghs , 1978 ) . \n in fact , the expected ferroelectric contribution of the suspended microtubules to the measured impedance z(@xmath30 ) can only be observed in the higher frequency domain ( s. figure 1b ) . \n otherwise , low frequency electrochemical phenomena , being certainly present in such a liquid suspension of microtubules , complicate the whole measuring procedure , which will suppress the appearance of a ferroelectric component inside the sample .    in practice , \n working with a suspension of microtubules additional experimental modifications might well become necessary . \n thus , in addition to a conventional dc polarization for the z(@xmath30 ) measurement one can also apply a pseudo - dc polarization , in order to avoid quasi - static complex electrochemical phenomena due to the electrode s polarization coming from slow and heavy ion transport inside the sample . \n the onset of ferroelectricity can be identified due to a resonance - like response in the phase and the amplitude diagram of the impedance ( s. figure 1b ) . \n we thank j. albers for discussions and for providing us with information on hydrated ferroelectrics . this work is based on presentations by n.e.m . and k. z. at the workshop ` biophysics of the cytoskeleton ' , banff , alberta , canada , august 18 -

{"ContextTokens": 3359, "GeneratedTokens": 95, "SynthesizedBody": "during the last years , many scientists have scrutinized the world around us looking for regularities . \n one of the most recent findings is the fact that many real systems can be cast into a common topological structure , called complex networks @xcite . \n examples include biological @xcite social @xcite and technological @xcite systems that exhibit similar patterns of interconnections @xcite . \n they are characterized by the existence of key elements in the network which drastically reduce the average distance between all of them , the so - called small - world property @xcite . \n additionally , it turns out that for a large number of real - world systems , the probability that any given element ( node ) of the system interacts with ( is linked to ) @xmath0 other components , follows a power - law @xmath1 , with and exponent @xmath2 usually estimated between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n these networks have been termed scale - free ( sf ) networks . \n the above property was soon shown to be at the root of distinct behaviours when several dynamical processes are placed on top of sf networks . \n these are the cases of percolation and epidemic spreading processes , intensively studied during the last years due to their practical relevance in different applications and the availability of analytical treatments @xcite . \n the peculiar topological properties of the underlying network for these two processes lead to the absence of any percolation or spreading threshold in the thermodynamic limit , a previously well - established result for regular and random graphs . \n it is then natural to ask whether or not and to what extent the topology of complex networks influences the behaviour of other dynamical processes . in particular , for biological and other applications , it would be relevant to consider the nodes of a given network as nonlinear dynamical systems . \n the behaviour of an isolated generic dynamical system in the long - term limit can be described by stable fixed points , limit cycles or chaotic attractors @xcite . \n however , we have learned in recent years that when many of such dynamical systems are coupled together , the details matter . in this way , the study of networks with both dynamical and structural complexity might shed light on a number of relevant open problems where nonlinearity and spatial complexity coexist . \n dynamical complexity may manifest itself through self - organization , synchronization , the emergence of order , etc .    in this paper , we study the emergence of collective phase synchronization @xcite in scale - free networks and in simple topological configurations such as triangles , squares and pentagons with a variable number of internal connections , called network motifs . to this end , we study the model proposed by kuramoto several years ago and show how a large number of the system s constituents forms a common dynamical pattern , despite the intrinsic differences in their individual dynamics . on a theoretical level , we point out that the fitness for synchronization of network motifs correlates well with their conservation in the evolution of protein motifs @xcite , which might hint at new connections between graph theory , dynamics on networks and biological systems . \n in order to study how topology influences collective dynamics , we assume that each network s component is an oscillator and that each interacts with the others following the kuramoto model @xcite . \n this choice is due to the remarkable prestige achieved by synchronization as a cooperative phenomenon within nonlinear science and to the seniority , elegance and universality of this model . \n specifically , each node @xmath5 is considered to be a planar rotor characterized by an angular phase , @xmath6 , and a natural frequency @xmath7 . \n linked nodes interact with a coupling strength @xmath8 according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of neighbors of the rotor @xmath5 as given by the actual architecture of the underlying graph . for the present work , \n the natural frequencies and the initial values of @xmath6 have been randomly drawn from a uniform distribution @xmath11 with mean @xmath12 in the interval @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . \n synchronization occurs when @xmath8 exceeds a critical value , at which clusters of frequency - locked oscillators appear . \n this state represents the emergence of cooperation between network s constituents . \n the original kuramoto model corresponds to the simplest case of globally coupled ( all - to - all ) , equally weighted oscillators where the coupling strength @xmath15 to ensure that the model is well behaved in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . for this model and without any interaction , @xmath16 , \n the oscillators follow their own dynamics as determined by their natural frequencies and thus the system is unable to synchronize . \n however , as @xmath17 increases the population of rotors becomes more coherent and few oscillators form a small cluster of ordered ( synchronized ) states . \n if @xmath17 is further increased , the synchronized pack tends to recruit more and more oscillators and eventually the system settles into a unique and totally synchronous state . \n the onset of synchronization occurs at a critical value of the coupling strength , @xmath18 . \n the second - order phase transition is characterized by the order parameter @xmath19 which behaves when both @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 for @xmath23 being @xmath24 .    in order to study the dynamics of the model on top of complex heterogeneous networks , we first generated sf nets using the ba procedure @xcite . in this model , starting from a set of @xmath25 nodes , one preferentially attaches each time step a newly introduced node to @xmath26 older ones . \n the procedure is repeated @xmath27 times and a network made up of @xmath28 nodes with a power law degree distribution @xmath1 with @xmath29 and average connectivity @xmath30 builds up . \n this network is a clear example of a highly heterogenous network in that the degree distribution has unbounded fluctuations when @xmath20 . \n we have performed extensive simulations of the model @xcite through numerical integration of the equations of motion eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) . in the case of random sf networks \n the global dynamics of the system is qualitatively the same as for the original kuramoto model . \n the phase diagram of the system is shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] for a network of @xmath31 nodes and several values of the average connectivity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the order parameter as given by eq.([eq2 ] ) . \n starting from small values of the coupling strength , the interactions do not overcome the tendency of each rotor to oscillate according to its individual dynamics . in this state , \n the behaviour of the system is completely incoherent and no synchronization is achieved . \n this picture persists until a certain critical value @xmath34 is crossed . at this point \n some elements lock their phase and a cluster of synchronized nodes comes up . \n this constitutes the onset of synchronization . beyond this value \n , there are several groups or clusters within which the nodes are either synchronized and locked in phase or still governed by their intrinsic dynamics and thus in an asynchronous state . \n the first groups add to @xmath33 and it departs from zero as @xmath8 is increased beyond @xmath34 . \n finally , after further increasing the value of @xmath8 , more and more nodes cluster around the mean phase and the system eventually settles into a completely synchronized state where @xmath35 .    on the other hand , fig . \n [ figure1 ] also provides evidence that the critical point at which synchronization is attained in these sf networks is not zero @xcite . \n this is more clearly appreciated if one eliminates the dependency observed in the figure of the parameter @xmath33 on the average connectivity of the network @xmath36 . \n if in eq.([eq1 ] ) the term @xmath8 is substituted by @xmath37 , the @xmath36-dependency is avoided and all curves in fig . \n [ figure1 ] collapse into a single one , showing a critical coupling strength @xmath38 signaling that even for large values of the average connectivity , @xmath34 is not equal to zero . \n additionally , finite - size scaling analysis @xcite shows that the transition remains of the second - order type as for the case of fully connected networks . \n let s now turn our attention to small geometrical structures known as motifs @xcite instead of looking at the whole network . \n these structures can be defined as graph components which are observed in a given network more frequently than in a completely random graph with identical @xmath39 . triangles and rectangular loops are among these graph components , also known as cycles . \n they are important because they express the degree of redundancy and multiplicity of paths among nodes in the topology of the network and reveal the existence of hierarchical levels . \n hence , the extension of the study of synchronization phenomena to motifs is also relevant . \n we have computed for all motifs up to @xmath40 nodes the probability , @xmath41 , that synchronization occurs . \n this probability is an increasing function of @xmath8 , and is calculated for each @xmath8 by randomly drawing the values of the natural frequencies @xmath7 from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath13 . \n starting from @xmath42 , one averages , for every @xmath8 , over many realizations of @xmath7 and computes the relative number of simulations where synchronization is accomplished , @xmath41 . \n we define @xmath43 , which varies from motif to motif , as the value of @xmath8 beyond which @xmath44 . \n the lower @xmath43 is for a motif , the better it synchronizes . in fig.[figure2 ] , we have represented @xmath41 as a function of @xmath8 for several motifs . \n the simplest case of the dimer ( @xmath45 in the table ) can be deduced analytically . using the same notation as in eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) , here we have :    @xmath46    to solve these equations , we introduce the new variables ,    @xmath47    thus , @xmath48 is the phase difference between the rotors , @xmath49 is the difference in the natural frequencies and @xmath50 is a dimensionless constant equal to twice the ratio @xmath51 . from eq.([eq3 ] ) we obtain ,    @xmath52    the integration of eq . \n ( [ eq7 ] ) leads to three solutions depending on the value of @xmath50 . \n the three distinct results of the integral in eq . \n ( [ eq7 ] ) indicate a different functional behaviour of the system when @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and when @xmath55 . \n in fact , @xmath54 is the critical point . in consequence , from the definition of @xmath50 in eq . \n ( [ eq5 ] ) , the critical coupling of this system corresponds to    @xmath56    recalling that the @xmath57s are drawn from a uniform probability distribution in the interval @xmath13 with a mean equal to zero , i.e. , @xmath58 , we have that the synchronization condition reduces to @xmath59 . \n the probability @xmath41 is then equal to @xmath60 , for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 . \n thus , for the dimer we have @xmath64 . for the other motifs , @xmath41 \n has been calculated numerically by means of a @xmath65-order runge - kutta method . \n the results are summarized in fig.[figure2 ] for several motifs ( see also table  [ table1 ] below ) .    from fig . \n [ figure2 ] , one realizes that for a fixed motif s size , the way in which connections are established determines the synchronization threshold of that motif configuration . \n for instance , configurations @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 correspond to motifs made up of four oscillators with a variable number of connections among them . however , their @xmath43 are quite different . \n this indicates that the details of the local and internal connections matter . in particular , we observe that the higher the interconnection between motif s constituents , the lower @xmath43 . \n we now show how the present study may provide useful hints to a better understanding of several experimental observations in biological systems . \n recent advances in network analysis and modeling have provided a promising approach to understanding basic biological organization @xcite . in this \n context , quantitative evidence has been recently reported @xcite that in _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ , the proteins organized in definite cohesive patterns of interaction , and these patterns themselves , are conserved in the evolution across species in a substantially higher degree than those that do not participate in such specific motifs . \n a second finding @xcite is that the conservation of proteins in distinct topological motifs correlates with their interconnectedness . \n these observations take place in the context of activities occurring within a living cell and which no doubt , are of extreme complexity . \n non - linear dynamics prevails at this level of organization , where units that interact according to simple rules can generate unexpected complex patterns @xcite . on a theoretical level \n , one may hypothesize that the observed persistence across evolution is due to some mechanism aimed at optimizing the cooperation between neighboring nodes \n . a first approach would then be to see if the same structures favor the synchronization as a cooperative phenomenon . \n table 1 summarizes the results found in @xcite and the values of @xmath43 for the kuramoto s model in the same motifs . \n it is surprising the existence of a possible correlation between conservation and fitness for synchronization of network motifs . \n namely , the lower @xmath43 , the higher the natural conservation rate . from table  [ table1 ] , one observes that : @xmath69 @xmath70 , for the chain - like motifs ; @xmath71 @xmath72 , for motifs ordered in increasing degree of complexity , i.e. , when one can go from the lower configuration @xmath73 to next one by adding a new link arbitrarily ; and @xmath74 @xmath75 , when interconnectedness between motif constituents increases . \n this may indicate that motifs displaying an improved fitness to develop cooperative activities are preserved across evolution with a higher probability . \n the results here obtained for topological motifs may be seen on a more general basis concerning the architecture of real biological and social networks . \n it is known that for most of these networks , the probability of finding cycles ( motifs ) in their structure is higher than that expected from a completely random graph with the same connectivity distribution . for social and biological networks , friendship or business relationships and natural selection \n seem to be at the origin of such cycles . from this perspective \n , one may assume that these networks have been shaped during their evolution by some kind of optimization mechanism that improves on a local level their ability to develop cooperation . \n if a new link is created and afterwards it reveals as not beneficial , then it is removed at later times .    in summary \n , we have studied the synchronization of kuramoto s phase coupled oscillators for the cases of scale - free networks and motifs . the results obtained indicate that the architecture of random sf networks allows synchronization at a small value of the coupling strength @xmath8 . \n additionally , motifs with high interconnectedness show the lower synchronization thresholds . moreover , the results presented here for the kuramoto s model hold for other non - linear dynamical systems , including chaotic oscillators @xcite . \n our results then lead to a twofold conclusion . on one hand \n , they suggest that non - linear mechanisms may be key ingredients for the understanding of the evolution of networks at a local scale . on the other hand , \n as recently unraveled for protein and other biological networks , the real topology of the systems under analysis is worth taking into account @xcite . \n finally , we point out that the kind of models studied here together with the spatial complexity of the underlying net is relevant for cell biology . \n a recent example can be found in the discovery that an ultradian clock ( oscillator ) shapes genome expression in the yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1439518240967, "RequestID": "b5de4f25f653017369a90cb2781ab9c4a8006b25", "TotalTokens": 3454}
{"ContextTokens": 3501, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "the idea to cool matter with light can be traced back at least 80 years @xcite , but not until the invention of the laser viable proposals and experimental work has started . the greatest influence on further research in this area had the technique of doppler cooling of atomic gases suggested by hnsch and schawlow @xcite , which has lead to the extremely successful field of ultracold dilute atomic gases @xcite . in another approach for laser cooling , \n anti - stokes processes in multilevel systems have been employed . \n proof of principle experiments for this type of laser cooling have been carried out with @xmath0 gas @xcite and a dye - solution @xcite . \n more recently , anti - stokes laser cooling has allowed for the laser cooling of solid state materials , as rare - earth doped glasses @xcite . \n cooling down to 150k starting from ambient temperature could be realized in such systems @xcite .    in our work \n , we are examining laser cooling of an alkali - noble buffer gas mixture at very high pressures typically around a few hundred bar by means of collisional redistribution . as with the cooling of solids \n , this method involves the cooling of macroscopic ensembles of matter . \n redistribution of atomic fluorescence is most widely known in the context of magnetooptic trapping of ultracold atoms , where this mechanism is a primary cause of trap loss processes @xcite . in the long investigated field of room - temperature atomic collisions , redistribution of fluorescence is a natural consequence of line - broadening effects from collisional aided excitation @xcite . in theoretical works , \n berman and stenholm proposed in 1978 laser cooling ( and heating ) based on the energy loss or gain during collisionally aided excitation of atoms @xcite . \n experiments that used alkali vapor and moderate buffer gas pressure below one atmosphere observed a heating for blue detuned radiation @xcite , but the cooling regime was never reached .    in our experiment laser cooling by collisional redistribution \n is investigated in a mixture of hot atomic rubidium vapor and several hundred bar of a buffer gas , where the collisionally broadened linewidth approaches the thermal energy @xmath1 in frequency units . \n a scheme of the described laser cooling approach is sketched in figure 1 , where the variation of the rubidium @xmath2 ground state and the @xmath3 excited state versus the distance from a noble gas perturber atom is indicated in a binary collision quasimolecular picture . during a collision between a rubidium and a noble gas atom , the rubidium electronic d - line transition can be transiently shifted into resonance with an otherwise far red detuned laser beam , which enables collisionally aided radiative excitation @xcite . to achieve cooling \n , we typically work with detunings of 10 - 20 nm to the red of an atomic resonance , where excitation is energetically only possible with the support of a collisional process , and the excitation rate is strongly dependent on the rate of collisions .        the duration of a collision and the excited state lifetime are clearly resolved ( @xmath4ps compared to 27ns ) , so after an excitation , spontaneous decay occurs most likely at larger distances between the collision partners and thus closer to the unpertubed atomic resonance frequency . on average \n the emitted photon is blue shifted relatively to the incident wavelength . \n the rubidium atoms undergo frequent cycles of collisionally aided excitation and spontaneous decay , and provided that the emitted photons can leave the sample , the collision partners loose kinetic energy and will be cooled . \n the typical energy that can be removed from the reservoir in a cooling cycle is of order @xmath5hz at t=500k , corresponding to a factor 20000 above the typical energy difference @xmath6 removed by a fluorescence photon in usual doppler cooling of dilute rubidium atomic gases .    experimentally , we have in earlier work demonstrated relative cooling of a rubidium - argon mixture by 66k and of a potassium - argon mixture by 132k , both with an argon buffer gas pressure near 200bar @xcite . the achieved cooling power approaches 100mw , and the achieved temperature drop is limited by the thermal conductivity of the gas . \n the partial pressure of the buffer gas exceeds that of the alkali vapor by five orders of magnitude , and correspondingly it are the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of the buffer gas that determine the induced temperature change and the temperature flow from a local heat sink in the gas . \n accordingly it is favourable to use a buffer gas with low thermal conductivity to achieve a large temperature gradient and a low local minimum temperature in the gas . on the other hand , for the purpose of actually transferring the cooling power to another cooling load which should not be directly exposed to the laser radiation , \n the exact opposite is a good choice . \n here we present experimental results where we used as buffer gas helium , the noble gas with the highest thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity . \n helium has in both parameters roughly an order of magnitude higher values than argon , the buffer gas used in our previously published results @xcite . \n the present paper describes spectroscopic measurements and initial redistribution cooling results using helium as a buffer gas . \n we are aware that the achieving of larger temperature drops in helium - based buffer gas systems will most likely require the use of thermally isolated all - sapphire cells . \n moreover , we review earlier experiments obtained with rubidium - argon buffer gas mixtures .    in the following \n , section2 describes the used experimental setup and measurements of the buffer gas broadened sample . \n further , section3 describes results on redistribution laser cooling and section4 gives conclusions . \n a scheme of the used experimental setup is shown in fig.2 , see @xcite for a detailed description . in brief , the present experiment is carried out in a high pressure steel chamber , where optical access is provided by two uncoated sapphire optical windows . \n after ultra - sound cleaning and bake - out , the cell is filled with rubidium metal ( 1 g ampules ) and helium or argon buffer gas . \n the cell is heated to typically 500k , which yields a vapor pressure limited rubidium partial pressure of @xmath41 mbar , corresponding to a number density of @xmath410@xmath7@xmath8 , and the used noble gas pressure is typically around 200bar . as primary laser source for spectroscopy and cooling \n we use a continuous - wave titanium - sapphire laser system of 3w output power near the wavelength of the rubidium d - lines .    for spectroscopic characterization of the pressure broadened sample , \n a confocal detection geometry is used ( see also @xcite ) , to suppress scattered incident laser radiation and selectively detect fluorescence from the cooling beam region . \n figure3a gives a typical pressure broadened spectrum . \n the plot shows the total detected fluorescence yield versus the incident laser frequency in a region around the rubidium d1- and d2-lines ( at 377thz and 384thz , corresponding to 795 nm and 780 nm respectively ) . \n the lineshape is asymmetric , with an increased absorption amplitude on the blue wing of the line for the here shown case of the use of helium as a buffer gas . the large pressure broadening enables to efficiently excite the rubidium atoms at the large detuning values of order @xmath9 ( corresponding to 23 nm at t=500k ) as typically used in the cooling experiment . \n figure 3b shows spectrally resolved fluorescence spectra for exciting laser frequencies of 360thz and 401thz , corresponding to a red and a blue detuning respectively . in both cases , \n the scattered fluorescence is efficiently redistributed towards the d - lines center . while for the former case the emitted fluorescence has ( in average ) higher photon energies than the incident radiation , \n which we expect to lead to cooling of the gas sample , in the latter case the emitted fluorescence has lower photon energies than the exciting optical beam , for which heating is expected . \n provided that no additional heating processes occur , we from energy conservation expect a cooling power in the sample of @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the incident laser power and @xmath12 the absorption probability in the gas for an incident laser frequency @xmath13 . \n further , @xmath14 is the centroid frequency of the emitted fluorescence . \n the frequency dependence of the optical density follows in lowest order the fluorescence spectrum shown in figure 3a and on resonance reaches a measured maximum value of about 4.5 . \n the expected cooling power , according to eq.1 , versus the laser frequency is shown by the connected red crosses in figure 5a . \n for a red detuning of the laser light of 10 - 20 nm from resonance the expected cooling power for the here investigated helium - rubidium gas mixture is in the order of 5 mw . \n this is significantly lower than in results obtained for the case of an argon buffer gas in earlier measurements of our group @xcite , for which the obtained cooling power was roughly an order of magnitude higher ( see connected red crosses in fig.5b ) at comparable laser power . besides of the lower rubidium vapor pressure for the shown data set \n , we also attribute this to the different quasi - molecular potentials of the rb - he and rb - ar pairs , which result in a lower absorption for far red detuned radiation for the rb - he case . \n to obtain evidence for an actual temperature change of the gas inside the cell , we use a thermal deflection spectroscopy technique @xcite , see fig.4 . \n the cooling laser beam induces a local temperature change in the gas , which in turn changes the refractive index of the gas . \n we detect this change of the refractive index profile with an off - resonant probe laser beam , in this case a helium - neon laser at 632 nm . the induced change of the refractive index @xmath15 versus temperature can be approximated as @xmath16        the deflection of the probe beam along the beam path is accordingly given by @xmath17 the cooling beam has a @xmath18 profile with beam radius @xmath19 and experiences an absorption coefficient @xmath20 . \n for a heat transport mainly in the radial direction ( we assume a long cell and that the beam focal radius is much smaller than the absorption length ) , and assuming that the cooling beam removes heat with a rate following its intensity distribution , the temperature distribution can be determined from the beam deflection using : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the transverse offset between cooling and probe laser beams . for the refractive index of the rb - he mixture at the 632 nm probe wavelength a value n@xmath41.0070(3 ) for helium at 200bar \n is used @xcite , where the quoted uncertainty is basically determined by the accuracy of the pressure measurement . \n the temperature gradient for the given situation can be modelled using from a heat transfer model @xcite . after a cooling time @xmath23 , \n the expected temperature gradient profile is @xmath24 . \n \\label{eq : four2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath19 the beam radius ( 1 mm for both cooling and probe beam ) , @xmath26 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath27 is the cooling power . \n the connected blue crosses in figs.5a and 5b show the measured deflection angle for helium and argon buffer gas respectively as a function of the cooling - laser frequency . for red detuning \n the probe beam is deflected towards the cooling beam , which indicates cooling , while the probe beam is deflected away from the cooling beam when the gas is locally heated . with the thermal deflection technique for both measurements cooling \n is observed only when the laser frequency is detuned approximately 10thz lower than one would expect from the redistribution of the fluorescence . \n the reason for this can be residual heating , which could be due to a small quenching cross section of excited - state rubidium atoms under the here present high buffer gas pressure . \n direct measurement of the lifetime of the excited 5p rubidium levels under 200 bar helium buffer gas confirm the natural lifetime of 27ns within an experimental uncertainty of 5ns @xcite . \n the here observed shift could be explained by an average decrease of the excited state lifetime of the rubidium 5p state due to quenching by roughly 1ns . despite the use of high purity buffer gas ( we typically use helium and argon buffer gas of purity 6.0 ) \n , we can not exclude that residual impurities , for example by a small nitrogen admixture , result in a corresponding reduction of the lifetime due to the high number of collisions the rubidium atoms undergo , typically several 10000 within a natural lifetime . \n quantitative measurements of the obtained temperature profile induced by the cooling laser beam have been carried out for the case of the rubidium - argon mixture , see ref.@xcite . here \n the lateral offset between the cooling and the probe laser beam was scanned . \n the red dots fitted with the black line show corresponding deflection data , obtained in such a transversal scan , which is a measurement for the transverse temperature gradient . \n the blue line shown in the figure is the result of a numerical integration of the corresponding deflection data following eq.4 . \n the used parameters for this measurement were a cooling laser frequency of 365thz , 1 mm cooling and probe beam diameters respectively , and 90% optical absorption in the 1 cm long cell . \n the obtained temperature drop in the beam center is 66(13)k , which is attributed to be limited by thermal conductivity of the argon gas in the thermally not isolated cooling volume . \n the dashed blue line is the temperature profile obtained from a theoretical heat transport model from which a cooling power of 87(20)mw can be derived . \n we expect that the temperature drop can be increased by depositing the available cooling power into a smaller volume , as can be achieved with a gas of higher optical density . \n we have investigated collisional redistribution cooling in both rubidium - argon and rubidium - helium gas mixtures . the observed cooling performance is , due to both the smaller thermal conductivity of the argon buffer gas and a blue asymmetry of the spectra in the case of rubidium - helium pair , generally more favourable in case of the use of argon as a buffer gas , at least for the present experimental condition of a gas cooling within the laser focus alone . \n cooling limitations from the large thermal conductivity of the buffer gas can however be avoided , when cooling of the complete cell is achieved , which requires the use of all ( sapphire- ) glass cells to suppress heating from wall absorption of scattered fluorescent radiation . to avoid condensation of the alkali atoms at the cell walls at low temperatures , \n we have started to investigate mixtures of molecular gases , which can be gaseous at room temperatures , and noble gases . \n promising candidates for a molecular redistribution cooling ( besides the alkaline - earth monohydrides , for which doppler laser cooling has already been demonstrated @xcite , are e.g. ethylene or co@xmath28-gas . \n future applications of redistribution laser cooling can include the supercooling of gases below the homogeneous nucleation temperature @xcite and optical chillers @xcite . \n zander , c. and drexhage , k.  h. , `` cooling of a dye solution by anti -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                                 as indicated in table @xmath26 , the @xmath22 and @xmath21 values are different for each cavity type , which increase with increasing cavity type . for the @xmath19 cavity , \n the quality factor is equal to @xmath27 and for the @xmath20 is @xmath28 . also according to table @xmath26 , the resonance wavelength of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .    by applying a single mode optical field to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities \n , we can demonstrate that cavities resonate with @xmath31 degrees phase difference . normalized transmission spectrum profile for both of @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavity types are depicted in figure @xmath32 . according to the figure @xmath33 , it is observed that at wavelength @xmath34 , the transmitted electric field through @xmath19 cavity has a positive value while the transmitted electric field through @xmath20 cavity has a negative value . \n we employed this transmission characteristics of the cavities to propose ultra - fast all optical cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates . \n the resonant optical fields within the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities experience a @xmath35 radian phase difference by applying a gaussian pulse with @xmath34 central wavelength . \n the obtained phase difference can not be retained through propagation in @xmath9 due to the material impaction . \n then , the phase difference changes from @xmath35 radian to about @xmath36 ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) at the output . to compensate this phase difference reduction \n , we applied the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity with a @xmath2 radian extra phase . according to the observed gaussian output pulses \n , we can see that the proposed structure operate at very high speed ( @xmath13 ) as illustrated in figure @xmath39 . in figure @xmath33 \n , one can observe that the resonance wavelengthes of cavities blue shift by increasing the applied voltage . \n where , a wavelength tunable range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 has been achieved by the applied voltage increasing from @xmath42 to @xmath39 @xmath43 . \n figure @xmath44 shows the optical intensity of signals with and without the extra phase through the structure . \n figures @xmath45 and @xmath46 show evolution of the phase difference of cavities from @xmath31 to @xmath47 through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , for without the extra phase case . \n however , in the case of extra phase application ( @xmath50 ) , figures @xmath51 and @xmath52 illustrate the evolution of the optical fields amplitudes for the cavities through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , as it is observed the phase difference evolution reach to @xmath53 in the output of structure . with comparing figures @xmath54 and @xmath55 one can demonstrate that @xmath31 @xmath38 phase difference can be obtained in output , which is useful for realization of the claimed tunable optical logic gate . \n to design a cnot optical logic gate , we used two @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities in @xmath0 with square lattice of air rods . \n we applied an input signal to the @xmath19 cavity with phase of @xmath56 as input for the cnot gate and another input signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity with input phase of @xmath57 as the control signal for the gate . \n where , the field amplitude of control and input signals are equal . when the control field is set in zero @xmath58 logic level , with no signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity , the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable reduction in its amplitude , as depicted in figures @xmath59 within temporal range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 . however , when the control field is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the reached pulse to the output of the gate is inverted of the input signal as depicted in figures @xmath59 from @xmath63 to @xmath60 . \n briefly , one can claim that no variation in the signal pulse amplitude is produced without applying any control signal . \n however , by applying a control signal , a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the input and control signals , which results in a destructive interference at the output and disappearing of the output signal referred as the low @xmath58 logic level . as illustrated by figure @xmath64 , the input of @xmath19 cavity is considered as the input port and the input of @xmath20 cavity as the control input of the cnot gate . \n the central wavelength of the both input pulses was the same at @xmath34 . \n as explained in above , figures @xmath59 exhibits the cavities responses with gaussian input pulses application for performing all logical cases of the truth table for the cnot logic gate . as an alternative view \n , one can consider the performance of the illustrated structure as an xor gate , due to the wavelength and field amplitude sameness of the applied input and control signals . here \n , the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xor logic gate is calculated as @xmath5 .      in order to realize an xnor gate \n , we should utilize three input signals where each of them is applied for one of three cavities created in the @xmath0 . here , there are two @xmath19 cavities to apply the input signals of the logic gate and one @xmath20 cavity for applying the control signal . for the xnor gate , \n always , the control field is set in high @xmath62 logic level . \n when the input signals are set in low @xmath58 logic levels , without applying any input signal to any @xmath19 cavities , the applied control signal to the @xmath20 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable variation in its amplitude , as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within temporal range of @xmath66 to @xmath61 . \n however , when any of the input signals is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the received pulse to the output of the gate becomes zero , as depicted in figures @xmath65 from @xmath67 to @xmath66 . as the last case , when both of the input signals are set in the high @xmath62 logic level , interference of them with the control field cause in emerging an output pulse in the high @xmath62 logic level as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within the range of @xmath63 to @xmath67 . \n as the same as xor , the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xnor logic gate is obtained as @xmath68 . in this work , \n we have considered full width at half maximum ( @xmath69 ) of the applied gaussian signals equal with @xmath70 . \n where , we have calculated the bit rate limit of @xmath7 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 for temporal performance of the simulated logic gates . \n then the proposed gates could demonstrate acceptable response for the gaussian input pulses with @xmath69 value of @xmath76 , temporally . \n thus , it is reasonable that data flow in the proposed logic gates can be enhanced to ultrahigh rates of @xmath77 , approximately . in this section \n , we demonstrated the logic gates operation with minimum value of the applied voltage at the central wavelength of @xmath34 . according to the figure @xmath33 we simulated operation of the gates at both extreme wavelengths of the achieved @xmath78 tunable range . \n thus , the designed tunable logic gates based on the electro - optic property of the substrate material show suitable characteristics . also , we would mention that one can design optical tunable logic gates with employing only @xmath19 or @xmath20 cavities by applying different voltages for each of the cavities . \n the electro - optic property of the substrate material of the @xmath0 cavities is deployed in optical tunable cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates functions achievement . \n where , we applied gaussian pulse signals at the central wavelength of @xmath40 as input signals for @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities . \n where , the resonance wavelength of the cavity can reduce from @xmath40 to @xmath41 by increasing the applied voltage to the each cavity . at any wavelength within the tunable range \n , a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the cavities output signals . in summary , for retaining this phase difference at the output of the @xmath9 structure , as the logic gate output , we got need for an extra phase difference @xmath79 between input and control signals of the logic gate . also , by temporal simulation of the designed logic gates , we demonstrated an ultra - fast logic operation and show their high potential as an appropriate candidate for applications such as tunable optical integrated circuits and optical processors . \n akihiro , f. ; takasumi t. _ opt . \n exp . _ * 2014 * , _ 22 _ , 4466 -

range for one incident angle at the same time , which is advantageous since part of the reflectivity and most of the bragg scattering resulting from the crystalline order in the polymer solution can be collected without changing the instrument settings . \n the data shown below in this manuscript were taken on figaro for two incident beam angles of 0.8@xmath8 and 1.4@xmath8 , taking data for 10 s and 60 s , respectively . \n the chopper speed was set to 1135 rpm with a phasing of 12.5@xmath8 , 21@xmath8 and 45@xmath8 for the second , third and fourth chopper . \n this settings result in a wavelength resolution of 7.0 % ( fwhm of the gaussian equivalent ) . \n the beam defining slits were set to a width and height of 40 mm and 0.338 mm for the source slit and 25 mm and 0.108 mm for the sample slit . a detailed description of the instrument figaro as well as the standard data reduction can be found in ref . \n figure [ fig : refl ] , left panel , depicts the neutron reflectivity of a 20 % solution of f127 in deuterated water taken on the reflectometer figaro at the ill , grenoble , france . \n neutron reflectivity of the sample measured in the crystalline phase ( left panel ) . \n the right panel depicts raw data taken on figaro with the scattered intensity plotted versus wavelength and scattering angle . ] \n the data are corrected for the the incident beam spectrum and the background is subtracted using the standard data processing software tool cosmos @xcite , available on the instrument . \n the reflectivity of both incident angles is shown after stitching them together . \n in addition to the region of total external reflection visible at small q values ( below 0.1 nm@xmath9 ) two bragg - reflections are found for data taken at 25 @xmath10 and with the sample in contact to the surface covered with ots . \n the first reflection is located at q=0.37 nm@xmath9 and corresponds to a d spacing of 16 nm . assuming a cubic close packing of the micelles at the interface @xcite the lattice parameter of the fcc structure is 29.5 nm and the two bragg reflections can be identified as ( 111 ) and ( 222 ) . \n a detailed discussion of the static arrangement of f127 micelles close to surfaces with different surface energies can be found in ref . \n @xcite . the right panel in figure [ fig : refl ] \n depicts the scattered intensity plotted versus wavelength and scattering angle , as collected on figaro . \n the intensity for an incident beam angle of 1.4@xmath8 is shown without any correction . \n the horizontal streak at 2.8@xmath8 marks the specular reflected intensity , which is shown corrected and extracted in the left panel . \n the high intensity at wavelength around 0.85 nm and a scattering angle of 2.8@xmath8 refers to the specular component of the ( 111 ) bragg reflection . \n the strong off - specular scattering , diagonal streak , confirms a highly correlated roughness in the micellar crystal . \n the weak diagonal streaks also visible in the intensity map are related to small angle scattering from the micellar crystal and are only visible since a relaxed resolution , divergence , is used on figaro parallel to the sample surface in order to gain in flux . for a more detailed discussion of the off - specular and gracing incidence small angle scattering from static micellar crystals we refer the reader to ref . \n in addition to the data taken with the sample in contact to the ots coated silicon wafer the read circles represent the reflectivity in contact with the piranha treated one . \n a huge difference in the intensity of the ( 111 ) bragg reflection is clearly visible . \n note , the measurement with the sample in contact to the piranha treated surface was taken for a shorter time resulting in worse statistics and representing the quality of data achievable in the measurement time specified above . in this article , we focus on the specular intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection for the sample exposed to an oscillatory shear force with a frequency of 1 hz and as a function of deformation or strain . \n the intensity , depicted in figure [ fig : osc ] , has been extracted from the detector pictures by integrating the scattered intensity in a certain solid angle and wavelength range , marked by the black box in figure [ fig : refl ] , right panel . \n + figure [ fig : osc ] depicts the result in a graph where the storage and loss modulus are plotted together with the peak intensity , top and bottom panel , respectively . \n three regions can be distinguished . at small \n strain values the storage modulus is larger than the loss modulus , implying a dominantly elastic behavior of the micellar crystal . in this region \n we find a much lower intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection with the sample in contact with the piranha treated silicon surface as compared to the oxide and ots covered surfaces . \n this fact indicates a surface induced ordering and is in line with previous studies @xcite . at strain values of about 1 % , \n the loss modulus starts increasing and the storage modulus starts slowly decreasing . at the same time , the intensity of the bragg reflection starts to increase for the piranha surface and to decrease for the other surface . above about 5 % deformation , the loss modulus becomes larger than the storage modulus . \n this indicates that the sample shows a more liquid - like behavior . \n at the same time the intensities of the bragg reflections remain unchanged , which can be explained by sliding of subsequent layers of micelles parallel to the solid surface . \n finally , at large deformations above 1000 % there is a difference in storage and loss modulus of more than one order of magnitude and the intensities of the bragg reflections at the different surfaces becomes almost the same . \n this indicates that for large stress values the influence of the interface on the local ordering becomes less important as compared to the influence of the shear forces . \n we note that the cone - plate distance is 0.1 mm in the center of the cone and the cone angle 1@xmath8 . comparing this to the penetration depth ( depth \n at which the neutron beam is attenuated to 1/e ) of the neutron beam which is on the order of some tens @xmath11 it is clear that the rheometer in this configuration is not sensitive to the surface induced changes revealed by neutron reflectivity . \n stress , storage and loss modulus plotted together with the intensity of the bragg reflection versus shear strain . ] \n our results demonstrate that close to the interface the anisotropy imposed by shear competes with that resulting from the presence of the solid boundary . \n the transition from elastic to viscous shear can be observed in the changes of the crystal bragg peak intensity . \n the technique presented in this manuscript opens new possibilities for the study of the near surface properties of complex liquids . by evaluating the full three dimensional data taken on time of flight instruments it is possible to retain the near surface structure in liquids spanning length scales from nm up to @xmath1 m with in -

mid inclination . \n according to @xcite , the absolute magnitude of dwarf novae is given as a function of its orbital period ,    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and p mean the absolute magnitude of dwarf novae in @xmath32 at the maximum of the normal outburst , and the orbital period in the unit of hours , respectively . \n unfortunately , we have no information about the orbital period of 2qz 0219 . \n instead , we settle for using the obtained superhump period as @xmath22 . \n this prescription is fairly valid because there is enough evidence that the difference between the superhump period and orbital period is only a few percent . \n in addition , the absence of an eclipse during the whole superoutburst indicate that 2qz 0219 is not a high inclination system . \n hence , we can safely use the above equation in order to estimate a distance to the object . with a little algebra , \n a plausible distance to 2qz 0219 lies in 370(+20 , -60 ) pc . \n this distance should be checked by other methods in future . \n high speed ccd photometry has revealed that su uma - type dwarf novae show changes of the superhump period during the superoutburst . \n most su uma - type dwarf novae show a decrease in their superhump periods as the superoutburst proceeds , presumably due to the shrinkage of the disk radius , or to a natural consequence of mass depletion from the disk @xcite . \n recently , it has turned out that several su uma - type dwarf novae including wz sge - type stars increase the superhump period with time . \n figure 7 represents period @xmath10 @xmath20 diagram for su uma - type stars . as for the cause of increasing superhump period \n , @xcite has given an insightful suggestion that the radius of the accretion disk at the outburst maximum is related to an increase or decrease of the superhump period . \n if the accretion disk is spread out well beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , where an eccentric mode sets in , the eccentric mode can propagate beyond the 3:1 resonance radius because there exists plenty mass in the outer region of the accretion disk during the superoutburst . \n if the argument by @xcite is correct , we can naturally explain why the increasing period of superhumps is @xmath33 seen among wz sge - type stars and su uma stars with large amplitudes . \n in the case of 2qz 0219 , taking into account the results of negative @xmath20 derivative and the above mentioned suggestion by @xcite , the radius of the accretion disk was not so large at the superoutburst maximum , at most , as much as the 3:1 resonance radius . \n thus , the superhump period variation for 2qz 0219 behaves as the `` textbook '' su uma - type dwarf novae . in order to test the validity of uemura s implication , \n hydrodynamic simulation should be performed . \n the present photometric observations of 2qz 0219 allowed us to confirm a new member of su uma - type dwarf novae by detecting superhumps . \n the best estimated superhumps period of j0219 was 0.081113(19 ) days = 116.8 min , placing 2qz 0219 near the lower edge of the period gap . in conjunction with our observations and the asas-3 archival data , the plateau stage of the superoutburst lasted at most 20 days . \n the amplitude of the superoutburst exceeded 5 mag , slightly larger than ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae but within the normal range . \n an estimation of the recurrence time of the superoutburst yielded @xmath1 346 @xmath10 462 days . \n we can roughly determine the distance to 2qz 0219 to be 370(+20 , -60 ) pc . \n the resultant @xmath25 diagram , together with the above results , led us to the conclusion that 2qz 0219 is a new member of a prototypical su uma - type dwarf nova . \n we are grateful to many vsnet observers who have reported vital observations . \n we would also express our gratitude to g. pojmanski for providing invaluable data of asas-3 observations . \n this work is supported by a grant -

{"ContextTokens": 2786, "GeneratedTokens": 265, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past years the dominant explanation for the large mass to light ratios inferred for galactic and meta - galactic systems , that these are embedded within massive dark matter halos , has begun to be challenged . \n direct detection of the dark matter particles , in spite of decades of extensive and dedicated searches , remains lacking . \n numerous alternative theories of gravity have appeared ( e.g. teves of @xcite , f(r ) theories e.g. @xcite ) mostly grounded on geometrical extensions to general relativity , and leading to laws of gravity which in the low acceleration regime , mimic the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) fitting formulas e.g. @xcite . \n similarly , @xcite have explored mond not as a modification to newton s second law , but as a modified gravitational force law in the newtonian regime , finding a good agreement with observed dynamics across galactic scales without requiring dark matter . \n recently @xcite have constructed an @xmath5 extension to general relativity which in the low velocity limit converges to the above approach . \n a generic feature of all such modified gravity schemes is the appearance of an acceleration scale , @xmath2 , above which classical gravity is recovered , and below which the dark matter mimicking regime appears . \n this results in a general prediction ; all systems where @xmath6 should appear as devoid of dark matter , and all systems where @xmath7 should appear as dark matter dominated . \n it is interesting that no @xmath6 system has ever been detected where dark matter needs to be invoked . on the other hand \n , the latter condition furnishes a testable prediction in relation to the orbits of wide binaries . for test particles in orbit around a @xmath1 star , in circular orbits of radius @xmath8 \n , the acceleration is expected to drop below @xmath9 for @xmath107000 au@xmath11 . \n this provides a test for the dark matter / modified theories of gravity debate ; the relative velocities of components of binary stars with large physical separations should deviate from kepler s third law . \n seen as an equivalent newtonian force law , beyond @xmath127000 au the gravitational force should gradually switch from the classical form of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and the orbital velocity , @xmath15 , should no longer decrease with separation , but settle at a constant value , dependent only on the total mass of the system through @xmath16 . under modified gravity theories , binary stars with separations beyond 7000 au should exhibit `` flat rotation curves '' and a `` tully - fisher relation '' , as galactic systems in the same acceleration regime do . \n we apply this test to the binaries of two recent catalogues containing relative velocities and separations . \n the two catalogues are entirely independent in their approaches . the first one , @xcite , comprises 280 systems from the _ hipparcos _ satellite , while the second , @xcite , identifies 1,250 ones from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . \n details can be found in @xcite . \n the newtonian prediction for the relative velocities of the two components of binaries having circular orbits , when plotted against the binary physical separation , @xmath8 , is for a scaling of @xmath17 , essentially following kepler s third law , provided the range of masses involved were narrow . in a relative proper motion sample however , only two components of the relative velocity appear , as velocity along the line of sight to the binary leads to no proper motion . \n thus , orbital projection plays a part , with systems having orbital planes along the line of sight sometimes appearing as having no relative proper motions . \n a further effect comes from any degree of orbital ellipticity present ; it is hence clear that the trend for @xmath17 described above , will only provide an upper limit to the distribution of projected @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 expected in any real observed sample , even if only a narrow range of masses is included . \n one should expect a range of measured values of projected @xmath18 at a fixed observed projected @xmath8 , all extending below the newtonian limit , which for equal mass binaries in circular orbits gives @xmath19 . \n further , over time , the orbital parameters of binaries will evolve due to the effects of galactic tidal forces and dynamical encounters with other stars in the field , specially in the case of wide binaries . \n to first order , one would expect little evolution for binaries tighter than the tidal limit of 1.7pc , and the eventual dissolution of wider systems . \n a very detailed study of all these points has recently appeared , @xcite . \n these authors numerically follow populations of 50,000 @xmath1 binaries in the galactic environment , accounting for the evolution of the orbital parameters of each due to the cumulative effects of the galactic tidal field at the solar radius . also , the effects of close and long range encounters with other stars in the field are carefully included , to yield a present day distribution of separations and relative velocities for an extensive population of wide binaries , under newtonian gravity . \n it is found that when many wide binaries cross their jacobi radius , the two components remain fairly close by in both coordinate and velocity space . \n thus , in any real wide binary search a number of wide pairs with separations larger than their jacobi radii will appear . finally , \n @xcite obtain the rms one - dimensional relative velocity difference , @xmath20 , projected along a line of sight , for the entire populations of binaries dynamically evolved over 10 gyr to today , as plotted against the projected separation on the sky for each pair . \n the expected keplerian fall of @xmath21 for separations below 1.7 pc is obtained , followed by a slight rise in @xmath20 as wide systems cross the jacobi radius threshold . \n @xmath20 then settles at rms values of @xmath22 . \n this represents the best currently available estimate of how relative velocities should scale with projected separations for binary stars ( both bound and in the process of dissolving in the galactic tides ) under newtonian gravity . \n we see that all we need is a large sample of relative proper motion and binary separation measurements to test the newtonian prediction for the rms values of the 1 dimensional relative velocities of @xcite , and to contrast the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 predictions for the upper envelope of the @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 distributions . \n in the @xcite catalogue wide binaries are identified by assigning a probability above chance alignment to the systems by carefully comparing to the underlying background ( and its variations ) in a 5 dimensional parameter space of proper motions and spatial positions . \n we keep only binaries with a probability of non - chance alignment greater than @xmath25 . \n the binary search criteria used by the authors requires that the proposed binary should have no near neighbours ; the projected separation between the two components is thus always many times smaller than the typical interstellar separation . \n we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 values reported . \n although the use of _ hipparcos _ measurements guarantees the best available quality in the data , we have also removed all binaries for which the final signal to noise ratio in the relative velocities was lower than @xmath28 . \n we are left with a sample of 280 binaries , having distances to the sun within @xmath29 in pc . \n the data show a perfectly flat upper envelope in a @xmath18 vs. projected @xmath8 , @xcite . \n the average signal to noise ratio for the data is 1.7 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 0.83 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the distribution to the real underlying upper limit for the sample , results in 3 @xmath30 as our estimate of the actual physical upper limit in @xmath18 . \n the sloan low mass wide pairs catalogue ( slowpokes ) of @xcite contains a little over 1,200 wide binaries with relative proper motions for each pair , distances and angular separations . \n also , extreme care was taken to include only physical binaries , with a full galactic population model used to exclude chance alignment stars using galactic coordinates and galactic velocities , resulting in an estimate of fewer than 2% of false positives . \n this yields only isolated binaries with no neighbours within many times the internal binary separation . \n again , we use the reported distances to the primaries to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 values reported by @xcite , to obtain a sample of 417 binaries . \n the upper envelope of the distribution of @xmath18 from this catalogue does not comply with kepler s third law . as was the case with the _ hipparcos _ sample , \n the upper envelope describes a flat line , as expected under modified gravity schemes . \n the average signal to noise in @xmath18 for the @xcite catalogue is 0.48 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 12 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the complete distribution to the real underlying upper limit gives the same @xmath33 as obtained for the @xcite _ hipparcos _ catalogue . \n figure ( 1 ) shows the rms value of the one - dimensional relative velocity difference for both of the samples discussed . \n the error bars give the error propagation on @xmath26 and @xmath32 . \n we construct @xmath20 by considering only one coordinate of the two available from the relative motion on the plane of the sky . \n thus , each binary can furnish two @xmath20 measurements , which statistically should not introduce any bias . \n indeed , using only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 or both for each binary , yields the same mean values for the points shown . \n the small solid error bars result from considering an enlarged sample where each binary contributes two @xmath36 measurements , while the larger dotted ones come from considering each binary only once , and do not change if we consider only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 . \n the series of small @xmath37 interval data are for the _ hipparcos _ catalogue of @xcite , while the two broader crosses show results for the @xcite sdss sample . \n the solid curve is the newtonian prediction of the full galactic evolutionary model of @xcite for binaries , both bound and in the process of dissolving . \n note that the results of this simulation deviate from kepler s law for @xmath8 larger than the newtonian jacobi radius of @xmath38 , whereas the discrepancy with the observed samples also occurs at much smaller separations . even considering the large error bars , where each binary contributes only one @xmath20 value \n , we see eight points lying beyond 1@xmath39 , making the probability of consistency between this prediction and the observations of less than @xmath40=@xmath41 . \n we obtain a constant rms value for @xmath20 of 1 @xmath30 , in qualitative agreement with expectations from modified gravity schemes . \n the vertical line marks @xmath42 ; we see the data departing from the newtonian prediction outwards of this line , and not before . \n the two independent catalogues , each using different sets of selection criteria , each perhaps subject to its own independent systematics , are consistent with the same result , a constant horizontal upper envelope for the distribution of relative velocities on the plane of the sky at an intrinsic value of 3 @xmath431 @xmath30 , extending over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath8 , with a constant rms @xmath20 value consistent with 1 @xmath430.5 @xmath30 . \n this supports the interpretation of the effect detected as the generic prediction of modified gravity theories . \n the solid curve gives the rms values for one dimensional projected relative velocities as a function of projected separations , for the dynamical modelling of large populations of wide binaries evolving in the galactic environment , taken from @xcite . \n the same quantity for the data from the catalogues analysed is given by the points with error bars ; those with narrow @xmath37 intervals being from the _ hipparcos _ sample of @xcite , and those two with wide @xmath37 intervals coming from the sdss sample of @xcite ] \n we identify a critical test in the classical gravity / modified gravity debate , using the relative velocities of wide binaries with separations in excess of 7000 au , as these occupy the @xmath0 regime . \n we present a first application of this test using the best currently available data . \n results show constant relative rms velocities for the binary stars in question . \n this is quantitatively inconsistent with detailed predictions of newtonian dynamical models for binaries evolving in the local galactic environment . \n our results are qualitatively in accordance with generic modified gravity models which explain galactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter . \n bekenstein , j. , 2004 , phys . \n d. , 70 , 3509", "StartTimeOffset": 1516512835890, "RequestID": "ea03e0396349410ccf834360328ffa59378c75f7", "TotalTokens": 3051}

an intermediate scale , where the wave function decays exponentially , although with less strength ; a short distance scale where the wave function is sizable .    in this work we consider the application of our method to anharmonic potentials of the form @xmath0 and discuss the accuracy of the approximations obtained in this framework in the case of quartic , sextic and octic potentials ( with @xmath1 respectively ) . \n the schrdinger equation in the present case reads @xmath2 \\psi_n(x ) = e_n      \\psi_n(x ) ,   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the anharmonic coupling , @xmath4 is the wave function of the @xmath5 excited state and @xmath6 its energy .    although one can not find the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq2 ] ) exactly , it is possible to determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath4 in the region of large @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) by substituting the ansatz @xmath9 into eq . \n ( [ eq2 ] ) . \n one obtains @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in the spirit of ref . \n @xcite we therefore write the wave function as @xmath12 where the exponential takes care of the correct behavior in the limit @xmath13 . notice that the quadratic term in the exponential does not affect the behavior at large distances , but is relevant at intermediate scales . \n the coefficient @xmath14 is written in terms of the frequency @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is an arbitrary parameter introduced by hand , see below ) . \n the reduced wave function @xmath17 is well - behaved and fulfills the equation . ] : @xmath18       \\xi_n(x ) = 0 . \n \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that no approximation has been invoked in the derivation of eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) . in the spirit of the linear delta expansion ( lde ) we now write eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) as @xmath19 \\xi'_n(x ) +       \\left[\\frac{2 m e_n}{\\hbar^2 } - \\frac{m \\to } { \\hbar } \\right ] \\xi_n(x )       = \\delta \\left\\ { 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu m}{n } } \\frac{x^n}{\\hbar } \\xi_n'(x )       \\right . \n \\nonumber \\\\     & - & \\left . \n \\frac{m^2 \\omega^2}{\\hbar^2 } x^2 \\xi_n(x ) - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu m}{n } }      \\frac{x^{n-1}}{\\hbar^2 } \\left(2 m \\to x^2 - \\hbar n \\right ) \\xi_n(x )      \\right\\ } . \n \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing this equation we have added a parameter @xmath20 , which was not present in eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) . for @xmath21 \n one recovers the original equation in eq . \n ( [ eq4 ] ) , while by taking @xmath22 one obtains the equation for the hermite polynomials , corresponding to a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath23 . \n notice that @xmath20 here is used as a power counting device : as a matter of fact we will treat the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) as a perturbation , although its size is not necessarily small , given the arbitrary nature of the parameter @xmath16 . \n an optimal choice of @xmath16 will make the right hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) small . \n we now write the following expansions : @xmath24 and substitute them in eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) , thus generating a hierarchy of equations , corresponding to the different orders in @xmath20 . \n such equations , which take the form of the equation for the hermite polynomials in the presence of a source term , can be solved sequentially up to some finite order . \n ( crosses ) . \n the dotted line is the result of ref . \n we use @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]     ( crosses ) . \n the dotted line is the result of ref . \n we use @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    given the perturbative nature of the approach that we are using , all the results , obtained to a finite order in perturbation theory , will display a dependence upon the arbitrary frequency @xmath16 . \n however this dependence is artificial since the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) does not depend upon @xmath16 . in the framework of the lde such dependence \n is minimized by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , i.e. by requiring that a given observable @xmath28 ( the energy , for example ) be locally independent of @xmath16 : @xmath29 in the present work we will enforce the pms by using the energy of the state as the observable . \n we need however to make an important point : by solving the equations corresponding to the different perturbative orders , we obtain two different estimates of the energy of the solution . \n one corresponds to the expansion in eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) , which was indeed used in @xcite ; the other corresponds to calculating the energy as the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the state described by the wave function obtained in eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) . \n this second choice turns out to provide a much better estimate of the energy : as a matter of fact , the energy calculated in this way not only contains contributions of higher order in @xmath20 ( the expectation value of the hamiltonian is bilinear in the wave function ) but it is also constrained by the variational principle ( at least for the ground state ) to lie above the exact result . \n therefore the pms applied to the expectation value of the hamiltonian corresponds , for the ground state , to the statement of the variational principle . \n this finding is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : compsandw ] , where we compare the energy of the ground and first excited states of the quartic aho  evaluated at order 15  to the average value of the hamiltonian  obtained using the wave function at the same order  as a function of @xmath16 .    in fig . \n [ fig : compsandwene ] , on the other hand , one can see the ground and first excited state energies of the quartic aho as a function of the perturbative order @xmath30 , obtained after application of the pms both to @xmath31 of eq . \n ( [ eq6a ] ) and to @xmath32 . \n the faster convergence to the correct result in the latter case is quite apparent . \n it is interesting that also in the case of the excited state the approach based upon the minimization of the average value of the hamiltonian seems to satisfy a variational principle . \n let us start by comparing the accuracy of our method with the one of ref . \n @xcite which is based on a variational improvement of the ordinary perturbation theory that gives a convergent sequence of approximations \n .     iterations . \n we use @xmath33 and @xmath34.,width=321 ]    in fig . \n [ fig : bellet ] we display the logarithm of the percentile error for the ground state energy of the quartic oscillator as a function of the approximation order . \n the error is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath6 is the `` exact '' value of the energy of the @xmath36-th state and @xmath37 the approximate estimation to order @xmath30 . \n the results using the present method ( crosses ) are compared to the outcome of the calculation in ref . \n @xcite , obtained after 47 iterations , for the ground state of the quartic aho ( the `` exact '' value of @xmath38 is taken from ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we now turn to compare our results with those of ref . \n @xcite , where the quartic , sextic and octic aho have been thoroughly analyzed with a method based on the generalized bloch equation . \n this method calculates iteratively certain matrix elements of the wave operator ( wave function expansion coefficients ) and then uses a renormalization technique .     and @xmath39 ;

{"ContextTokens": 2299, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "astrophysical noise introduces spurious spectroscopic signals that hinder the achievable radial velocity ( rv ) precision . \n such noise sources include starspots , plage / faculae , and magneto - convection , as well as oscillations , meridional flows , and potentially variable gravitational redshift @xcite . \n even magnetically quiet stars , which may lack the large amplitude signals induced by starspots , still exhibit inhomogeneities due to stellar surface magneto - convection , as long as they have an outer convective envelope . in the convective envelope , hot bubbles of bright plasma ( known as granules ) rise to the stellar surface where they eventually cool , darken and sink down into the intergranular lanes . \n as the plasma bubbles rise through the stellar photosphere , and therefore move towards the observer , they are blueshifted and as they disperse and fall downwards into the stellar interior they are redshifted with respect to the observer . since the granules are brighter and cover more surface area than the intergranular lanes the result is a net convective blueshift , which introduces asymmetries into the observed stellar lines ( the result is a ` c'-shaped absorption line bisector for solar - type stars ) \n . the exact ratio of granules to intergranular lanes is constantly changing as the granules evolve and interact with their surroundings , which in turn means the observed line asymmetries are constantly changing . for sun - like stars , the net result from these induced line changes \n is rv shifts at the level of several 10s of cm s@xmath0 @xcite . \n it is clear that an understanding of convection on solar - type stars , and indeed for all low - mass stars with convective envelopes , is essential if we are to reach cm s@xmath0 rv precision . in these proceedings \n , we report on our study of the effects of stellar photospheric magneto - convection using state - of - the - art 3d magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) solar simulations and detailed spectroscopic diagnostics . \n our goal is to disentangle and remove the convective induced rvs from stellar absorption lines . \n we simulate the solar photosphere using the muram code @xcite with a simulation box measuring 12 @xmath1 12 mm@xmath2 in the horizontal direction and 1.4 mm in the vertical direction . \n stokes-@xmath3 profiles for the @xmath4 fei absorption line were calculated for 190 simulated photospheric model snapshots using the spinor code @xcite . due to computational constraints , and a desire to breakdown the underlying physics , \n we parameterise the granulation signal using an @xmath5 80 minute time - series from the mhd simulation @xcite . \n this is done by separating the pixels , and their corresponding stokes-@xmath3 fe i 6302 @xmath6 absorption line profiles , within each snapshot based on continuum intensity and magnetic field limits . \n the result is four granulation component line profiles ( representing granules , non - magnetic intergranular lanes , magnetic intergranular lanes , and magnetic bright points ) that can be used to generate stokes-@xmath3 profiles with convection induced asymmetries as long as the appropriate filling factors are used ( see figure  [ fig:4comp_l ] ) . since granulation is naturally corrugated , observations at different line - of - sight ( los ) angles view different aspects of the granulation . as one views granulation toward the stellar limb the granular walls become visible and some of the intergranular lanes are obstructed by the granules . furthermore , once horizontal flows at disk center now have components along the los and hence the four component profiles experience both line shape changes and relative velocity shifts . to incorporate these variations \n , we incline the mhd snapshots from 0 - 80@xmath7 in 2@xmath7 steps and repeat the parameterisation at each inclination step ( computing the simulations beyond 80@xmath7 was computationally unfeasible ) . \n an example of the variations in the four component profile shapes is shown on the right side of figure  [ fig:4comp_l ] , whereas the rvs induced across the stellar limb due to the corrugated nature of granulation is shown in figure  [ fig : rv0dgr_l2 ] . \n this rv dependency on the convective blueshift term as a function of limb angle could be important for current methods of removing activity signals .    to ensure that our parameterization is representative of the mhd simulations we use the filling factors from the aforementioned time - series in conjunction with the four component profiles to reconstruct the average absorption line profiles from the simulation snapshots . \n the average relative error is measured to ensure the line shape of the reconstructed profiles matches the original profiles from the simulation . \n the velocity shifts due to granulation are also measured in each instance ( @xcite provides more details on this process for disk center  note this process remains the same for each inclination across the disk ) . for all inclinations \n the reconstructed profiles agree with the original profiles to better than 0.8% . \n the average rv residual ( the difference between granulation rvs from the original simulation and those from the reconstruction ) only varies from @xmath5 3 to -5 cm s@xmath0 on a 100 to 20 m s@xmath0 signal . as a result \n , we are confident that our granulation parameterisation is representative of the more computationally expensive mhd simulations . \n we used the granulation component filling factor distributions and relationships determined from the mhd simulations to generate new line profiles that are representative of those produced by the simulation itself . to begin \n , we randomly selected a granule filling factor based on the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) from the original time - series . from the mhd simulations we found a strong linear relationship between granules and non - magnetic intergranular lanes , and thus we used this relationship to then select the non - magnetic intergranular lane filling factor . \n unfortunately , there were no strong correlations between these two components and the magnetic components so the magnetic bright point filling factors were selected at random based on their cdf from the original time - series . \n finally , the fourth component ( magnetic intergranular lanes ) was determined by the fact that all four component filling factors must sum to one . \n kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and wilcoxon rank - sum tests were performed to ensure that the generated filling factors belong to the same population as that produced from the mhd simulation ( all components passed at all stellar limb angles , except the magnetic intergranular lanes at @xmath8 20@xmath7 , but this component contributes very little to the total profiles at these angles and thus this effect is likely negligible ) .    to simulate a sun - as - a - star model observation , we tiled a stellar disk with 12 @xmath1 12 mm@xmath2 regions , with the appropriate projected area , and randomly assigned each tile a newly generated line profile . \n note that stellar limb darkening was accounted for within the original simulations and therefore also in the four component line profiles ; however , we did linearly interpolate between stellar limb angles to correct for the odd inclinations and those inclinations greater than 80@xmath7 ( due to computational constraints , tiles between 80 - 90@xmath7 were all assigned a line profile based on the four components at 80@xmath7 \n note this effect is likely negligible due to the small projected area and heavy limb darkening in this region ) . once all the tiles were assigned an appropriate line profile we then integrated over the entire disk to simulate a model observation . \n this process was repeated 1,000 times to build up a statistically significant sample size to study . \n each observation is independent and therefore relates to the physical case where each observation was separated by at least one convective turnover timescale . in \n future work we aim to incorporate the effects of a non - zero exposure time . \n the disk - integrated line profiles and their line bisectors are shown in the left side of figure  [ fig : diskint_vasy ] . \n finally , we examined the sun - as - a - star disk - integrated line profiles for any correlation between line shape change or asymmetries and convection induced rv . to begin , we inspected numerous characteristics of the line bisector ( including bisector inverse slope , bisector curvature , velocity displacement , and bisector amplitude [ @xcite ] ) , as well as line depth and line width at various depths . \n we also investigated diagnostics that addressed the entirety of the line profile , such as bi - gaussian fitting and v@xmath9 @xcite . \n finally , we integrated the area under the line profile to create a proxy for photometric brightness . \n v@xmath9 and the proxy for photometric brightness produced the strongest correlations with rv and largest noise reduction ( determined by subtracting off the correlation and comparing the standard deviation of the rvs before and after ) , a @xmath5 50% noise reduction in total . \n a 50% reduction in convective noise meant the overall noise level was around 10 cm s@xmath0 in these quiet star simulations . \n the right side of figure  [ fig : diskint_vasy ] shows the excellent correlation between v@xmath9 and granulation induced rv . \n the next best correlations were with the line depth and bisector curvature , which are able to remove @xmath5 35% of the noise . \n the remaining diagnostics either remove less than 20% of the noise ( velocity displacement , bisector amplitude , equivalent width ) or actually result in an increase of the overall noise ( bisector inverse slope and bi - gaussian fitting ) .    these initial results indicate hope that we will be able to empirically measure the convective induced line shape variations and use them to remove the convective induced rvs in high precision studies . \n it is important to note that we are currently working on an updated version of the radiative mhd solar simulation ( with updated equation of state and opacities etc . ) to try to match the disk integrated line profile more closely with solar observations . \n initial results from the updated mhd simulation indicate there is a slight change in bisector shape and in some of the diagnostics , but strong correlations are still present and we anticipate similar overall results in noise reduction . we are also working to incorporate lower magnetic field strengths , additional sources of noise , finite exposure lengths , and the effects of planets . \n additionally , we plan to extend the simulations across a suite of stellar lines ( with a wide range of formation heights , absorption strengths , excitation and ionisation potentials ) and various spectral types ( m - f ) . \n simultaneously , we are also working to test these results observationally with the sun and with the highest precision stellar targets available with the overall aim to remove magneto - convective noise to a sub 10 cm s@xmath0 level in time for the espresso spectrograph to come online .", "StartTimeOffset": 1556032757552, "RequestID": "8ccc6bdd40e61975c8e9faa9f76e3c7ca17f6aaf", "TotalTokens": 2428}
{"ContextTokens": 2682, "GeneratedTokens": 128, "SynthesizedBody": "pulsars are steep - spectrum radio sources , with a `` typical '' spectral index of @xmath3 ( lorimer et al . \n for this reason , most large - area pulsar surveys have been done at relatively low frequencies , @xmath4mhz . however , at low frequencies and low galactic latitudes the contribution from synchrotron radiation ( with spectral index @xmath5 ) dominates the system temperature of a radio telescope , greatly reducing the sensitivity to most pulsars .    to search for pulsars along the disk of the galaxy , one should therefore consider using a relatively high frequency , @xmath6mhz ( @xmath7 cm ) . to search for _ distant _ pulsars along the galactic plane , one \n is virtually compelled to use high frequencies , because multi - path propagation of radio pulses through the inhomogeneous interstellar medium results in broadening ( `` scattering '' ) of intrinsically sharp pulses ( see fig . \n this effect , greatly reducing the detectability of pulsars , varies with frequency approximately as @xmath8 ( cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ) . \n the obvious drawback of a survey at 1400mhz is that , in addition to the long individual integration times required to maintain high sensitivity due to the reduced pulsar fluxes , the number of independent telescope pointings needed increases as @xmath9 . \n llll & jodrell bank & parkes & parkes + latitude range , @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + longitude range , @xmath14 & @xmath15  @xmath16 & @xmath17  @xmath18 & @xmath19 \n @xmath20 + center frequency ( mhz ) & 1400 & 1520 & 1374 + number of beams & 1 & 1 & 13 + integration time ( min ) & 10 & 2.5 & 35 + sample interval ( ms ) & 2.0 & 1.2 & 0.25 + bandwidth ( mhz ) & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + @xmath24 ( jy ) & 60 & 70 & 36 + @xmath25 ( mjy ) & 1.2 & 1.0 & 0.15 + pulsars found / detected & 40/61 & 46/100 & 440+/630 + + reference & clifton et al . \n & johnston et al . & \n this work +    despite this hindrance there are very good reasons for wanting to search the galactic plane : young pulsars will naturally be found close to their places of birth , viz . the galactic disk . while relatively rare , they are interesting for a variety of reasons , including the study of pulsar \n supernova remnant interactions , and the preferential display of rotational `` glitches '' , and increased likelihood of emission at x- and @xmath26-ray energies , which are of interest for studies of the internal dynamics , and cooling and emission mechanisms of magnetized neutron stars , respectively . \n also , to obtain an unbiased picture of the intrinsic galactic distribution of pulsars , rather than just of the local population , one must penetrate deep into the galaxy , i.e. , use high frequencies . \n only two large - area pulsar surveys had been carried out at 20 cm prior to the one described here . \n the surveys of clifton et al . \n ( 1992 ) and johnston et al . \n ( 1992 ) in the 1980s ( see table  1 ) were very successful at finding many pulsars , preferentially young and relatively distant .    in early 1997 \n a 13-element receiver package with very good system noise characteristics was installed on the parkes telescope . \n developed for surveying hi in the local universe ( staveley - smith et al . \n 1996 ) , it is also ideally suited for pulsar searching . \n we began collecting data for the survey in august 1997 . \n receivers for each of 13 beams are sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations . \n signals from each polarization of each beam are detected in 96 filters , each 3mhz wide , upon which they are added in polarization pairs , high - pass filtered with a cutoff of 0.2hz , integrated for 0.25ms , and 1-bit sampled before being written to magnetic tape with relevant telescope information , for off - line processing . \n the sensitivity of the survey to long - period pulsars , about 0.15mjy , is a factor of seven better than the previous parkes 20 cm survey ( johnston et al . \n 1992 ) , and we are even more sensitive to short - period pulsars , owing to the faster sample interval and narrower filters used ( see table  1 ) . figure  1_a _ shows the calculated sensitivity of the survey . \n note that the figure does not take into account scattering : according to it a pulsar like the crab , with period 33ms , but located across the galaxy , with @xmath27@xmath2pc , will be detectable with a minimum flux density of about 0.6mjy . \n as figure  4_b _ shows , such a pulsar will most likely not be detectable as a pulsed source almost regardless of strength . \n the 13 beam patterns ( each subtending a @xmath28 diameter ) are not adjacent on the sky ; rather , one central beam ( with the best sensitivity ) is surrounded by a ring of six beams separated by two beams - widths , surrounded in turn by a second ring separated by a further two beam - widths . \n we collect data by interleaving pointings on a hexagonal grid , resulting in complete sky coverage with adjacent beams overlapping at half - power points . \n each pointing covers an area about 0.6deg@xmath29 , resulting in sky coverage at a rate of 1deg@xmath29/hr , and the total survey area requires about 2700 individual pointings .    as of september 1999 we have collected and analyzed about 1200 independent telescope pointings , some 700deg@xmath29 , or 45% of the total . \n data reduction takes place in workstations in a manner similar to previous surveys ( e.g. , manchester et al . \n 1996 ) . figure  1_b _ shows the search - code output for the discovery of a binary pulsar . to date we have discovered 440 new pulsars , and have re - detected 190 known pulsars . because of the long integrations , some binary pulsars ( in particular millisecond pulsars ) have signal - to - noise ratios reduced , owing to doppler - induced varying spin periods . \n we therefore complement our standard search analysis with `` acceleration search '' reduction , recently begun . \n while we have discovered 10 new pulsars for every 1% of the survey area searched so far , it should not be concluded that we will amass a total of 1000 new pulsars . \n we began by surveying the regions closest to the galactic plane , which are richest in pulsars . in figure  2_a \n _ we see that we have already searched essentially the entire @xmath30 region , with a new - pulsar density , averaged over the entire longitude range , of slightly over 1/deg@xmath29 . \n clearly the density of pulsars drops dramatically for @xmath31 , which comprises much of the region yet to be searched . \n conversely in figure  2_b _ we see that , as a function of longitude , the region we have preferentially searched so far ( @xmath32 ) has the lowest pulsar density . accounting for these selection effects in some detail , we predict that the number of new discoveries for the entire survey should be somewhat over 600 . another estimate is derived from the number of pulsars previously known in the overall search area , 255 , and the number of ( re-)detections : these would suggest an eventual total of @xmath33 new objects . \n in fact we expect a total of about 700 pulsars to be discovered , after accounting for some further selection effects ( e.g. , so far we have not been complete in confirming new pulsar candidates down to the sensitivity level implicit in the calculations underlying figure  1_a _ ) . \n we have therefore already detected about 2/3 of all pulsars we will discover . \n manchester et al . \n ( this volume ) describe in some detail what is already known about many of the new pulsars . \n figure  3_a _ shows the distribution of dm for the newly discovered pulsars , and for comparison also shows that for previously known pulsars . \n qualitatively the distribution is as expected : we find pulsars predominantly with large dm , since our survey is by far the most sensitive ever to distant pulsars along the galactic plane ; on the other hand we find very few `` nearby '' ( @xmath34@xmath2pc ) pulsars , in part because selection effects ( e.g. , scattering ) preventing the detection of such pulsars in past surveys were far less important than for high - dm pulsars . \n the median dm for the new pulsars is about 400@xmath2pc , and we also see that there is a marked decrease in the number of objects with @xmath35@xmath2pc , with a maximum of about 1300@xmath2pc . naturally it is more difficult to find such highly dispersed pulsars , both because of the attending level of scattering , and reduced flux density due to large distance . but \n as we can see from figure  4_a _ , we do not in any case expect large numbers of pulsars in the galaxy to have @xmath36@xmath2pc .    a comparison of the period distributions for newly discovered and previously known pulsars ( fig . \n 3_b _ ) yields some surprises . \n the most obvious discrepancy is that we have not discovered a significant number of short - period pulsars ( only one with @xmath37ms ) . \n the parkes 70 cm survey ( manchester et al . 1996 ) , with a long - period sensitivity of @xmath38mjy and poorer time- and frequency - resolution than the multibeam survey , yielded 17 millisecond pulsars . assuming a spectral index of @xmath39 , 3mjy at 70 cm are equivalent to 0.3mjy at 20 cm  i.e. \n , we should be more sensitive to millisecond pulsars than that survey . \n one can not reasonably appeal to hypothetical larger spectral indices : edwards et al . \n ( this volume ) report on the very successful use of the multibeam data - acquisition system for finding millisecond pulsars in a survey at intermediate galactic latitudes and with short integration times . \n it is conceivable that strong scattering prevents us from detecting many millisecond pulsars with @xmath40@xmath2pc ; in any case we are still investigating this dearth of millisecond pulsar discoveries . \n a second surprise concerns the discovery of relatively many pulsars with long periods , @xmath41s . \n this may be due to surveys with shorter integration times not collecting data for many such pulse periods , coupled with the prevalence of `` nulling '' pulsars among those with long periods ; and to the effectiveness with which much local radio - frequency interference gets `` dispersed away '' in our search for high - dm pulsars .    in figure  4_a \n _ we plot the positions of the pulsars detected in the multibeam survey projected onto the galactic plane , according to the distance model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) . \n two things are immediately apparent : the previously known re - detected pulsars are located relatively nearby ( @xmath42kpc ) , while many of the newly discovered pulsars are very distant , with many beyond the inner - most spiral arm ; and many of the newly discovered pulsars seem to be located along spiral arms , particularly the two inner - most ones . regarding this last point , we do expect pulsars to be correlated with spiral arm locations , but we should be careful to consider potential biases in the distance model that will place pulsars preferentially in regions of high electron density . \n the multibeam survey is being remarkably successful at uncovering very distant pulsars . \n the dm - distribution of these pulsars , @xmath43 , together with measured scattering parameters ( cf . \n 4_b _ ) , and eventually faraday - rotation parameters , probing the interstellar magnetic field , should give us a more unbiased picture of the galactic distribution of pulsars , and add considerably to our knowledge of the interstellar medium .", "StartTimeOffset": 1562717263835, "RequestID": "713d5999fff414001ebb76ad0fca1165725e6c60", "TotalTokens": 2810}
{"ContextTokens": 4051, "GeneratedTokens": 211, "SynthesizedBody": "a support vector machine ( svm ) is a distinguishing classifier conventionally defined by a separating hyperplane . in other words , \n given labeled training data ( supervised learning ) , the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which classifies the unseen examples[1 - 2 ] . \n svm is not limited statistics or machine learning but can be applied in wide number of applications . \n svm proved to be the best classifier in different applications from handwritten digit recognition to text categorization . \n svm does nt have any effect on classification due to the curse of dimensionality . \n it works well with high dimensional data . \n literature survey witnesses that the support vector machines are the best classifiers for 2-class classification problems . \n the real time applications are not limited to binary classification but multiclass classification[3 ] . \n for example , to classify an astronomical object as a star , a galaxy or a quasar requires a multi - class classifier but not binary classifier . \n there are two major approaches in solving the n - class problem one is a single large optimization problem [ 4 - 5 ] , and the alternative is to decompose n - class problem into multiple 2-class problems . but solving a single large optimization problem will be expensive in terms of computational time and not suitable for practical applications . \n there are several algorithms based on the second approach like ovo(one - versus - one),ova(one - versus - all ) , dag(directed acyclic graph)[6 - 7 ] . in this paper \n we propose a new algorithm which decomposes the single n - class problem into multiple 2-class problems . and \n it requires less number of binary classifiers when compared with the above mentioned algorithms and gives a better accuracy too . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . \n the related work is discussed in section 2.the proposed approach is presented in section 3 . \n section 4 contains the experimental results and comparison of the proposed approach with the existing algorithms . \n finally , section 5 contains conclusion and future work . \n the learning task in binary svm can be represented as the following @xmath0    subject to @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the parameters of the model for total @xmath4 number of instances . \n + using lagrange multiplier method the following equation is to be solved ,    @xmath5 + the dual version of the above problem is + @xmath6 subject to @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 are known as the lagrange multipliers . + by solving this dual problem , svm will be found . \n once the svm model is built , the class label of a testing object z can be predicted as follows . \n + @xmath10 if @xmath11 z will be predicted as + class else -ve class . \n the simple approach is to decompose the problem of classifying n classes into n binary problems , where each problem differentiates a given class from the other n-1 classes [ 8 ] . in this approach , \n we require k = n binary classifiers , where the nth classifier is trained with positive examples belonging to class n and negative examples belonging to the other n-1 classes . \n when an unknown example is to be predicted , the classifier achieving the maximum output is considered as the best choice , and the corresponding class label is assigned to that test object . \n though this approach is simple [ 8 ] , it provides performance that is comparable to other more complicated approaches when the binary classifier is tuned well .      in this approach , each class is compared to every other class [ 9 - 10 ] . \n a binary classifier is built to differentiate between each pair of classes , while discarding the rest of the classes . \n this requires building n(n-1)/2 binary classifiers . \n when testing a new object , a voting is performed among the classifiers and the class with the maximum number of votes will be considered as the best choice . \n results [ 6,11]show that this approach is in general better than the one - versus - all approach . \n the n - class problem is decomposed into multiple 2-class problems in a binary tree structured manner . \n k - means clustering is used as a preprocessing step to get the rough estimation of similarity between the class labels . \n this will let us divide the class labels into two disjoint sets and build the svm for the root node . \n thereafter every node is divided at the mid point for creating disjoint sets . \n the order of the class labels is computed based on the sse . \n the least sse will be first in the list and the highest sse will appear last in the list . \n this way ( n-1 ) binary svms will be built , and hence needs only ( n-1)/2 svms evaluation to classify the unclassified record . \n this is better than the worst case ( n-1 ) of ova and n(n-1)/2 of ovo . at the same time , \n our experimental results show that the accuracy is comparable with ovo . \n but when cbts is compared with ova it shows a better accuracy with reduced training time and testing time . \n the algorithm for training and testing is illustrated below . \n input the training objects . \n add all the training objects to the root node . \n let the class labels are from 1 .... n + * preprocessing step : * divide the training objects i.e.the root node into two clusters / nodes ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) using k - means clustering ( centroid based ) . \n +    1 .   the objects will be adjusted to ( @xmath12 ) as positive class or ( @xmath13 ) as negative class based on the majority of their class labels from the two clusters . \n + 2 .   for ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) calculate the sse of all objects based on the same class labels and sort them in the ascending order . \n the sse is given by @xmath14 + 3 . \n for both ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) repeat + 1 . \n if the number of class labels of the node are two , construct the binary classifier and return . if the number of class labels are more than two + 2 . \n divide the each node exactly at the mid point , construct the binary svm and repeat this till we reach only two class labels .      1 . \n the test object should be evaluated on the root node the binary tree of svms . \n repeat : * if the value is positive traverse to the left node ( @xmath12 ) else to the right node ( @xmath13 ) . + * until we reach the leaf node . \n classify the test object into the class label of leaf node . \n +    * let s run through an example . \n * consider figure 1 , suppose if we have 8 classes , we first run k - means clustering with k=2 to divide the data objects according to their distribution . \n then , through the cluster distribution and based on the majority we get to know which class labels fall on one side ( positive ) and which ones on the other side ( negative ) . in the example shown , set @xmath12 \\{1,3,7 } belong to the positive class and set of rest of class labels , @xmath13 \\{4,6,8,2,5 } belong to the negative class \n . the order of class labels within the node will be in the ascending order of sse . \n we then build a svm model by constructing a binary svm between data objects belonging to @xmath12 as belonging to positive class and those belonging to @xmath13 as negative class . \n now , for the left child of the root node , sample space is all the data objects that belong to class labels in @xmath12 i.e. \\{1,3,7}. we divide exactly at the mid point ( remember , clustering is done at the first step only ! ) and hence make new @xmath12 and @xmath13 sets for this node . \n so , new @xmath12 is \\{1,3 } and @xmath13 is \\{7}. we now consider all data objects having class labels in @xmath12 as having positive class and all in @xmath13 as negative class and build a svm model . \n this svm model acts as left child of the root node .    this way we build the whole binary tree of svm functions recursively for both left and right nodes \n till we reach a leaf node . \n when an unseen object has to be classified , the search starts from the root node and then it moves on to the left or right based on the evaluation function value recursively till the leaf node and assigns the corresponding class label to the test object .            in figure 2 , the hyperplanes are shown for different class labels based on the above approach . \n the order of the construction of the hyperplanes will be based on the binary tree structure . \n we implemented the algorithm on twelve classification data sets and compared the training time , testing time and accuracy with ovo and ova . \n glass , iris , letter , mfeat - fac , mfeat - fou , mfeat - kar and mfeat - mor , pendigits , satimage , segment , shuttle , vowel are uci data sets and taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html . the detailed properties of the data sets are given in table i. for letter , shuttle and satimage dataset , a separate training and testing file was used . \n but , for the rest of all the data sets 2/3 part of data is considered for training and 1/3 is considered for testing . \n all the datasets were scaled to [ 0,1 ] and have been randomized ( similar class labels data will not appear together ) . in our implementation , we make use of radial basis function(rbf ) kernel and the range of value of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 to @xmath18 , c @xmath16 @xmath19 to @xmath20 . \n rbf kernel works best for any kind of problem [ 16 ] . in all the three approaches ovo , ova , \n cbts the best combination of @xmath15 and c is chosen from the above mentioned range so as to provide the higher accuracy and lower testing and training time [ 17 ] . \n all the computations are done on a computer with 1.60ghz intel i5 -

filter imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide - angle optical telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , united states , astronomical telescope survey . \n it has 6 class labels and only 5 features ( u , g , r , i , z ) are considered ( it has many ) . \n the data can be downloaded from sql interface on http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/search/sql.asp    the results are shown in table v for sdss data set . \n cbts outperforms both ova and ovo in the aspects of accuracy and training time with the best gamma and cost values . \n the size of the instances are varied from 30,000 to 75,000 . \n ova could nt build the binary classifiers when the data size is 75,000 because of scalability issue whereas ovo and cbts could build the required models with out any problem . \n hence cbts is scalable . and it gives a better accuracy with reduced training time . \n .the complete details of the data sets used in our implementation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n we propose a new algorithm cbts ( centroid based binary tree structured svm ) , a binary tree structure in which the root node contains all the class labels and is splitted based on the k - means clustering at the first step . \n and then the left and right nodes are recursively splitted into half till we have only two class labels . in this n-1 svms \n are required to construct but the required svms in ovo , ova are n(n-1)/2 , n respectively . \n the testing time for all ovo , ova , dag is linear on n i.e. o(n ) but for our algorithm it is o(log n ) as it needs only ( n-1)/2 classifiers to predict the class label for the test object . \n experimental results show that the accuracy of cbts is comparable with ovo approach and it out performs with ova both in accuracy and training , testing time . \n cbts also capable of handling large data sets , hence scalable . by using a more optimized approach of implementing cbts , testing time may further be reduced . instead of k - means \n clustering alternative partition techniques can also be explored at the root level . \n furthermore , a parallel / distributed version of our algorithm can be taken up as a future work . in our algorithm \n there are independent svm models that can be constructed simultaneously which results in reducing both training and testing time of cbts even further . \n we are thankful for the resources provided by the department of computer science and information systems , bits , pilani , k.k . \n birla goa campus to carry out the experimental analysis . \n c.cortes and v. vapnik . \n _ support vector network . \n 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emseptember 1995 , volume 20 , issue 3 , pp 273 - 297 v. vapnik . _ \n the nature of statistical learning theory_. ny : springer - verlag . \n k.crammer,y.singer , _ on the learnability and design of output codes for multiclass problems_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emproceedings of the thirteenth annual conference on computational learning theory , morgan kaufmann publishers inc . , san francisco , ca , usa,2000,pp.35 - 46 v.n.vapnik _ statistical learning theory_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emjohn wiley and sons , new york,1998 . \n y.guermeur , combining discriminant models with new - multi - class svms , 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4empatt.anal.appl.5(2002 ) 168 - 179 chih - wei hsu and chih - jen lin . \n _ a comparison of methods for multi class support vector machines_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emieee transactions on neural networks , vol \n . 13 , no . \n 2 , march 2002 abe , shigeo _ analysis of multi support vector machines_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emproc . \n international conference on computational intelligence for modelling control and automation ( cimca2003 ) , : 385 - 396 ryan rifkin , aldebano klautau , _ in defense of one  vs - all classification _ \n 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emjournal of machine learning research 5 ( 2004 ) 101 - 141 . \n _ another approach to polychotomous classification . technical report _ , \n 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em stanford university , 1996 . \n trevor hastie and robert tibshirani . \n _ classification by pairwise coupling . \n _ 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em advances in neural information processing systems , volume 10 . \n the mit press,1998 erin allwein , robert shapire , and yoram singer . _ reducing multiclass to binary : a unifying approach for margin classifiers_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em journal of machine learning research , pages 113141 , 2000    l.bottou , c. cortes , j. denker , h. drucker , i. guyon , l. jackel , y. lecun , u. muller , e. sackinger , p. simard , and v. vapnik . \n _ comparison of classifier methods : a case study in handwriting digit recognition_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emin international conference on pattern recognition , pages 77 - 87 . \n ieee computer society press , 1994 . \n s. knerr , l. personnaz , and g. dreyfus , _ single - layer learning revisited : a stepwise procedure for building and training a neural network_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em neurocomputing : algorithms , architectures and applications . \n springer - verlag , 1990 . \n _ another approach to polychotomous classification . technical report , \n department of statistics , stanford university,1996_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emavailable at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/reports/friedman/poly.ps.z u. krebel . \n _ pairwise classification and support vector machines_. 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4emadvances in kernel methods  support vector learning , pages 255 - 268 , cambrdige , ma , 1999 . mit press . \n chih - chung chang and chih - jen lin ._libsvm : a library for support vector machines . \n _ 1em plus 0.5em minus 0.4em acm transactions on intelligent systems and technology , 2:27:127:27 , 2011 . \n software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/  cjlin / libsvm", "StartTimeOffset": 1578136842857, "RequestID": "fe5e3343917326d742f713c221c1d51136d052ac", "TotalTokens": 4262}
{"ContextTokens": 2924, "GeneratedTokens": 235, "SynthesizedBody": "globular clusters are among the oldest objects in galaxies , and understanding the details of their formation and evolution can bring valuable insight into the early history of galaxies . \n one of the most interesting questions concerns the relation of globular clusters to the stellar halos of galaxies . at present \n , only a small fraction of halo stars are found in clusters . \n observations indicate however that the galactic halo has a clumpy structure ( majewski et al . \n 1996 , helmi et al . \n 1999 ) , and tidal streams surrounding globular clusters ( grillmair et al . \n 1995 , leon et al . \n 2000 ) have been detected . \n a significant fraction of the stellar halo might therefore have formed in compact stellar systems , although dwarf galaxies are also possible contributers . \n linked to this question is the determination of the initial mass function of globular clusters . \n the globular cluster system of the milky way as we observe it today is characterized by a gaussian distribution in absolute magnitudes , with mean @xmath2 and scatter @xmath3 ( harris 2000 ) . \n similar distributions have been found for old cluster systems in other galaxies ( kundu et al . \n in contrast , young massive clusters in interacting and starburst galaxies have power - law distributions over masses @xmath4 , with slopes close to @xmath5 ( whitmore & schweitzer 1995 , whitmore et al . \n if the globular cluster system of the milky way has started with such a mass - function , it contained many low - mass clusters which dissolve completely and cause a stronger enrichment of the stellar halo .    in this paper , we study cluster systems starting with gaussian or power - law mass - functions . \n we use analytic formulas for the lifetimes of star clusters and remove clusters with lifetimes smaller than a hubble time . the number and masses of surviving clusters \n are then compared with the milky way globular cluster system in order to determine the mass that must have been initially in the cluster system . \n this estimate is then compared with the mass of the stellar halo . \n the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we discuss the dissolution processes of globular clusters . \n section 3 describes the set - up of the cluster system and in section 4 we present the results . in section 5 \n we draw our conclusions . \n star clusters dissolve due to several processes : in the beginning the loss of gas out of which the cluster was formed and the mass - loss of individual cluster stars are most important . \n later clusters dissolve mainly due to two - body relaxation and disc or bulge shocks from the varying external tidal field . \n clusters are also affected by dynamical friction , which causes them to sink towards the galactic center where they are destroyed by the strong tidal field . \n we consider clusters moving in circular orbits and start our simulations after the initial gas is removed from the clusters and massive stars have gone supernova . \n hence , we are left with only two dissolution processes : two - body relaxation and dynamical friction . \n the lifetimes against two - body relaxation are obtained from a fit to the results of @xmath0-body simulations made by sverre aarseth and douglas heggie as part of the collaborative experiment ( heggie et al . \n they performed simulations of multi - mass , king @xmath6 clusters which moved on circular orbits through an external tidal field . \n figure 1 shows the half - mass times of their clusters as a function of the particle number @xmath0 . \n the best fit is obtained by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( giersz & heggie 1996 ) . \n the lifetimes are obtained by assuming that they are twice as large as the half - mass times . \n we note that the lifetimes of clusters in external tidal fields increase more slowly with the particle number than their relaxation times . \n it has been shown ( fukushige & heggie 2000 , baumgardt 2001 ) that this is a consequence of the finite escape time of stars from such clusters . as a result , \n lifetimes of globular clusters are smaller than previously predicted .      according to binney & tremaine ( 1987 , eq .  7 - 26 ) \n , the time it takes for a cluster with mass @xmath9 and initial galactocentric distance @xmath10 to sink to the galactic center is given by    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the circular velocity of the galaxy and @xmath13 is of order 10 . \n the milky way is modeled as an isothermal sphere with circular velocity @xmath14 km / sec . \n we adopt an age of @xmath15 gyr for the age of the galactic globular cluster system . \n cluster masses either follow a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath16 and width @xmath17 , or a power - law @xmath18 with slope @xmath19 . if clusters are distributed according to a power - law , lower and upper limits of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are chosen for the cluster masses . \n the lower limit has no influence on the final mass - function , since clusters with @xmath22 dissolve at all galactocentric radii in less than a hubble time . \n we study the evolution of star clusters between galactocentric distances 1  kpc  @xmath23  40  kpc . at each @xmath24 \n , we simulate the evolution of 200.000 clusters . \n we first calculate their dynamical friction time @xmath25 according to eq .  2 , and remove clusters with @xmath26 . for the remaining clusters , \n we calculate their tidal radius from the cluster mass and the galactocentric distance . \n we assume that the density distribution of a cluster follows a king @xmath6 profile , in which case the ratio of the half - mass radius of a cluster to its tidal radius is given by @xmath27 . \n we can then calculate the crossing times @xmath28 and the dissolution times of the clusters according to eq .  1 . \n if the dissolution time is smaller than a hubble time , a cluster dissolves completely , otherwise the final mass of the cluster is calculated according to @xmath29 i.e.  we assume a constant mass - loss rate . \n fig .  2 shows the evolution of the mass - function of globular clusters at two galactocentric radii . \n a gaussian initial mass - function stays everywhere close to the initial distribution . in the inner parts , the mean mass increases slightly due to the efficient destruction of low - mass clusters . in the outer parts , the distribution changes very little since \n only few clusters are destroyed . \n a power - law distribution shows a stronger depletion of clusters . in the inner parts \n , it evolves into a distribution which is very similar to the one obtained from a gaussian initial mass - function . \n the two distributions differ mainly at large galactocentric radii , where the power - law distribution leads to a mass - function with lower mean mass . \n but even at large radii , the power - law distribution evolves into a bell - shaped curve . \n fig .  3 compares the mean cluster masses with the observations of milky way clusters . \n the properties of galactic globular clusters show no strong variation with galactocentric distance \n . the mean cluster mass might be slighter larger around @xmath30 kpc , but the differences are small . \n independent of the starting condition , the final cluster systems match the milky way clusters for @xmath31 kpc fairly well . \n hence , the initial state can not be decided from observations of the inner clusters . in the outer parts , \n a gaussian initial distribution is close to the observations while a power - law mass - function produces a cluster system which has too many low - mass clusters . \n this could change however if elliptic cluster orbits are considered , in which case clusters are destroyed more easily due to the varying tidal field . \n in addition , undiscovered low - mass clusters could exist in the galactic halo , causing the mean cluster mass to be lower than observed . \n the fraction of clusters that survive after 12 gyr and the mass lost from the globular cluster system depend on the radial distribution of clusters . \n the number of observed globular clusters decreases as @xmath32 , at least for @xmath33 kpc ( harris 2000 ) . \n if we adopt the same distribution for the initial cluster system , we find that for a gaussian mass - function , @xmath34 of globular clusters survive over the whole range of distances studied ( 1 - 40 kpc ) . \n they contain 36  % of the mass that was initially in the cluster system . \n the corresponding numbers for a power - law distribution are 8 % and 25 % respectively . \n as expected much fewer clusters survive \n . however , since most of the dissolving clusters are of low mass , the mass - loss rates differ not very much . as a lower limit instead of @xmath35 , would decrease the mass fraction surviving in clusters to 3/4 of its original value . ] \n according to the mcmaster - database of globular cluster parameters ( harris 1996 ) , the galactic globular cluster system contains 132 clusters between 1 and 40 kpc . \n these clusters have a total mass of @xmath36 . \n the initial mass in the cluster system was therefore of order 1 to @xmath37 . according to suntzeff \n et al .  ( 1991 ) , the mass of the stellar halo between 4 and 25 kpc is @xmath38 . assuming a @xmath39 density law for the halo stars , the halo mass between 1 and 40 kpc turns out to be @xmath40 , which is an order of magnitude more than the mass of the globular cluster system in this distance range . \n hence , the majority of halo stars was not born in clusters . \n the evolution of the galactic globular cluster system under the influence of two - body relaxation and dynamical friction was studied . \n it was found that a gaussian initial distribution fits the present day galactic globular cluster system very well . \n a power - law initial distribution can not be ruled out however since it gives a good fit to the observations in the inner parts . \n the differences in the outer parts could vanish if additional destruction mechanisms are considered . \n furthermore , our knowledge of remote halo clusters might not be complete . \n we can not constrain the fraction of stars born in low - mass clusters with @xmath22 , since low - mass clusters dissolve completely even at the largest distances studied .    depending on the initial mass - function , only between 5 % and 10 % of the halo stars \n were born in globular clusters . \n this value is smaller than the fraction of stars formed in young star clusters in starburst and interacting galaxies , which seems to be close to 20 % ( meurer et al . \n 1995 , zepf et al . \n some of these young clusters might however be unbound , or become unbound due to the mass - loss of individual cluster stars . \n this could bring both values into agreement . \n i thank douglas heggie for a careful reading of the paper and comments . \n is supported by pparc under grant 1998/00044 . \n baumgardt , h. 2001 , mnras , in press , astro - ph/00120330 binney , j. , tremaine , s. 1987 , galactic dynamics , princeton univ .  press , princeton fukushige , t. , heggie , d.  c. 2000 , mnras,318 , 753 giersz , m. , heggie , d.  c. 1996 , mnras , 279 , 1037 grillmair , c.  j. , freeman , k.  c. , irwin , m. , quinn , p.  j. 1995 , aj , 109 , 2553 harris , w.  e. 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 harris , w.  e. 2000 , in globular cluster systems : lectures for the 1998 saas - fee advanced course on star clusters , in press heggie , d.  c.  et al . \n 1998 , in highlights of astronomy , vol . \n 11b , ed . \n j.  andersen , d.  reidel publ . \n dordrecht , p.  591 helmi , a. , white , s.  d.  m. , de zeeuw , p.  t. , zhao , h. 1999 , nature , 402 , 53 kundu , a.  et al . 1999 , \n apj , 513 , 733 leon , s. , meylan , g. , combes , f. 2000 , a&a , 359 , 907 majewski , s.  r. , munn , j.  a. , hawley , s.  l. 1996 , apj , 459 , l73 meurer , g.  r.  et al . \n 1995 , aj , 110 , 2665 suntzeff , n.b . , \n kinman , t.d . , kraft , r.p . \n 1991 , apj , 367 , 528 whitmore , b.  c. , schweizer , f. 1995 , aj , 109 , 960 whitmore , b.  c.  et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 1551 zepf , s.  e.  et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 752", "StartTimeOffset": 1592898220120, "RequestID": "f849b09b0bc37b2288f8dc95eb93b329a3344d2e", "TotalTokens": 3159}
{"ContextTokens": 3554, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "the idea of thermoacoustic tomography ( tct , sometimes also called tat )  @xcite can be briefly described as follows ( see figure  [ fig : tctsketch ] ) . \n a short pulse of radiofrequency ( rf ) electromagnetic waves is sent through a biological object heating up the tissue . \n it is known that the cancerous cells absorb several times more rf energy than the healthy ones  @xcite . as a result \n a significant increase of temperature occurs at the tumor locations causing a thermal expansion of cancerous masses pressing on the neighboring healthy tissue . \n the created pressure wave is registered by the transducers located on the edge of the object . \n assuming speed of propagation of these acoustic waves constant inside the object ( an assumption which is not always correct , but is satisfactory , e.g. for mammography ) , the signals registered at any transducer location are generated by the inclusions laying on a sphere centered at that location . \n in fact the measured data are the integrals of rf absorption coefficient @xmath0 over those spheres or , in other words , the spherical radon transform @xmath1 of the rf absorption coefficient @xmath0 . \n hence , to reconstruct the image one needs to invert the spherical radon transform . \n the spherical radon transform of @xmath0 is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the surface area on the sphere @xmath4 centered at @xmath5 .    in the definition \n we allow arbitrary set of centers @xmath6 and radii @xmath7 . \n however , from the dimensional consideration it is clear , that this mapping is overdetermined . \n the tomographic motivation suggests to restrict the set of centers to a surface @xmath8 ( the set of transducers locations ) , while not imposing any restrictions on the radii . in this paper \n we will deal only with the case of spherical acquisition ( i.e. the transducers are located on a unit sphere ) and from now on we will suppose @xmath9 . \n two different approaches have been used to derive exact inversion formulae for this case . \n fourier - bessel and spherical harmonic expansions result in solutions written as an infinite series for two and three dimensions respectively  @xcite . \n the tct analog of @xmath10-filtered backprojection inversion is derived in  @xcite @xmath11 as well as a filtered backprojection type version @xmath12 both formulas can be generalized to higher odd dimensions  @xcite . \n notice that , as one can expect for a codimension 1 radon transform in 3d , the formulas are local .    in section 2 we describe the numerical simulation of the data acquisition . the reconstruction algorithms based on the @xmath10-filtered backprojection formula  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and the filtered backprojection one  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) \n are discussed in section  3 . \n the region of reconstruction is the unit ball centered at the origin ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . \n all phantoms considered in the paper are sums of indicator functions supported in ellipsoids completely contained inside the unit ball . \n the transducers are located on the surface of the unit sphere . \n we parameterize the transducer location by two angles @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the the azimuthal angle in the @xmath15-plane and @xmath16 $ ] is the polar angle measured from the @xmath17-axis . \n since the spherical radon transform is linear , it is enough to create projections for phantoms with a single ellipsoid and then superimpose the projections . for a single ellipsoid the data measured at a fixed transducer location at a given moment ( i.e. for fixed @xmath18 ) is the surface area of a part of the sphere of integration cut by the intersecting ellipsoid . \n it can be expressed as a finite sum with terms of the form @xmath19 d{\\phi } \\label{eq : doubleint}\\ ] ] where each such term corresponds to a connected component of the intersection . here \n @xmath20 and @xmath21 parameterize the sphere of integration and are independent of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which parameterize the transducer location . \n the angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined by the intersection of the integration sphere and the phantom s ellipsoid . \n the cosines of these angles can be found from the solution of a quartic equation describing that intersection .    in the numerical results presented below the quartic equation \n is solved using the matlab built - in function  roots \" . by adding up these roots in an appropriate way we obtain the inner integral with respect to the polar angle @xmath26 in equation  ( [ eq : doubleint ] ) . \n the result is a function of azimuthal angle @xmath27 , which we will denote @xmath28 . \n depending on the location and parameters of the ellipsoid , @xmath28 might be either a smooth @xmath29-periodic function of @xmath27 , or a piecewise smooth one ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .    in the first case we compute its values at uniformly discretized locations on the interval \n @xmath30 $ ] and use the trapezoidal rule to compute the integral . for , numerical integration using \n the trapezoidal rule is accurate to @xmath31  @xcite . \n if , however , @xmath28 is only piecewise smooth on @xmath30 $ ] , then we locate the pieces of where it is smooth and use gaussian quadrature to integrate over each piece . \n once we have generated the projection data , we reconstruct the original indicator functions of the phantoms . the reconstruction algorithms \n are based on the @xmath10-filtered backprojection  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) or the filtered backprojection  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) . \n the integrals over the unit sphere in  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) are computed as double integrals with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath22 and the polar angle @xmath23 . \n the function to be integrated is periodic with respect to @xmath22 making the trapezoidal rule an appealing quadrature choice . \n integration with respect to @xmath23 is done by gaussian quadrature . \n the laplace operator is implemented through the matlab built - in function  del2 \" . \n the reconstructions were generated using matlab 5.0 .    in the results below \n the resolution is over a volume resulting in isotropic pixel dimension of . \n the algorithm is tested on the defrise phantom which consists of five thin ellipsoids symmetrically centered along the @xmath17-axis ( see fig .  [ \n fig : def2d ] ) . \n we numerate them from @xmath32 to @xmath33 starting with the lowest .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the data was acquired from the transducers located discretely over the sphere in the following way . \n the azimuthal angles of the transducer locations were uniformly discretized to @xmath34 points between 0 and @xmath35 . \n the polar angles of the transducer locations corresponded to @xmath36 gaussian nodes on the interval form 0 to @xmath29 , as described in the previous section . \n the radii of the integration spheres were uniformly discretized to @xmath37 points from 0 to 2 . \n the reconstruction was done by both methods : filtered backprojection ( fbp ) and @xmath10-filtered backprojection . \n +    the obtained results validate reconstruction formulas  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) and  ( [ eq : fbp ] ) ( see fig .  [ defrise ] ) . in both cases \n the defrise phantom has a good reconstruction everywhere except along the @xmath17-axis ( @xmath38 ) , where some noise is present which , while not always noticeable on reconstructions , is visible on the graphs . \n the reason for appearance of that noise is the correlation of numerical errors along that axis of phantom s symmetry and is discussed in section  [ subsec : errors ] . \n half - scan reconstructions were done using data from only the eastern hemisphere ( @xmath39 , @xmath36 ) or the southern hemisphere ( @xmath34 , @xmath40 ) . \n these hemispheres are highlighted in figure  [ fig : defpartialscan ] . \n the rest of the data has been zero - filled . \n +    -0.3 in    it is known  @xcite that in case of incomplete data one can expect to recover stably only certain parts of the image the rest of it being blurred out . \n namely some parts of the wavefront set of the image will be lost . for our phantom \n the singularities are jump discontinuities ( edges ) of imaged value @xmath0 across an interface @xmath41 ( a surface of an ellipsoid in 3d ) . \n the wavefront @xmath42 of @xmath0 in this situation is the set of pairs @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a point on @xmath41 , and @xmath45 is a vector normal to @xmath41 at @xmath44 . \n as it was shown in  @xcite using microlocal analysis , a point @xmath46 can be stably detected from the radon data , if and only if @xmath1 includes data obtained from a sphere passing through @xmath44 and normal to @xmath45 . in other words , one can see only those parts of an interface , that can be tangentially touched by spheres of integration centered at available transducer locations . \n the rest of the interface will be blurred . \n edges in the defrise phantom were reconstructed in figure  [ fig : defpartialscan ] as expected . when the data is collected from the eastern hemisphere \n there are enough spheres to touch tangentially all edges in the eastern hemisphere ( see fig . \n [ fig : def2d ] ) but none to do it in the western hemisphere . \n that is why the locations of the edges in the eastern hemisphere were correctly reconstructed while those in the western part were blurred . \n when the data is collected from the southern hemisphere there are enough spheres to touch tangentially all edges in the defrise phantom , hence all of them were resolved . \n from the geometric description above it is not hard to see that there may exist certain regions of reconstruction ( locations of @xmath44 , sometimes called audible zones ) where any possible pair @xmath43 belonging to @xmath42 is recognizable from @xmath1 . in our examples , \n when the data is collected from the eastern or southern hemisphere , these regions are the eastern and southern half of the unit ball correspondingly . \n notice that the image values were not reconstructed correctly , since part of the data was missing . however , certain iterative techniques allow one to improve substantially the image values in the audible zone  @xcite .      in early experimental work on thermoacoustic tomography , \n an approximate backprojection formula was used . \n it was written in analogy with the backprojection of regular radon transform and looked similar to equation  ( [ eq : rhofilt ] ) , except the missing weight factor @xmath47 . \n the composition of this operator with the direct radon transform is an elliptic pseudo - differential operator of order zero ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite . ) \n thus the locations and  strengths \" of image singularities are recovered correctly . \n however the values of the image function will not be recovered correctly . \n the obtained reconstructions validate the predictions correctly recovering locations of edges . \n the values of image functions are accurate near the center where but degrade slowly with distance from the origin , as expected . \n +    -0.3 in      as it was mentioned before , the reconstructions of defrise phantom have some noise along the axis of phantom s symmetry @xmath38 ( see figs . \n [ defrise ] , [ fig : defpartialscan ] ) . to discuss the reasons of appearance of that noise we consider reconstructions of some simpler phantoms consisting of indicator functions of a perfect ball . \n this allows us to compute the radon transform analytically , hence to exclude the errors in the data simulation . for every fixed @xmath48 \n , @xmath49 is a third order polynomial with respect to @xmath7 for @xmath50 and is zero for every other @xmath7 . filtered backprojection requires differentiating with respect to the radial variable @xmath7 . \n we used centered finite differences to estimate which is exact on the third degree polynomials . \n therefore , we compute exactly for all radii , @xmath7 , at least @xmath51 away from @xmath52 and @xmath53 . hence the only errors in numerical differentiation that spread into the backprojection come with the data from spheres close to the ones touching tangentially the phantom ball . \n none of these spheres passes inside the phantom ball , hence backprojection at those points is free of errors from numerical differentiation ( see fig . \n [ errors ] ) . \n now let us consider a point @xmath54 on the axis of symmetry of the ball phantoms ( the line connecting the center of the phantom ball and the origin ) . \n there are two sets of spheres that pass through that point and touch the phantom ball tangentially . \n the spheres in the first set contain the phantom ball , while the spheres in the second set do not . \n a 2d slice of this scenario is presented in figure  [ circles ] . \n notice that all spheres in the same set have the same radius . \n so the errors from the numerical differentiation that they will bring into the backprojection algorithm are absolutely the same . \n the axis of symmetry is the only location in the reconstruction region where these errors are perfectly correlated . \n this resonance increases the magnitude of errors resulting in the noise along the symmetry axis on reconstructed images ( see fig . \n [ errors ] ) .    in case of ellipsoids in the defrise \n phantom everything said above holds . \n in fact magnitude of errors is five times bigger since there are five ellipsoids with the same axis of symmetry there . at the same time \n , the reconstruction of an ellipsoidal phantom without any rotational symmetry has no axis of emphasized errors ( see fig . \n [ ellipsoid ] ) . \n we have implemented a straightforward numerical validation of both fbp and @xmath10-filtered inversion formulae for tct data on the high - frequency defrise phantom . \n fbp and @xmath10-filtered have virtually identical performance with noise - free simulated data from this high - contrast object . \n artifacts due to numerical errors are more severe in fbp than @xmath10-filtered images and might be reduced by mollification techniques  @xcite . comparing fbp and @xmath10-filtered performance in the presence of noise and for low - contrast detectability will appear in future publications . \n the authors would like to thank mark anastasio , david finch , peter kuchment , leonid kunyansky and rakesh for information about their work and discussions on the subject . \n the first author would also like to thank his advisor peter kuchment for constant support . \n the first author was supported in part by the nsf grants dms 9971674 and 0002195 and thanks the nsf for that support . \n any opinions , findings , conclusions or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the nsf . \n m.  haltmeier , t.  schuster , o.  scherzer ,  filtered backprojection for thermoacoustic computed tomography in spherical geometry \" , _ mathematical methods in the applied sciences , accepted for publication . \n _          r.a . \n kruger , k.d . \n miller , h.e . \n reynolds , w.l . \n kiser jr . , \n reinecke , g.a . \n kruger , `` contrast enhancement of breast cancer in vivo using thermoacoustic ct at 434 mhz , '' _ radiology _ 2000 ; * 216 * : 279 -

{"ContextTokens": 3321, "GeneratedTokens": 95, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the very early motivations for introducing confinement in experimental studies of liquids and glass formers was the general agreement that there might exist a typical lengthscale measuring the dynamical molecular cooperativity @xcite . \n this quantity is suspected to increase with decreasing temperature , and to contribute to the observed anomalous properties of the structural relaxation such as super - arrhenian slowing - down in fragile compounds . introducing a maximum size to the system by means of a porous matrix \n gives the opportunity to emphasize experimental evidence of those dynamical cooperative clusters . \n up to now , most theoretical expectations and more or less direct experimental studies converge to state that the characteristic size of these cooperative rearranging regions ( crr ) does not exceed a few molecular sizes . \n confinement effects have been mostly scrutinized in porous materials presenting cavities of nanometric dimension . \n a large variety of materials has been used , often silicates within different geometries , either isotropic ( fractal aerogels , interconnected vycors , aerosils or gelsils ) or template - controlled ( mcm-41 , sba-15 ) . \n several experimental difficulties are encountered in such studies due to the unavoidable powder averaging of the measured observables and to the huge surface to volume ratio that is reached . \n indeed , the surface contribution to the free energy of the confined liquid can not be ignored anymore , and the awaited ultimate finite - size effects can be masked by dominant interfacial solid - liquid interactions @xcite . \n experimental evidence of such surface contribution was reported on simple liquids like toluene @xcite , as a stretching of the dynamical self - correlation functions toward longer times , and a non - vanishing static contribution within experimental resolution . \n these data were interpreted by a very large distribution of correlation times , starting from very slow reorientations imposed by a pinning at the pore surface , to bulk - like dynamics at the center . \n such a broadening of molecular dynamics frequencies over several decades is supported by numerical simulations @xcite . \n this onset of glass - like dynamics in simple liquids appears as an essential consequence of confinement , but is not the only one , for also the structure and the thermodynamical stable and metastable states are affected @xcite . \n these interrelated effects remain partly misunderstood even for simple fluids . \n a large effort towards a better understanding of more complex confined fluids is timely , for they are introduced in an increasing number of innovative applications of nanosciences ( lab - on - chip , nanofluidics ... ) . \n liquid crystals ( lc ) are test - systems in order to investigate fluids with an increasing degree on complexity . \n their structure is characterized by anisotropic order parameters giving rise to typical sequences of nematic or smectic phases . \n however , their molecular nature allows one to confidently assign dynamical contributions in terms of rotations , translational diffusion or librations , accessible to a large number of techniques like dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , neutron quasielastic scattering or light scattering ( photon correlation spectroscopy , optical kerr effect @xcite ) . \n both these structural and dynamical aspects have been widely studied on bulk samples , and make lc s model systems particularly suited to experimental investigations of confinement effects on complex fluids . like more simple liquids , the thermodynamics of confined lc s is also profoundly modified . \n one of the most striking effect is the instability of the translational smectic ordering with respect to the quenched disorder field introduced by an irregular solid / lc interface @xcite . \n this leads to a very important depression of the melting temperature of the confined crystalline phase , and the suppression of the nematic to smectic continuous transition , replaced by a frustrated short - range ( nanometric ) smectic ordering @xcite . \n we report in this paper new experimental data depicting structural and dynamical features of a confined lc in a nanoporous material of very low dimensionality . \n fully hydrogenated liquid crystal ( lc ) 4-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ( 8cb ) was purchased from sigma - aldrich and used without further purification . \n columnar porous silicon ( psi ) matrices were obtained from a heavily doped ( 100 ) oriented silicon substrate by electrochemical etching @xcite . \n a porosity of 60 % , made of a parallel arrangement of not - connected channels ( diameter @xmath0 300 ) is obtained , aligned in a layer of thickness @xmath0 30 @xmath1 m . \n this very large aspect ratio induces a quasi one - dimensional character of the porous structure , preferentially aligned on the macroscopic lengthscale . \n thermal oxidation of the structure can be further performed , leading to a transparent layer well suited to investigations by optical techniques . \n 8cb was confined into psi by capillary wetting from the liquid phase under vapour pressure in a vaccuum chamber and at a temperature of 60c , well above the n - i transition temperature . \n the excess of lc was then removed by squeezing the wafers between whatman filtration papers . \n the complete filling of the pores was characterized by confocal microraman spectroscopy @xcite . \n neutron diffraction experiments were performed on the g6.1 double - axis diffractometer ( cold neutron guide ) at the laboratoire lon brillouin ( llb , cnrs / cea , saclay ) , with an incident wavelength of 4.71 . \n quasielastic incoherent neutron scattering experiments were carried out on the time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer g6.2 at the llb , with a resolution of 107 @xmath1ev fwhm . the covered momentum transfer ( q ) range was about 0.4 to 1.9 @xmath2 . \n the temperature was controlled to better than 0.1 k over a range from 100 k to 340 k using a cryoloop . \n numerical deconvolution of tof spectra were carried out following standard procedures using the `` qensh '' software provided by the llb . \n for both diffraction and tof experiments , eight filled porous silicon wafers were stacked parallel to each other in a cylindrical aluminium cell , representing a total amount of confined lc of about 20 mg . \n ellipsometry experiments were carried out with a horiba jobin - yvon uvisel spectrometer , in the visible range ( @xmath3 from 410 to 830 nm ) . \n the measured ellipsometric angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related respectively to the amplitude ratio and to the phase difference between the complex reflexion coefficients ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) of the sample ( resp . parallel or perpendicular to the incident plane ) . from these two angles , new quantities are defined according to :    @xmath8    these functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 were fitted versus the wavelength using the horiba `` deltapsi2 '' software provided with the apparatus . \n the sample was modelled as a porous silica layer top of a silicon substrate . \n the dielectric dispersions of silicon and silica were described using standard library data . \n the dielectric dispersion of the organic liquid crystal was modeled by a uniaxial anisotropic single oscillator . \n the porosity of the layer was described using a classical anisotropic bruggeman model @xcite mixing silica and void dispersions for the empty matrix , or silica and 8cb dispersions for the filled matrix . \n brillouin scattering was performed with a triple pass tandem of fabry - perot ( sandercock model ) with a kr@xmath11 ion laser ( coherent ) at a wavelength of 647 nm . \n laser power was kept at a few tens of mw in order to avoid a too big heating due to absorption of the bulk silicon supporting the film . at too high counting rates a shutter obturates the photomultiplier inducing discontinuities in the spectra . \n typical spectra were accumulated during several hours . \n spectra were fitted by an apparatus function convoluted to damped oscillator profiles ( brillouin lines ) and a debye relaxor . \n all results presented hereafter were obtained close to room temperature , in the smectic phase of 8cb ( bulk or confined ) @xcite . in this temperature range , \n the liquid crystal 8cb confined in psi experiences smectic ordering that remains short - range ( sro , @xmath12 ) due to quenshed disorder effects imposed by solid - liquid interfacial interactions @xcite . \n these effects destroy the bulk second order nematic to smectic phase transition . as a consequence , \n the bragg peak associated to this smectic sro and appearing at @xmath13 ( at a working wavelength of 4.7 ) is significantly broader than the experimental resolution . \n figure [ ellipso ] displays ellipsometric spectra measured on empty porous silica and porous silica filled with 8cb . \n the interference fringes are due to multiple reflections at interfaces of the porous layer . \n it is therefore possible to deduce an estimation of the layer thickness , and typical values between 2.5 and 5 @xmath1 m ( depending on the sample ) were found , in good agreement with independent sem results . \n a simple comparison of both curves shows strong differences in the amplitude modulation of those fringes , as a consequence of the dispersion of the optical index of the confined liquid crystalline phase . \n this observation can be used as a direct characterization of a proper filling of the porous layer with 8cb . \n a semi - quantitative analysis was performed using the model described in section [ expellipso ] . \n best fits agree with an optical uniaxial birefringence of the filled porous layer of about @xmath14 , with an optical axis aligned with the direction of the nanopores . \n the important differences in the ellipsometric data allow to separate unambiguously this additional birefrengence due to the liquid crystal from the natural optical anisotropy of the empty porous layer . \n these two contributions can be further more distinguished through the temperature dependence of the liquid crystal contribution . \n from the orientation of this measured optical anisotropy , it can be concluded that the orientational order parameter of the confined 8cb strongly couples to the one - dimensional character of the porous matrix . \n @xmath2 ) by 8cb confined into porous silicon . the inset sketches the experimental setup . \n the sample macroscopic orientation is defined by the angle @xmath15 between the silicon wafer plane and the incident beam . ] \n figure [ mosa ] shows the intensity of the bragg peak associated to the smectic sro measured at constant @xmath16 @xmath2 , while rotating the sample plane by an angle @xmath15 with respect to the neutron incident beam . \n the best fit using an arbitrary lorentzian form indicates that the maximum of the bragg reflexion is peaked at @xmath17 , which corresponds to the sample orientation @xmath18 where the @xmath19 vector is parallel to the nanochannels of the porous silicon layer . \n the linewidth is about 17hwhm . within this rather small mosaicity , \n the director of the smectic layers is obviously well aligned with the silicon channels axis . \n both ellipsometry and neutron diffraction results show that 8cb confined in porous silicon displays in the meantime orientational and translational order parameters that are macroscopically one - dimensionally oriented through a strong coupling with the peculiar low dimensionality of the matrix . \n accordingly , the molecular dynamics of the confined phase might be also affected by this anisotropic ordering . whereas translational diffusion should in some extent depend on the local properties of the smectic sro domains \n , the rotational molecular relaxations should be more sensitive to orientational parameters . in this section , \n we report brillouin and quasielastic neutron scattering results , that complementary probe the molecular relaxations in the picosecond time range . \n figure [ brillouin ] shows the comparison of brillouin spectra obtained on porous silica filled with 8cb or on the separated constituents . \n the black line is the best fit according to the procedure detailed in section [ expbri ] . \n the brillouin doublets appearing on the spectra have different origins : the one at the lowest frequency is a longitudinal mode propagating tangentially to the surface , whereas at the highest frequency appears a longitudinal mode propagating mainly along the pores perpendicular to the surface . \n the response of the bulk liquid crystal consists in a single quasielastic lorentzian line of about 5 ghz hwhm ( i.e. @xmath20 ps ) . \n the symmetry of the experimental setup suggests to assign this line to uniaxial rotation of the molecules around their long axis . \n the response of an empty porous silica matrix reveals strong brillouin modes , sitting on a very broad quasielastic contribution ( more than 35 ghz ) . \n comparatively , the brillouin spectrum of a filled porous layer can be described by a weighted linear combination of these individual responses , assuming a broadening of the acoustic modes . \n this damping is due to the coupling of the solid matrix to the viscosity of the liquid crystal ( poroelasticity effect ) \n . a quasielastic contribution of about the same width as for the bulk 8cb can be seen on the data , suggesting that the uniaxial molecular rotations are only weakly affected by the confinement . \n quasielastic neutron scattering experiments were performed , in order to probe additional relaxations . \n figure [ mibemol ] shows the tof spectra measured on bulk 8cb and 8cb / psi . \n spectra were fitted using one lorentzian plus one elastic ( resolution limited ) components . for bulk 8cb \n , the quasielastic contribution has a linewidth of about 0.25 mev ( @xmath21 ps ) . \n its occurence at large values of momentum transfer together with the presence of an elastic contribution would suggest that it also reflects localized reorientations ( rotations , end - chain relaxations ... ) . \n @xmath2 , on ( a ) bulk 8cb , and ( b ) 8cb confined in porous silicon . ]    for 8cb confined in porous silicon , figure [ mibemol](b ) reports a significant increase of the elastic contribution , together with a decrease of the quasielastic linewidth down to 0.16 mev . \n this moderate slowing down of the fast reorientational motions agrees with the brillouin results , and confirms that rotational molecular dynamics seem to be only weakly disturbed by the anisotropic confinement in porous silicon . on the other hand \n , the increase of the elastic contribution suggests that slow relaxations ( slower than the tof energy resolution ) or long range translational diffusion might be much more affected . \n this is expected from a heterogeneous propagation of a surface induced slowing - down through the inner pore volume . \n we report in this note new experimental results on a smectic liquid crystal confined into a low dimensional , macroscopically oriented porous silicon layer , which has been introduced recently @xcite . \n the combination of a large panel of complementary techniques allows one to probe in parallel the structural and dynamical behavior of the confined molecules . \n it is shown that both orientational and translational order parameters of the confined liquid crystal couple to the anisotropy of the silicon matrix , and give rise to unusual structural properties reminiscent for some aspects of electric or magnetic field effects on bulk liquid crystals . \n the picosecond molecular dynamics of this oriented short -

scale mass for the hidden photon can be obtained quite naturally both through the stckelberg and the higgs mechanism . \n the former , being the simplest mechanism to give mass to abelian gauge bosons , can give for example in certain string compactifications with d7-branes a mass to the hidden photon according to @xmath1 , which depends on the volume of the extra dimension , i.e. the string - scale @xmath2 , and the planck scale @xmath3  @xcite . \n for intermediate string - scales @xmath4 gev , which are preferred by the axion decay constant and susy breaking scales , this leads to @xmath5 gev - scale . in the case of the higgs mechanism where the symmetry breaking is transferred by the kinetic mixing from the visible to the hidden sector the hidden photon mass \n can be estimated by @xmath6  @xcite . \n assuming that the kinetic mixing @xmath7 is generated supersymmetrically at high scales , without light fields charged under both u(1)s , it is of the order of a loop factor  @xcite and we impose the following relation with the hidden gauge coupling @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 factor leading typically to @xmath12 and thus @xmath5 gev - scale . \n we consider the most simple hidden sector containing only an extra u(1 ) symmetry and the corresponding hidden photon @xmath0 which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon . \n the most general lagrangian for such a scenario , including a mass - term @xmath13 for the hidden photon and the kinetic mixing between @xmath14 and @xmath0 parameterized by @xmath7 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the field strength of the ordinary electromagnetic field @xmath17 and @xmath18 the field strength of the hidden u(1 ) field @xmath19 . \n the hidden photon can be constrained by and searched for in experiments through its coupling to sm fermions which is possible due to the kinetic mixing with the photon . \n sm precision measurements ( sm pm )  @xcite , the muon and electron anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath20 )  @xcite and a reinterpretation of the babar search for the @xmath21 decay to a pseudoscalar in the process @xmath22s \n @xcite exclude large values of kinetic mixing as shown in grey in the left plot of fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] . \n fixed - target experiments where @xmath0 can be produced in    r0.69         bremsstrahlung off @xmath23-beams place additional constraints from the non - observation of the decay @xmath24 . \n limits from past @xmath25-beam dump searches that have been studied in  @xcite are shown in the left plot of fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] as grey areas . \n the same graph also contains as coloured lines the new limits set by currently running ( mami  @xcite , kloe-2  @xcite , apex  @xcite ) and reanalyzed older experiments ( serpukhov  @xcite , orsay  @xcite ) . \n experiments are closing in on the remaining region of the parameter space and more is to be tested in the ( near ) future by presently operating or planned fixed - target experiments at jlab ( apex  @xcite , hps  @xcite , darklight  @xcite ) , mainz ( mami , mesa  @xcite ) and desy ( hips  @xcite ) . \n the expected sensitivities of those experiments are shown as coloured lines in the right plot of fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] . \n the results of this section are based on an analysis that has been presented in detail in  @xcite . \n the simplest possible extension of the hidden sector studied in the previous section is the addition of a dirac fermion as dark matter candidate ( cf .  @xcite ) . as the hidden photon mediates both the dm annihilation and the dm scattering on nuclei it is essential for the determination of the dm relic abundance and direct detection rate respectively . \n r0.34        using relation  ( [ eq - kappa ] ) with @xmath26 we find that for a dm mass of 6 gev the correct relic abundance can be obtained on the dark green stripe in fig . \n [ fig - hdm - hplimits ] while in the light green area the contribution to the total dm density is only subdominant . \n the spin - independent ( si ) scattering on nuclei of the dirac fermion dm can explain the cogent  @xcite signal in the purple band ( 90% cl lighter 99% cl darker purple ) . \n the plotted cross section @xmath27 has been rescaled by the relic abundance for subdominant dm and fits the one found in  @xcite to be compatible with cogent for a standard halo model . \n constraints from cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite are not shown as they do not apply to dm masses as light as 6 gev . \n the excluded grey areas and coloured lines for sensitivities of future experiments are the same as in fig . \n [ fig - hplimits ] . \n a scan over the dm mass allows to fill the complete parameter space as shown in fig . \n [ fig - scattplot ] on the left for @xmath28 where dark green corresponds to the correct relic abundance , light green to subdominant and purple to cogent allowed points ( all points are compatible with other direct detection limits ) . \n the effects of varying the dm mass , the parameter @xmath10 and the details of the halo model have been studied in more detail in  @xcite .      as a more sophisticated and better motivated model \n , we consider three chiral superfields @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 charged under the hidden u(1 ) . taking the superpotential @xmath32 and the dimensionless coupling  @xmath33 \n this is the simplest anomaly - free model possible without adding dimensionful supersymmetric quantities . \n while we assume the mssm in the visible sector , the dm phenomenology of the hs depends on the details of the susy breaking . \n -2 ( dash -

th kk state is @xmath62 . \n the physical mass eigenstates and their masses could be obtained after diagonalizing @xmath63 by @xmath64 . \n if @xmath65 were zero , the matrix @xmath66 would have a zero eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath67 where the angle @xmath68 describes the mixing between the zero mode and the higher kk modes . \n thus , to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath69 , we can get the lowest eigenvalue which gives the physical neutrino mass squared : @xmath70 as the wave function of r - handed state at @xmath20 is exponentially suppressed as @xmath71 , we naturally get a small neutrino mass , @xmath72 , with a largish @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as it is clearly seen in eq . \n , the zero mode can mix with kk excitation modes but the mixing angle is highly suppressed @xmath75 . \n however the mass splitting between particle and antiparticle in the zero mode states , which we can take as a perturbation , can not be neglected and actually is important to account the minos anomaly . \n once ghost condensation takes place on @xmath19 brane , @xmath76 , the second term becomes another neutrino bilinear term @xmath77 where @xmath78 . \n a convenient parameter , @xmath79 , measures the lorentz violation . \n when @xmath80 the masses of particle ( neutrino , in our case ) and anti - particle ( anti - neutrino , in our case ) are different by @xmath81 : , the dirac equation in momentum space is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dirac mass coming from conventional higgs mechanism . in the rest frame , @xmath84 \n , the equation is reduced to @xmath85 and the mass eigenvalues are @xmath86 or @xmath87 . ] \n @xmath88 the minos data in eq . \n implies that the mass difference in neutrino and anti - neutrino would be in the range of @xmath89 or @xmath90 here we used @xmath91 to fit the correct neutrino mass scale with @xmath92 . \n note that @xmath93 is consistent with the bound @xmath94 from neutron @xmath95 decay  @xcite . \n again as the splitting is small enough we can neglect the mixing between zero mode and other kk modes . \n taking @xmath96 and the bound on the size of extra dimension ) if they are light enough . \n taking current mass bound for the higgs into account , we conclude that @xmath97 or @xmath98 is allowed by lep - ii and tevatron experiments . ] , we get the lower bound on @xmath10 from the neutrino sector , @xmath99 gev . on the other hand , from nonlinear dynamics of the gravity sector , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath10  @xcite . \n thus , there is only a small window for @xmath10:@xmath100 since @xmath10 should be pretty close to @xmath101 we expect to see twinkling of the cmb  @xcite and blinking of the light from a quasar at a large distance with the twinkling timescale @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the overall velocity of the rest frame of ghost condensation relative to the cmb and the quasar rest frame , respectively . \n there are other bounds which we should take into account but , as shall see , they do not set additional constraints . \n due to the coupling of neutrinos to ghost condensation , an ultrarelativistic neutrino emits a nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite . \n this is an analogue of erenkov radiation . demanding that neutrinos from sn1987a should not be deflected by this process , we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath104 this is automatically satisfied if ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) is satisfied . if we demand that the total relative energy lost from cosmological neutrinos to nambu - goldstone bosons during the epoch between neutrino decoupling to the last scattering surface of the cmb , then we obtain the bound  @xcite @xmath105 again , this is satisfied under ( [ eqn : boundsonm ] ) . \n in this paper we have considered ghost condensation as a source of _ cpt _ violation . taking the coupling with neutrino current into account \n , we could provide a possible difference between neutrino and anti - neutrino , namely @xmath106 which has been recently hinted by minos experiment even though the result is preliminary . to avoid a sizable _ cpt _ violation in other sectors , we suggest an extra dimension model where the right - handed neutrinos in the bulk mediate the standard model sector and the ghost condensate which takes place at a distance from the standard model brane . \n the model leads to interesting observational consequences : twinkling cmb and blinking quasars with the timescale around tens to hundreds of minutes which might be within the reach of future cmb observations ( e.g. planck @xcite ) and astronomical point source observations . \n finally discussion on flavor non - diagonal _ cpt _ violation is in order . \n flavor non - diagnoal dimension five operators directly contribute to neutrino oscillation as in the standard matter effects and so are highly constrained by solar , atmospheric and other ground based neutrino experiments . \n to forbid flavor non - diagonal terms we assume flavor symmetry on the ghost condensate brane so that only flavor diagonal dimension five operators are induced at the leading order . \n on the other hand , flavor transition induced by yukawa couplings are small @xmath107 . \n the authors would thank tsutomu yanagida , hitoshi murayama and masahiro tanaka for helpful discussions and comments . \n this work was supported by the world premier international research center initiative ( wpi initiative ) by mext . \n the work of s.m . was supported in part by grant -

called _ timeslices _ of the feynman paths . in the limit \n @xmath12 eq . \n ( [ pfad ] ) becomes exact . for quantum dots \n the space dimension is d=2 and the ( 2nm)-dimensional integral given in ( [ pfad ] ) can be evaluated by standard metropolis monte carlo techniques . due to the determinant \n the integrand is not always positive and the expectation value of an observable @xmath13 depending only on position operators has to be calculated using @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the value of the observable @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the value of the integrand in ( [ pfad ] ) in the gth monte carlo step . \n ( [ sign ] ) reveals a severe problem connected with the path integral for fermions which is commonly denoted as the _ fermion sign problem _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n it can be shown that the ratio between integrands with positive sign ( @xmath18 ) and negative sign ( @xmath19 ) is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the ground state energies of the fermi system and the corresponding bose system . \n it is now obvious that the statistical error in ( [ sign ] ) grows rapidly for small temperatures @xmath23 . \n moreover the energy difference @xmath24 will grow with increasing system size causing an increase of the statistical error .    within pimc \n the calculation of the kinetic energy expectation value is another critical task . \n this is merely due to the fact that the monte carlo calculation is usually done in position space and that the discretization of the paths allows a number of different approaches to calculate the expectation value of a momentum dependent operator . \n a number of various different energy estimators has been discussed in the past @xcite .    to avoid these difficulties we developed a procedure which allows the calculation of all energy expectation values from the knowledge of the pair correlation functions @xmath25 and the radial density functions per electron @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability of finding electron @xmath28 in distance @xmath29 from the center .    due to the particle symmetry \n we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 utilizing the hypervirial theorem of hirschfelder @xcite the energy can be written as a sum of ten parts  @xcite @xmath32 while in density functional approaches the calculation of the kinetic energy and the exchange correlation energy is a major topic and subject to permanent discussion , within the path integral approach these energies are included in a natural way . \n + however , the systematic error arising from the limited number of timeslices @xmath11 and the statistical error of the monte carlo calculation have to be controlled carefully . \n we checked our algorithm extensively using eight non - interacting fermions in a parabolic trap as a test system . \n we found that at low temperatures where the ratio of signs is around 0.99 , convergence can only be achieved obeying the following rules : 1 ) the determinants have to be calculated very accurately using a more costly algorithm with pivoting . \n 2 ) the completely uncorrelated generation of the monte carlo steps is essential , i.e. the coordinate to be moved should be chosen randomly . moving the particle \n coordinates using always the same sequence produces inaccurate results . \n 3 ) a good random number generator with a _ completely _ uncorrelated sequence in all significant bits of a 64 bit real number should be applied . \n we therefore developed a 53 bit random number of marsaglia - zaman type@xcite instead of using one of the standard 24 or 32 bit random number generators coming with standard system libraries . \n 4 ) further , to improve the convergence a number of different monte carlo steps can be applied , i.e. moving single time slices , moving complete particle paths and parts of a path . \n + our fortran - code is completely parallelized using mpi and lapack . \n to compare our pimc calculations to experimental data we calculated the addition energies @xmath33 of a qd with up to 11 electrons using the material constants @xmath34 and @xmath1 = 12.9 for gaas as given by hirose and wingreen @xcite . \n it is assumed that these parameters mimic the experimental setup of tarucha et  al . \n @xcite reasonably well . \n the strength of the harmonic potential is fixed at @xmath35 = 3.0 mev . \n the resulting effective atomic units are @xmath36 = 10.955 mev for the hartree energy and @xmath37 = 10.1886 nm for the bohr radius . \n the boltzmann constant is @xmath38 . \n we performed pimc simulations for quantum dots with different spin configurations at a fixed temperature of 10 k. due to the fermion sign problem the number of monte carlo steps necessary to push the statistical error of the total energy , which has been calculated properly from 25 uncorrelated subsequences of mc steps , into the range of 0.1 percent is extremely high . \n the number of monte carlo steps ranged between 2.5 billion steps per particle coordinate for @xmath39 and about 10 billion steps for @xmath40 . \n [ addfig ] displays the addition energies for quantum dots with up to 11 electrons . \n the circles indicate the results from our path integral calculations at 10 k , the squares are results of spin density functional calculations of hirose and wingreen  @xcite , and the triangles are the experimental results of tarucha et  al . \n @xcite . \n both theoretical calculations reproduce the general @xmath5-dependence of the addition energies in great detail . \n tarucha et  al . \n give an estimate of the electron temperature in their experiments of @xmath41  k. for computational reasons our pimc calculations are performed at 10 k and it can not be expected that the absolute energy values agree as well as the 0  k dft calculations with the experimental results . \n however , it should be noted that pimc correctly predicts the drop in the addition energy from @xmath42 to @xmath43 while the dft calculations fail at this point . \n the inset in fig . \n [ addfig ] displays the total spins of the spin configurations with lowest energy as found in dft and pimc at 10 k. in dft calculations ( 0 k ) the spin configuration of the ground state is determined by hund s rule for up to 22 electrons . \n in contrast , in our pimc calculation at 10 k the total spin is not always in accordance with hund s rule . \n for @xmath44 we checked the temperature dependence of the spin configuration . at 5 \n k the energy of the spin 0 configuration is 0.01 @xmath45 higher than the spin 1 energy indicating a temperature dependence of the favored spin configuration .    as an important fact \n we note that the @xmath5-dependence of the addition energies is not affected by the actual spin configuration . \n the situation is quite similar to that in transition metal clusters with extreme small energy differences between states with significantly different magnetic moments @xcite .    as can be inferred from fig . \n [ rhogamma](a ) the radial spin densities are significantly different for both spin configurations . the total potential energy for the spin 1 configuration is about 0.07 mev lower than that of the spin  0 configuration . at 10 k \n this is overcompensated by an 0.27 mev higher kinetic energy ( see tab . \n [ etable ] ) . \n although the kinetic and potential energies for different total spins significantly differ the total energies are almost equal . \n similar situations are found for larger @xmath5 .    for convenience and \n easy comparision we determined the value of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath46 , which is sometimes used to characterize quantum dots ( see e.g. @xcite ) to be @xmath46=4.19 for @xmath44 . \n .kinetic and potential energies as well as @xmath47=@xmath48 in mev for different electron configurations at 10 k ( the numbers in brackets are the single particle energies ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in conclusion , we have found that despite of the notorious fermion sign problem pimc is capable to answer interesting questions for strongly correlated electron systems like qds and qdms \n . for qds pimc reproduces correctly the experimental addition energies . \n our temperature dependent calculations give new insights into the process of wc . \n for the 2-dimensional qds a ratio @xmath49 below 0.1 seems to indicate wc both for @xmath1 and temperature dependent calculations . \n however , reagarding this aspect a more firm classification parameter e.g. similary to the lindemann criterion is desirable . \n a comparision to other qmc methods seems to be in order here . \n even our most complicated simulations took less than two hours on a cray t3e with 62 processors . \n taking the advantages of modern computer power and optimized software , the _ brute force _ pimc applied here is able to produce very precise results . \n different algorithms have been published to improve the performance of path integral methods . \n a recent one is the _ multi - level blocking _ method published by mak et  al . \n simulations using this algorithm are expected to converge better than our direct treatment since the fermion sign problem is avoided partially . \n the published results of the treatment of quantum dots by egger et  al . \n @xcite do not confirm this expectation . \n obviously the advantages of the new method are more than compensated by other numerical problems , maybe due to the energy estimator used @xcite . nevertheless , a combination of the multi - level - blocking method and our technique might result in a very powerful tool . \n we wish to thank the _ regionales rechenzentrum niedersachsen _ and the _ konrad zuse institut berlin _ for their excellent computer support and e.  r.  hilf for stimulating discussions . \n 10 n. zhitenev , r. ashoori , l. pfeiffer , and k. west , phys . \n lett . * 79 * , 2308 ( 1997 ) . \n s. tarucha , d. austing , and t. honda , phys . \n lett . * 77 * , 3613 ( 1996 ) . c. yannouleas and u. landman , phys . \n rev . lett . * 82 * , 5325 ( 1999 ) . \n m. koskinen , m. manninen , and s. reimann , phys . \n lett . * 79 * , 1389 ( 1997 ) . \n r. egger , w. husler , c. mak , and h. grabert , phys . \n lett . * 82 * , 3320 ( 1999 ) . \n k. hirose and n. wingreen , phys . \n b * 59 * , 4604 ( 1999 ) . \n d. pfannkuche , v. gudmundsson , and p. maksym , phys . \n b * 47 * , 2244 ( 1993 ) . \n r. pino , phys . \n b * 58 * , 4644 ( 1998 ) . \n m. takahashi and m. imada , j. phys . \n . jpn . * 53 * , 936 ( 1984 ) . \n m. takahashi and m. imada , j. phys . \n * 53 * , 3765 ( 1984 ) . \n p. borrmann and e. hilf , z. phys . \n d * 26 * , s350 ( 1993 ) . \n d. ceperley , phys . \n . lett . * 69 * , 331 ( 1992 ) . \n a. lyubartsev and p. vorontsov - velayaminov , phys . \n a * 48 * , 4075 ( 1993 ) . i. morgenstern , z. phys . \n b * 77 * , 267 ( 1989 ) . w.  h. newman and a. kuki , j. chem \n * 96 * , 356 ( 1992 ) . \n j. cao and b. berne , j. chem . \n phys . * 91 * , 6359 ( 1989 ) . \n a. giansanti and g. jacucci , j. chem . phys . * \n 89 * , 7454 ( 1988 ) . \n h. kono , a. takasaka , and s. lin , j. chem . \n * 88 * , 6390 ( 1988 ) . \n j.  o. hirschfelder , j. chem . \n phys . * 33 * , 1462 ( 1960 ) . \n h. heinze , p. borrmann , h. stamerjohanns , and e. hilf , z. phys . \n * d * * 40 * , 190 ( 1997 ) . \n p. borrmann , in preparation ( unpublished ) . \n k. lee and j. callaway , phys . \n b * 48 * , 15358 ( 1993 ) c. mak , r. egger , and h. weber - gottschick , phys .  rev \n .  lett . * 81 * , 4533 ( 1998 ) . \n d. ceperley , phys . rev \n . lett . * 69 * , 331 ( 1992 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1724123932641, "RequestID": "7b3b3a1ae268ed232afb5b402ded4cd4068536e6", "TotalTokens": 3890}
{"ContextTokens": 4092, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "collisions of neutron - rich ions can be exploited to investigate isospin asymmetries of nuclear matter . \n this is a topic of great current interest which impacts both terrestrial nuclear physics and the physics of neutron stars . \n the on - going and up - coming experimental programs using radioactive nuclear beams are expected to improve our knowledge of nuclear properties away from the stability line , making predictions of neutron - rich systems especially interesting and timely . \n interaction cross section measurements can provide valuable information on the structure of exotic nuclei . in this paper , we will be concerned specifically with the nucleus - nucleus total reaction cross section and its sensitivity to medium effects and to the inclusion of isospin asymmetries . by isospin asymmetries \n we mean : 1 ) separating neutron and proton densities in the target and projectile nuclei , as opposed to just considering total _ \n nucleon _ densites ( something which is often done for mildly isospin - asymmetric nuclei ) ; and 2 ) _ medium - induced _ differences between collisions of different types of nucleons in the presence of unequal concentrations of protons and neutrons . \n ( notice that we are not referring to the well - known differences between @xmath1 and @xmath2 cross sections . ) \n intermediate energies are best for our purpose , as both the model approximations we apply and the expectation of sensitivity to medium effects are reasonably justified . \n isospin - dependent dynamics can be studied through a variety of reactions / phenomena related to the transport of protons and neutrons . a review of isospin effects in heavy - ion reactions which may be particularly suitable to probe the nuclear symmetry energy can be found in ref . \n furthermore , fusion dynamics in heavy - ion collisions close to the coulomb barrier is sensitive to the incident energy and the neutron - to - proton ratio in the neck region of the colliding systems @xcite . \n more recently , isospin and symmetry energy effects on the competition between fusion and break - up reactions in low - energy ( about 10a mev ) heavy - ion collisions have been studied within a stochastic mean - field approach @xcite . when exotic beams are employed , these mechanisms are expected to be sensitive to the isovector part of the nuclear potential , thus yielding information on the symmetry energy . in passing , \n we note that the mean field used in calculations such as those from ref . \n @xcite is often derived from phenomenological forces . \n we hope that these very comprehensive reaction studies will consider including predictions from microscopic many - body calculations as part of their input . \n although a rather global observable as compared to the potentially more  selective \" mechanisms mentioned above , the reaction cross section has the potential to reveal sensitivities to effects induced by isospin asymmetry in the medium , particularly when written in such a way as to discriminate between protons and neutrons ( see section * iia * , eq . \n it is then interesting to explore to which extent this is true . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section * ii * , we review some formal aspects of reaction cross section calculations ( within the optical limit of the glauber model ( gm ) @xcite ) and describe the main input , namely the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions and the nuclear densities . in our case , both of these ingredients are obtained from , or are closely related to , our microscopic equation of state ( eos ) , making all aspects of our calculation internally consistent with one underlying nuclear interaction . \n we will discuss how medium effects and isospin asymmetries are introduced in the various elements of our calculation . within section * ii * , we will look at the reaction cross section for collisions of stable nuclei and perform some sensitivity studies . we have chosen collisions of @xmath3ca on @xmath0pb as our initial  laboratory \" . \n although not an exotic one , @xmath0pb is an interesting nucleus to consider , since very accurate measurements of its neutron skin are expected to come from the electroweak physics program at the jefferson laboratory . \n ( to the best of our knowledge , such value is not yet available , but we understand that the jlab target uncertainty should be very small . )    several authors have confronted reaction cross sections with neutron - rich isotopes ( see , for instance , ref . \n @xcite for carbon isotopes incident on a proton ) . in section \n * iii * we will look at some reaction cross section data for collisions involving neutron - rich isotopes of calcium and argon at energy / nucleon between 50 and 70 mev @xcite . \n for that purpose , we need neutron and proton densities for the nuclides under consideration . again \n , we obtain density distributions from our equation of state and then move to predictions of reaction cross sections . \n our conclusions and future outlook are summarized in section iv . \n we operate within the optical limit of the glauber model @xcite . \n the reaction cross section is written , in terms of the impact parameter @xmath4 , as @xmath5 with @xmath6 the _ nuclear transparency _ , defined as @xmath7 where the _ thickness function _ is given by @xcite @xmath8 namely , the thickness function is the product of the averaged nn cross section and the overlap integral of the target and projectile densities , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n the averaged nn cross section is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the proton , neutron , and mass numbers of the target(projectile ) nucleus , and @xmath15(@xmath16 ) are the elementary cross sections for scattering of identical(non - identical ) nucleons . \n more generally , and accounting for finite range nuclear interactions @xcite , one writes the transparency as @xmath17 where the @xmath18-integrated densities of the target and projectile nuclei are defined as @xmath19 and @xmath20 in these expressions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are _ transverse _ coordinates , defined in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis . \n typically , the range function , @xmath23 , which is normalized to unity , is taken to be of gaussian shape with an interaction range of about 0.6 - 1.0 fm @xcite . \n taking the range function to be a delta function , @xmath24 , amounts to adopting the zero - range approximation  @xcite . \n the formulas above can be understood in terms of interaction probability between density elements in the target and projectile nuclei . \n those density elements consist of  tubes \" parallel to the beam axis ( the @xmath18-axis ) and whose position is specified by the vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the use of z - integrated densities reduces an otherwise six - dimensional integral ( similar to the double - folding of an effective nuclear interation ) to a four - dimensional one , which we calculate numerically . \n alternatively , the integral can be rendered separable by fourier transformation into momentum space @xcite . \n notice that , when properly discriminating between proton and neutron densities ( beyond the @xmath27 and @xmath28 factors which appear in eq . \n ( 4 ) ) , the transparency function is written as @xmath29 where the summations extend over neutron and proton densities of target and projectile . in the next section \n , we will discuss the inclusion of isospin asymmetry through the densities as well as the elementary cross sections . \n a first - order coulomb correction can be included by replacing the impact parameter with the ( classical ) distance of closest approach in the coulomb field @xcite . \n that is , in eq . \n ( 5 ) one replaces the impact parameter with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance of closest approach when @xmath32 . \n we apply such trajectory modification here . \n some comments are in place concerning the validity of the glauber model in the energy range to be considered here , particularly the lower end of that range , which is 50 mev / nucleon . \n the basic assumption of the glauber model is the description of the relative motion of target and projectile in terms of straight trajectories . for low energy , the eikonal trajectories \n should be modified to account for both the coulomb field and the nuclear field , with the nuclear field effect tending to move the reaction cross section closer to the glauber model results . in ref . \n @xcite , it is shown that the most significant effect at low and intermediate energies ( from the coulomb barrier to 50 times the coulomb barrier ) is the one due to the coulomb field . \n in fact , close to the coulomb barrier , the coulomb - modified gm and the coulomb plus nuclear modified gm appear indistinguishable . for a system such as @xmath3ca + @xmath0pb , which we will confront next \n , 50 mev / nucleon is about 10 times the coulomb barrier ( in terms of center - of - mass energy ) , and the results of ref . \n @xcite gives us some confidence that a ( coulomb - modified ) gm is reasonably valid for our purposes . \n @xcite included effects from the nuclear potential to compare modified gm predictions with their measurements ( in the range of 10 - 300 mev / nucleon ) . \n the potential was taken to be the real part of an optical potential extracted from analysis of elastic scattering data for similar reaction systems . \n they note that nuclear field effects can counterbalance the coulomb repulsion in a significant way mostly for the lightest projectiles @xcite ( one reason why we prefer to work with medium - heavy nuclei ) . \n another mechanism that goes beyond the glauber model is pauli blocking , which is included in our in - medium nn cross sections ( see below ) . \n note , further , that our in - medium cross sections also contain nuclear mean field effects , being modified by the average nuclear matter potential . \n weighing all the considerations above , we remain well aware that several modifications of the glauber model may be important at the lower energies , especially when a detailed comparison with the data is the main objective . here , on the other hand , we focus mostly on exploring sensitivities .    . \n point and charge r.m.s . \n radii ( in units of fermi ) predicted through our equation of state for @xmath3ca and @xmath0pb . \n the second and third column display the proton and neutron point radii . \n the fourth and fifth columns show the charge radius and its empirical value . \n the values in the second half of the table are obtained ignoring differencs between proton and neutron distributions . \n see text for details . [ \n cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in closing , we stress that one of the main features of our work is a seamless and parameter - free pipeline ( from the effective nn interaction to the eos , to nuclear densities , to in - medium nn cross sections , to reaction cross sections ) originating from one single realistic nn potential @xcite . for the purpose of this sensitivity study \n , we adopted a reaction model that has been traditionally used due to its convenience and simplicity . in the near future \n , we plan to remove some of the approximations inherent to the optical limit of the glauber model @xcite . \n we have performed sensitivity tests with the total reaction cross section involving stable ( although mildly isospin asymmetric ) nuclei , such as @xmath0pb . \n this observable has the potential to discriminate among different eos yielding different predictions for the neutron distribution of neutron - rich nuclei . \n we explored the impact of applying medium effects on the nn cross sections . \n taking as a reference point standard data sets with stable nuclei such as those by kox _ \n @xcite , we see that error bars can be as small as 6 - 7% and occasionally as large as 20% or more . \n overall , this level of precision would make it difficult to resolve the model dependence of the reaction cross section with respect to medium effects . \n nevertheless , theorists should feel encouraged to find better agreement concerning the best definition and calculation of effective in - medium nn cross sections .    in a problem as complex as the one of heavy - ion reactions , where several ingredients are necessary and none of them is free of uncertainty \n , one has to be very selective of the appropriate  laboratory \" . \n reactions with exotic nuclei at high energy ( as those measured , for instance , in ref . \n @xcite at 950a mev ) , where medium effects can be expected to be negligible , are best suited to probe matter distribution beyond stability . \n once reliable information on the structure is available , that information can be used in calculations of lower - energy reactions where the focus can be placed on the density - dependence of the nuclear interaction . \n as noted in the introduction , the isospin degree of freedom plays an important role in heavy - ion collisions , especially the transport of neutrons and protons . \n it was found @xcite that in - medium nn cross sections have significant influence on the isospin transport and the nucleon transverse flow at intermediate energy . \n although here we are not dealing with a transport model , the transparency , written as in eq . \n ( 8) , allows for a natural separation of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath2 cross sections . \n sensitivity to such separation , if any , would result from different probabilities ( of the different types of collisions ) in the overlap region of isospin asymmetric colliding ions . \n we explored whether such differences can be detected by the reaction cross section and concluded that they can not . \n ultimately , the possibility of exploiting this and other reaction observables to constrain nuclear properties and/or medium modifications of the nuclear force rests on the availability of large systematics and good - precision data . \n these are precisely among the major goals of upcoming experimental efforts in nuclear physics . \n support from the u.s . \n department of energy under grant no . \n de - fg02 - 03er41270 is acknowledged . \n bao -

{"ContextTokens": 3685, "GeneratedTokens": 251, "SynthesizedBody": "among the low - mass pre - main sequence binary systems in nearby active star - forming regions , there exist a handful in which one of the two stars is reminiscent of a protostar , radiating primarily at infrared wavelengths and faint or undetected in visible light . \n these objects are referred to as  infrared companions \" ( ircs ) , despite being in most cases more luminous than their primaries . \n their bolometric temperatures , which measure the  center of mass \" of the spectral energy distribution and are correlated with evolutionary status for young stars ( myers & ladd 1993 ) , tend to lie in a transition region between true embedded sources on the one hand and classical or weak - lined t  tauri stars on the other . \n a variety of models have been proposed for the ircs , but they are generally taken to be dust - shrouded stars which are either less evolved than their primaries and have yet to dissipate their natal envelopes ( _ e.g. , _ dyck , simon , & zuckerman 1982 ) or are experiencing episodes of enhanced accretion , perhaps due to interactions with the primary or with a circumbinary disk ( _ e.g. , _ koresko , herbst , & leinert 1997 ; hereafter khl ) . \n the prototype irc is the companion to t  tauri itself . \n early studies of haro 610 by elias ( 1978 ) revealed a nonstellar photographic appearance , a spectrum displaying prominent forbidden line emission , and photometric variations of a factor @xmath0 at 2.2 @xmath1 m . \n the infrared companion was found 1.2 north of the visible star by leinert & haas ( 1989 ; hereafter lh ) , who used slit - scanning speckle interferometry to measure the ratio of the brightnesses of the two stars at wavelengths between 1.65 and 4.8 @xmath1 m . as in the t  tauri system , \n the irc was fainter than the visible star at wavelengths shorter than @xmath2 @xmath1 m , but brighter in the mid - infrared . \n the haro  610  irc is the reddest object studied by khl , with a bolometric temperature of only 210  k , compared to 490  k for the t  tauri irc . \n in addition to the irc , lh found evidence of _ extended _ emission , in the form of visibility amplitude curves which fell below unity at high frequencies , for scans taken perpendicular to the axis of the binary . \n by contrast , scans taken along the binary axis showed only the oscillations typical of a pair of pointlike stars . \n lh argued that this extended emission was probably associated with one of the two stars . with the advent of two - dimensional infrared detectors on large telescopes , together with refined speckle imaging techniques , \n it has become practical to directly image the components of young binaries to search for faint tertiary components and diffuse circumstellar material . \n letter _ presents the results of a speckle holographic imaging study of the haro 610 irc . \n the new high - resolution images were taken in the k ( 2.2 @xmath1 m ) photometric band at the 10  m keck  1 telescope on three nights in november 1997 , march 1998 , and november 1998 ( see table 1 ) using the near - infrared camera ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) . \n the nirc image converter ( matthews et al . 1996 ) produced a magnified pixel spacing of 0.02 , approximately nyquist - sampling the diffraction limit at 2 @xmath1 m . \n the observations consisted of thousands of exposures of the visual binary , with integration times of @xmath3 sec for each frame . \n this short exposure time partially  froze \" the atmospheric seeing , so that the point - spread function ( psf ) consisted of distinguishable speckles . \n the 1.2 separation of the binary was large enough that the psfs did not significantly overlap in frames with good seeing . \n individual frames were calibrated in the standard way by subtracting mean sky frames , dividing by flatfield images , and  fixing \" bad pixels . \n a model was computed for the  bleed \" signal which extended along and perpendicular to the readout direction , and this was subtracted from the calibrated frame . for each frame , a measurement of the instantaneous point - spread function ( psf ) was made by masking all pixels on the side of the frame toward the irc , leaving only the primary . \n frames in which the instantaneous seeing was too poor for this procedure to cleanly separate the stars were rejected . for the rest , the fourier power spectrum of the psf frames , and the cross - spectrum ( _ i.e. , _ the fourier transform of the cross - correlation ) of the masked frame with the unmasked frame , were computed . \n if the primary star is unresolved , then in principle the ratio of the cross - spectrum to the psf frame s power spectrum is the fourier transform of the diffraction - limited image . \n raw frames produced by nirc suffer from semi - coherent electronic pattern noise which is typically concentrated in a small regions of the fourier domain . \n if not corrected , this noise limits the sensitivity of the holography technique . to identify the contaminated frequencies , \n a noise frame was constructed by replacing the pixels containing the stars with copies of an empty region near a corner of the field . \n the power spectrum of the noise frame was computed , and frequencies containing more power in the noise frame than the average over the series of unmasked frames at similar frequencies were marked as bad . \n the psf power and the cross - spectrum at uncontaminated frequencies were accumulated over the whole series of frames . \n a final image was reconstructed from them , with the use of an apodizing function to suppress high - frequency noise . \n the image was then rotated to standard orientation . \n the apodizing function chosen was the product of a gaussian and a hanning function . \n it produced a final image resolution of 81  mas ( fwhm ) . \n the resulting images for each of the three nights are presented in figure  1 . the image from each epoch is scaled to the maximum pixel level in the irc . \n these images display a dynamic range , measured as the brightness of the peak of the primary star in units of noise , of @xmath4 . \n this is much larger than is typical for a speckle image ; the improvement is due to the holography technique s use of instantaneous psf measurements instead of relying on a statistical consistency of the atmosphere between separate target and reference - star frames as in normal speckle interferometry . \n the technique does produce a residual artifact in the form of an apparent ridge of emission which runs approximately midway between the two stars and parallel to the direction of the mask used to make the psf frames . \n this is probably due to a small amount of flux from the primary which spills over into the masked region . in addition , in the final epoch there is a narrow strip which extends from the irc in a direction approximately north and exactly parallel to the detector readout . \n a direct k - band image of the region was taken without the image converter , so that the raw field was 38  ( @xmath5 au ) . \n frames were taken with the binary in two well - separated locations , and the reduction was done by computing the difference between these frames and pixel - fixing . \n the resulting image , presented in figure  2 , has much lower resolution but higher flux sensitivity than the holographic image . \n it shows the two stars surrounded by an arc of nebulosity which curves gently from the primary star . \n crrrrr 22 nov 1997 & 2.2 @xmath1 m & 0.15 & 931 & 0.32 & @xmath6 + 8 mar 1998 & 2.2 @xmath1 m & 0.15 & 1276 & 0.36 & @xmath7 + 3 nov 1998 & 2.2 @xmath1 m & 0.14 & 2230 & 0.40 & @xmath8 + \n the haro  610 infrared companion is clearly resolved in the image taken on each of the three nights . \n its peak is marginally resolved in all three images , with a deconvolved fwhm of @xmath9 mas , or 5 au , along cuts in the east - west direction . \n the peak is surrounded by a complex and irregular structure , the brightest part of which consists of a nebulous  tail \" that extends some 300 mas to the south . \n a fainter peak , which we designate haro  610  irc  sw , appears 400 mas to the southwest of the irc . \n finally , a narrow  arm \" extends 500 mas westward from a point just north of the peak . \n the irc underwent a significant morphological change during the observations , especially between the second and third epochs . between the first and third epochs \n , a new  tail \" appears to the north of the peak , reaching an extent of @xmath10 mas . \n it is fainter but wider than the southern tail . at the same time , irc  sw dimmed by a factor of @xmath11 compared to the irc s peak . \n the 2.2 @xmath1 m brightness of the irc , measured as a fraction of the brightness of the primary , more than doubled from 0.15 to 0.39 ( see table  1 ) . for comparison , \n lh found it to be 0.13 in september 1988 , and khl found 0.04 in october 1994 .    in order to compare the holographic images with the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) speckle measurements by lh \n , we projected the holographic images along position angle perpendicular to 355@xmath12 , computed the 1-d fourier amplitudes , and divided them by the amplitude of a projected point - source image made with the same apodization function . \n the first and third epochs show excellent agreement with the k - band amplitude curve of lh , while the middle epoch shows small ( @xmath13 ) depression in the zero - frequency level . \n = 15.0 cm    = 10.0 cm \n it would be natural to suppose that the circumstellar material surrounding the irc may be in the form of an optically - thick disk of gas and dust . \n peak with tails \" morphology in the final epoch qualitatively resembles simulations of a nearly edge - on disk ( _ e.g. , _ wood et al . \n 1998 ) , with the southern and northern tails tracing light scattering in the upper regions of the sunward - facing side of the disk , and the star located somewhere slightly to the west of the emission peak . \n such a disk is seen in hk  tauri , in which the secondary star is completely obscured and the disk is traced at visible and near - infrared wavelengths via the starlight it scatters ( stapelfeldt et al . \n 1998 ; koresko 1998 ) . in the case of haro  610 \n , the disk axis would be nearly perpendicular to the line joining the two stars , as one would expect if the disk lies in the orbital plane of the binary , and in contrast to the probable geometry of the hk  tauri system . \n the large extinction which would be produced by an edge - on disk is consistent with previous infrared spectroscopic and spectrophotometric results . \n a deep mid - infrared silicate absorption feature was seen toward the irc by van cleve et al . \n ( 1994 ) , while no such absorption was seen toward the primary . \n the low - resolution k - band spectrum measured by herbst , koresko , & leinert ( 1995 ) is a featureless continuum except for a molecular hydrogen @xmath14 s(1 ) emission line at 2.12 @xmath1 m . \n this suggests that the 2 @xmath1 m light originates primarily in dust , which may be heated either by stellar photons or by gravitational energy released via disk accretion . \n the lack of a detectable @xmath15 s(1 ) line was taken to indicate that the hydrogen is excited in a shock , presumably associated with either accretion or outflow , rather than pumped by ultraviolet photons .    however , the simple edge - on disk picture alone fails to account for several important features of the system . in particular \n , it is not obviously consistent with the existence of haro  610  irc  sw and the west - facing arm , or with the lack of a northern tail in the first epochs . \n if most of the circumstellar mass does reside in a disk , then it appears that the disk may have suffered strong perturbations which have disrupted its outer regions . \n the timescale over which the irc s morphology changes is too short to correspond to orbital or freefall motions in the material in the outer regions of the nebula , where the orbital period is on the order of centuries . \n this suggests that the changes are the result of changing illumination of the distant material due , _ \n e.g. , _ to shadowing of the central star by material orbiting within @xmath16 au of the star , or by starspots ( _ e.g. , _ wood & whitney 1998 ) . \n additional clues to the structure of the irc are provided by the outflows associated with the system . a giant herbig - haro flow which extends about 1.6 pc ( 39 arcmin ) along a position angle close to 222@xmath12 \n was found by devine et al . \n these authors suggest that the flow originates from the irc , which may be problematic in the context of the disk model , as the outflow s position angle is @xmath17@xmath12 from the sky - projected axis of the putative disk . \n movessian & makagian ( 1999 ) report the discovery of a jet which curves away from the binary at a position angle of 195@xmath12 , although they could not identify its source with either of the stars . \n this is presumably structure seen in our direct image , in which it appears to be associated with the primary . \n if the irc is the source of the giant h - h flow , then haro  610  irc  sw lies suggestively along the flow axis . but this object shows no sign of the @xmath18 mas outward motion which would be expected over the @xmath19 yr span of the observations if it moved at the @xmath10 km  s@xmath20 typical of the pattern speed in such a flow ( _ e.g. , _ eisloffel & mundt 1992 ) . by contrast , the free - fall velocity would produce an undectable motion . \n we conclude that irc  sw is more likely to be orbiting the irc or associated with envelope material than to be part of the outflow .    if irc \n sw were a _ \n stellar _ companion to the irc , it could easily perturb the irc s disk , and any disk of its own would be similarly perturbed , perhaps accounting for its photometric variability . \n a triple system would likely be unstable to significant orbital evolution or even ejection on timescales shorter than the age of haro  610 ( pendleton & black 1983 ) . \n on the other hand , irc \n sw s surface brightness is roughly consistent with a model in which an isotropically - scattering dusty surface is illuminated by unextincted light from the central star of the irc , which is taken to have t@xmath21 k and l@xmath22 ( khl ) . \n the low extinction seen by irc \n sw could result from its position along the outflow axis of the giant h - h flow , which would clear a path through the irc envelope , and the scattering surface would be either an irregularity in the surface of the outflow cavity or a knot of material within it . \n instabilities in the outflow ( devine et al . \n 1999 ) might account for the apparent variability of the object . \n the complex structure seen in the haro  610  irc is in stark contrast to the simple , beautifully regular shape of the nearly edge - on disk which surrounds hk  tauri  b. while it would be premature to draw strong conclusions from this about the irc class as a whole , it does suggest that at least in this object the characteristic low infrared color temperature may be the product of reprocessing and scattering in a disk which has been strongly perturbed , at least in its outer regions . \n the origin of this perturbation is not clear , but possibilities include interactions with the giant herbig - haro flow , residual infalling cloud material , or with a possible star embedded in irc  sw . \n it is a pleasure to thank a. bouchez for his assistance with the observations , f. roddier for a useful suggestion regarding the data reduction , and the anonymous referee for suggestions which improved the interpretation of the results . \n data presented herein were obtained at the w.m . \n keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration . \n the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m . \n keck foundation . \n this research was supported by the national aeronautics and space administration .", "StartTimeOffset": 1770710379139, "RequestID": "0ebe29e1f5e0a55dc94365fda0c5fe6e6ea01025", "TotalTokens": 3936}
{"ContextTokens": 3766, "GeneratedTokens": 130, "SynthesizedBody": "when a macroscopically flat solid is pulled horizontally over an also macroscopically flat substrate , for given rates of pulling and of normal loads , the solid undergoes an intermittent behavior made of periods where it sticks to the substrate followed by periods where it slips over the same substrate . \n several models have been written to explain this phenomenon . \n the first model explained this stick slip behavior by parameters of the system : the static friction and the dynamic friction coefficients and the normal load @xcite . in the years 1950 , bowden and tabor made the theory that the friction coefficient depends on the strength of the material @xcite . \n moreover , dieterich @xcite and heslot et al . \n @xcite demonstrated that the friction coefficients where not constant during one experiment , they showed that there was an aging process in the material . \n finally , baumberger @xcite showed that the transition from a continuous sliding to a stick slip behavior was dependent on the elasticity of the measuring set up . \n a model was introduced by dieterich , rice and ruina @xcite to give a mathematical basis to the stick slip phenomenon .    by the same way , \n if a granular medium is sheared by pulling an horizontal cover on the top of it , the granular system undergoes alternatively sticks ( i.e. the whole system is stopped ) and slips . \n this stick slip behavior depends on the rate at which the granular medium is pulled and on the normal load which is applied on it . \n several experiments have been made on granular matter under shear as well for dry grains @xcite as for cohesive grains @xcite.numerical simulations have been performed on this topic by thompson and grest @xcite . \n but the question of the elasticity of all the elements setting up the shear experiment has almost not been studied . \n baumberger @xcite has shown that the existence of a stick slip behavior when dragging a solid inside a granular medium , depends on the elasticity of the elastic component of the pulling set up . \n however , it is very difficult to estimate the elasticity of the shearing apparatus , and therefore of the grains and in case of cohesive grains , the elasticity of the interactions between neighbouring grains . a previous study @xcite has shown that in the case of a numerical model of the shearing , at a constant shearing rate , of two - dimensional disks , it is possible to replace the action of the grains by one single spring . but what happens if all the components of the experimental or numerical set up have their own elasticity ? in order to answer this question , we computed by a numerical model the shearing of disks in a shearing cell with non infinite and infinite elasticity , and with cohesion or without cohesion between neighbouring grains . \n molecular dynamics is a powerful numerical method to study the dynamics of granular materials @xcite . \n the model we used here is a version of molecular dynamics for granular flow with cohesion in a two - dimensional shearing cell @xcite . \n particles are modeled as n disks that have equal density @xmath0 and diameters @xmath1 . \n the only external force acting on the system results from gravity , @xmath2 . \n the particle - particle and particle - wall contacts are described in the

the effective radius ( mass ) of the particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the relative velocity of particle @xmath8 towards particle @xmath7 . \n the effective radius is defined here as the radius of the disk which effectively enters in the interaction with another disk , it can be smaller than the real disk radius in the case where the disks overlap or larger in the case of capillary interaction ( see below ) . \n the effective radius is proportional to the distance between the centers of the disks if these two are in interaction : @xmath10 assuming that the disks never overlap more than @xmath11 and therefore adapting the time step . \n the effective mass is defined here as the mass which contributes to the shearing , in our case all disks have their effective mass equal to their real mass except the disks which build the bottom of the shearing cell . \n @xmath12 ( resp . \n @xmath13 ) is the diameter of particle @xmath7 ( resp . \n @xmath8 ) and @xmath14 points from particle @xmath7 to particle @xmath8 . \n @xmath15 is a phenomenological dissipation coefficient . \n we model the friction force between particles by putting a virtual spring at the point of first contact . \n its elongation is integrated over the entire collision time and set to zero when the contact is lost . \n the maximum possible value of the restoring force in the shear direction ( i.e. in the plane perpendicular to the normal direction ) , according to coulomb s criterion , is proportional to the normal force multiplied by the friction coefficient @xmath16 . \n it gives a friction force @xmath17 which is written : @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the unit vector in the shear direction . \n when a particle collides with the cylinder wall , the same forces ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) act with infinite mass and radius for particle @xmath8 . \n the disks are allowed to rotate . \n the rotational force is given by : @xmath20    cohesive forces were modelled by adding a spring force to the normal force when particles are in contact : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the corresponding elastic constant ( with a dimension of a young modulus ) . \n when the distance ( proportional to the effective radius ) between the surface of the particles is lower than 10 % of the diameter of the smallest particle , the value of the spring constant is multiplied by the distance between the particles . \n this additive force is set to zero when the elongation of the virtual spring reaches a maximum length of 10% of the smallest particle diameter . \n this cohesive force is a good model for capillary forces between beads with nanoasperities . \n the disks are put in an horizontal and rectangular shearing cell with or without blades , one can see an example of this shearing cell in ref.@xcite . \n periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the left and right hand side of the cell . \n shear is applied on the disks in the shearing cell by translating the upper cover on which are linked blades to drag the disks or without any blades . \n the shear cell is made of disks in order to simplify the interactions of the bulk disks and the shear cell : the upper cover is made of disks of non zero effective mass ( allowing the vertical move of the cover ) and the bottom of the cell is made of disks with zero effective mass ( allowing a stable position of the shear cell with respect to gravity ) . \n shear is applied on the disks by translating the upper cover either at constant velocity , whatever the resistance to translation of the granular medium , or with a spring linked to the cover . in this last case , \n the acceleration @xmath23 and force @xmath24 acted by the cover on the disks assembly is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the elasticity constant of the spring pulling the cover and @xmath27 is the weight of the cover . \n the upper cover of the cell is allowed to undergo a vertical shift , the magnitude of this shift depending on the weight of this upper cover ( and therefore on the effective mass of the upper cover disks ) , on the velocity of the upper cover and on the disks assembly dilation . \n we added no vertical elasticity to the cover as it would be more difficult to analyze the results with one more elastic component . \n the parameters of our computations were the followings : the weight of the cover was equal to @xmath28 , the mass of one disk being equal to @xmath29 . \n the length of the cell was @xmath30 and the height of the blades was @xmath31 . \n we used @xmath32 disks . \n the dissipation coefficient was equal to @xmath33 , the young modulus was @xmath34 and the spring constant was @xmath35 for the case of cohesive disks . \n we computed the total force acted on the upper cover by the disk assembly as a resistance to shear . for this \n , we added only the horizontal coordinates of the forces acting on the cover . \n this total force is similar to a stress . \n the height of the cover increased after the beginning of the simulation for all cases of shear rates and elastic constants . \n results are given in figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . \n these figures represent different responses of the numerical set up as a function of the cover elasticity ( vertical coordinates ) and shearing rates ( horizontal coordinates ) . \n each symbol corresponds to one value of the cover elasticity and one value of the shearing rate , each of them given by its coordinates . for the sake of simplicity \n , we gave an elasticity of 100@xmath36 to covers with infinite elasticity as our plots are in log - log . \n five regions have been identified in these plots :    * i : regular in time ( with a characteristic frequency ) but irregular in shape ( noisy ) * ii : irregular in time and irregular in shape * iii : curved slip signal and irregular in time * iv : regular in shape and irregular in time * v : regular in shape and in time    figure 1 presents the different behaviors of the shear signal for a shear cell without blades and for disks without cohesion as a function of the shear rate and of the elasticity constant of the cover . \n figure 2 presents the same feature for disks with cohesion . \n figures 3 and 4 correspond to a shear cell with blades for respectively non cohesive and cohesive disks . \n an example of different stick slip signals is presented in figure 5 . \n the black bold curve corresponds to region ii , the long dashed curve corresponds to region iv and the thin continuous curve corresponds to region iii . \n let us first analyze the elasticity of the setup and disks leading to the behavior corresponding to region i in fig . \n 1,2,3 and 4 . \n region i is uniquely present when the cover is pulled with an infinite elasticity , i.e. when it slides at a constant rate . \n the presence of cohesion between the disks does not change this behavior neither the presence of blades on the cover . \n this characteristic behavior is the one which has been studied in ref . \n @xcite . in this previous study \n , the authors showed that the whole assembly of disks could be replaced by one single spring in the case of cohesive disks . here \n , we have the same behavior ( presence of a characteristic frequency of the shear signal but irregular signal ) even when there is no cohesion between the disks . \n straightforwardly , we can say that , as the cohesion has the dimension of a young modulus , it only modifies the resulting ( effective ) young modulus of the disks . \n therefore , the assembly of disks behaves as a single spring which is the only source of elasticity in the experiment . \n now , considering region ii , let us compare fig . 1,2,3 and 4 . in fig . 1 \n , corresponding to a setup with a varying elasticity and disks without cohesion , the shear signal is irregular in time and in shape for all the values of the elasticity of the cover but only for small shear rates . in fig . \n 2 , this behavior disappears for shear rates larger than 0.4@xmath37 for the same values of the elasticity of the cover . in fig . 3 and 4 , only elasticities of the cover larger than 10 lead to this behavior , in the case of shear rates smaller than 20@xmath37 . \n we can say that the three ( resp . \n two ) origins of elasticities for fig . 2 and 4 ( resp . \n for fig . 1 and 3 ) lead to an incoherent shear signal which in these cases has no characteristic frequency and is irregular in time . \n the system in this case is equivalent to 2 or 3 springs in series , with equivalent spring constant . \n the resulting shear signal is therefore incoherent . \n region iii corresponds to shear signals which are smooth but irregular in time . \n moreover , the shear signal corresponding to the stick and to the slip stages are curved , showing a non linearity in the elasticity of the experiment . \n region iii is absent in fig.1 and appears in fig . 2 3 and 4 for small spring constant ( equal to 1 ) of the cover . here \n again we can say that the experiment is equivalent to two or three springs in series ; but , contrarily to the behavior of the shear signal of region ii , the spring constant of the cover is small and becoming dominant in the behavior of the system ( we recall that the resulting spring constant of springs in series is the inverse of the sum of inverses of each spring constant ) . \n region iv corresponds to shear signals which are regular in shape but not regular in time ( with no characteristic frequency ) . as for region iii \n , the system in this case may be modelled by two or three springs in series , the spring with the lowest spring constant is dominant giving the behavior of the resulting shear signal . \n the difference between the spring constant of the cover and the one or two other spring constants ( representing the disks assembly and the cohesion ) is smaller than in the case of region iii .    in the case of region \n v , we can always consider that the system is equivalent to two or three springs in series . \n we can consider that there is a characteristic frequency of the shear signal because the two or three spring constants have each a characteristic frequency close from each other .    as a summary , \n let us calculate the spring constants of each of the components of the system . \n the spring constant @xmath26 of the cover is an input parameter of the computation . \n the spring constant @xmath38 of the beads without cohesion ( dry beads ) may be given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spring constant directly related to the young modulus @xmath4 of one bead . \n @xmath41 corresponds to the mean number of disks per vertical line in the shear cell while @xmath42 is the mean horizontal number of disks per horizontal line . \n this is equivalent to say that we have @xmath41 equivalent springs in series each of these equivalent springs being one line of @xmath43 disks in series . \n similarly , the equivalent spring constant @xmath44 of cohesive disks ( humid disks ) may be computed using the same formula but with a value of the equivalent spring constant @xmath45 of each disks modified in order to take account of the cohesion and of the young modulus which can be considered as springs acting in parallel @xmath46 . \n the equivalent spring constant of the assembly of disks is then approximatively equal to @xmath47 . \n depending on the geometry of the shear cell , the values of @xmath41 may vary . \n indeed , in a shear cell with blades , only the disks which are below the blades enter the shearing process . for the shear cell without blades , @xmath48 and for the shear cell with blades @xmath49 corresponding to the the number of active disks in the shear process , per vertical line \n . therefore , the actual values are for the cover @xmath50,for the shear cell without blades and for disks without cohesion @xmath51 and for disks with cohesion @xmath52 . in the case of the shear cell with blades @xmath53 and for disks with cohesion @xmath54 . \n the shear signal is regular in shape when @xmath26 is of the same order than @xmath38 or @xmath44 and for large shear rates , like in regions iv and v. otherwise , the shear signal is irregular in shape .    in ref . \n @xcite , we saw that the position of the spring corresponding to the assembly of disks could be modelled by the following equation : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the shear rate and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 the equivalent spring constant of the disks and @xmath59 the mass of the disks assembly . here \n again we may use this equation for the whole system assuming that the equivalent spring constant is @xmath60 and @xmath59 is the sum of the mass of the cover and of the disks assembly . \n therefore , one may see that if the value of @xmath56 is much larger than @xmath58 the shear signal presents a characteristic frequency like in regions i and v. if the value of @xmath56 is smaller than @xmath58 , no characteristic frequency appears like in regions ii , iii and iv . \n finally , we can say that the shape of the signal and its frequency may be analyzed separately . \n the shape of the signal depends on the relative values of all components of the system while the frequency of the shear signal depends on the mass , the shear rate and the elasticity of the system . \n we made a numerical simulations by molecular dynamics of the shearing of twodimensional disks . depending on the elastic constant of each component of the set up ( of the cover , of the disks , and of the cohesion between the disks ) and of the shear rate , the resulting simulated shear \n signal is either regular or irregular in shape , and with or without a characteristic frequency . \n an analytic analysis allowed us to understand this behavior in the light of the relative values of the elastic constants entering the setup . \n it appears that we found a regular shear signal only for given values of the elastic constants and of the shear rate .",

@xcite ) , shaped by a number of disruption mechanisms to produce field stars and associations . \n tidal tails have lower extinctions and less complicated star formation histories  and resulting stellar populations  than galaxy interiors . \n they therefore present a unique opportunity to study a relatively observationally simple , yet physically interesting environment , and assess how it shapes cluster sizes , color and magnitude distributions , and statistical properties . \n we may also compare what is observed in these environments to prior studies of galaxy interiors . \n we report our recent work in elucidating this issue with general diagnostics of cluster candidates detected in _ hst _ wfpc2 images . \n this represents a pilot study of using a large sample of galaxies with limited bandpass coverage to uncover the physics of star cluster formation and survival ;

average 95  sec over four above sets of data  @xcite . \n cytoplasmic flow in tubes reverses with period 54  sec  @xcite . \n further experiments might deal with establishing an exact link between oscillations of a protoplasmic tube s resistance and peristaltic oscillations of the tube  @xcite . \n frequency of electrical potential oscillations of physarum can be modified by tactile  @xcite and chemical  @xcite stimuli , by coloured illumination of a protoplasmic tube  @xcite , and by loading physarum with functional nano - particles  @xcite . \n the correlation between resistance frequency and frequency of electrical potential oscillations allows to speculate that frequency of resistance oscillation can be also tuned by chemical , optical and tactile control inputs . \n thus , we believe the physarum electrical oscillator is _ adjustable_. \n applicability of physarum oscillators in conventional electronic circuits is limited to none . \n physarum oscillators produce a very low frequency waveforms and therefore can only be used in computing devices where speed of information processing is not critical . \n thus a potential application domain of physarum oscillators is in self - growing biological computing devices and hybrid bio - silicon devices , and amorphous bio - inspired robots  @xcite . \n another promising application would be in disposable bio - sensors and bio - circuits : living physarum oscillator can produce stable waveforms for up to 5 - 7 days ; such time frame is sufficient to make reliable measurements and to perform non - time consuming computations . \n a single protoplasmic tube of an acellular slime mould _ p. polycephalum _ can be employed as a living electronic oscillator which produces stable , accurate , and , in principle , adjustable waveforms . \n this is because the tube exhibits periodic peristaltic contractions which lead to oscillations of the tube s resistance . \n de lacy costello b. , adamatzky a. assessing the chemotaxis behavior of _ physarum polycephalum _ to a range of simple volatile organic chemicals . \n communicative & integrative biology 6:5 , e25030 ;

{"ContextTokens": 4005, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "the supernova ( sn ) mechanism explaining how massive stars end in a central collapse to a neutron star ( or a black hole ) and explosive ejection of the outer layers is still debated . \n it has been related to neutrino emission from the hot collapsed core and accreted matter @xcite , and this ( regular ) scenario is again becoming more and more promising with recent multi - d hydrodynamic approaches and improved ( spectral ) neutrino transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the equation of state ( eos ) caused explosion scenario has found some recent revival , based on the quark - hadron phase transition at supernuclear densities @xcite , but its working depends on specific choices of eos properties in a very narrow parameter range . \n other options are related to rotation and magnetic fields , a topic which has been discussed for more than 30 years , but required three - dimensional ( 3d ) modeling and had therefore only been addressed with limited success in the early days . \n the major outcome was that high rotation rates and ( possibly unrealistically high ) magnetic fields were required to launch explosions . \n the question is whether such magnetic fields can be attained during collapse with rotation and on which timescale after collapse . \n this topic has recently been re - addressed by @xcite and @xcite . in the present letter \n we want to present results obtained with our 3d magneto - hydrodynamics code fish @xcite . \n there is another reason why such magnetohydrodynamically driven explosions are of possible interest : the search for the site of a ( full ) @xmath0-process early in galactic evolution . \n the initially postulated neutrino wind in regular ( neutrino - driven ) supernovae @xcite ( a ) did not result in having sufficiently high entropies , and ( b ) in addition , the innermost ejecta turned out to be proton - rich instead of neutron - rich @xcite , a situation which has now also been shown in long - term simulations . \n electron - capture supernovae , which explode without a long phase of accretion onto the proto - neutron star ( pns ) , apparently provide more favorable conditions @xcite . \n however , also the proton to nucleon ratios obtained under such conditions do not support a strong @xmath0-process , which successfully reproduces the platinum peak of r - elements around @xmath4 . \n a similar result was recently obtained for core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosions triggered by a quark - hadron phase transition during the early post - bounce phase when investigating their detailed nucleosynthesis @xcite . \n both types of events might support a weak but not a full @xmath0-process . \n neutron star mergers have been shown to be powerful sources of @xmath0-process matter , in fact ejecting a factor of 100 to 1000 more @xmath0-process material than required on average from ccsne , if those would have to explain solar @xmath0-process element abundances . \n this would actually support the large scatter of eu / fe found in very metal - poor stars . \n the only problem is that it might be hard to explain the early appearance of @xmath0-process matter for metallicities at and below [ fe / h ] = @xmath5 . \n some recent studies , which include the fact that our galaxy is possibly the result from smaller merging subsystems ( with different star formation rates ) have been expected to show a way out of this dilemma . \n if this can not be solved , we need another strong @xmath0-process source already at low metallicities , and possibly jets from rotating core collapses with strong magnetic fields could be the solution @xcite .    the present letter has the aim to explore the results from our 3d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) calculations , which lead to bipolar jet ejection . \n the following section [ sec:3d mhd - ccsn ] will discuss the initial models and the explosion dynamics ; section [ sec : nucleosynth ] will present nucleosynthesis results . \n section [ sec : discussion_outlook ] is devoted to a discussion of uncertainties and an outlook on future investigations . \n the calculation presented here was performed with the computational setup similar to our previous investigations . \n the initially innermost ( 600 km)@xmath6 of the massive star are covered by a 3d cartesian domain uniformly discretized by @xmath7 cells , resulting in a 1 km resolution , that is embedded in a spherically symmetric domain encompassing the iron core and parts of the silicon shell . \n the magnetic fluid is evolved with the ` fish ` code @xcite , solving the ideal mhd equations . \n the spherically symmetric domain is evolved with the ` agile ` code @xcite . \n the gravitational potential is approximated by an effective axisymmetric mass distribution that includes general relativistic monopole corrections . \n we use the @xcite eos with nuclear compressibility 180 mev . \n we have included a lagrangian component in the form of tracer particles which are passively advected with the flow . \n they record the thermodynamic conditions of a particular fluid element and serve as input to the post - processing nucleosynthesis calculations . \n the transport of the electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos is approximated by a 3d spectral leakage scheme , based on previous gray leakage schemes ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n the neutrino energy is discretized with 12 geometrically increasing energy groups spanning the range @xmath8 mev . the amount of energy and particles locally released is calculated for each bin as an interpolation between the diffusive rates and the ( free streaming ) production rates , depending on the local neutrino optical depth . for the computation of the spectral optical depth we have used a ray - by - ray axisymmetric approximation , calculated on a polar grid encompassing the full 3d cartesian domain discretized uniformly with 1 km radial spacing and 30 angular rays covering the full @xmath9 $ ] realm . \n all fundamental neutrino reactions have been included ( neutrino scattering on nucleons and nuclei , neutrino absorption / emission on nucleons and nuclei ) , providing detailed spectral emissivities and opacities @xcite . \n inside the neutrinosphere , weak equilibrium is assumed and trapped neutrinos are modeled accordingly ; outside of it , no explicit absorption is considered . \n thus we can only follow neutrino emission and the associated neutronization of matter . \n however , the up to now microphysically most complete two - dimensional axisymmetric study of mhd - ccsn with multi - group flux - limited diffusion neutrino transport performed by @xcite has shown , that neutrino heating contributes only @xmath10 to the explosion energy and is therefore subdominant . \n this justifies our pragmatic approach at first . \n we employed the pre - collapse @xmath11 model of @xcite . \n although the model provides profiles for rotation and magnetic fields , we use an analytic prescription for their distributions and we will comment on this choice in section [ sec : discussion_outlook ] . \n the initial rotation law was assumed to be shellular with @xmath12 , @xmath13 s@xmath14 and @xmath15 km corresponding to an initial ratio of rotational energy to gravitational binding energy @xmath16 . \n for the magnetic field we have assumed a homogeneous distribution of a purely poloidal field throughout the computational domain of strength @xmath17 g corresponding to an initial ratio of magnetic energy to gravitational binding energy @xmath18 . \n the computed model then undergoes gravitational collapse and experiences core - bounce due to the stiffening of the eos above nuclear saturation density . \n conservation of angular momentum in combination with the collapse leads to a massive spin - up of the core , reaching @xmath19 at bounce , and significant rotationally induced deformations . during the collapse the magnetic field \n is amplified by magnetic flux conservation reaching a central strength of @xmath20 g and @xmath21 at bounce . \n after bounce , differential rotation winds up the poloidal field very quickly into a very strong toroidal field increasing the magnetic energy / pressure at the expense of rotational energy . \n consequently , strongly magnetized regions appear near the rotational axis with an associated magnetic pressure quickly reaching and exceeding that of the local gas pressure . \n the lorentz force then becomes dynamically important and matter near the rotational axis is lifted from the pns and drives a bipolar outflow , i.e. , jets are launched . \n the jets rapidly propagate along the rotational axis and quickly reach the boundary of the initial 3d domain . in order to follow the jet propagation further \n , we have continuously extended the 3d domain to a final size of @xmath22 km at @xmath23 ms after bounce . \n figure  [ fig : fig01 ] displays a snapshot at the final time .    the quickly expanding bipolar jets transport energy and neutron rich material outward against the gravitational attraction of the pns . \n we have estimated the ejected mass @xmath24 and explosion energy @xmath25 erg by summing over the fluid cells that are gravitationally unbound . \n we defined a fluid cell as unbound if its total specific energy ( internal+kinetic+magnetic+potential ) is positive and if the radial velocity is pointing outward . \n these are admittedly crude lower bound estimates and these numbers were still growing at the end of the simulation . \n the nucleosynthesis calculations are performed with a new extended reaction network @xcite which represents an advanced ( numerically and physically ) update of the basnet network ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we use the reaction rates of ( * ? ? ? \n * for the frdm mass model ) . \n we use the same weak interaction rates ( electron / positron captures and @xmath26-decays ) as in @xcite . additionally , we include neutron capture and neutron induced fission rates following and @xmath26-delayed fission probabilities as described in @xcite . \n the tracer particles obtained from the simulation provide density , temperature , and electron fraction for the nuclear network , as well as position and velocity , from the beginning to the end of the simulation ( @xmath27 ) . \n after @xmath28 , thermodynamic variables are evolved following the prescription in @xcite . \n @xcite have shown that the details of the expansion only have a minor impact on the final abundances . \n for the post - processing we only consider gravitationally unbound tracer particles ( see section [ sec:3d mhd - ccsn ] ) . in order to obtain mass integrated abundances \n we distribute the total ejected mass equally among all ejected tracers . \n it could be shown that this yields very similar results to post - processing calculations based on the conditions in the unbound cells at the final time @xcite . \n the electron fraction is a key input for the nucleosynthesis and strongly depends on details of the challenging neutrino transport . \n although neutrino absorption is crucial to determine the @xmath29 , it is not yet included in the hydrodynamical simulations ( where it is expected to have a minor impact on the dynamics ; see section [ sec:3d mhd - ccsn ] ) . \n therefore , we present two different nucleosynthesis calculations : ( 1 ) @xmath29 is taken from the original tracer particles , ( 2 ) the effects of neutrino absorption on @xmath29 are included also in the network . in this second approach , \n we post - process the data from the tracer and use the neutrino information obtained with the leakage scheme ( section [ sec:3d mhd - ccsn ] ) . \n we use integrated neutrino luminosities to update the electron fraction outside the neutrinosphere ( neglecting the effect of neutrino energy deposition on the matter temperature ) . \n the electron fraction of the tracer is evolved using approximated rates for the neutrino emission and absorption on nucleons ( see , e.g. , ) .    in both of our approaches for @xmath29 , \n the network calculations start when the temperature decreases to @xmath30  gk . in the case with post - processing corrections for neutrino absorption \n , we also consider neutrino reactions from @xcite in the nucleosynthesis network . \n the required neutrino luminosities and mean energies are given by the leakage scheme and assumed to be constant and equal to their values at @xmath31 .    the evolution of @xmath29 is presented in figure  [ fig : fig02 ] for the original simulation data and for the estimate of neutrino absorption . in the latter \n , high energy @xmath32 captures on protons decrease @xmath29 outside the @xmath32-neutrinosphere . \n however , beyond the @xmath33-neutrinosphere , @xmath33 absorption on neutrons dominates and @xmath29 increases . the fast expansion and the relatively low neutrino mean energy limit the effect of the absorption . \n this trend is confirmed also by the network for @xmath34  gk . \n figure  [ fig : fig03 ] shows the ejected mass as a function of @xmath29 for the original simulation data and for the case including neutrino absorption . \n these corrections shift the peak distribution from @xmath35 to @xmath36 and broaden it toward higher @xmath29 . in both approaches , at the onset of the nucleosynthesis , the density is still relatively high , @xmath37 , and the electron fraction rather low , @xmath38 . \n this leads to an initial nuclear statistical equilibrium composition rich in neutrons and neutron - rich nuclei . \n such conditions are closer to neutron star mergers than to the high entropy wind , which is characterized by an alpha - rich freeze - out with few nuclei close to stability and small amount of neutrons . \n mass integrated abundances are presented in figure  [ fig : fig04 ] for the two treatments of the electron fraction and compared to solar @xmath0-process abundances ( e.g. , ) . \n nuclei around the second ( @xmath39 ) and third ( @xmath40 ) @xmath0-process peaks , as well as the pb region , can be synthesized in the jets . \n note that the improvements in the electron fraction calculation result only in minor variations of the abundances . \n moreover , the position of the peaks nicely agrees with solar system abundances . \n however , the agreement is not equally good for all mass numbers as the nuclei between peaks are slightly underproduced . \n note also that the large trough in the mass range @xmath41 is mainly due to the strong @xmath42 shell - closure of the frdm mass model . \n similar deficiencies were discussed by @xcite and can be cured by using a different mass model . \n nuclei in the region below the second peak are produced mainly by charged - particle reactions which occur only in the tracer particles with relatively high electron fraction . \n this also explains the lower abundances in the range @xmath43 for the case of @xmath29 without neutrino absorption ( figure  [ fig : fig04 ] ) . \n this calculation reaches lower @xmath29 which leads to higher neutron densities and a more abundant third peak and pb region . \n magneto - rotationally driven supernovae suffer one main critique point : the simultaneous presence of fast rotation and strong magnetic fields in the progenitor before collapse . \n recent progenitor models computed by @xcite suggest that these special conditions are not reached in common evolutionary paths of massive stars . \n however , the low - metallicity models of @xcite indicate that for a fraction , perhaps 1% , of all massive stars , favorable conditions can appear under special circumstances . \n this rarity of progenitors with these special initial conditions can also be put into accordance with the observed scatter of @xmath0-process element abundances at low metallicity , combined with the high @xmath0-process production of @xmath44 per event . \n this indicates that these elements have been produced in relatively scarce but efficient events . \n therefore , the rare progenitor configurations used here could naturally provide a strong @xmath0-process site in agreement with observations of the early galaxy chemical evolution . \n currently , the aim to perform long - term global 3d simulations of ccsne , including possibly a sophisticated radiative transfer of neutrinos , and the aim to simulate the local flow instabilities , leading to magnetic field amplification , seem to be mutually exclusive . given this difficulty \n , we followed here the common approach in the literature by taking sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields . by doing so \n , it is hypothesized that there is a physical process that can sufficiently quickly amplify the magnetic field to dynamic importance by extracting the free rotational energy in differential rotation . \n this motivates our choice of the high initial poloidal field strength , which by flux compression and rotational winding leads to magnetic fields whose magnitude roughly agree with those expected from the magnetorotational instability at saturation . \n there are additional shortcomings in the treatment presented here . \n this includes that thermodynamic properties of tracer particles are only extrapolated beyond the end of the mhd calculation and the nucleosynthesis results were not yet tested with several nuclear mass models . \n but the main outcome of this investigation is that full 3d calculations can support the emergence of bipolar jets and that these are not artifacts of up to now axisymmetric approaches @xcite . \n such explosions , resulting from the individual evolution of massive stars rather than complicated binary histories of neutron star mergers , could explain strong @xmath0-process features during early galactic evolution as observed in many low metallicity stars . \n the @xmath0-process production is very efficient , a factor of 100 more than expected on average from supernovae , if they would be responsible for solar @xmath0-process abundances . \n the question remains : whether magnetars  with the magnetic fields required for this outcome  result from about 1% of all core collapses or are rarer events . \n apparently present knowledge permits this option @xcite . \n the magnetorotationally driven supernova simulation presented here provides a scenario for a strong @xmath0-process site seemingly consistent with observations of the early chemical evolution of our galaxy . \n future studies should investigate the effects of the progenitor configuration ( like mass , magnetic field and rotation rate ) , the nuclear input ( in particular the mass formula ) , and a more consistent treatment of neutrino interactions on the robustness of the conclusions drawn here . \n we thank t. rauscher and i. panov for useful discussions and help with reaction rates and fission . \n we acknowledge support and funding by the swiss national science foundation ( snsf ) . \n a.a . was supported by feodor lynen fellowship ( humboldt foundation ) and by the helmholtz -

{"ContextTokens": 3373, "GeneratedTokens": 197, "SynthesizedBody": "a long standing goal in optics is the development and improvement of precision optical metrology . in the first paper on weak values in 1988 @xcite , aharanov , \n albert and vaidman suggested that the weak value effect might be used as an amplifier in order to measure ( in the case they were considering ) the value of a small magnetic field by looking at the anomalously large deflection of a beam of atoms traversing a stern - gerlach apparatus . \n the general validity of this weak value effect was later shown experimentally in an optical context by ritchie _ \n @xcite , who replaced the magnetic spin with transverse polarization , and brunner _ et al . _ \n @xcite , who illustrated the pervasiveness of the weak value effect in common optical telecom networks . \n more recently , the amplification properties of this weak value effect have been exploited in similar optical systems to precisely measure beam deflection @xcite , phase shifts @xcite , frequency shifts @xcite , time delays @xcite , and even temperature shifts @xcite , by using either polarization or which - path degrees of freedom . \n although these experiments can be described using classical wave optics @xcite , the analysis using quantum techniques provides additional insight and allows for future extension to cases with no classical counterpart . \n hence , we shall continue to use a quantum approach in this work as well . \n our theoretical analysis begins with the rochester setup @xcite , where the tilt of a moving mirror within an interferometer is detected from the signal on a split - detector . \n while this setup has a sub - picoradian resolution with only milliwatts of laser power , there are a number of ways this can be improved to yield even greater sensitivity . \n a generic shortcoming of weak - value - related metrological techniques is the fact that only a small fraction of the events are `` post - selected '' , while the vast majority of events are intentionally thrown away . \n the main goal of the current work is to investigate how this situation can be further improved if those events are recycled . \n this will be done by taking photons which are not post - selected and reinjecting them back into the interferometer , so that eventually , every photon can be post - selected in principle . \n we will see that this strategy does indeed lead to an improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio of the desired parameter , effectively given by the power increase of the split - detection signal . \n moreover , since the existing single - pass weak - value amplification already achieves the sensitivity of standard measurement techniques ( such as homodyne detection ) but with lower technical noise @xcite , the improvements from recycling should _ exceed _ the sensitivity of the standard techniques . \n we note that because we employ not just a single pass , but many passes of a given photon through the interferometer , the simple weak value formula used in the first paper on the subject @xcite will no longer suffice , and we must develop a theoretical formalism for multiple passes that will account for the amplification of the deflection , as well as the probability of reaching the detector after some number of traversals . \n while the recycling scheme is an important advance in its own right ( and can be generically applied to all weak value amplification schemes ) , it also lends itself to further enhancement if combined with other precision metrology techniques currently in use . \n for example , the inclusion of a spatial filter or parity - flipping element to zeno - stabilize the beam , or the use of a squeezed reference beam @xcite could significantly reduce degradation effects and quantum noise , respectively . \n the recycling technique , therefore , sets the stage for combined weak value / quantum light amplification strategies for future research . \n furthermore , though our present work focuses on a novel pulsed recycling method , possible extensions to continuous wave operation may allow for the use of power recycling @xcite and signal recycling @xcite techniques , both of which are in use in modern gravitational wave detectors @xcite . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section \n [ sec : qual ] we give a heuristic estimation of the expected gains from a recycling setup based on qualitative power considerations and accessible laboratory conditions . in section  [ sec : collimated ] we analytically compute the exact recycling solution for a particular setup under the assumption that the beam can stay perfectly collimated . in section  [ sec : diverging ] we relax this assumption with a numerical treatment including diffraction effects . \n we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n our baseline for comparison will be the rochester continuous wave ( cw ) sagnac interferometric scheme described in @xcite . \n we wish to improve the detected signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by using a combination of pulsed laser operation with the same average power output and a design that sends the undetected portion of each pulse back into the interferometer . \n such a setup is illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] for reference . \n however , before committing to a particular recycling design we can make fairly general estimations about the increases in sensitivity that we expect from any similar recycling scheme .     between the clockwise ( @xmath0 ) and counter - clockwise ( @xmath1 ) traveling paths . \n the piezo - driven mirror imparts a transverse momentum kick @xmath2 that differs by a sign for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 paths . \n a split detector is placed at the dark port to measure a resulting pulse deflection . \n the h - polarized part of the pulse that exits the bright port is rotated again by the active pc back to v before being confined by the pbs and mirror to return the pulse to the interferometer through the pc , now _ \n inactive_. ]      the constraints on how much we can increase the power collected by the dark port detector in order to improve the measurement sensitivity depend crucially on the relative time scales involved , which include :    1 .   the pulse duration @xmath3 being emitted by the laser . for typical lasers \n this can vary between @xmath4 ns and @xmath5  fs reasonably , which correspond to pulse lengths of @xmath6 m and @xmath7 m , respectively . \n 2 .   the repetition period @xmath8 of the laser . for typical lasers \n the repetition rate @xmath9 can vary from @xmath4  hz to several ghz reasonably . \n 3 .   the traversal period @xmath10 of the interferometer setup . \n this is determined by the physical size of the setup . as an upper - bound estimate , a @xmath11 \n m long recycling setup will have a total period of @xmath12 ns . \n the gating time @xmath13 for adding new pulses to the interferometer . \n this will determine the minimum inter - pulse spacing @xmath14 inside the interferometer . \n this also must be strictly less than the time between pulses emitted by the laser @xmath15 so that every new laser pulse can be injected . for a pockels cell , @xmath16 ns . \n these are summarized in table  [ tab : timescales ] . \n .relevant time scales for a recycling experiment . [ \n cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ] \n and @xmath17 . in order of \n ( blue , solid ) , ( red , dashed ) , ( purple , dot - dashed ) , and ( brown , dotted ) we show weak initial diverging lenses with extreme focal lengths @xmath18 and no lens . \n the ( black , dashed ) curve shows the scaling given by power considerations in eq .  . \n here @xmath19 refers to the snr of a single unrecycled pulse with an optimally chosen focal length of @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the accumulated snr over @xmath22 traversals for the indicated lens choices . \n , width=288 ]    by assuming a collimated beam , we have so far neglected beam propagation effects in the analysis , as well as any lens effects that could further change the detection physics . in order to incorporate these effects , \n we now alter our measurement operators and pursue a numerical approach . \n we find that these effects may slightly enhance the snr gains from recycling before saturation due to the finite detector size , but do not fundamentally alter the basic power - scaling behavior . \n for that reason , it will be sufficient to illustrate only the weak - value regime as an example .    extending the collimated analysis in section  [ sec : collimated ] to include beam propagation leads to a replacement of the measurement operators with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the carrier momentum of the pulse , and @xmath26 is the propagation length from piezo to 50:50 beam splitter @xcite \n . the number density will then involve the composite measurement operator @xmath27 adding a diverging lens with focal length @xmath28 also modifies the initial state with an operator @xmath29 . \n hence , powers of the following modified operators will appear in the full solution ,    [ eq : recursiveparts ] @xmath30    which can be simplified recursively , as detailed in appendix  [ sec : recursiveappendix ] . \n the effect of a diverging lens is considered for comparison with the unrecycled experiment in ref . \n @xcite , where such a lens was able to enhance sensitivity . \n table  [ tab : numericalparameters ] shows the parameters which describe the laser and experimental geometry . \n our choice of @xmath25 corresponds to the 780 - 800 nm lasers used in @xcite , and the 3-meter interferometer length @xmath26 is taken from the generous upper bound estimate discussed in section  [ sec : qual ] as a worst case scenario for beam divergence effects . for the weak - value regime of small @xmath31 and @xmath32 \n such that @xmath33 , we found that it was more computationally efficient to expand the sine and cosine functions in to second order in @xmath2 and fourth order in @xmath32 , as shown in appendix  [ sec : truncation ] . to test the validity of this truncation \n , we initially set the interferometer length @xmath26 to zero so that a comparison could be made with the previously calculated collimated solutions . \n we restrict our attention to the snr gains achieved by recycling a single pulse for @xmath22 traversals , since adding more pulses leads to a simple scaling of the single pulse result . \n the snr gains for different choices of initial diverging lens are shown in fig . \n [ fig : snrplateaus ] , where they are compared to the ideal power - scaling curve that we expect from our qualitative considerations given by . in all cases , \n the expected gains roughly follow the qualitative power scaling rule for a large number of traversals before saturating due to the beam growing larger than the finite size of the split - detector . \n note that the beam divergence mitigates the snr decay that was observed for the collimated case , even without beam stabilization due to flipping or zeno reshaping . \n by investigating the optical design shown in fig .  [ \n fig : setup ] , we have shown how a single optical pulse can be trapped inside the interferometer until the photons all exit the dark port and are `` post - selected , '' greatly boosting the sensitivity of the precision measurement . \n the added power accumulated at the detector within a fixed duration of time is the dominant source of sensitivity gain . \n further increases are achievable by trapping multiple pulses in the interferometer simultaneously . \n the number of trapped pulses is limited by the length of the pulses , the gating frequency of current pockels cells , and the physical size of the interferometer . \n we carefully analyzed the case of a collimated beam and showed that repeated post - selections cause a walk - off effect in the recycled pulse , which tends to diminish the snr . \n however , we also showed that these walk - off effects can be easily corrected by zeno reshaping , or by a parity flip , which reflects the beam around its optic axis on each traversal . \n somewhat surprisingly , the gains with parity correction can even exceed those expected from the power scaling . including propagation effects \n does not destroy the sensitivity gain shown for the collimated case , but instead can produce additional enhancement .    while these sensitivity gains alone are a substantial improvement over the original idea , the combination of these techniques with other established metrology techniques  such as the use of a squeezed reference beam \n could further increase the sensitivity beyond that indicated here . \n we acknowledge support from the us army research office grants no . \n 62270phii : stir , and no . w911nf-09 - 0 - 01417 , as well as the national science foundation grant no . dmr-0844899 . \n 27ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) \n @noop `` , ''   ( ) , @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) in  @noop _ _  ( ,  )  pp . \n @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ) \n using equations and from above , an exact recursive simplification can be constructed . \n written explicitly in the momentum basis we have @xmath34 where the functions @xmath35 are given by the recursion relation @xmath36 the overall measurement operator is then given simply by multiplying the unitary operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the right . \n note that each pulse retains the phase and momentum information accumulated from previous traversals . \n given an input gaussian profile as in , we find @xmath39 with @xmath40    the solution with no initial diverging lens is given by taking limit @xmath41 , which modifies equation   with the replacement @xmath42 . \n similarly , setting @xmath43 recovers the collimated solution as expected . \n truncating the measurement operators that include propagation effects to second order in @xmath2 and fourth order in @xmath32 for the weak value regime produces the expressions ,    [ eq : approximateexpansions ] @xmath44{\\langle p \\rvert } , \\nonumber \\\\   { \\hat{\\bm u}}_\\ell^2 { \\hat{\\bm m}}_+ & = \\int \\ ! \\mathrm{d}p{\\lvert p\\rangle}e^{-ip^2\\ell / k_0}\\ , \\times \\\\   & \\qquad \\left[1 - \\frac{\\phi^2}{8 } + \\frac{\\phi^4}{384 } + \\frac{ik\\phi}{2}\\partial_p - \\frac{ik\\phi^3}{48}\\partial_p \n \\right.\\nonumber \\\\   & \\qquad\\quad\\left . \n + \\frac{k^2}{2}\\partial_p^2 - \\frac{k^2\\phi^2}{16}\\partial_p^2\\right]{\\langle p \\rvert } . \n \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]", "StartTimeOffset": 1868782142959, "RequestID": "dceb76765d910824d99ef6d97f727ad081e9a0dc", "TotalTokens": 3570}

napiwotzki 1997 ; heber , reid &  werner 2000 ) . \n a complete description of the data taken with the int is given in morales - rueda et al . \n our sample ( as of july 2003 ) contains 117 systems , 80 from the palomar - green ( pg ) survey , 16 from the kitt peak downes ( kpd ) survey and 12 from the edinburgh - cape ( ec ) survey .      to measure the radial velocities of the lines we perform least squares fitting of a model line profile that consists of 3 gaussians . \n this fitting consists of several steps : * 1 . \n * continuum normalise the spectra , * 2 . \n * use default fixed values for the fwhms and heights of the 3 gaussians and fit all the spectra simultaneously to obtain the overall mean velocity , * 3 . \n * fit all the lines simultaneously by fixing the overall velocity ( obtained in previous step ) and allowing the fwhms and heights of the 3 gaussians to vary * 4 . \n * fit the spectra individually this time fixing the fwhms and heights to the values obtained in step 3 and allowing for the velocities to be variable , * 5 . * \n shift out the velocities obtained in step 4 for each spectrum and obtain a more refined value for the fwhms and heights of the 3 gaussians and * 6 . \n * fix the fwhms and heights to the refined values from step 5 and measure individual velocities for each spectrum . \n we use as many balmer lines as there are present in each spectrum to perform the fitting . see fig . \n [ fig1 ] for an example of fitting two balmer lines . \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )      for the red spectra ( up to august 2001 ) the statistical uncertainties are of the order of 1km / s whereas for the blue spectra the uncertainties are of the order of 2km / s ( a tenth of a pixel ) . \n we know that there are also other unaccounted sources of error that are probably not correlated with the orbit or the statistical errors , i.e. slit - filling , intrinsic variability of the star . \n we estimate these systematic errors by assuming that when added in quadrature with the raw uncertainties they will give us a reduced @xmath5 = 1 . \n we assume that in all cases the systematic uncertainty is at least 2km / s ( @xmath6 a tenth of a pixel ) and this value works well for most systems . in some cases \n the systematic error turns out to be larger , with the largest value being 5km / s for kpd0025 + 5402 . \n we fit the data with a model composed of a sinusoid and a constant ( cumming , marcy &  butler 1999 ) to determine the orbital periods . \n this method works better than the lomb - scargle periodogram for small numbers of points . for each fit \n we calculate its associated @xmath5 and select the solution with the minimum @xmath5 value . \n an example of a periodogram and a radial velocity curve folded on the orbital period are presented in fig.[fig2 ] .    to distinguish between competing aliases ( those separated by @xmath7 20 ) we use a technique developed by marsh , dhillon &  duck ( 1995 ) and later adapted to this study by morales - rueda et al . \n ( 2003 ) to calculate the probability of the true orbital period being further than 1 and 10 per cent from the value obtained . \n we assume our values are correct if the probability of the period being wrong is @xmath8 0.1 per cent . \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 ) \n in fig .  [ fig3 ] \n we present the number of sdb binaries known when this paper was produced versus their orbital periods . \n the systems included in the figure are those presented in fig . \n 4 of morales - rueda et al . \n ( 2003 ) plus 7 new ones from our sample . during this workshop \n a few more sdb binaries were presented by edelmann et al . \n which have not been included in the figure . \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    the picture we now have of how the orbital periods of sdb binaries are distributed is very different from what it was before we started this program . \n we can see that the distribution extends toward longer periods than it was initially thought . \n another important feature is the excess of systems at orbital periods of the order of 1 day ( the 1 day bin actually includes systems with orbital periods between 0.32 and 1 days ) . \n these systems should be more difficult to detect as one requires more observations to be able to distinguish between the orbital period and the observational aliases \n . this feature has been seen by other authors ( green , private communication ) . \n thanks to the long time baseline of our observations we are starting to detect binary systems with longer orbital periods , i.e. 4 systems with orbital periods of tens of days and the first one with a period of hundreds of days . \n maxted et al . \n discuss somewhere else in these proceedings the nature of the companions to these sdbs in detail . \n it is worth pointing out here that we find 2 systems in our sample with m dwarf companions , pg1017 - 086 ( maxted et al . \n 2002 ) and pg1329 + 159 ( maxted et al . in preparation ) . \n 19 others are found to have white dwarf ( wd ) companions ( maxted et al . in preparation ) . \n han et al . ( 2002 , 2003 ) present five possible channels for the formation of sdb stars , three of them will form sdbs in binary systems . \n [ fig4 ] shows the orbital period distribution predicted by their favoured model . \n the plot also presents our data in the form of vertical ticks on the horizontal axis . \n most of the binaries in our sample seem to have formed via the second common envelope ( ce ) ejection channel ( short period binaries with wd companions ) , some via the first ce ejection channel ( short to intermediate periods with main sequence companions ) . \n their models predict the formation of a large number of long period binaries via the first roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) channel ( first suggested by tutukov &  yungleson 1990 ) . up to this day \n we have only detected one of such system with an orbital period of a few hundred days in our sample . \n we seem to be missing a very large population of binaries with large orbital periods . \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 ) \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    our sample suffers from several important biases :    * \\1 . \n targets have been selected from 3 main surveys , pg , kpd and ec . \n the pg survey is biased against companions of g and k spectral type as any target with a spectrum showing caii h - lines was taken off the survey . \n this should be taken into account when looking at the companions of sdbs as most of the ones from the pg survey will be wds instead of main sequence stars . \n this has important consequences when one intends to compare binary formation models with observations . \n it is difficult to assess how important this bias is . \n a second important bias is given by the resolution of the spectra . \n up to now we have used intermediate resolution spectrographs to measure radial velocities . \n longer period systems will show smaller amplitude radial velocities and we are probably missing them . \n the use of higher resolution spectrographs might change significantly the picture we have at the moment . * \n \\3 . only now , after almost four years of observations , is the time baseline getting long enough to detect the longer period systems . \n this can explain the dearth of long period systems compared to han et al.s ( 2003 ) predictions . \n all targets we have observed are bright ( v @xmath9 14.5 ) . \n it is also well known that the pg survey is incomplete at bright magnitudes due to saturation of the plates . \n all targets are in the disk of the galaxy ( see fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n the more sdbs we study the more binaries we find , the fraction we find being of the order of 2/3 in agreement with maxted et al . \n most of the binaries found seemed to have formed via the first and second ce ejection phases but we are starting to find systems that might have formed through the first rlof as predicted by han et al . \n ( 2003 ) . \n the int is operated on the island of la palma by the ing in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the iac . \n we thank patt for their support of this program . \n the radcliffe telescope is operated by the south african astronomical observatory .", "StartTimeOffset": 1891749884250, "RequestID": "b6990abce10d33c4ad515e7a56166f6f877b09aa", "TotalTokens": 2605}

element method ( fem ) . \n the fem results for eigenvalues with @xmath11 potential are shown as crosses in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] . * \n the third method is based on the expansion in two -

dimensional complex hamiltonians . \n the results are shown as dots in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] and crosses in fig . \n [ fig : hh_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : hh_im ] .    from fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] we can clearly to see that all three methods provide consistent informations about the real part of the eigenvalues . and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] shows the two numerical methods are consistent on the imaginary part of the eigenvalues . \n using perturbation theory , we calculate the eigenvalues as power series of the coupling constant @xmath26 . here are the first few terms for the first 10 eigenvalues : @xmath27 we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series . \n the results are shown as lines in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] . from the figure \n , we may see that some pad expansions have poles and cross each others .    in the same figure , \n we show the real parts of eigenvalues from fem as crosses and from ho expansions as dots . \n the two sets of numerical results clearly agree with each other . and \n surprisingly , up to the crossing points , the pad expansions fit the numerical results very well . \n although the hamiltonian @xmath30 has @xmath0 symmetry , some energy eigenvalues are complex . \n the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by two numerical methods are shown in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] .     with the complex cubic potential . \n lines are from perturbative expansion using @xmath29 pad . \n crosses are results using fem . \n dots are results using the method based on two -

heiles potential , a similar patten appears . the energy eigenvalues become complex when @xmath35 . \n there are special features for this interaction .    * first , there are all rational numbers in every term of eigenvalues in the perturbation expansion . * \n second , there are an accident degeneracy between odd and even @xmath15-parity . most of the energy levels are degenerated , but interestingly , not all of them . \n for example , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , but @xmath39 . \n in fact , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same up to the order of @xmath21 , but for the order of @xmath42 and higher , they separate . \n this patten remains the same for higher exciting states : * * for even @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc . \n * * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc . \n * * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath49 starting from the order of @xmath42 . * third , @xmath50 appears to be non - alternating in signs in the expansion . and \n this is a unique case up to @xmath51 . \n here are the first few terms for the first 21 eigenvalues : @xmath52 as in the previous section , we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series . \n the results are shown as lines in fig . \n [ fig : hh_re ] . \n the results from ho expansions are shown as crosses in the same figure . once again , we found the pad expansions fit the numerical results up to the crossing points . \n the @xmath0 symmetry is also broken in this hamiltonian . \n some eigenvalues cross and form complex conjugate pairs . \n the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by ho expansions are shown in fig . \n [ fig : hh_im ] .     with the complex hnon -

{"ContextTokens": 3849, "GeneratedTokens": 197, "SynthesizedBody": "fault - tolerant error correction promises to enable the reliable storage and manipulation of quantum information , but only if errors affecting qubits are not strongly correlated and occur with a probability below some threshold error rate @xcite . in practice , error correction should tolerate realistically high error rates and be compatible with experimentally feasible technology , without requiring excessive overhead in order to achieve a sufficiently reliable universal set of logical gates . in principle , topological error correction with the surface code appears to satisfy these criteria @xcite , enabling schemes that tolerate error rates of approximately one percent per gate for qubits constrained to a two - dimensional array with local interactions @xcite . \n however , the overhead of these schemes remains daunting @xcite , motivating the search for other approaches  for example , see refs . \n @xcite . here , we are interested in error correction using topological color codes \n @xcite , which have many similarities with the surface code but in some cases also admit transversal implementation of logical gates that span the clifford group . this property may help to reduce the overhead required to achieve universality via state distillation @xcite , making these codes promising candidates for fault - tolerant error correction @xcite . \n one critical aspect of error correction is decoding , which is the task of inferring from the error syndrome a set of corrections that will return the system to the code space . in the first instance \n , a practical decoding algorithm should be computationally efficient . \n it should also tolerate uncertainty in the syndrome due to errors  in other words , it should be fault tolerant . \n efficient fault - tolerant decoding of the surface code can be achieved by solving a particular graph matching problem @xcite , among other techniques @xcite . \n however , the equivalent approach for topological color codes introduces a hypergraph matching problem for which no efficient algorithm is known , although approximate solutions can still be used @xcite . \n recently , several efficient decoding algorithms for color codes have been proposed . \n these involve iteratively decoding using message passing @xcite or relating the error syndrome to syndromes across multiple copies of the surface code @xcite , which are then decoded using existing techniques . \n however , the performance of these algorithms remains unknown in the important , realistic case where the qubits used to measure the error syndrome are themselves affected by errors .    here \n , we investigate the efficient fault - tolerant decoding of color codes . \n we begin with the decoding algorithm due to delfosse @xcite , which relates the hypergraph matching problem associated with color codes to a set of three graph matching problems with efficient solutions . \n we modify this algorithm to account for syndrome errors , applying it to the family of codes defined by the 4.8.8 semiregular lattice embedded on a plane with a triangular boundary . for a three - dimensional bit - flip channel , \n we report a threshold of 0.0208(1 ) , compared with 0.0305(4 ) previously reported for an integer - program - based decoding algorithm @xcite . \n this result indicates that decoding of topological color codes by graph matching is a feasible approach in the context of fault - tolerant error correction . \n when we account for correlated errors introduced by the syndrome measurement circuits , the threshold is reduced to 0.00143(1 ) per gate . \n this threshold is higher than others reported for the color code @xcite , but significantly lower than the equivalent threshold for the surface code under an identical noise model @xcite . \n a topological color code is defined by a three - colorable cubic ( trivalent ) graph embedded on a surface . \n the faces of a graph are three - colorable if every face can be assigned one of three colors such that no two faces that share an edge are the same color . \n data qubits reside at the nodes of the graph . \n each face is associated with two stabilizer generators @xcite , or check operators , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a face in the embedding , @xmath2 is the set of qubits incident on @xmath1 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the single - qubit pauli operators . \n the code space is the simultaneous + 1 eigenspace of the stabilizer generators .    . \n each node corresponds to a data qubit and each face corresponds to two stabilizer generators . \n errors ( black circles ) anticommute with stabilizer generators ( purple circles ) . \n hatched faces indicate where errors terminate on the boundaries , but the implied qubits and stabilizer generators are not actually present . \n logical pauli operators ( grey circles ) are associated with the boundaries . ]    here , we are particularly interested in the family of topological color codes defined by the 4.8.8 semiregular lattice embedded in a planar disc , which admit transversal implementation of the entire clifford group @xcite . if we restrict the number of logical qubits to equal one , then we are left with a family of codes defined by lattices with triangular boundaries , as illustrated in fig . \n the code parameters are @xmath5 $ ] for odd - integer code distance @xmath6 . \n logical pauli operators are connected chains of single - qubit pauli operators along any one of the three boundaries . \n additional logical qubits may be introduced by puncturing holes in the disc to modify its topology . in doing so , \n the stabilizer generators remain local in two spatial dimensions , ensuring compatibility with most quantum computer technologies @xcite . \n in general , the error syndrome is obtained by measuring the eigenvalues of the complete set of stabilizer generators . however , \n for now , we will focus on the @xmath3-error syndrome , which is obtained by measuring the eigenvalues of only the @xmath4-type stabilizer generators . \n the location of errors is implied by stabilizer generators whose eigenvalue is @xmath7 . \n for example , an isolated single - qubit error away from the boundaries will anticommute with the three adjacent stabilizer generators . however , more complicated chains of errors will only anticommute with the stabilizer generators at their terminals . \n errors may also terminate on the boundaries , and so , in keeping with the three - coloration of the graph , each boundary is assigned a color complementary to the colors of the adjacent faces . \n examples of errors and the corresponding syndromes are illustrated in fig . \n decoding is the procedure of inferring from the syndrome a set of corrections that will return the system to the code space . \n = @xmath8 . \n in contrast with fig . \n [ fig1 ] , each face corresponds to a data qubit and each node corresponds to a stabilizer generator . \n nodes connected by dashed edges correspond to the boundaries . \n the dual graph is partitioned into three colored subgraphs that connect nodes of the complementary set of colors . \n ( b ) red subgraph for @xmath6=@xmath9 where the syndrome is repeatedly measured in order from bottom to top . \n errors affecting data qubits and syndrome qubits correspond to spacelike and timelike edges respectively . ]    here , it is useful to introduce the dual graph , which can be partitioned into three colored subgraphs , as shown in fig . \n [ fig2](a ) . \n crucially , a single - qubit error will anticommute with only two adjacent stabilizer generators in each subgraph . in this way , when considered independently , each subgraph is equivalent to a surface code with its own syndrome @xcite . \n the minimum - weight set of errors consistent with the syndrome of a surface code can be found efficiently by solving a particular graph matching problem using edmonds perfect matching algorithm @xcite . with this in mind , assuming that the syndrome is perfectly reliable , decoding proceeds as follows :    1 .   for each subgraph , \n find the minimum - weight set of errors consistent with the syndrome , corresponding to a set of edges \n calculate the union of the edges identified in the three subgraphs , which partitions the data qubits into two sets . \n 3 .   correct all qubits in the lowest - weight set . \n figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] illustrate this procedure , giving examples of success and failure respectively \n . it may be possible to exploit correlations between the three subgraphs to more accurately identify errors @xcite , but we have not investigated this possibility in detail .            in general , the error syndrome will be unreliable , as the circuits used to measure the eigenvalues of the stabilizer generators may introduce additional errors . \n this ambiguity is resolved by repeating the measurement circuits @xmath6 times . \n then , the location of errors is implied by stabilizer generators whose eigenvalue is found to change between successive measurements . in particular , an error affecting \n a data qubit will cause the eigenvalues of the adjacent stabilizer generators to change from their previous values , while an error affecting a syndrome qubit will cause the eigenvalue of a single stabilizer generator to change ( apparently ) from its previous value and then change back again @xcite .    again , our decoding strategy is to consider each subgraph as an independent surface code . \n however , to reflect the fact that the syndrome is repeatedly measured , each subgraph is extended along an axis which we identify with time @xcite . \n the minimum - weight set of errors consistent with the syndrome of each subgraph may include errors affecting data qubits and errors affecting syndrome qubits , which , respectively , correspond to spacelike and timelike edges in the subgraph , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig2](b ) . \n therefore , we make the following modification to the second step of the decoding procedure :    * calculate the two - dimensional projection of the spacelike edges identified in the three subgraphs , which partitions the data qubits into two sets . \n edges cancel if they occur an even number of times in the projection . \n next , we specify circuits to measure the eigenvalues of the stabilizer generators . at the simplest level , \n standard single - qubit operator measurements are sufficient for this purpose , as the structure of the code limits the propagation of errors @xcite \n . however , more intricate circuits may be useful to trade off various parameters such as threshold , circuit depth , and connectivity @xcite . here \n , circuits are chosen to ensure that high - weight correlated errors are relatively unlikely without introducing a stochastic verification procedure . \n measurements reveal any weight - two errors in the cat state caused by a single error occurring during its preparation @xcite . to execute these circuits , assuming that qubits are constrained to a two - dimensional array , each qubit must be allowed to interact with either three or five of its neighbors . \n ]    weight - four stabilizer generators are measured with a two - qubit cat state @xcite , as shown in fig . \n [ fig5](a ) . \n weight - eight stabilizer generators are measured with a four - qubit cat state , which is prepared according to the left - hand side of fig . \n [ fig5](b ) . in preparing this state \n , a single error may propagate to several errors that may in turn propagate to several data qubits . \n however , the circuit is designed so that it is possible to determine the nature of such errors with a simple post - processing operation @xcite . \n referring to the right - hand side of fig . \n [ fig5](b ) , the @xmath4 measurements detect these errors while the @xmath3 measurement reveals the eigenvalue of the stabilizer generator , as required . \n when correlated errors are detected , appropriate corrections are applied to the affected data qubits . \n we simulate error correction with the color code using standard monte carlo methods @xcite . in each instance \n we generate a set of errors based on some noise model , decode the corresponding syndrome , and apply corrections as required . \n we sample the logical error rate as a function of the physical error rate for odd code distances between 9 and 21 . following refs . \n @xcite , a universal scaling ansatz accounting for finite - size effects is fit to the data and the threshold is extracted ( where @xmath10 in all cases ) . \n where appropriate , we quote the lowest of the separate thresholds for @xmath3 and @xmath4 logical errors , which sets the overall threshold .     statistical error and curves are best fits accounting for finite -

dimensional array with local interactions @xcite .    with respect to the decoding algorithm \n , there is still the prospect of improvement . \n for example , our simulations indicate that the full algebraic distance of the codes is not achieved . \n this is due to two reasons : firstly , the syndrome measurement circuits introduce correlated errors that are not accounted for in the decoding algorithm . \n secondly , the decoding algorithm fails for certain problematic error configurations , irrespective of these correlated errors . \n for example , fig . \n [ fig4 ] illustrates that fewer than @xmath19 errors may result in a logical error in some instances . \n addressing these failings will be necessary to determine the optimal performance of topological color codes for fault -

either @xmath7 or @xmath8 is a fitted parameter . for the photometry we fit for @xmath7 plus \n the remaining parameters and set @xmath8 = 0.75 as is appropriate for variation dominated by an irradiation effect . \n this produces an ephemeris with minimum light at phase zero : @xmath9 figure [ 6026 ] shows the light curve folded on this ephemeris and the sine curve fit . \n the rms variation of the data from the fitted sine curve is 0.010 magnitude . \n the remaining parameters from the sine fitting are @xmath10 mag ( instrumental ) and @xmath11 mag . \n as with ngc 6026 , the light curve of ngc 6337 in figure [ 6337 ] shows apparently well - behaved periodic variability . \n the periodogram showed periodic variability with a strong one day alias . \n the peak with the most power was located at a period of 0.173 days . \n since ngc 6337 appears as a ring , the nebular background close to the central star is at a minimum , allowing more accurate photometry . \n this , along with the obvious slope to each night of observation allowed all but the highest peak to be rejected . \n the corresponding period was taken as a starting point for fitting a sine curve of the same form as equation 1 , for ngc 6026 . \n the derived photometric ephemeris for minimum light in ngc 6337 is then @xmath12 figure [ 6337 ] shows the light curve folded on this ephemeris and the sine curve fit . \n the rms variation of the data from the fitted sine curve is 0.016 magnitude . \n the remaining parameters from the sine fitting are @xmath13 mag ( instrumental ) and @xmath14 mag . \n the short orbital periods allow limits to be placed on several of the binary system parameters . taking the masses of both css to be @xmath15 , typical of cspne \n , kepler s 2nd law gives the binary separation as a function of secondary mass . \n the small deviation from a sine curve , short orbital periods , and significant reflection effects observed in the two systems suggest that the companions are cool dwarf stars which do not fill , or just fill , their roche lobes . \n to find an upper limit for the secondary masses , i will assume that both secondaries are main sequence stars and do not fill their roche lobes . \n this condition is met for the two systems , according to their corresponding orbital periods and for @xmath16 , by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n these correspond to binary separations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n a few comments may be made about the binary system inclinations as well . \n corradi et al . \n ( 2000 ) show that the ring - like structure of ngc 6337 is the narrow waist of a nearly pole - on bipolar pn . \n the inclination of the pn then must be @xmath21 for the bright inner ring to have no apparent ellipticity . \n ngc 6026 does not appear ring - shaped , but as a partial ellipse with a very faint south - east edge . \n if this pn is what bond ( 2000 ) refers to as a `` wedding ring '' pn , then the inclination must be intermediate and can be roughly determined from the ellipticity of the observed pn . \n the ellipse measures @xmath22 , giving an inclination of @xmath23 . \n if the binary mechanism for shaping pne is correct , then the close binary css must have inclinations equal to those of the pne . \n finally , previous studies have found the fraction of detectable close binary cspne to be @xmath24 ( bond 2000 ) . \n the binary fraction found here is 25% , much higher than previous studies , though the low number of statistics means that the results are reasonably similar . \n since the sample observed in this study was not randomly selected , but was based on the classifications of soker ( 1997 ) , it would be interesting to increase the number of cspne observed . \n if the 25% binary fraction persisted , the binary mechanism for pn shaping would be strongly supported , specifically the scenario outlined by soker ( 1997 ) . \n i would like to thank bill bagnuolo , doug gies , and bill nelson for their generous support and todd henry and alberto miranda for their assistance with the ctio 0.9 m telescope . \n this research was funded by georgia state university .", "StartTimeOffset": 1946626195440, "RequestID": "afd375e9044f1538391b7205221c9c4d667c7d67", "TotalTokens": 1779}

{"ContextTokens": 2815, "GeneratedTokens": 197, "SynthesizedBody": "atmospheres of old and cool white dwarfs deliver valuable information on stellar and planetary evolution . \n this is because of relatively simple cooling physics that allows for accurate cosmochronometry @xcite and of the stratified nature of a white dwarf star , which allows for tracing the content of acreted planetary - like material @xcite . \n however , in order to properly asses this information , atmospheres of these stars must be well characterized and understood . \n this is often difficult with the standard models that are based mainly of the ideal - gas description of physics and chemistry . \n the atmospheres of helium - rich stars reach densities of fluid ( up to a few g / cc @xcite ) and there are severe problems in proper characterization of such old stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n impact of the dense atmospheres on stellar spectra are illustrated by the pressure distortion of @xmath1 bands @xcite and also with some problems with fitting the metal lines profiles @xcite . \n the former problems in fitting the uv spectra and u and b photometric bands of less extreme hydrogen - rich white dwarfs @xcite , solved by introduction of the ly-@xmath2 red wing opacities @xcite , also show the importance of proper modeling , accurate fitting and characterization of spectra of cool white dwarfs , for correct understanding of these stars @xcite .    in the last two decades various high - pressure improvements \n have been introduced to the modeling . \n these include the non - ideal equation of state @xcite , the opacities @xcite , the refraction @xcite and the chemical abundances of species @xcite . \n the further tests of ly - alpha red wing profiles validated this absorption mechanism for a sample of cool stars @xcite . \n while the less extreme atmospheres of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs are now well reproduced by the current models , the modeling of more extreme helium - rich atmospheres still encounters difficulties @xcite . in spite of significant work devoted to improvement of high density chemistry and physics description , \n no conclusive models describing dense , helium - rich atmospheres exist . \n in particular , a group of so - called ultracool white dwarfs , which are believed to be helium - rich stars , have rather vague atmospheric parameters assignment @xcite . \n we suspect that the pressure - distortion of ir opacities , namely the collision induced absorption ( cia , @xcite ) , contributes to much of these difficulties .    having steady improvement in the performance and availability of the computational power and quantum chemistry simulation software and techniques , \n many dense helium problems could be tackled by atomistic simulations @xcite . \n the ir opacities could be directly simulated using _ ab initio _ methods of quantum chemistry @xcite . \n recently we attempted such simulations and the first results are briefly discussed here in the context of interpreting the near- and mid - ir spectra of ultracool stars . \n recently , using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics technique , @xcite simulated the cia opacities of pure , dense helium and found significant absorption resulting from triple collisions between helium atoms . \n this absorption mechanism was postulated ( e.g. @xcite ) , but had been never before observed experimentally or computed . the obtained absorption coefficient for a representative temperature of 5000 k is given in figure [ f1 ] . \n although the intensity of this absorption mechanism is about four orders of magnitude lower that the relevant h@xmath0/h - he cia opacities , because he atoms are the dominant species it becomes a significant ir absorption mechanism in the atmospheres with @xmath3 ( see fig . \n [ f2 ] ) . when we applied the new absorption mechanism to the spectrum of lhs1128 star , which is broadly discussed by @xcite ( fig . \n [ f2 ] ) , we obtained much better fit to the irac fluxes . \n this opacity source thus explains a flat - like behavior of the observed ir fluxes , as opposite to the @xmath4 flux suppression and the @xmath5 flux excess predicted by the current models ( fig . \n using the same simulation method as @xcite used for simulation of the he - he - he absorption ( see also @xcite in this volume ) we have simulated the @xmath6 cia opacities . as indicated in fig . 2 of @xcite we found a significant distortion of this absorption mechanism for densities @xmath7 . \n the obtained profiles for the low and high densities are compared in figure [ f3 ] . as indicated in the figure \n , there are three main pressure effects . \n ( 1 ) the rototranslational band peak at @xmath8 becomes more pronounced and ( 2 ) shifted towards higher frequencies . \n we interpret this as a result of triple collisions @xcite and decrease in the separation between hydrogen atoms in h@xmath0 with increase in density , and related decrease of the h@xmath0 rotational inertia , as illustrated in fig . \n [ f4 ] . at the same time , ( 3 ) the @xmath9 main vibrational band shifts to the higher frequencies and splits into two peaks due to an interference between the dipole moments induced in the successive collisions of h@xmath0 and he atoms @xcite . \n this splitting has been experimentally observed before @xcite and in figure [ f5 ] we compare those results with these simulated by us . \n we obtained larger splitting because simulations were performed at much higher temperature , thus with higher thermal collisions energy than in the experiments performed at ambient conditions . \n the obtained results could be used for the interpretation of difference between the modeled and the observed spectra of ultracool white dwarfs , such as lhs3025 . \n compared to the synthetic spectrum computed using the standard cia opacity description of @xcite , the observed spectrum does not show the clear minimum at @xmath10 and the flux excess at @xmath11 that are predicted by models , and indicates more absorption in the near - ir . \n this is consistent with the simulated broadening and the redistribution of the main vibrational peak and the enhancement of rototranslational peak . \n the absorption spectrum simulated at @xmath12 ( fig . \n [ f3 ] ) indicates maximum of absorption at @xmath13 and more absorption in the near - ir , which is consistent with the observed spectral energy distribution of lhs3025 , and also other ultracool white dwarfs @xcite . \n more elaborate analysis requires more complete set of simulated spectra , including investigation of the temperature dependence , derivation of the relevant distortion model , calculations of a grid of atmosphere models and their usage for subsequent fitting of spectra and analysis of ultracool white dwarfs . \n this work is currently in progress . \n we have showed the results of simulations of he - he - he and h@xmath0-he cia infrared opacities and their impact for the interpretation of spectra of cool , helium - rich stars , including ultracool white dwarfs . \n we discuss the impact of the newly found he - he - he cia opacity from pure helium on the spectra . by improved fit to the spectrum of lhs1128 star we show that this opacity mechanism could be responsible for a flat - like infrared spectral energy distribution of these stars , which could not be reproduced with previous models . \n the subsequent simulations of h@xmath0-he cia opacities show significant pressure - distortion of this absorption mechanism with the simulated intensity change being consistent with the one deducted from the mismatch between the current models prediction and the observed spectral energy distribution for star lhs3250 . \n however , more complete simulations of the ir opacities and subsequent computation of new models are required for complete analysis and refitting the spectra of cool , helium - rich stars , which is currently in progress . \n last but not least , the simulations conducted here and the subsequent analysis show that the modern atomistic modeling methods could be successfully applied to modeling condensed stellar atmospheres and that , on the other hand , the atmospheres of white dwarfs represent excellent laboratories for testing the physics and chemistry of matter at extreme conditions . \n abel , m. , frommhold , l. , li , x. , & hunt , k. l. c. 2012 , the journal of chemical physics , 136 , 044319 bergeron , p. , leggett , s. k. , & ruiz , m. t. 2001 , , 133 , 433 bergeron , p. , ruiz , m. t. , & leggett , s. k. 1997 , , 108 , 339 blouin , s. , dufour , p. , & kowalski , p. m. 2017 ( astronomical soc . of the pacific ) , \n this volume dufour , p. , bergeron , p. , liebert , j. , harris , h. c. , knapp , g. r. , anderson , s. f. , hall , p. b. , strauss , m. a. , collinge , m. j. , & edwards , m. c. 2007 , the astrophysical journal , 663 , 1291 farihi , j. , barstow , m. a. , redfield , s. , dufour , p. , & hambly , n. c. 2010 , mon . not . \n r. astron . \n soc . , 404 , 2123 fontaine , g. , brassard , p. , & bergeron , p. 2001 \n , , 113 , 409 frommhold , l. 1993 , collision -

{"ContextTokens": 3918, "GeneratedTokens": 254, "SynthesizedBody": "adaptive optics ( ao ) systems may provide diffraction - limited imaging with ground - based telescopes , measuring the wavefront aberrations due to the atmosphere by means of a suitably bright reference star and compensating for these aberrations by means of a deformable mirror . in classical ao systems , based on a single natural reference star , such a star has to be located close to the target object , i.e. within the isoplanatic patch , so that the probability of finding it is quite low . \n this probability defines the fraction of the sky where an efficient correction can be achieved ( sky coverage ) , and for near infrared wavelengths it is few percent @xcite . in this context \n the potential power of laser guide star ( lgs ) ao , proposed by @xcite , is clear . \n the basic idea is to generate a bright guide star in the upper atmosphere by means of a laser . \n two alternative physical phenomena may be exploited for such a purpose : rayleigh scattering at low - medium altitude , up to @xmath0 10 - 20 km @xcite , or excitation of the atoms in the sodium layer located at approximately @xmath0 90 km , characterized by a thickness of @xmath1 10 km @xcite . \n although low - altitude rayleigh scattering can provide much more backscattered light , the higher altitude of the mesospheric sodium layer reduces the cone effect @xcite , i.e. maximizes the atmospheric volume sampled by the artificial source . \n the use of lgs in principle solves the problem of the lack of bright reference sources , but other difficulties arise . \n apart from the above mentioned cone effect , that might be compensated using multiple reference sources @xcite , the problem analyzed in this paper is related to the perspective elongation of the lgs image , due to the vertical extension of the artificial source . referring , for instance , to a shack - hartmann ( sh ) wavefront sensor ( wfs ) , the subapertures located far from the laser launcher see an elongated lgs image , pointing towards the laser launcher . \n the angular elongation is given by ( see figure [ elongation ] ) @xmath2 since @xmath3 and @xmath4 are given by @xmath5 equation , in the small angles approximation , becomes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thickness of the sodium layer , @xmath8 is the mean altitude of the sodium layer and @xmath9 is the distance between the pupil subaperture and the lgs launcher ( figure [ elongation ] ) . \n this elongation can dramatically affect the capability to measure the wavefront , especially in the case of large diameter telescopes . \n ( in this case at the edge of the telescope aperture ) from the launch site . \n @xmath7 represents the thickness of the sodium layer , @xmath8 is the mean altitude of the layer and @xmath10 is the angular elongation . ]    on a 30 - 40 m class telescope , like the tmt @xcite and the e - elt @xcite , the maximum elongation @xmath10 varies between few arcsec and 10 arcsec , depending on the actual telescope diameter , on the sodium layer properties and on the laser launcher position .    through numerical simulations , verified by means of analytical formulas , we compute the measurement error on the optical path difference ( opd ) per subaperture , considering the elongation pattern on a sh wfs for the 42 m e - elt @xcite , in the case of a laser guide star launched either from behind the secondary mirror ( i.e. from the center of the pupil ) or from the edge of the primary mirror . in section [ \n sect : parameters ] we describe the simulations and the input parameters . \n the performance analysis of a specific algorithm ( weighted center of gravity ) is the subject of section [ sect : subnoise ] . in sections [ sect : \n propagation ] and [ sect : results2 ] we propagate the measurement error on the opd per subaperture to rms wavefront error over the whole pupil , hereafter referred to as wfe , assuming a modal least square wavefront reconstruction on a karhunen - loeve ( k - l ) basis . \n the resulting wfe is evaluated as a function of number of photons and read - out - noise ( ron ) . \n an estimation of the number of detected photons needed to achieve a pre - fixed wfe per lgs is given in section [ sect : results2 ] . \n in order to understand how the image of a lgs looks like as seen from each subaperture of a shack - hartmann wavefront sensor , it is important to choose a model of the sodium density profile . \n the density of the sodium layer can change by a factor of two or more depending on the telescope site and the time of the year . \n its mean altitude can change on a time scale of hours @xcite . \n we consider two different sodium profile models ( figure [ profile ] ) , with a shape similar to those presented in @xcite :    * single gaussian sodium density profile , peak at @xmath11 km and fwhm @xmath12 km ; * bi - modal sodium density profile given by the sum of two gaussians with the following characteristics : peak at @xmath13 km and fwhm @xmath14 km , peak at @xmath15 km and fwhm @xmath16 km . \n the described sodium profiles have been used to simulate the spots seen by a sh wfs . \n some examples of simulated spots are shown in figure [ spots ] . \n we consider two lgs launching schemes : from behind the secondary mirror ( central projection ) and from the edge of the primary mirror ( lateral projection ) . \n central projection gives a perspective elongation pattern with radial symmetry , while lateral projection leads to a non - symmetric pattern with maximum elongation two times larger than in the former option . \n the peak density of the sodium layer is imaged at the center of the field of view ( fov ) of each subaperture . \n the lgs spot imaged by each subaperture is modeled as follows :    * the starting point is a line source of length calculated accordingly to equation [ eq : na ] and with intensity distribution given by the adopted sodium density profile ; * the line source is convolved by a seeing - like disk of angular size @xmath17 arcsec , taking into account the round - trip propagation of the beam through the turbulent atmosphere ( seeing = 1 arcsec ) . \n this angular size corresponds to the width in the non - elongated axis . \n the subaperture diffraction ( @xmath18 arcsec ) is not considered in the spot model , as it is negligible with respect to the seeing effect , that always dominates over diffraction since the ao correction at the laser wavelength is quite poor . \n we generate sequences of instantaneous spots : each spot is characterized by a random jitter and is contaminated by photon noise and read - out noise ( ron ) . \n the random offset is extracted from a gaussian distribution , whose standard deviation may be tuned to simulate open or closed loop conditions . \n the photon noise is added to each pixel accordingly to a poisson distribution with a mean value equal to the pixel intensity ; the ron is extracted from a gaussian distribution of zero mean . \n different values of focal plane sampling and subaperture fov may be adopted in the generation of the sequence , in order to evaluate their impact on the wfs performance . \n depending on the chosen subaperture fov , the wings of the most elongated spots , especially for the the subapertures at the edge of the pupil , may fall outside the fov of the subapertures themselves . in a real system \n , this would translate into a light contamination of adjacent subapertures , a drawback that may be overcome using simple light baffling methods , for instance a diaphragm on the lgs image in an intermediate focal plane before the wfs . \n this baffling is always implicitly assumed here , so that the limited subaperture fov translates into a truncation of the spot wings , but not into a contamination of adjacent subapertures . \n the number of photons per subaperture referred to in the following includes also the photons blocked by the subaperture baffle . \n the sequence of instantaneous spots , typically formed by 500 realizations , is analyzed by a spot position measurement algorithm . \n the algorithm result is compared to the known true position , thus obtaining a sequence of position differences , the rms of which is the figure of merit for the algorithm performance evaluation . \n each instantaneous spot is tested for detectability . for this purpose \n two checks are implemented @xcite : the maximum intensity value of the spot is requested to be at least twice the ron and the calculated position has to be within @xmath19 from the true position , where @xmath20 is the standard deviation of the best fit gaussian to the long - exposure spot , obtained by summing all the images in the sequence . when more than a certain fraction of images ( in our simulations 50% , following thomas et al . \n 2006 ) are rejected , we consider the centroid measurements to have failed and not be reliable for those light conditions .    .simulation parameters . \n [ cols= \" < , < \" , ] \n the effect of the lgs perspective elongation on the performance of a shack - hartmann wfs for a large aperture telescope has been analyzed in this paper . \n the weighted center of gravity algorithm has been used for the spot position measurement in the subapertures . the opd measurement error in the subapertures \n has been propagated to wfe ( rms wavefront error ) across the whole pupil , assuming a modal least square wavefront reconstruction ; a fast method to perform this error propagation has been proposed and validated , improving the efficiency of the calculation for a system with a very large number of subapertures . the method proposed here \n is based on a single channel approach , i.e. it allows the computation of the propagated wavefront error per single lgs , starting from the first order properties of the wfs ( number of subapertures , number of detected photons per subaperture , ron , focal plane sampling , subaperture fov , calculation window ) . \n the analysis presented in this paper has been tuned for the specific case of a mcao module for the e - elt , assuming a target wfe per lgs of 200 nm . \n different sodium profiles have been considered : gaussian and bi - modal profiles . \n it has been found that , with a suitable optimization of the wcog algorithm , performance is quite similar in the two cases . \n two laser projection schemes have been considered : central and lateral projection . in this framework , assuming for instance a reasonable detector noise ron = 3 @xmath21pixel , it has been found that approximately @xmath22 detected photons per subaperture per frame are required for the central laser projection . for comparison , the photon return of the keck lgs system @xcite , properly adapted to the case of the mcao system for the e - elt considering all relevant parameters , would correspond to approximately @xmath23 ; therefore the number of detected photons required to achieve our target wfe is a factor @xmath24 larger . for the lateral laser projection \n , the required number of photons is @xmath25 , i.e. a factor @xmath26 larger that for the central projection . \n the choice between central and lateral projection depends not only on the number of required photons , but also on other aspects ( contamination due to the rayleigh scattering of the laser light in the lower atmosphere , size of the isoplanatic angle compared to the perspective elongation ) , that are beyond the scope of this paper . \n a notable reduction in the required number of detected photons ( @xmath27 ) might be obtained by canceling the perspective elongation by means of a dynamic refocus scheme combined with a pulsed laser ( baranec & dekany 2008 , beckers et al . \n 2003 , georges et al . \n 2003 ) , which is technologically challenging , or range gating @xcite , that however wastes a non negligible fraction of laser power . \n other approaches are under investigation to achieve similar results without fast moving parts @xcite . \n a detailed analysis of the influence of the ron has been performed . assuming a more conservative value ron = 5 @xmath21pixel \n , the required number of detected photons increases by a factor @xmath28 with respect to the case ron = 3 @xmath21pixel . \n another important aspect that has been analyzed is the number of pixels per subaperture , that determines the detector size . with typical sodium profiles , assuming nyquist sampling in the non elongated direction and central laser projection , the minimum number of pixels per subaperture is @xmath29 , so that 84 subapertures across the diameter ( table [ tab : parameters1 ] ) corresponds to a detector size of @xmath30 pixels , that doubles in the case of lateral laser projection . \n this detector format , especially combined with a ron = 3 @xmath21pixel or better looks a demanding requirement .    the analysis presented in this paper is based on the wcog algorithm . \n however it is worth comparing this method to other algorithms ( e.g. correlation maximization , quad - cell approach ) with the aim of relaxing the requirements on the number of photons and on the detector specifications . \n additional aspects to be considered in the evaluation of the algorithms are the variation of the sodium profile with time and the impact of the differential aberrations between science and lgs channel , that usually depend on the zenithal angle variation during the exposure . \n the sodium profile variations imply continuous updating of the algorithm reference ( the weighting function and the calibration curve in the case of the wcog ) ; the differential aberrations may translate into time dependent spot offsets in the subapertures , that need to be compensated or calibrated . \n the evaluation of different algorithms , considering these additional issues , is the subject of an additional work in preparation @xcite . \n the authors thank r. clare , n. hubin , t. fusco , m. le louarn , e. marchetti , c. petit , m. tallon for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by the european community ( framework programme 6 , elt design study , contract n. 011863 ;

{"ContextTokens": 4075, "GeneratedTokens": 192, "SynthesizedBody": "the cometary globules in the helix nebula ( ngc  7293 ) are among the most remarkable structures seen in planetary nebulae ( pne ) . \n they occur in large numbers in the lower ionization regions of the nebula , and appear in high resolution optical images as small ( @xmath6 ) , convex , photo - ionized surfaces facing the central star , with comet - like tails extending in the opposite direction ( e.g. , meaburn et al . 1992 ; odell & handron 1996 ) . \n these structures are seen in other pne ( e.g. , odell et al . 2002 ) and are probably quite common , but they are best seen in the helix nebula because it is the nearest example , at a distance of @xmath7  pc ( @xmath8  mas , harris et al . \n 1997 ) . \n a key step in understanding the nature of the helix globules has been their detection in co by huggins et al . \n ( 1992 ) . with a resolution @xmath9 \n , the co observations did not resolve their structure , but demonstrated that globules contain a major mass component of molecular gas , consistent with observations of dust , seen in absorption against the nebula emission by meaburn et al . \n the molecular gas places important constraints on the origin and evolution of the globules , and provides a direct connection with the massive shell of neutral gas that surrounds the ionized nebula ( forveille & huggins 1991 ; young et al . \n 1999 ; rodriguez , goss , & williams 2002 ) . \n this connection is underscored by wide field imaging of the nebula in the infrared lines of h@xmath1 by kastner et al . \n ( 1996 ) , cox et al . \n ( 1998 ) , and speck et al . \n ( 2002 ) , at resolutions from 8  to 2 , that show a highly fragmented envelope .    in order to determine the detailed relation between the molecular gas and the structure of the globules revealed by optical images \n , we have made new observations of the helix nebula in both co and h@xmath1 with significantly better resolution than previous observations . in this _ \n letter _ , we report results on the molecular gas in a single cometary globule that resolve its head - tail structure . \n the globule observed is a prominent feature lying within the ionized nebula to the north of the central star at offsets ( @xmath1010 , + 135 ) . \n it is designated c1 by huggins et al . \n ( 1992 ) and its location is shown in fig . \n 3a of meaburn et al . \n ( 1998 ) where it is labeled `` 1 '' . \n optical images of the globule from walsh & meaburn ( 1993 ) in h@xmath11+[nii]6584  and in [ oiii]5007 , where it is seen in absorption against the nebular emission , are shown in the top right panels of fig .  1 . \n the co observations were made in the 2.6  mm ( 115  ghz ) @xmath0 line using the iram interferometer at plateau de bure , france , in may 1999 . \n the array consisted of five , 15  m antennas , equipped with sis heterodyne receivers . \n the observations were made with the d configuration of the array , with maximum baselines of @xmath12  m. the primary beam size of the interferometer is 44  at 2.6  mm , and the effective velocity resolution for the analysis is 0.2  kms@xmath5 . \n the uv data were fourier transformed and cleaned , using the clark algorithm , and the restored gaussian clean beam is @xmath13 , at a position angle of 14 . \n the results are shown in figs . \n 1 and 2 .    images of the h@xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 emission in the northern quadrant of the helix nebula were obtained with the sofi infrared camera on the eso ntt , in june , 2001 . \n the instrument has a 1024@xmath14 hawaii hgcdte array and was used with an image scale of 024 pixel@xmath5 . \n the seeing was 1 . \n the observations were made with an h@xmath1 filter of width 0.028  @xmath4 , centered at 2.124  @xmath4 , well separated from the hei 2@xmath15p@xmath162@xmath15s 2.058  @xmath4 and hi 2.166  @xmath4 lines , the latter having a transmission of a few percent in the filter passband . \n fifteen 1  min exposures were made , using sky offset positions at 5  n , 5  e , and 7  ne . \n the individual images were sky cleaned , flat fielded , and combined with shift - and - add registration using the brightest stellar images . \n many globules are detected in the full h@xmath1 image , and the region around globule c1 is shown in the top , center - left panel in fig .  1 . an approximate calibration has been made by comparing the smoothed , full image with the data of speck et al . \n the intensity of the emission at the head of the globule is @xmath17  ergs@xmath5@xmath18sr@xmath5 . \n astrometry of the h@xmath1 and optical images was carried out using stars in the usno catalog , and the registration between the images is @xmath19 rms . \n the accuracy of the absolute positions for comparison with the co interferometry is @xmath20 00 . \n the observations presented in fig .  1 provide complementary views of the helix globule . \n the co 10 line , with an upper level of @xmath21  k above the ground state , shows the overall distribution and kinematics of the cool molecular gas ; the high lying ( @xmath22  k ) h@xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 line traces excited molecular gas ; the image in [ oiii ] shows the distribution of dust , seen in absorption against the nebular emission ; and the image in h@xmath11+[nii ] shows the photo - ionized surfaces facing the central star \n .    the observations immediately confirm the molecular nature of the globule , and reveal some important details of its structure .      the co 10 velocity - integrated intensity map ( fig . \n 1 ) is seen to be extended with respect to the telescope beam , and the deconvolved source size , assuming a gaussian distribution , is @xmath23 ( 1  corresponds to @xmath24  cm at 200  pc ) . \n the emission is marginally resolved in ra but is resolved in dec , and extends roughly along the head - tail axis of the globule . \n the peak intensity is 2.6  kkms@xmath5 , and the total flux is 166  kkms@xmath5arcsec@xmath14 . \n the co velocity - strip ( fig .  2 ) shows that to the south , toward the head of the globule , the line width is extremely narrow , @xmath25  kms@xmath5  ( fwhm ) , and it broadens out to @xmath26  kms@xmath5  farther north into the tail region . \n the co radial velocity is precisely determined to be @xmath27  kms@xmath5  ( the correction to @xmath28 is @xmath102.9  kms@xmath5 ) , consistent with @xmath29  kms@xmath5measured in [ nii ] 6584  by meaburn et al . \n the systemic velocity of the whole envelope of the helix nebula is @xmath1023  kms@xmath5  ( young et al . 1999 ) , so the globule is blue - shifted by @xmath30  kms@xmath5 . for a radial expansion velocity of the globule system of @xmath31  kms@xmath5 \n ( young et al . 1999 ) , the globule lies on the near side of the nebula , on a radius vector from the star inclined to the line of sight by @xmath32 . the head - tail axis , assumed radial , is also seen at this angle . \n the co channel maps ( fig . \n 1 ) show the structure in the molecular gas . \n there are two peaks , offset 3  n and 8n from the field center . \n the first is just north of the maximum absorption in the [ oiii ] image ( centered at @xmath33n ) , and we identify this molecular emission with the head of the globule whose photo - ionized surface toward the central star is seen in the h@xmath11+[nii ] image . \n substantial co emission , however , extends away from the head into the tail region , and the second co peak lies close to a second , weak maximum in the dust absorption image ( at 8n ) . \n this extended co emission , together with the line broadening into the tail accounts for the offset of the peak in the co integrated intensity map from the head of the globule . \n these observations demonstrate that the molecular gas in the cometary globule is _ not _ a compact spheroidal bullet , but has a substantial component extending into the tail region . \n the distribution of the h@xmath1 emission in the globule is strikingly different from that of co ( see fig .  1 ) . \n the strongest h@xmath1 emission occurs at the face of the globule toward the central star . \n there is little emission directly behind the globule , but observable emission extends to large distances ( @xmath34 ) along the tail . \n remarkably , the h@xmath1 distribution most closely follows that of the ionized gas seen in h@xmath11+[nii ] . \n the high spatial resolution of our observations and the well defined geometry of the globule provide a unique perspective on the question of the excitation of the h@xmath1 ( cox et al . \n 1998 ) , which affects its observed distribution . \n the bright h@xmath1 emission clearly arises in a thin surface layer in the molecular gas . \n 3 shows a close - up of the globule head , comparing the h@xmath1 and h@xmath11+[nii ] emission with [ oiii ] . the h@xmath1 emission forms a limb - brightened cap on the globule facing the central star , and lies just inside ( 01 ) the halo of photo - ionized gas seen in h@xmath11+[nii ] . in the tail region too ( fig .  1 ) , the h@xmath1 is enhanced near two h@xmath11+[nii ] peaks , at 8n and 12n on the east side , which are directly illuminated by the star . \n more detailed observations are needed to determine whether these are separate , small globules along the line of sight , or sub - structures of the main tail . \n the observed distribution of the h@xmath1 emission is in complete accord with the expectations of h@xmath1 excitation in a thin photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) at the surface of the molecular gas . \n the observed intensity of the line is probably consistent with this interpretation ( natta & hollenbach 1998 ; speck et al . \n 2002 ) although detailed pdr models of the globules have not yet been developed . \n the possibility that the observed distribution is caused by shocks is unlikely , in view of the small crossing time ( @xmath35  yr ) for shocks ( @xmath36  kms@xmath5 ) able to excite the @xmath37 @xmath3 h@xmath1 line ( e.g. , burton et al . 1992 ) ; shocks in the bulk of the molecular gas are ruled out by the absence of any disturbance in the co emission with velocities larger than @xmath38  kms@xmath5 .      using the co 21 observations of the globule by huggins et al . \n ( 1992 ) , we find the 21/10 flux ratio to be @xmath20 23 ( assuming significant 10 flux is not resolved out on the shortest baselines ) , which suggests that the lines are at least partly optically thin , with an excitation temperature @xmath20 1840  k in the thin limit . \n for a representative value of 25  k and a co abundance of @xmath39 , the co 10 flux gives a mass of molecular gas in the globule of @xmath40  m@xmath41 . \n the corresponding average density in a volume with projected dimensions of @xmath42 , which includes the head and the tail seen in co , is @xmath43  @xmath44 . \n these values are consistent with a mass of @xmath45  m@xmath41  and @xmath46  @xmath44 determined for the head of the globule by meaburn et al . \n ( 1992 ) from the dust absorption seen in [ oiii ] , corrected to a distance of 200  pc . \n the typical mass of photo - ionized gas at the surface of a globule , @xmath47  m@xmath41  ( e.g. , odell & handron 1996 ) , is negligible in comparison . \n the structure and kinematics of the molecular gas in the head and in the tail of the globule provide basic constraints on their origin and evolution . \n one scenario for the origin of globules is that they form in the atmosphere of the progenitor star and are carried out in the expanding circumstellar envelope ( dyson et al . \n 1989 ) . in this case \n , the wind - swept appearance of the globules suggests a model in which material from the head is swept into the tail by a radially directed wind , and dyson , hartquist , & biro ( 1993 ) have shown that the wind needs to be subsonic to form a narrow tail . \n our observations constrain this model in showing no evidence for a wind - swept flow pattern at the present time . \n there is no difference in velocity between the co emission in the head and the tail of the globule , and from the co strip map ( fig . \n 2 ) the differential motion is @xmath48  kms@xmath5along the line of sight , or @xmath49  kms@xmath5  in a radial direction , corrected for the inclination . \n this would produce a tail of length @xmath50 in 5,000  yr which is likely the maximum time available for such a process . \n the tails could have been fully formed at an earlier epoch , or it might be that ablation occurs only from the ionized edges of the head of the globule , but this would not account for the presence of molecular gas seen in h@xmath1 along the whole length of the tail .    a different view of the gas dynamics around the globule at the present time is provided by the photo - evaporation model , which has been discussed in the context of the helix globules by lpez - martn et al . \n ( 2001 ) . in this model , photo - ionization of the neutral globule , whose molecular core is unambiguously confirmed by our observations , produces an ionized out - flow from the surface . \n given that the density of the ionized gas at the head of the globule is @xmath51  @xmath44 , and that of the ambient gas is much lower @xmath52  @xmath44 ( e.g. , odell & handron 1996 ) , any subsonic flow of the ambient gas around the globule is unlikely to have important dynamical effects in shaping the gas in the tail . \n an alternative mechanism for growing a tail on a pre - existing globule is by shadowing ( cant et al . \n 1998 ) , which can form a tail behind the globule as the result of under - pressure of the gas in the shadowed region . for the simplest case of a neutral globule in ionized gas \n , this model produces only modest density increases in the tail , and is unlikely to lead to the substantial molecular tails revealed by the present observations . \n striking effects of shadowing of the ionizing radiation are , however , seen in optical images of the helix ( e.g. , henry , kwitter , & dufour 1999 ) , where long , radial plumes appear as extensions to globules and their tails . \n similar shadowing of the stellar radiation at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit must also occur , and the consequent reduction of the co and h@xmath1 photo - dissociation rates in the shadowed regions must play a key role in preserving the molecular gas in the extended tails .    if globules originate close to the star as proposed by dyson et al . \n ( 1989 ) , the most crucial phase in their evolution occurs when they are overrun by the ionization front of the nebula . at this stage \n , the shadowing of pre - existing molecules or hydrodynamic flows , or both , could lead to globules with molecular tails . \n an alternative scenario is one in which the globules and their tails originate simultaneously in instabilities at the ionization front ( e.g. , capriotti 1973 ) . in this model , shadowing and possibly hydrodynamic flows would also likely play a role , and the fingers of gas which result from the instability could contribute directly to the formation of the tails . \n the later development of these two models will likely be similar , and can plausibly lead to the globules with substantial molecular tails that we now observe . \n further studies should allow us to discriminate between them . \n as for the fate of the globules , meaburn et al . \n ( 1998 ) estimated an ablation rate for globule c1 of @xmath53  m@xmath41yr@xmath5 based on densities inferred from the [ oiii ] image , and an assumed ablation flow velocity of 10  kms@xmath5 . \n this implies an improbably short lifetime of @xmath54  yr which led meaburn et al . to consider ad hoc , restricted flow models around the globule . \n the absence of an observable ablation flow in the globule reported here for co ( @xmath55  kms@xmath5 ) completely resolves this problem , by increasing the original estimate of the ablation time scale by at least an order of magnitude . \n in fact , the current mass - loss rate of the globule is likely dominated by photo - evaporation ( lpez - martn et al . \n 2001 ) , and the corresponding time scale is @xmath56  yr . thus the globules are long lived , and may even escape the nebula .", "StartTimeOffset": 2032573599756, "RequestID": "d2ef53396d507c8a5e6d195f68eaa391ce6da93a", "TotalTokens": 4267}
{"ContextTokens": 3769, "GeneratedTokens": 253, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of the nearest and brightest active galaxies have inspired our current paradigm for the workings of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . \n their proximity gives superb spatial scale , which has been exploited in imaging with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and in high - resolution radio observations . \n these same nearby agn have the highest s / n _ hst _ far - uv spectra , and the best high - resolution x - ray spectra . the spectral energy distribution of agn peaks in the far - ultraviolet wavelength range . \n thus , it is important for understanding the energy generation mechanism and the processes that govern accretion onto massive black holes . \n since this portion of the spectrum also determines the radiative input to the broad - line region ( blr ) and the narrow - line region ( nlr ) in agn , as well as the surrounding host galaxy and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , determining its spectral shape is a crucial input for understanding the physical conditions of the gas in surrounding regions . \n the high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) enables us to study the astrophysics of the nearest agn in this crucial waveband . \n the 9001200   spectral range contains numerous diagnostic spectral features that can be applied to agn physics . \n the most prominent emission line is the o  vi resonance doublet @xmath0 , which is particularly strong in the spectra of low - redshift , low - luminosity agn due to the baldwin effect @xcite . \n this line can serve as a diagnostic of the energy input from the extreme ultraviolet to soft x - ray portions of the ionizing continuum . \n likewise , the o  vi doublet is a crucial diagnostic for the absorbing gas commonly seen as o  vii and o  viii absorption in x - ray spectra of agn ( @xcite ) , and as ly@xmath1 and c  iv absorption in _ hst _ spectra @xcite . \n the high - order lyman lines and the lyman limit provide additional diagnostics of absorbing gas . in some cases ( e.g. , ngc 4151 or ngc 3516 ) \n the neutral hydrogen can be optically thick and thereby play a significant role in collimating the ionizing radiation that illuminates the nlr @xcite . finally , numerous ground - state transitions of molecular hydrogen in the lyman and werner bands provide a sensitive tracer of molecular gas . under the right circumstances \n , one might expect to see @xmath2 associated with the obscuring torus in agn in absorption against the continuum and broad emission lines . \n the ionizing continuum shape in agn is difficult to study directly . at low redshift \n it is mostly obscured by our own interstellar medium , and inferences must be made from the spectral shape observed in the far - uv and soft x - ray ( on either side of the opaque interstellar absorption ) as well as from clues provided by the emission lines observed . \n composite spectra assembled from _ hst _ \n observations of moderate - redshift quasars ( @xcite ) show that the spectral energy distribution of agn peaks in the far - ultraviolet , with a distinct break at @xmath3  . \n the short wavelength response of _ fuse _ allows us to investigate the continuum properties of lower - redshift , lower - luminosity agn . \n we have used both the composite spectrum approach , and the detailed assembly of spectral energy distributions for 17 individual agn . \n @xcite obtained quasi - simultaneous observations of 17 agn using _ fuse _ , _ hst _ , and ground - based telescopes to produce spectral energy distributions covering 9129000   in the observed frame . \n a sampling of these spectra in figure [ uvosedfig ] shows that single power laws adequately describe the uv - optical continuum shape of roughly half the sample . \n many of the objects , however , show breaks in the spectral index at @xmath4  , similar to the _ hst _ composites . \n when we compare the uv - optical spectra with archival x - ray spectra ( figure [ xsedfig ] ) , one can see that the spectral energy distribution is clearly peaking in the far - ultraviolet . in most cases , \n the objects in the @xcite sample have an x - ray spectral slope and normalization matching the extrapolation of the fuv continuum . \n these individual seds are broadly consistent with modern accretion - disk models . \n geometrically thin disk models with non - lte atmospheres @xcite predict a narrow distribution of power - law indices for disk spectra on the red side of the peak in the sed . \n these models peak in the far - ultraviolet , with a spectral break or bump near the lyman limit . \n spectral indices shortward of the break have a broader distribution . as shown in figure [ admodsfig ] the 17 agn from @xcite have roughly similar distributions of spectral indices compared to the models .    with the same technique used to create the _ hst _ composite agn spectra , we have constructed a composite _ fuse _ spectrum from 128 observations of 85 distinct agn @xcite . as shown in figure [ compositefig ] , \n the _ fuse _ composite ( @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) is bluer than the _ hst _ composite ( @xmath7 ) , it shows no evidence for a break in the spectral index in the far - ultraviolet , and it has significantly stronger ne  viii and o  vi emission .    in an effort to understand these properties in more detail , we examined the spectral indices of individual objects in the sample . as found by @xcite \n , some individual objects do show breaks in their spectrum , but , in general , the _ fuse _ agn are lower luminosity and bluer than individual _ hst _ agn . \n the left panel of figure [ baldwinfig ] shows a significant anticorrelation between the agn spectral index and its luminosity . \n we interpret this in the context of an accretion disk around the central black hole in the following manner  lower - luminosity agn are likely to have less massive black holes , and hence hotter accretion disks . \n this shifts the peak of their spectral energy distributions to shorter wavelengths , moving the spectral break out of the _ fuse _ bandpass and making their spectra bluer . \n this physical interpretation may also explain the baldwin effect . \n the bluer spectra will have more high - energy photons , leading to relatively more emission from highly ionized species such as c  iv , o  vi , and ne  viii . \n as shown in the right panel of figure [ baldwinfig ] , o  vi emission in the _ fuse _ sample shows a strong anticorrelation with luminosity . \n as of november 1 , 2002 , _ fuse _ spectra for a total of 104 agn were present in the archive . \n four of these are type 2 agn , and the rest are type 1 . \n two of the type 2 agn show strong , narrow emission lines ( ngc  1068 and mrk  477 ) , and the other two have stellar continua typical of starburst galaxies . \n 53 of the type 1 agn have @xmath8 , so that the o  vi doublet is visible in the _ fuse _ band . \n as shown earlier in figure [ baldwinfig ] , all of these agn have strong , broad o  vi emission . \n surprisingly , roughly a third of these ( 17/53 ) also show strong _ narrow _ o  vi emission . \n emission from c  iii @xmath9 and n  iii @xmath10 is common , as is a bump of blended emission lines on the red wing of o  vi . in narrow - line seyfert \n 1 galaxies such as i  zw  1 , this bump is resolved into emission from s  iv @xmath11 and he  ii @xmath12 .    as shown in the left panel of figure [ abshistfig ] , \n absorption is common at all luminosities , and over 50% ( 30 of 53 ) of the low - redshift type 1 agn observed using _ fuse _ show detectable o  vi absorption , comparable to those seyferts that show longer - wavelength uv @xcite or x - ray @xcite absorption . \n none show intrinsic @xmath2 absorption . \n we see three basic morphologies for o  vi absorption lines : ( 1 ) * single * : 13 of 30 objects exhibit single , narrow , isolated o  vi absorption lines , as illustrated by the spectrum of ton  s180 @xcite . \n pg0804 + 761 , shown in the top panel of figure [ spectrafig ] , is another example . \n ( 2 ) * blend * : multiple o  vi absorption components that are blended together . \n 10 of 30 objects fall in this class , and the spectrum of mrk  279 is typical @xcite . \n the middle panel of figure [ spectrafig ] shows mrk  478 as another example . \n ( 3 ) * smooth * : the 7 objects here are an extreme expression of the  blend \" class , where the o  vi absorption is so broad and blended that individual o  vi components can not be identified . \n ngc  4151 typifies this class @xcite . \n the mini - bal qso pg1411 + 442 is another example of this class , shown in the bottom panel of figure [ spectrafig ] . \n individual o  vi absorption components in our spectra have fwhm of 50750 @xmath13 , with most objects having fwhm @xmath14 . \n the multiple components that are typically present are almost always blue shifted , and they span a velocity range of 2004000 @xmath13 ; half the objects span a range of @xmath15 . \n as shown in the right panel of figure [ abshistfig ] , the maximum outflow velocities show a tendency to increase with source luminosity , perhaps indicating that radiative acceleration plays some role in the dynamics . note also that there is a population of low - velocity absorbers present at all luminosities . \n the absorption lines we see in our spectra of agn are associated with mass outflows from the active nucleus . \n these outflows can profoundly affect the evolution of the central engine @xcite , the host galaxy and its interstellar medium @xcite and also the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite . \n winds from the high metal - abundance nuclear regions may be a significant source for enriching the igm @xcite . \n absorption by the outflow can also collimate the ionizing radiation @xcite and thereby influence the ionization structure of the host galaxy and the surrounding igm . \n the outflowing gas in agn is sometimes visible as extended , bi - conical emission at visible or x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. , ngc 4151 , @xcite , @xcite ; ngc 1068 , @xcite ) , but it most frequently manifests itself as blue - shifted absorption features in their uv and x - ray spectra . \n about half of all low - redshift agn show x - ray absorption by highly ionized gas @xcite , and a similar fraction show associated uv absorption in ionized species such as c  iv @xcite and o  vi @xcite . in more luminous quasars , the fraction of objects in the sloan digital sky survey that shows broad c  iv absorption troughs rises steeply as the troughs become narrower @xcite , comprising over 30% of the quasar population at widths narrower than 1000 @xmath13 . for agn that have been observed in both the x - ray and the uv , there is a one - to - one correspondence between objects showing x - ray and uv absorption , implying that the phenomena are related in some way ( crenshaw et al . \n the high frequency of occurrence of uv and x - ray absorption suggests that the absorbing gas has a high covering fraction , and that it is present in all agn . \n the gas has a total mass exceeding @xmath16 ( greater than the broad - line region , or blr ) , and is outflowing at a rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 the accretion rate in some objects ) @xcite . in an effort to understand agn outflows better , _ fuse _ \n guest investigators have been successful in coordinating several campaigns on bright agn with simultaneous _ \n hst _ and x - ray observations of ngc  3783 , ngc  5548 , ngc  4051 , ngc  4151 , ark  564 , mrk  279 , and ngc  7469 . \n * doublet ratios for the o  vi absorption lines show that the absorbers can be optically thick , but they are not black at line center . thus column densities are frequently underestimated , sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude @xcite . \n * variations in the absorption line strength can reflect either an ionization response , or bulk motion @xcite . \n * in the extensive recent _ chandra / fuse / hst _ campaign on ngc 3783 @xcite , the kinematics of the x - ray absorbing gas provide a good match to the uv - absorbing gas . \n the x - ray absorbing gas itself contains material spanning a large range of ionization parameters @xcite , and it is likely that this broad range of physical conditions can also include the uv - absorbing ions . \n this is a natural prediction of the thermally driven wind model of @xcite , and would also be likely in disk - driven winds . * in other cases the uv gas visible in _ fuse _ \n spectra appears to be in a fairly low ionization state , and there is no direct relation between the x - ray absorption and the multiple kinematic components seen in the uv ( ngc  5548 : @xcite ; mrk  509 : @xcite ; ngc  7469 : @xcite ) . \n the multiple kinematic components frequently seen in the uv absorption spectra of agn clearly show that the absorbing medium is complex , with separate uv and x - ray dominant zones . in some cases \n , the uv absorption component corresponding to the x - ray warm absorber can be clearly identified , such as ngc  3783 ( @xcite ) . in others , however , _ no _ uv absorption component shows physical conditions characteristic of those seen in the x - ray absorber as in ngc  5548 ( @xcite ) . \n one potential geometry for this complex absorbing structure is high - density , low - column uv - absorbing clouds embedded in a low - density , high - ionization medium that dominates the x - ray absorption . \n disk - driven winds are a possible explanation for some cases of agn outflows @xcite . \n by analogy to stellar winds , one would expect the terminal velocity of an agn outflow to reflect the gravity of its origin . \n disk - driven winds should therefore have velocities in the range of several thousand @xmath13 . \n objects with broad , smooth profiles might fall in this category . \n the geometry proposed by @xcite suggests that these objects should have only modest inclinations . \n however , two prime examples of seyferts with broad smooth absorption troughs , ngc 3516 @xcite and ngc 4151 @xcite , are likely the highest inclination sources in our sample given their extended , bi - conical narrow emission - line region morphologies @xcite and their opaque lyman limits @xcite . \n the lower velocities we observe in objects like ngc 3783 and ngc 5548 are more compatible with thermally driven winds from the obscuring torus @xcite . in these thermally driven winds , photoionized evaporation in the presence of a copious mass source ( the torus ) locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to total gas pressure ( the ionization parameter @xmath19 ) at a critical value . for agn spectral energy distributions lacking a strong extreme ultraviolet bump , such as the composite spectra of quasars assembled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the ionization equilibrium curve exhibits an extensive vertical branch . \n thus , at the critical ionization parameter for evaporation , there is a broad range of temperatures that can coexist in equilibrium at nearly constant pressure . for this reason \n , the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous . \n outflow velocities are typical of the sound speed in the heated gas , or several hundred @xmath13 , comparable to the velocities seen in many agn .    in summary , we find that o  vi absorption is common in low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) agn . \n 30 of 53 type 1 agn with @xmath8 observed using _ fuse _ show multiple , blended o  vi absorption lines with typical widths of @xmath20 that are blueshifted over a velocity range of @xmath21 1000 @xmath13 . \n those galaxies in our sample with existing x - ray or longer wavelength uv observations also show c  iv absorption and evidence of a soft x - ray warm absorber . \n in some cases , a uv absorption component has physical properties similar to the x - ray absorbing gas , but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between the uv and x - ray absorbing components . \n i thank all the members of the _ fuse _ agn working group for their contributions to this research , especially jennifer scott and zhaohui shang . \n this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa -

designed electronics boards , which send as much unfiltered data as possible to shore . with its capability of timing resolutions on a nanosecond - scale and synchronous transmission of several mbyte per second and storey , it is perfectly suited for the acquisition of acoustic data \n . additionally , the antares infrastructure provides measurements of the position of the storey with a precision better than 10 cm and of miscellaneous environmental parameters ( e.g.  the speed of sound , temperature and sea current ) . for the digitisation of the acoustic signals and feeding into \n the antares data stream the so - called acoustics digitisation board ( _ acouadc - board _ ) was designed . \n there are a total of three such boards per storey receiving the data of two sensors each . \n the acouadc - board consists of an analogue and a digital part . \n the analogue part amplifies the voltage signals coming from the acoustic sensors by adjustable factors between 1 and 512 and filters the resulting signal . \n the system has low noise and is designed to be  together with the sensors  sensitive to the acoustic background of the deep sea over a wide frequency - range ( approx \n . 1 to 100khz ) . \n figure  [ fig_frequency_response ] shows the measured filter characteristics of the analogue part of a prototype acouadc - board for a gain of 10 in amplitude ( 20db ) . in the left hand plot \n the frequency response of the integrated bandpass is observable . \n this filter suppresses frequencies below approx . \n 4khz and above approx.130khz . \n the high - pass part cuts into the trailing edge of the low frequency noise of the deep - sea acoustic background @xcite and thus protects the system from saturation . \n the low - pass part efficiently suppresses frequencies above the nyquist frequency of 250khz for the digitisation frequency of 500khz ( see below ) . for frequencies above roughly 10khz , the time delay of signals passing through the analogue part ( right plot of fig . \n [ fig_frequency_response ] ) is negligible on the digitisation time scale of 2@xmath3s . \n s. the dashed line in the right - hand plot denotes the electronics digitisation time of 2@xmath3s , showing the characteristic time scale.[fig_frequency_response],height=215 ]    s. the dashed line in the right - hand plot denotes the electronics digitisation time of 2@xmath3s , showing the characteristic time scale.[fig_frequency_response],height=215 ]     + by the calibration of the whole data taking chain \n the transfer function of the system  it is possible to reconstruct the acoustic signal from the recorded one with high precision within the sensitive frequency range of the setup . \n the dynamic range achieved is from the order of 1mpa to the order of 10pa in rms over the frequency range from 1 to 100khz . \n this allows for studying both the acoustic background in the deep sea under all prevailing conditions @xcite and bips from noise sources mimicking neutrino signatures of energies exceeding e.g.  gzk - neutrinos by several orders of magnitude . \n the digital part digitises and processes the acoustic data . \n it is designed to be highly flexible by employing a micro controller ( _ @xmath4c _ ) and a field programmable gate array ( _ fpga _ ) as data processor . \n the @xmath3c can be controlled from the on - shore control room and is used to adjust settings of the analogue part and the data processing . \n also , the complete programming of the acouadc - board can be updated in situ . \n the fpga reads the digitised acoustic data from the analogue to digital converter ( _ adc _ ) which has a 16-bit resolution and a maximum sampling rate of 500ksamples per second ( _ ksps _ ) . \n the data is processed , e.g.  down - sampled to reduce data traffic , and is read out by the antares daq system which handles the transmission to the control room . \n the maximum data rate per storey is limited to 20mbit per second by the electronics sending the data to shore , limiting the maximum sample rate of acoustic data per storey to 1.25msps . \n therefore the digital data is down - sampled to 200ksps at the acouadc - board , to allow for continuous and synchronous read - out of all six sensors of each storey . \n however , the bandwidth can be distributed freely between the sensors , so transmission of the acoustic data is also possible for two sensors at each storey at full sampling - rate .    on - shore \n a dedicated pc - cluster will be set up to process and store the acoustic data arriving from the storeys and to control the off - shore daq . on this cluster , different data filtering schemes and triggers \n will be implemented , as well as raw data stored . \n a dedicated array of acoustic sensors will be installed in the deep - sea environment of the antares site in 2007 . \n the aim is to study the feasibility of a future neutrino detector in water employing the acoustic detection method . \n the technical realisation of the project is well advanced with prototypes of each component ready and tested . \n the setup will provide the possibility to study the acoustic background noise and signals of the deep sea on a long time scale in the frequency range of interest between 1 and 100khz . \n the main goal is to measure the rate of correlated neutrino - like background events on different length scales , which is decisive for assessing the sensitivity of a future acoustic detector for ultra - high - energy neutrinos .", "StartTimeOffset": 2049304103081, "RequestID": "6ca40aaa50356ce5f07683bd4155448631a8f566", "TotalTokens": 2965}

{"ContextTokens": 4046, "GeneratedTokens": 84, "SynthesizedBody": "despite a long history of research in the field of localization , even such a standard problem as the one - dimensional anderson tight - binding model with nearest neighbor hopping and diagonal disorder can still hold surprises . \n this model is described by the equation of motion @xmath0 where , @xmath1 represents a wave function at the @xmath2-th site , @xmath3 is a random site energy distributed uniformly between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the energy . \n recently , schomerus and titov @xcite demonstrated that single parameter scaling ( sps ) , which is a cornerstone of the conceptual framework for dealing with transport properties of disordered systems @xcite , is violated in this classical model of localization in the vicinity of the energy @xmath7 . while the violation of sps in the vicinities of the energies @xmath8 ( which are band boundaries of the system with @xmath9 , i.e. , all @xmath10 ) is well established @xcite , the absence of sps at the band center @xmath7 looks surprising . \n it is yet another manifestation of the anomalous nature of this spectral point . whereas earlier studies of the anderson model revealed an anomalous behavior of the localization length at @xmath7 @xcite , the violation of sps in this spectral region remained unnoticed . \n the mathematical roots of the anomalous behavior of the localization length were established in ref .  . \n at the same time the physical understanding of the nature of the anomalous properties of @xmath7 is still absent . \n here we suggest an approach to this spectral region based on symmetries of the hamiltonian eq . \n ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) , which clarifies the physical nature of this anomaly , and explains scaling properties of the anderson model in this spectral region . \n it is convenient to describe the statistics of conductance , @xmath11 , of a disordered chain of length @xmath12 in terms of the lyapunov exponent ( le ) , @xmath13 , defined as @xcite @xmath14 sps means that the probability distribution of @xmath13 depends on a single parameter , so that , e.g. , any moment of this distribution can be expressed through the mean value of le , @xmath15 . \n such a relationship between @xmath16 and the variance , @xmath17 , was first conjectured in ref . \n @xmath18the authors of ref .   demonstrated that at @xmath7 , parameter @xmath19 of eq . \n ( [ sps ] ) deviates from the sps value and is equal to @xmath20 . \n this deviation from eq . \n ( [ sps ] ) , which was overlooked by previous studies probably due to its small size , is of principle importance . \n it seemingly contradicts a well established criterion for sps introduced in ref .  . \n in this letter we show that this is only an apparent contradiction , and explain the violation of sps at @xmath7 within the general picture developed in ref .  . \n the anomaly at @xmath7 turns out to result from a hidden symmetry of the tight - binding model , which splits the conduction band into two adjacent bands with a boundary at @xmath7 . \n this splitting does not affect thermodynamic properties of the model but is crucial to its scaling behavior .    before presenting our resolution of the mysterious behavior in the vicinity of @xmath7 , \n let us recall the history of the criterion for sps . \n originally , anderson , et al . \n @xcite suggested that sps holds when the localization length of the system , @xmath21 exceeds what they called the phase randomization length : @xmath22 . \n the stationary distribution of the phases of the reflection and transmission amplitudes in disordered one - dimensional systems was assumed to become uniform as soon as the system length @xmath12 exceeds @xmath23 . \n many authors derived eq . \n ( [ sps ] ) from this phase randomization hypothesis for several different models . \n the phase randomization itself was rigorously proven only for few particular models : banded matrices @xcite , the anderson tight - binding model with diagonal disorder @xcite , and a continuous model with a white - noise random potential @xcite for certain spectral regions . at the same time \n , it was shown that for some values of energies , such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 for the model described by eq . \n ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) the stationary distribution of the phases is not uniform stone , kappus , derrida , goldhirsch1994,izrailev , ossipov . \n although in the vicinities of these special energies sps is indeed violated @xcite , the criterion for sps based on the phase randomization length does not seem to describe the situation adequately . indeed , the absence of the phase randomization in all situations discussed above does not mean that the relaxation  length of the phase distribution diverges and exceeds the localization length when one approaches the respective energies . \n what actually happens is that the uniform contribution to the stationary phase distribution vanishes in the vicinity of these special energies . as a result , the nonuniform part , which always exists but is usually small , becomes dominant @xcite . \n thus , the phase randomization length , as it was introduced in ref . \n @xcite , is ill - defined . \n thus , appealing to the phase distribution in connection with sps simply substitutes the problem of formulating a criterion for sps by the problem of finding a criterion for the uniform distribution of phases . \n previously proposed criteria for the latter are specific for particular models . \n for instance , in ref .   for the anderson model within the white noise approximation , \n the criteria for the phase randomization for the band edges and the band center are set as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( @xmath26 is a measure of the disorder strength ) . \n these definitions do not look satisfactory to us . \n we believe that the criterion should be universal and formulated in terms of some fundamental macroscopic quantities . \n such a universal criterion for sps similar in form to the anderson s , @xmath22 , was recently suggested in ref . \n : @xmath27 the new length scale , @xmath28 , has nothing to do with @xmath23 and can be expressed through the integral density of states normalized by the total number of states in the band , @xmath29 , and a distance between the neighboring sites , @xmath30 : @xmath31 . \n \\label{ls}\\ ] ] this criterion was extracted from the exact calculation of the variance of le for the anderson model with the cauchy distribution of the site energies , @xmath3 ( the lloyd model ) . \n ( [ sps ] ) was derived in ref .   without any relation to the phase distribution . \n obtained in ref . \n differs by the factor of @xmath32 from the standard form eq . \n ( [ sps ] ) because of the peculiarities of the cauchy distribution ] for in - band states , @xmath33 and @xmath28 is microscopic and therefore is not significant . \n for the states close to the band edges and fluctuation states in the former band gaps , where @xmath34 or @xmath35 , @xmath28 becomes macroscopic and can exceed @xmath36 . in the latter case \n , @xmath28 has a clear physical meaning as an average distance between localization centers responsible for the states with energies between @xmath6 and the closest fluctuation boundary of the spectrum . \n the expression of @xmath37 in terms of the density of states @xmath29 allowed authors of refs .   to conjecture a generalization of this definition to other models . \n it was suggested that @xmath29 in eq . \n ( [ ls ] ) must be understood as the total number of states ( per unit length ) between @xmath6 and a closest genuine spectral boundary normalized by the total number of states . \n this definition of @xmath37 can be used also in the case of systems with multiple bands , provided that the disorder does not fill the band gaps of the original systems completely , and there exist genuine spectral boundaries inside each of the band gaps . under this condition \n , @xmath29 refers to the number of states associated with one particular band of the spectrum , and varies between @xmath38 and @xmath39 when @xmath6 spans the states of the band .    in light of this criterion \n , one can understand the violation of sps in the band gaps of the initial spectrum observed numerically in ref .  . \n applicability of the @xmath37-based criterion was examined for several other models such as the anderson model with the box @xcite and dichotomic @xcite distributions of the site energies , the model of a scalar wave propagating through a one - dimensional disordered periodic - on - average superlattice , and even for the model of a wave propagating in an absorbing medium @xcite . \n in all these cases , the criterion perfectly described the transition between the sps behavior of in - band states , and non - sps behavior of the band edge and fluctuation states . \n moreover , as was shown recently in ref .  , the length @xmath37 plays an even more important role than simply determining a boundary between sps and non - sps spectral regions : the second and the third moments of the distribution of the lyapunov exponent in the non - sps region can be parameterized by a single parameter @xmath40 provided that @xmath12 exceeds @xmath37 . \n , there is an additional parameter @xmath41 , which describes an anomalous behavior of the second moment @xcite . ] \n the success of the scaling approach based on the parameter @xmath40 , eqs . \n ( [ eles ] ) and ( [ ls ] ) , in predicting violations of sps at the band edges of different models , and in describing the probability distribution of le in non - sps spectral regions @xcite motivated us to look more carefully at the reasons for the apparent failure of this approach at the center of the band of the anderson model .    we start our analysis with a tight - binding model without disorder , @xmath42 . the solution of eq . \n ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) at @xmath42 is plane waves , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 satisfying the dispersion equation @xmath45 according to the traditional widely accepted point of view , eq . \n ( [ dispersion ] ) describes a single energy band @xmath46 ,    however , this model contains more than the simple picture reveals . \n indeed , the equations of motion , eq .  ( [ eq_of_motion ] ) , at @xmath42 acquire an additional symmetry : operation @xmath47 transforms a state @xmath48 into the state @xmath49 : @xmath50 . \n this operation forms a group , and the states of this model can be classified according to its irreducible representations .    in order to realize these representations , we introduce two field invariants with respect to @xmath51 : @xmath52 solving equations of motion for these fields we find that the spectrum is separated into two branches described by the following dispersion equations @xmath53 two bands of the spectrum described by eq . \n ( [ newdisp ] ) have a common boundary at @xmath7 , and , therefore , the spectrum of the system appears as consisting of a single band , as it is usually assumed . \n however , the classification of the states according to the irreducible representations of @xmath51 reveals that @xmath7 should be considered as a band boundary rather than as a band center . \n the new description of the band structure can be viewed as a transition to the reduced zone representation , where the wave number of the original dispersion equation eq . \n ( [ dispersion ] ) is restricted to the interval @xmath54 . \n this operation is equivalent to doubling of the elementary cell of the original periodic chain . \n this can be justified by noticing that two adjacent sites of the chain are not equivalent with respect to the operation @xmath51 [ eq .  ( [ dn ] ) ] . \n the considerations presented above would have been merely an exercise , if the vicinity of @xmath7 did not behave anomalously in the presence of disorder . \n of course , any disorder mixes states from @xmath55 and @xmath56 bands . \n however , since violation of sps occurs in the vicinity of a spectral boundary of an unperturbed system @xcite , one can expect that @xmath7 behaves similarly to @xmath57 boundaries . \n actually a similarity between properties of @xmath7 and other band boundaries was noted already in ref .  , where it was shown that the calculation of the le in the vicinities of all three points @xmath58 , and @xmath7 required almost identical mathematical approach .    the deviation of the parameter @xmath59 , eq . \n ( [ sps ] ) , from unity observed in ref . \n can be interpreted as a manifestation of the band - edge nature of the spectral point @xmath7 . \n this deviation is , however , different from the behavior of @xmath60 in the vicinity of @xmath8 . near @xmath8 \n , @xmath60 demonstrates a small overshoot above unity at the band side of these boundaries , and decreases quickly at the band gap sides @xcite . \n since two conduction bands are adjacent at @xmath7 , there is no band gap related decrease of @xmath61 . \n however , the band - edge nature of @xmath7 still manifests itself in the form of the overshoot , discovered in ref .  . \n this overshoot appears at both sides of @xmath7 . \n the fundamental question is whether the deviation from sps near @xmath7 occurs in accordance with the criterion eq . \n ( [ eles ] ) ? \n the answer is `` yes '' , however , the definition of the length @xmath28 , eq . \n ( [ ls ] ) , should be modified to reflect the fact that the states are now distributed between two bands . \n accordingly , when calculating @xmath28 for each of the bands , we have to keep in mind that @xmath29 in eq . \n ( [ ls ] ) is a number of states between @xmath7 and a given energy @xmath6 normalized by the total number of states in this band . \n the results of the numerical calculations based on the new definition of @xmath28 reveal first of all ( fig . \n [ fig : e0scaling ] ) that the criterion @xmath62 and sps are indeed violated simultaneously near @xmath7 as well as near @xmath63 . what we find even more important , however , is that the results of the calculations for different energies , strengths of disorder , and lengths of the system , all collapse to a single curve , when presented in the form @xmath59 \n . thus @xmath64 , after the proper definition of @xmath37 , remains a natural scaling variable for the entire spectrum of the system . \n this means that separating negative and positive energies in two bands is physically significant . \n of course , functions @xmath65 for the vicinities of @xmath63 and @xmath7 , do not coincide . \n this does not cause problems for our scaling description as long as these two regions are well separated by the spectral interval where @xmath66 . \n additional arguments in favor of our interpretation of the @xmath7 anomaly can be obtained by modifying the initial anderson model . \n for example , one can include next to the nearest neighbors interaction , and consider a model determined by the equation @xmath67 the spectrum of this model , in the absence of disorder , consists of two branches , only one of which corresponds to propagating states for @xmath68 . \n this branch is invariant with respect to a similar symmetry @xmath69 . \n the stationary point of this transformation @xmath70 is a boundary between two adjacent bands . \n numerical calculations confirmed that indeed there is an anomaly in the dependence of the scaling parameter @xmath71 at @xmath72 similar to the one discussed above ( see inset in fig .  [ \n fig : e0scaling ] ) .    to justify the physical significance of our treatment of @xmath7 as a band edge \n further we added a periodic potential @xmath73 to random site energies @xmath74 . \n this potential breaks the symmetry of the model , and creates in the vicinity of @xmath7 a real band gap with a width proportional to @xmath75 . \n the idea is to look at the sensitivity of the anomalous behavior in the vicinity of @xmath7 to the presence of the real band gap . \n this gap should decrease together with the magnitude of the symmetry - breaking potential . \n will the features associated with the gap survive the vanishing of the gap width ? the results of the numerical simulations answering this question are presented in fig . \n [ fig : symmetry breaking ] . \n one can see that the anomalies in @xmath59 remain stable with respect to the symmetry - breaking perturbation . in the limit @xmath76 \n , @xmath59 has the same behavior as for small but finite @xmath77 . \n this observation in conjunction with the scaling arguments presented above gives strong support to our treatment of @xmath7 as a band edge . \n finally , there is one more question that should be addressed . \n choosing an appropriate periodic potential one can create a band gap centered not only at @xmath78 but anywhere in the spectrum . \n why , then , is sps violated only near @xmath7 ? \n it follows from our numerical studies that when the periodic potential is weak and @xmath79 , the @xmath59-function always approaches the band edge without any overshoot above its sps value , @xmath80 ; it simply decreases inside the gap . as a result \n , the normal sps - like behavior is restored once the periodic potential vanishes . in the lloyd model , \n the similar behavior is characteristic for all band boundaries , @xmath81 . \n therefore , the absence of a real band gap at @xmath7 masks the actual nature of this energy , and the center - band anomaly in the behavior of the second moment is not observed . \n concluding , we resolved the mystery of the anomalous properties in the vicinity of @xmath7 in the anderson model with diagonal disorder . \n we demonstrated that due to an additional symmetry of the respective hamiltonian , this spectral point must be considered as a band boundary between two adjacent bands rather than the center of a single band . \n the relevance of the criterion for sps suggested in refs .   is thus reestablished . \n our approach allows one to describe statistical properties of conductance in the vicinity of @xmath7 within the framework of the scaling approach of ref .  . \n the authors thank steve schwarz for reading and commenting on the manuscript . \n the work at queens college was supported by afosr under contract no . \n f49620 - 02 - 1 - 0305 , and partially by psc - cuny grants . \n ba gratefully acknowledges partial support by the epsrc grant gr / r95432 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2057858836907, "RequestID": "9af8bbfd76a2fbc64b6bb38d40a461702335bc9c", "TotalTokens": 4130}
{"ContextTokens": 3803, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "the number of discovered extrasolar planets is increasing quickly during recent years . according to the extrasolar planets catalog maintained by jean schneider ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets/catalog.html ) , in may 2002 , \n there are about 77 extrasolar planets around 69 main sequence stars . \n these planets with mass range from 0.16 to 17 jupiter masses ( @xmath0 ) have semimajor axes from 0.04 au to 4.5 au and also a wide range of eccentricities . \n interestingly , there is a planet moving on an extremely elongated orbit ( @xmath1 ) around the solar - type star hd 80606 ( naef et al . \n these exciting discoveries provide great opportunities to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems . \n for example , jiang & ip ( 2001 ) showed that the interaction with disc is important to explain the original orbital elements during the planetary formation . \n yeh & jiang ( 2001 ) analytically showed that the scattered planets should in general move on an eccentric orbit and thus the orbital circularization must be important for scattered planets if they are now moving on nearly circular orbits ( see jiang & yeh 2002a , jiang & yeh 2002b for the following up ) . \n in addition to the dynamical studies , tabachnik & tremaine ( 2002 ) used the maximum likelihood method to estimate the mass and period distributions of extrasolar planets and found there is a mass - period correlation , but they attributed their finding to the observational selection effect .    however , zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) claimed that this mass - period correlation can not be completely explained by the observational selection effect . \n they did some monte carlo simulations and show the real dependency between the mass and period of extrasolar planets . \n this mass - period correlation gives the paucity of massive close - in planets . \n since they are supposed to be the easiest to detect , zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) said this paucity was unlikely to be the result of any selection effect . \n ptzold & rauer ( 2002 ) have reported the possible explanation about the absence of massive close - in planets by tidal interaction . \n they defined `` critical mass '' to be the maximum mass that the planet can have and survive under the tidal interaction from the central star for a given particular semimajor axis . \n they determined the critical mass as function of semimajor axis for some assumed stellar dissipation factors and the ages of the planetary systems . \n their results showed that most planetary systems are located at the permitted region of the `` critical mass - semimajor axis '' plot ( their figure 3 ) except the @xmath2 boo system , which needs more careful treatment for the assumed parameter values . \n however , if these planets could be formed a bit farther from the central star initially , they should still survive under the tidal interaction and thus might be detected during the inward migration . \n one should keep in mind that the location where the planets are detected are not where they are formed . \n the planets from farther place could migrate inward to the region closer to the central star and probably have chances to be detected by us . to further investigate this problem \n , we carefully study the planetary migration due to tidal interaction . \n we try to include the effect of orbital eccentricity at the beginning and we confirm that that the model used in ptzold & rauer ( 2002 ) is a good approximation . \n we thus use the similar model in ptzold & rauer ( 2002 ) for the rest calculations . \n we describe our basic models for tidal interaction in section 2 and the results will be in section 3 . \n we provide concluding remarks in section 4 . \n a tide is raised on the central star by the close - in planet because the force experienced by the side of the central star facing the planet is stronger than that experienced by the far side of the central star . \n we consider below the models for planets on both circular and eccentric orbits .      if the close - in planet is moving on a circular , equatorial orbit , according to the tidal potential theory , this planet would change its orbit following below formula :    = sign(- n ) ( ) ^5 n a , where @xmath3 is the semimajor axis \n , @xmath4 is the time , @xmath5 is the rotating angular speed of the central star , @xmath6 is the stellar love number , @xmath7 is the tidal dissipation function , @xmath8 is the planetary mass , @xmath9 is the mass of the central star , @xmath10 is the central star s radius and @xmath11 is the orbital mean motion which is determined by n=.    we set @xmath12 ( murray & dermott 1999 ) and take @xmath13 ( the average value in ptzold & rauer 2002 ) . \n the above formula provides a good simple tool to study the tidal orbital decay for close - in planets . \n however , in fact , most discovered planets have certain amount of orbital eccentricities . \n some of these eccentricities are even very big . \n we plan to include the effect of eccentricity into the calculations by the following equations . \n we know that the angular momentum is related to orbital eccentricity @xmath14 . \n thus , the evolution of semimajor axis @xmath3 due to tidal interaction should depend on eccentricity @xmath14 because the tidal torque change the orbital angular momentum of planets .    the mechanical energy decreasing rate @xmath15 due to tidal interaction is = ( - ) , where @xmath16 is the magnitude of the torque , @xmath5 is the spin angular speed of the central star and @xmath17 is the orbital angular speed of the planet at particular time . \n @xmath16 can be approximated by : = k r^5 , these parameters are defined in last sub - section . \n the orbital angular speed of the planet can be expressed as = , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is approximated as @xmath20 . \n therefore , = k r^5 [ - ]    on the other hand , the mechanical energy of the system can be expressed as    e= i ^2 - g and    = i + g by kepler s third law , g(m+m ) = n^2 a^3 , we have = i + n^2 a . \n further , the angular momentum of the system is l= \n a^2 n ( 1-e^2)^1/2 , where @xmath21 is the moment of inertia of the central star , @xmath14 is the orbital eccentricity and we have ignore the contribution from the spin of the planet .    by the conservation of angular momentum , @xmath22 , we have    i = - na + n a^2 .    in general , both terms on the right hand side of equation ( 12 ) should be considered . \n the second term divided by the first term would be e^2(1-e^2 ) [ ( ) ^2 ( ) ^5 ] , where equation ( 4.198 ) in murray & dermott ( 1999 ) has been used to estimate the value of @xmath23 and we use @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 etc . to replace the corresponding parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 etc . of equation ( 4.198 ) in murray & dermott ( 1999 ) . \n if we use the jupiter as an example , this ratio would be about 1 when @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n we plan to consider the simple case when @xmath32 is small enough and the second term can be ignored . we will leave more general case in which both orbital migration and circularization need to be included to the future work . \n thus , = ( n - ) na    from equation ( 14 ) and equation ( 6 ) , we have    = 3k ( n-)^-1 [ - ] , where @xmath5 is related to @xmath3 by equation ( 11 ) .    given an assumed initial angular momentum @xmath33 etc . \n , @xmath3 can be solved numerically by equation ( 15 ) . \n by the equations in last section , we can study the inward migration of planets due to tidal interaction . \n we place the planet at different initial semimajor axis as different case : 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 and also 0.06 au . \n figure 1 are the plots of semimajor axis as function of time for these different initial semimajor axes when we set the planetary mass to be particular value . \n thus , there are five curves on each panel of figure 1 . \n figure 1(a)-(d ) are the results when the planetary masses are assumed to be 5@xmath34 , 2@xmath34 , @xmath34 , 0.5@xmath34 individually . \n since 2 gyrs is about the age of @xmath2 boo system and thus we regard 2 gyrs as the typical age of extrasolar planetary systems . \n those planets who can survive for 2 gyrs under the tidal interaction are possible to be detected . \n all the curves are the results when we assume the planets move on circular orbits and the triangle points are the results when the planets move on eccentric orbits ( assume @xmath35 and @xmath32 is small enough ) . in general , the results of eccentric orbits are quite similar to the results of circular orbits and the ignorance of eccentricity will not affect the determination of planet surviving time scale etc . \n this confirms that the equations used in ptzold and rauer ( 2002 ) are good approximations and we thus use the model of circular orbits for all the rest calculations . \n figure 1(a)-(d ) show that when initial semimajor axis @xmath36 au the planet would only have tiny migration during 2 gyrs . \n the planet can easily survive under the tidal interaction . \n if initial semimajor axis @xmath37 au , the orbital semimajor axis decays a bit more . \n if the initial semimajor axis @xmath38 au , the planet fall into the central star when @xmath4 is about 1 gyrs for the case of 5@xmath34 but still survive for all other cases . \n when initial semimajor axis @xmath39 au , the planet falls into the central star within 1.5 gyrs . \n if initial semimajor axis @xmath40 au , the planet almost approaches to the central star immediately . \n the detection probability for particular range of semimajor axis depends on how much time the planet can survive around that range . \n we plot the time the planet should spend from one semimajor axis @xmath41 to another semimajor axis @xmath42 ( we assume @xmath43 ) during the orbital decay in figure 2 . \n there are two sets of @xmath41 : one makes @xmath44 au ( dotted lines ) , another set @xmath45 au ( solid lines ) . figure 2(a)-(d ) are the results when we set the planetary mass to be 5@xmath34 , 2@xmath34 , @xmath0 , 0.5@xmath0 individually .    in figure 2(a)-(b ) , the planet spends more than 1 gyrs to stay around 0.05 au and thus the planet is likely to survive during 2 gyrs . \n however , the planet only stays around @xmath46 au for about 0.5 gyrs and around @xmath47 au for about 0.2 gyrs only . \n these time scales are considerablely smaller than the age of the planetary system and thus the planet initially formed around these locations are very unlikely to be observed . \n when the planetary mass is smaller as in figure ( c)-(d ) , the planet can survive for much longer ( more than 1.5 gyrs ) around 0.04 au and still only stays around 0.03 au for order of 0.5 gyrs . \n this implies that the probability that the planet is detected to be around 0.03 au is very small . \n figure 3 are the @xmath48 plots for all discovered extrasolar planets , where @xmath9 is the planetary mass and @xmath3 is the semimajor axis . \n the data for these planets are from extrasolar planets catalog ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets/catalog.html ) in may 2002 . in figure 3(a ) , we take @xmath3 to be the values of current semimajor axes of these discovered extrasolar planets . \n however , in figure 3(b)-(d ) , we take @xmath3 to be the planetary semimajor axes backward in time for 2 , 6 , 12 gyrs individually . \n the values of @xmath3 backward in time can be obtained by equation ( 1 ) .    in figure 3(b)-(d ) , we found that most planets do not move on the @xmath48 plane but some of them do move a lot when they are backward in time . \n it is quite obvious that the planets line up on the left side of the plots in figure 3(b)-(d ) and the position of this line hardly moves from figure 3(b ) to 3(d ) . \n this line can be approximated by ( m / m_j ) = [ 28   ln(a / au ) + 62 ] . \n we can also see that those planets do not move much are all on the right side of this line . \n this line can thus be regarded as the `` critical line '' : all planets on the right side of this line would not migrate much during their lifetime but all the planets standing on this critical line of figure 3(b)-(d ) would move to the left - up corner of figure 3(a ) after 2 , 6 or 12 gyrs and finally all the planets on the left side of this line would migrate inward quickly to approach the central star and thus can not be detected . \n as dynamical friction successfully explained the orbit of sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( jiang & binney 2001 ) , the tidal interaction can indeed explain the current observed mass - period correlation reported by zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) . \n the results in figure 1 give us the full picture of inward migration due to tidal interaction . \n we found that 0.03 au seems to be the critical semimajor axis for the planet with mass of order of @xmath2 boo system to survive in 2 gyrs . \n this is consistent with the current observational results that the smallest semimajor axis of discovered planet is about 0.04 au . \n on the other hand , we can also check this minimum possible semimajor axis from another point of view . in figure 2 , \n the time scale for a planet can survive is smaller if the planet is closer to the central star initially and the time a planet can stay around 0.03 au is considerablely much less than 2 gyrs , which was regarded as the typical age of these planetary systems . \n because time scale is too short , the probability to detect the planet is very small . \n moreover , we interestingly discover the observational `` critical line '' on @xmath48 plane . all the planets on the left side of this line would migrate inward quickly to approach the central star and thus can not be detected . \n therefore , the initial configuration on @xmath48 plane might be composed of all the points on figure 3(b ) plus those points which might have been on the left side of the `` critical line '' about 2 gyrs ago but disappear in figure 3(a ) because these planets already fall into the central star . from this point of view \n , even there is correlation between mass and period for current discovered planets as claimed by zucker & mazeh ( 2002 ) , this correlation could be weaker or less obvious at the time when these planets were just formed since we can add arbitrary number of `` possible '' planets on the left side of our observational `` critical line '' if there is no difficulty to form planets there in theory . \n this tells us that we should be careful when we try to link the mass - period correlation to the theory of planetary formation . \n we are grateful to the referee s good suggestions . \n this work is supported in part by the national science council , taiwan , under grants nsc 90 - 2112-m-008 - 052 . \n jiang , i .- \n g . & binney , j. , 2000 , mnras , 314 , 468

called quantum spin liquid has been suggested as a possible parent state of high temperature superconductivity upon electron or hole doping @xcite . \n the quantum fluctuation is usually enhanced with small spin , low dimensionality , and geometric frustration . \n indeed , so far almost all the candidates of quantum spin liquid discovered or proposed are effective spin-1/2 systems with or without charge fluctuations on triangular lattice @xcite , on kagome lattice zncu1,zncu2,bacu , cuv , huse2010 , or on honeycomb lattice wangfa2010,sondhi2011,lauchli2011,reuther2011,meng2010 . \n besides the exotic quantum spin liquid phases , strong quantum fluctuations in spin-1/2 systems can also lead to highly unconventional quantum critical points . \n for example , it has been proposed that a generic direct second order quantum phase transition between a magnetic ordered phase and a paramagnetic phase with broken lattice symmetry can exist in spin-1/2 quantum magnets senthil2004a , senthil2004b . \n such a transition is forbidden by the classic landau -

quadrupolar phase , in agreement with both the semiclassicalchen - levy , papanicolaou88 and quantum monte carlo@xcite results . \n .,width=302 ]    . , width=302 ]    in the staggered magnetization curve a sharp jump shows at @xmath61 . \n this feature was also observed in the quantum monte carlo calculation on a square lattice@xcite . \n but the quadrupolar moment is finite and changes continuously at this point . \n so a first order phase transition occurs , in consistence with the conclusion drawn from the first derivative of the ground state energy . \n as expected , the staggered quadrupolar moment @xmath62 vanishes in the fm , af and ferro - quadrupolar phases . \n a surprising result is that this moment also vanishes in the classical staggered quadrupolar phase @xmath17 , i.e. the quantum fluctuation suppresses completely the staggered quadrupolar order , different from the previous studies on the triangular or square lattices @xcite . \n more interestingly , the critical point has been shifted by the quantum fluctuation from @xmath63 to about @xmath64 , which excludes the su(3 ) af heisenberg spin-1 model from any long - range magnetic order .        to further characterize the phase for @xmath65 \n , we have performed a thorough exploration of three possible vbs patterns ( fig . \n fig : vbspattern ) on the honeycomb lattice . \n it has been checked that whatever vbs patterns we start with , it always converges into the plaquette order phase ( fig . \n [ fig : vbspattern](a ) ) under renormalization group flow . \n hence the ground state energy of the plaquette vbs phase is the lowest . \n this plaquette order phase explicitly breaks the lattice translation symmetry , but not the spin su(2 ) symmetry . \n a naive picture of this plaquette order is that , in order to minimize the ground state energy , the spins on one third of the minimal hexagons of the honeycomb lattice form the vbs phase , like the haldane gapped phase in one dimension .    in order to detect the plaquette order \n , we calculate the plaquette order parameter defined as @xmath66where @xmath67 @xmath68 means the two nearest neighbor spins connected by red ( black ) bond of fig . \n fig : vbspattern(a ) . fig . \n [ fig : pvbs_theta ] shows the @xmath16-dependence of the plaquette order parameters . \n both the plaquette and af orders vanish simultaneously and continuously at the critical point @xmath69 . \n this observation suggests that this plaquette - af transition is in fact a second order transition , in consistence with the conclusion drawn from the first and second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to @xmath16 in fig . \n [ fig : de_theta ] . \n but we are still unable to rule out the possibility of a very weak first order transition , partly due to the finite bond dimension @xmath22 . \n however , around the transition point between antiferromagnetic and plaquette valence bond solid phases , we have evaluated the ground state wave function using the cluster update approach proposed by wang et al.@xcite . \n the cluster update considers long range entanglement by computing larger block size . \n the accuracy of the computation near a second order phase transition can be improved by using relatively small cluster size ( 6 sites ) .    . \n , width=302 ] \n a second order transition between af and vbs order was originally predicted theoretically as the deconfined quantum critical point . \n this theory is based on the observation that the topological defect ( skyrmion ) of the af order parameter carries a finite lattice momentum , thus after the af order is suppressed by the skyrmion proliferation , the system automatically enters the vbs order . \n the previous studies on deconfined criticality were focused on spin-1/2 systems only , and this theory has gained strong numerical evidence from quantum monte carlo simulation on a spin-1/2 model on the square lattice with both two - body and four - body interactions sandvik1,sandvik2,kaulmelko . \n our present result actually gives rise to a possible deconfined quantum critical point in the spin-1 systems . \n using the techniques in ref . \n [ ] , we can show that for spin-1 systems on the honeycomb lattice the momenta carried by the skyrmion will precisely lead to the plaquette order pattern after the skyrmion proliferation @xcite . \n due to the critical point between af and plaquette order at @xmath70 , our numerical result also implies that the ground state of the su(3 ) af heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice has a plaquette order . \n this result concurs with the recent studies on the su(n ) heisenberg model @xcite , which suggested that the su(n ) spins tend to form block singlets that are commensurate with the lattice .    to summarize , the ground state phase diagram of the quantum spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice has been determined precisely . besides the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and ferro - quadrupolar phases , a plaquette order phase is found in the region of @xmath71 for the first time , where the classical af or staggered quadrupolar order is completely suppressed by quantum fluctuations . \n the quantum phase transition between af and the plaquette order phase is found to be either a direct second order or a very weak first order transition . \n this is a possible candidate of a deconfined quantum critical point in a quantum spin-1 system . \n further investigation on the critical properties around this point is desired . \n we would like to thank ling wang for stimulating discussion . \n this work is supported by nsfc and the grants of national program for basic research of most of china . \n cenke xu is supported by the sloan research fellowship . \n another columnar vbs order ( fig . \n [ fig : vbspattern](b ) ) has the same symmetry as the plaquette order , which in principle can also be a candidate phase of the skyrmion condensate . however , in this part of the phase diagram the energy of the columnar vbs order is higher than the plaquette order . \n one can see this by noting that the su(3 ) invariant point is in this plaquette phase , and the plaquette phase can be adiabatically connected to a su(3 ) singlet phase , while the vbs order in fig . \n fig : vbspattern(b ) can not . thus we conclude that the plaquette order is energetically more favorable than the columnar vbs order close to the su(3 ) point .", "StartTimeOffset": 2117392519978, "RequestID": "90b6aa7f583cbdd030d84bd8883168ed9302d917", "TotalTokens": 3949}
{"ContextTokens": 2108, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "in this paper we present a summary of the r@xmath1d results and expected performance of a hadron blind detector ( hbd ) which has been developed as an upgrade of the phenix detector at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl \n . the hbd will allow the measurement of electron - positron pairs from the decay of the light vector mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and the low - mass ( @xmath5 1 gev / c@xmath6 ) pair continuum in au+au collisions . \n dileptons are valuable probes to diagnose the hot and dense matter formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . \n the physics potential of this probe is fully confirmed by results from lower energy experiments . \n the most prominent result is the strong enhancement of low - mass electron pairs observed by the ceres experiment @xcite at the cern sps and recently confirmed by the na60 results @xcite . \n this enhancement triggered a wealth of theoretical activity and was quantitatively reproduced only by invoking the thermal radiation from a high density hadron gas ( @xmath7 ) with in - medium modification of the intermediate @xmath2 meson which could be linked to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . \n the measurement of electron pairs is however a very challenging one . \n the main difficulty arises from the huge combinatorial background , i.e. uncorrelated pairs formed by tracks from unrecognized @xmath8 conversions and @xmath9 dalitz decays . for example \n , the analysis of run-4 data taken with the present phenix configuration @xcite shows that the signal to background ratio , s / b , at the invariant mass of m @xmath10  500  mev / c@xmath6 is approximately 1/500 , making the measurement of the low - mass pair continuum practically impossible . \n an upgrade of the phenix detector is therefore necessary for this measurement . \n the present paper is focussed on the comprehensive r&d program that we have carried out over the past two years to develop such an upgrade @xcite . \n the upgrade consists of two elements : a ) installation ( foreseen in the original design of phenix ) of an inner coil which results in an almost field - free region close to the vertex , extending out to @xmath10 60 cm in the radial direction ; b ) the major and challenging element of the upgrade is a hadron - blind detector ( hbd ) located in this field free region . fig . \n [ fig : hbdinphnx ] shows the layout of the inner part of the phenix detector together with the location of the coils and the proposed hbd . \n the main task of the hbd is to recognize and reject @xmath8 conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays . \n the strategy is to exploit the fact that the opening angle of electron pairs from these sources is very small compared to the pairs from light vector mesons . in the field - free region , this angle is preserved and by applying an opening angle cut one can reject more than 90% of the conversions and @xmath11 dalitz decays , while preserving most of the signal . \n based on monte carlo simulations , the main hbd specifications are : electron identification with a very high efficiency ( @xmath12 90@xmath13 ) , double hit recognition at a comparable level and moderate @xmath14 rejection factor of @xmath10100 . \n we analyzed possible realizations of the hbd detector and finally adopted the following scheme : a windowless erenkov detector , operated with pure cf@xmath0 in a proximity focus configuration and directly coupled to a triple gas electron multiplier ( gem ) @xcite detector with a csi photocathode evaporated on the top face of the first gem foil and with pad readout . \n the concept described in the previous section exhibits a number of very attractive features : a ) the choice of cf@xmath0 both as radiator and detector gas in a windowless geometry results in a very large bandwidth ( 6 - 11.5 ev ) and consequently in a very large figure of merit n@xmath15 ( @xmath10800  @xmath16 ) . with these unprecedented numbers , \n the number of photoelectrons n@xmath17 is expected to be of the order of 35 for a 50 cm long radiator ; b ) the readout scheme foresees the detection of the erenkov photoelectrons in a pad plane with hexagonal pads of size slightly smaller than the blob size ( @xmath1010 cm@xmath6 ) such that the probability of a single - pad hit by an electron entering the hbd is negligibly small . on the other hand , whenever a hadron gives a signal in the hbd , it will produce a single pad hit with an almost 100% probability . \n this will provide a strong handle in the hadron rejection factor of the hbd ; c ) the relatively large pad size results also in a low granularity and therefore a low cost detector . \n in addition , since the photoelectrons produced by a single electron will be distributed between at most three pads , one can expect a primary charge of at least 10 electrons / pad , allowing operation of the detector at a relatively moderate gain of a few times 10@xmath19 . \n this is a crucial advantage for the stable operation of a uv photon detector . \n however , many elements of the proposed hbd were new and had not been tested before in the laboratory . \n a number of issues and questions were raised which required dedicated investigation . to address these questions and to demonstrate the concept validity , \n a comprehensive r&d program was needed . \n the results of this effort are summarized below @xcite :    * we have shown that a triple gem detector with a reflective csi photocathode operates in a stable mode at gains up to 10@xmath20 in pure cf@xmath0 . * \n a charge saturation effect occurring in cf@xmath0 when the total charge in the avalanche reaches 4@xmath2110@xmath22  e makes the hbd relatively robust against discharges . \n * we carried out a test of a triple gem detector operated with pure cf@xmath0 at the proposed location inside the phenix central arm spectrometer . \n the detector performed smoothly in the presence of au+au collisions exhibiting no discharges or gain instabilities . \n * we have studied the basic parameters which determine the hbd performance . in particular , we measured the device response to mip s and to electrons . \n large hadron rejection factors , well in excess of 100 , can be achieved while preserving an electron detection efficiency larger than 90% . \n * we confirmed measurements of the csi quantum efficiency over the bandwidth 6 - 8.3  ev and extended them up to 10.3  ev . \n extrapolation to the expected operational bandwidth of the device ( 6 - 11.5 ev ) gives a figure of merit n@xmath15=822 @xmath16 . \n * aging studies of the gem foils as well as the csi photocathode revealed that there is no significant deterioration of the detector for irradiation levels corresponding to @xmath10  10 years of normal phenix operation at rhic . \n these results demonstrated the validity of the proposed hbd concept and paved the way to the incorporation of such a device in the phenix experiment . \n the mechanical design of the hbd has been developed and construction procedures have been exercised and optimized on a full - scale prototype . \n the hbd consists of two identical arms ( see fig .  [ \n fig : hbd-3d_qm2005 ] ) , each one covering 135@xmath23 in azimuth and @xmath240.45 units of pseudorapidity . in each arm \n the detector element is subdivided in 12 detector modules , 6 along the @xmath4 axis @xmath21 2 along the z axis , with a module size of @xmath25 cm@xmath6 . \n the signals are collected in the anode plane consisting of 1152 hexagonal pads in each arm . \n the detector vessel has a polygonal shape made of panels glued together . \n the full - scale prototype design has been integrated into the phenix standard simulation package . \n realistic simulations have been performed using hijing central au+au collisions at @xmath26 gev with embedded @xmath4 mesons . \n we chose a very narrow centrality window : impact parameter b  @xmath27 2  fm ( top 2@xmath13 ) which corresponds to an average charged particle rapidity density of dn@xmath28/dy  @xmath29  940 . \n [ fig : event_display ] shows the reconstructed clusters after clean - up of such a central collision . \n the clean - up is optimized for electron identification and hadron rejection . \n it requires : a ) a pad amplitude @xmath30  p.e . ; \n b ) a cluster amplitude@xmath31  20  p.e . \n ; c ) a cluster size with n@xmath32  2 . out of the huge number of hadrons ( @xmath10400 ) going through the hbd only two are reconstructed demostrating excellent hadron rejection . \n electrons reconstructed in the central arms and matched to a cluster in the hbd are rejected as a ) likely conversions if the cluster amplitude is larger than 60 p.e . ; \n b ) likely @xmath11 dalitz decays if there is another electron cluster in the hbd within a distance of 200  mrad . for the mass region around the @xmath4 meson , \n this results in a reduction of the combinatorial background from these two sources by a factor larger than 100 , compared to the present performance without the hbd . at this level of rejection \n the quality of the low - mass pair measurement is not anymore limited by this background but rather by the combinatorial background from the semi - leptonic decays of charmed mesons .", "StartTimeOffset": 2128227564986, "RequestID": "f35524c9d5fc8f7307f2382810fcd02f0de24e1e", "TotalTokens": 2227}

{"ContextTokens": 2702, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "[ intro ] the measurement of heavy - flavour production as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in hadronic collisions is sensitive to the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production and could give insight into the role of multi - parton interactions ( mpis , i.e. several hard partonic interactions occuring in a single collision between two nucleons ) . \n particle production at the lhc is expected to have a substantial contribution from mpis in pp ( p  pb ) collisions , where the highest multiplicity values observed are similar to the ones of peripheral cu  cu ( pb  pb ) collisions at rhic ( lhc ) . measurements by the cms collaboration of jet and underlying event properties have shown better agreement with models including mpis @xcite . \n measurements by the alice collaboration of minijets point to an increase of mpis with increasing charged - particle multiplicity @xcite . in the heavy - flavour sector \n several measurements have been performed @xcite . \n in particular alice found an approximately linear increase of j/@xmath8 yield as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at @xmath0 = 7 tev @xcite . \n moreover it is interesting to compare heavy - flavour production in p \n pb collisions with pp results to test whether the yield and the transverse momentum distributions follow a scaling with the number of binary nucleon \n nucleon collisions in the p  pb collision . \n this scaling is expected for particles produced in hard ( high virtuality ) partonic scattering processes in the absence of nuclear effects in the initial or in the final state of the p  pb collision . \n this is studied by measuring the nuclear modification factor @xmath9 , defined as the ratio of the @xmath5-differential cross section measured in p \n pb collisions to that measured in pp collisions scaled by the mass number a of the pb nucleus . \n the d - meson @xmath9 in minimum bias p  pb collisions was found consistent with unity for @xmath10 1 gev/@xmath11 within uncertainties of about 20% @xcite , showing that cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects ( nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath12 broadening , energy loss in cold nuclear matter ) do not strongly affect charm - quark production in p \n pb collisions @xcite . \n it is interesting to measure the nuclear modification factor in p \n pb collisions in classes of the event activity , because the latter is related to the collision centrality ( i.e. impact parameter as well as the number of participating nucleons and binary collisions ) of the p  pb collisions . \n the measurement of the @xmath9 requires to estimate the average number of binary collisions @xmath7 for the event activity intervals used in the analysis . \n alice has identified in p \n pb collisions several sources that can induce a bias in the centrality determination based on particle multiplicity measurement @xcite . \n this bias have been observed in the measurement of the nuclear modification factor of charged particles in p \n pb collisions in multiplicity classes @xcite . \n this work investigates whether such a bias is also present for @xmath6 mesons . \n the results are presented in form of the @xmath6-meson self - normalized yield in pp and p  pb collisions , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the d - meson per - event yield in multiplicity intervals , @xmath15 the multiplicity integrated per - event yield , @xmath16 are the corresponding reconstruction and selection efficiencies and @xmath17 is the trigger efficiency ( only relevant in pp ) . \n furthermore , the binary scaling is studied in several event activity classes via the @xmath18 ratio , defiled as : @xmath19 for the v0a and zna event activity estimators respectively , defined in the next section . \n these two observables represent different ways to study the multiplicity dependence of @xmath6-meson production in p \n pb collisions : the self - normalized yields are more focused on the study of mpis , while @xmath18 reflects the scaling of charm production in p \n pb collisions relative to pp collisions . \n the alice detector is described in @xcite . \n the data samples analyzed are from the 2010 pp run ( 300 @xmath20 events at @xmath0 = 7 tev ) and the 2013 p \n pb run ( 100 @xmath20 events at @xmath1 = 5.02 tev ) . \n details on the trigger and event selections can be found in @xcite . \n events are divided in event activity classes . \n three event activity estimators have been used :    * @xmath21 : number of track segments reconstructed in the silicon pixel detector ( spd - two innermost layers of the inner tracking system - @xmath22 ) ; * v0a : signal amplitude of the a - side vzero scintillator ( @xmath23 - pb going direction for p  pb collisions ) ; * zna : energy from nuclear fragments in the a - side zero degree neutron calorimeter ( 112.5 m from interaction point - pb going direction for p  pb collisions ) . \n the self - normalized yields are obtained in @xmath21 intervals , while the @xmath18 analysis adopts v0a and zna multiplicity classes ( 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , 40 - 60% , 60 - 100% ) . \n the analysis is based on the reconstruction of @xmath6 mesons in their hadronic decay channels ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) in the alice central barrel ( @xmath270.9 ) , exploiting the excellent vertex resolution and particle identification capabilities of the alice detector as described in @xcite . \n @xmath6-meson efficiency corrections in pp and p  pb collisions are determined with monte carlo simulations based on pythia 6.4.21 and hijing event generators . \n a fraction of the total @xmath6-meson yield comes from the decay of b mesons . for the @xmath18 analysis \n this contribution was estimated based on fonll pqcd calculations as described in @xcite , while for the self - normalized yield analysis no subtraction has been performed , assuming that the fraction of feed - down @xmath6 mesons does not depend on multiplicity and cancels in the ratio of eq . \n a deviation from this assumption has been considered to estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty . the pp and p \n pb corrected yields have been used to compute the @xmath18 as in eq . \n 2 . the average values of @xmath28 in the four v0a and zna event activity classes have been evaluated as follows :    * v0a : the @xmath29 values have been obtained for each v0a multiplicity interval with the approach used for pb  pb collisions , i.e. via a fit to the v0a multiplicity distribution based on the glauber model for the collision geometry and a two - component model for particle production @xcite . * \n zna : the @xmath30 values have been calculated by scaling the @xmath31 in minimum - bias p  pb collisions by the ratio between the average multiplicity density measured at mid - rapidity for a given zn energy event class and the one measured in minimum bias collisions . \n @xmath32 is obtained as @xmath32 = @xmath30 - 1 . \n the self - normalized yields have been measured for prompt @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons . they are shown in charged - particle multiplicity ( dn@xmath33/d@xmath34 ) intervals ( fig.1 ) , since a simulation study has shown that @xmath21/@xmath35 equals @xmath36 . \n for all the @xmath6-meson species , the yield increases with charged - particle multiplicity . \n no @xmath5 dependence of this trend has been observed . \n the left panel of fig.1 shows @xmath2 self - normalized yields for pp and p  pb collisions . \n both systems show an increase of the yield with charged - particle multiplicity . \n the trend for pp collisions can be interpreted as being due to strong hadronic activity connected with charm production and to the presence of mpis affecting the hard momentum scale relevant for heavy - quark production . in the p \n pb case , it should be considered that high - multiplicity events can also originate from a higher number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the nuclear interaction . \n the right panel of fig.1 shows the average values of self - normalized yields for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 and j/@xmath8 in p \n pb collisions . \n j/@xmath8 yields have been measured in 2.5@xmath374.0 ( p - going direction ) and @xmath38 ( pb - going direction ) and they show an increase with charged - particle multiplicity . \n however a quantitative comparison of j/@xmath8 and @xmath6-meson yields has to take into account the rapidity dependence of cold nuclear matter effects such as gluon shadowing , that depends on the bjorken @xmath39 value of the parton involved in the process producing charm , and energy loss in cold nuclear matter @xcite . \n the average value of @xmath18 for prompt @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons is shown in the left panels of figs . 2 and 3 for the v0a and zna estimators , respectively . \n a bias can be observed in the v0a measurement , where the low - multiplicity @xmath18 is below unity in all six @xmath5 bins , while the zna measurement is compatible with unity within systematic and statistical uncertainties at both low and high event activity . \n these @xmath18 results are compared with the ones obtained for charged particles , shown in the right panels of figs . 2 and 3 . \n these comparisons demonstrate that the @xmath18 of high @xmath5 ( @xmath40 8 gev/@xmath11 ) charged particles feature a similar pattern as the one of @xmath6 mesons , confirming the presence of a bias in the v0a - based determination of @xmath29 that is reduced using the zna estimator . \n this indicates that the determination of @xmath7 depends on the rapidity region in which the event activity measurement is performed . with the least biased estimator ( zna ) \n we observe @xmath18 being compatible with unity for all multiplicites and @xmath5 . \n details on the @xmath28 bias have been presented at this conference and they are described in @xcite .    in conclusion , the d - meson self - normalized yields show an increasing trend with increasing charged - particle multiplicity . \n the trends observed for pp and p  pb collisions are compatible within uncertaintes . \n the @xmath18 results for @xmath6 mesons are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained for high @xmath5 charged particles . \n in particular the zna measurement shows no multiplicity dependence of the @xmath6-meson production in p \n pb collisions relative to binary scaling of pp production cross sections while v0a results show a similar bias as observed for high-@xmath5 charged particles . \n 00 v. khachatryan et al . \n [ the cms collaboration ] , eur . \n j. c 73 ( 2013 ) 2674 a. abelev et al . \n [ alice collaboration ] , jhep 09 ( 2013 ) 049 m aguilar -

what is main processes which cause such a drastic fall of solar activity ? to what extent our insight into the solar activity correct in general ?    for solving mentioned problems \n physicist direct their special attention to cosmogenic isotopes @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 . \n the study of these isotopes may give a lot of information about the dynamics of solar activity .    at present \n the most complete data about the solar activity and the intensity of cosmic rays are obtained by means of the above mentioned cosmogenic isotopes ( @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) formed in the earth s atmosphere . \n the main peculiarity of these isotopes and advantage as compared with others is the fact that there exist objects in nature ( e. g. tree rings , arctic and antarctic ices , algae with long life time , etc . ) which can `` fix '' i.e. `` memorize '' annual concentration of the mentioned isotopes , during period that prevails it s half - life time . \n to study the influence of solar activity ( modu1ation ) in the earth atmosphere on radiocarbon concentration during the maunder minimum we use experimental data obtained at the laboratory of nuclear physics of the tsu @xcite ( fig . \n first of all , it should be noted that experimental data cover the maunder minimum itself ( 1645 - 1720 yy ) ( fig . \n 2 ) and its neighboring periods ( 1600 - 1645 and 1715 - 1800 yy ) too . \n the measurements in @xcite were performed with one - year step , i.e. for every calendar year @xmath4 concentration is measured in the corresponding tree ring . \n the experimental samples of tree rings were obtained in lithuania . \n the value of @xmath4 concentration in relation to the international standard scale is calculated by the following formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath12 represents measured activities of the sample ( s ) , standard ( st ) and background ( b ) , respectively . experimental error \n does not exceed 0.2 - 0.3% . in order to extract variations of @xmath4 \n concentration originated only from the `` cosmic '' sources , it is necessary to exclude the influence of the earth s magnetic field . \n this influence has been widely discussed and to date the most accurate estimation is that : global change of geomagnetic field with period of 10 thousand years causes about 10% change in @xmath4 data . \n the following expression accounts for the geomagnetic field effect in @xmath4 concentration @xmath13 , \\ ] ] where t is current calendar year ( t is negative b.c . ) . \n as we mentioned above the effective tool for studying the solar activity dynamics during the maunder minimum is to reveal the cyclings in @xmath4 time dependence ( i.e. periodicities in experimental data given in fig.2 ) . for this purpose \n the method of spectral analysis has been used @xcite . the calculated power spectrum is shown in fig.3 . according to fig.3 the main peak at frequency 0.05 lies in high reliability interval ( 95% ) ( corresponding period @xmath2 year ) . \n small peak is observed at frequency 0.12 ( corresponding period @xmath3 year ) though it s reliability is comparatively low . \n 1 .   using the method of spectral analysis \n we have revealed variations in cosmogenic radiocarbon concentration in the earth atmosphere during the maunder minimum . \n periodicities of two types have been revealed in experimental data . \n 3 .   the reason of the mentioned periodicities is the solar activity . \n this means that in the maunder minimum period modulating action of the sun was weak , nevertheless cycling is preserved \n . it can be also said that in period of the maunder minimum the mechanism of solar dynamo still works . \n reduction of the number of the sunspots may be caused by the coincidence of the minima of any other long - term periodicities at the moment of the maunder minimum . \n kocharov , i.v . \n zhorzholiani , z.v . \n lomtatidze , r.y . \n metskvarishvili , s.l . \n tsereteli , radiocarbon , 1992 , v.34 , n2,p . \n 213 - 217 . \n kocharov , y. n. markov , r.y . \n metskvarishvili , s. l. tsereteli . \n materials of the seminar `` intensity of cosmic rays and cosmogen isotopes '' . 1983 . \n l. 101.[in russian ] i.v . \n zhorzholiani , p. g. kereselidze , et al . \n materials of intern . \n seminar `` experimental methods of astrophysical and geophysical phenomena study '' . 1988 . \n l. 114.[in russian ] g. m. jenkins , d. g. watts `` spectral analysis and its applications '' , holden - day , san francisco , cambridge , london , amsterdam 1969 . \n catalog of indices of solar and geliomagnetic activity . \n obninsk 1976.[in russian ]", "StartTimeOffset": 2230108957777, "RequestID": "602c1f769066a8a7efe608b42fab9a050a1ee6f5", "TotalTokens": 1522}

ray selection methods , have adopted different strategies in terms of survey depth and solid angle . in fig.[fig : vmax ] , we show the sky coverage of three surveys which span a wide region of the solid angle  limiting flux plane , from the large , shallow emss survey @xcite , to the moderately deep 160 deg@xmath9 cfa survey @xcite , and the deep , small area ( 50 deg@xmath9 ) rdcs @xcite ( the other rosat surveys generally fill the space in between ) . \n this complementary coverage of the @xmath10 plane has the advantage of providing a better sampling of the xlf at different redshifts when results from various surveys are combined . as an example , we also show in fig.[fig : vmax ] the corresponding survey volume which is covered at @xmath11 for an @xmath12 cluster . \n this illustrates the good sensitivity of the rdcs for detecting very distant  common \" clusters , whereas a similar plot would show that the emss explores a larger volume for the most luminous rare systems ( @xmath13 ) .    in fig.[fig : \n xlf_all ] we show several measurements of the cluster xlf that have been published to date . \n sample sizes and median redshifts of each sample are also indicated . \n based on these data , several groups have argued that no significant evolution is observed in the space density of distant clusters with @xmath14\\ { \\raise -2.truept\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{$\\sim$}}\\raise5.truept \\hbox{$<$}\\ } } 3\\times 10^{44 } { \\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}}$ ] @xcite . as demonstrated by the rdcs , this trend persists out to @xmath15 . \n measurements of the distant xlf at @xmath16 are difficult with current samples , due to low number statistics . as a result \n , the evolution of the high end of the xlf has remained a hotly debated issue , ever since it was first reported in the emss @xcite . \n more recently , vikhlinin et al . \n @xcite have confirmed the emss findings by comparing the observed number of very luminous systems with the no evolution prediction . \n this result seems to be also in agreement with a preliminary analysis of the bright sharc sample @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig : xlf_all ] ) . \n the binned representation of the xlf in fig.[fig : xlf_all ] does not provide a full picture of the space density evolution observed in a given sample . for example , it fails to provide the statistical significance of a possible departure from no evolution models @xcite . \n the information contained in the rdcs can be more readily recovered by analyzing the unbinned @xmath17 distribution with a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) approach , which compares the observed cluster distribution on the @xmath17 plane with that expected from a given xlf model . \n we characterize the cluster xlf as an evolving schechter function , + @xmath18 , with @xmath19 ; where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two evolutionary parameters . \n different surveys find consistent values for the faint end slope @xmath22 , which is not observed to vary as a function of redshift ( fig . \n [ fig : xlf_all ] ) . \n for the local xlf , we use here the measurement of the bcs sample @xcite , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    for this analysis \n , we use a complete flux limited sample ( @xmath26 erg @xmath27 s@xmath6 ) of 81 spectroscopically confirmed rdcs clusters drawn from 33 deg@xmath9 ( @xmath28 ) . \n observed flux errors are included in the likelihood computation . \n the resulting @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 c.l . contours in the a - b plane are shown in fig . \n [ fig : like ] , for two different cosmologies . \n best fit values for the @xmath32 case are @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath30 errors ) . the no evolution model ( @xmath35 ) is excluded at more than a @xmath31 confidence level , even when the uncertainties of the local xlf are taken into account . \n the departure of our best fit model from the no - evolution scenario is due to the small number of observed clusters in the rdcs at @xmath36 with luminosities @xmath37 compared to the no - evolution prediction . \n interestingly , this effect is barely significant with a slightly shallower sample ( @xmath38 , 70 clusters ) . \n this evolutionary trend is similar to that observed in the emss @xcite .    by excluding the most luminous clusters from our ml analysis \n , we find that there is _ no evidence of evolution _ \n ( with @xmath30 confidence level ) at luminosities @xmath39 , confirming previous results obtained with smaller samples . a redshift dependent inspection of the likelihood also shows that little can be said on the evolution of the high end of the xlf at @xmath40 with the current rdcs sample . \n these findings lead to a consistent picture in which the comoving space density of the bulk of the cluster population is approximately constant out to @xmath41 , but the most luminous ( @xmath37 ) , presumably most massive clusters were indeed rarer at high redshifts . \n constraints on cosmological models based on this same rdcs sample are discussed elsewhere ( borgani et al . \n this volume ; @xcite ) . \n an inspection of fig . \n [ fig : vmax ] indicates that the rdcs probes an appreciable volume at high redshifts . the maximum sensitivity for clusters at @xmath42 \n is reached at fluxes below @xmath43 and for luminosities @xmath44 . \n the discovery of the first x - ray selected cluster ( rxj0848.9 + 4452 , fig . \n [ fig : c0848 ] ) at @xmath45 in the rdcs @xcite has confirmed these expectations . deep near - ir imagery and optical spectroscopy with keck / lris were required to secure this identification . \n this system has @xmath46 ( in rest frame [ 0.5 - 2 kev ] band ) and is found to lie only @xmath47 away ( @xmath48 comoving mpc ) from an ir selected cluster previously discovered by stanford et al . \n @xcite at @xmath49 , also known to be x - ray luminous with half the @xmath50 of rxj0848.9 . \n this is , most likely , the first example of a high - redshift supercluster consisting of two separate systems in an advanced stage of collapse . scheduled chandra and xmm observations of this field should provide important information on the temperature and metal enrichment of their intra - cluster media . \n recently , two additional faint rdcs candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed , using keck / lris and vlt / fors , as clusters at @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n it should be stressed that these clusters , with @xmath53 , are low surface brightness `` fluctuations '' in pspc images , and therefore the fraction of spurious candidates can be significant at these low fluxes . moreover , the spectroscopic follow - up work of such distant clusters is particularly time consuming , even with 8 - 10 meter class telescopes . \n although the optical identification is not yet complete at these faint flux levels , the high-@xmath54 tail of the rdcs can be used to set an interesting lower limit to the space density of clusters at @xmath55 . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ fig : xlf_new ] , where an extended rdcs sample has been used to obtain the best estimate of the xlf of distant clusters out to @xmath56 . \n such a sample contains 107 clusters drawn from a 47 deg@xmath9 area , with 8 clusters at @xmath57 . \n we also plot in fig . \n [ fig : xlf_new ] the best fit xlf model described above , at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    to better understand the constraints that these newly - identified high redshift clusters set on the xlf evolution , we have plotted in fig . \n [ fig : like ] ( right ) the loci of the a - b plane for which the corresponding xlf , @xmath60}(l , z)$ ] , predicts @xmath61 clusters at @xmath62 , for the entire rdcs sample . \n about 20 clusters would have to be identified in the no - evolution scenario . \n this seems very unlikely , unless the sample is severely incomplete at faint fluxes . \n given that 4 clusters have already been discovered , the portion of the a - b plane which is allowed by this preliminary analysis suggests that the evolution is still rather mild at @xmath42 , at luminosities just above @xmath63 . \n the next obvious step in the effort to understand cluster formation and evolution is to push the cluster ( or proto - cluster ) search out to even higher redshifts , namely out to @xmath64 where the signature of large scale stucture has already been unveiled @xcite . \n finding clusters around high-@xmath54 agn is a viable method ( e.g.@xcite ) , although not suitable for assessing the cluster abundance . \n serendipitous searches with chandra and xmm will of course be actively pursued , but it will take several years to build large enough survey areas , and furthermore , the spectroscopic follow - up of cluster candidates at @xmath65 may turn out to be too difficult with existing telescopes . \n while the short - term prospects for exploring the era at @xmath66 may appear somewhat bleak , it should be kept in mind that earlier this decade many theorists and observers were convinced that clusters at @xmath62 were either out of reach , or did not exist . \n borgani , s. , rosati , p. , tozzi , p. , & norman , c. 1999 , apj , 517 , 40 burke , d.j . \n 1997 , apj , 488 , l83 carilli , c.l . \n 1998 , apj , 494 , l143 crawford , c.s . & \n fabian , a.c . \n 1996 , mnras , 282 , 1483 de grandi et al . 1999 , apj , 514 , 148 dickinson m. et al . 1999 , \n apj , submitted ebeling , h. et al . \n 1997 , apj , 479 , l101 henry , j.p . \n 1992 , apj , 386 , 408 gioia , i.m . \n 1990 , apj , 356 , l35 jones , l.r . \n 1998 , apj , 495 , 100 nichol , r.c . \n et al . 1999 , apj , 521 , l21 page , m.j . , carrera , f.j . 1999 , mnras , in press rosati , p. 1998 , in wide field surveys in cosmology , 14th iap meeting ( paris , publ . \n : editions frontieres ) p.219 rosati , p. , et al . \n 1998 , apj , 492 , l21 rosati , p. et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 76 stanford , s.a . \n 1997 , aj , 114 , 2232 steidel c.c . \n et al .  1999 , \n apj , 519 , 1 vikhlinin a. et al . \n 1998 , apj , 498 , l21", "StartTimeOffset": 2236610972886, "RequestID": "882af5fc88c96ed186794038e22db50897aa2de9", "TotalTokens": 3171}
{"ContextTokens": 4072, "GeneratedTokens": 291, "SynthesizedBody": "the first type i x - ray bursting sources were discovered with sas 3 @xcite and oso-8 @xcite . @xcite and \n @xcite independently discussed the origin of the phenomenon : type i x - ray bursts are explained by thermonuclear flashes of the material accreting from the companion star on the surface of the neutron star . \n all x - ray sources showing type i bursts are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . \n the proprieties and the theory of the x - ray bursts are discussed in the review of @xcite . \n the x - ray burster ks 1741 - 293 was firstly reported by @xcite as one of the two new transient sources near the galactic centre ( gc ) detected during the observations performed with the x - ray wide - field camera ttm on board the kvant module of the mir space station . \n ks 1741 - 293 was detected , on 3 consecutive days in the energy range 5.7@xmath027.2 kev , during which it exhibited two type i x - ray bursts . \n ks 1741 - 293 may be identified with either mxb 1743 - 29 and mxb 1742 - 29 , two bursting sources detected in 1976 with sas-3 . \n the single peak burst profile excludes the identification of ks 1741 - 293 with mxb 1743 - 29 @xcite . \n therefore ks 1741 - 293 and mxb 1742 - 29 are likely to be the same source . in the bepposax era ( 1996 - 2002 ) , ks 1741 - 293 was detected , together with a large sample of galactic sources , during the wide field camera ( wfc ) monitoring of the gc region @xcite at a peak flux of the order of 30 mcrab in the 2 - 28 kev energy range . from the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs , on board bepposax ) \n observations , @xcite report a 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the source @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 and 10@xmath3 erg s@xmath2 ( corrected for absorption ) on september 1997 and march 1998 , respectively , assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc . \n ks 1741 - 293 was also detected by asca during 107 pointing observations of a @xmath4 deg@xmath5 region around the gc showing an apparent variability by a factor of 50 , while on the contrary no burst has been found @xcite . \n no hard x - ray detection has been reported by the first gamma - ray imager sigma on board the granat satellite and indeed the source is not in the hard x - ray sigma catalogue , covering the 40 - 100 kev range @xcite . \n ks 1741 - 293 is listed in the batse / cgro instrument deep sample as one of the 179 sources monitored along the cgro operative life @xcite even though it is not a firm detection . \n ks 1741 - 293 is reported in the third ibis catalogue @xcite at a significance level of 67 sigma with a flux of ( @xmath6 ) mcrab in the 20 - 40 kev band . \n recently an x - ray burst has been reported from ks 1741 - 293 with ibis / isgri in the 15 - 25 kev band by @xcite . \n it occurred on march 30 , 2004 . \n a search for optical , infrared and radio counterparts was made by @xcite without finding a firm candidate . \n a chandra source inside all the ks 1741 - 293 high energy error circles has been proposed by @xcite as a possible counterpart . \n these authors discuss also a possible association with a non - thermal radio nebula that could be the supernova remnant produced by the accretion induced collapse in the binary system . \n however this association is still under debate due to the estimated age ( about 500 years ) of the snr , which is very low for a lmxb .    in this work \n we show that , within february 2003 and may 2005 , ks 1741 - 293 has been clearly detected in the hard x energy band ( @xmath7 kev ) with the ibis imager during two visibility periods , while during the other observations it appears to be in a quiescent status . using the combined data from the x - ray monitor jem - x and the ibis hard x telescope , we obtain in the second period of visibility the wide band x - ray spectrum from about 5 kev to 100 kev . we show for the first time the soft component simultaneously with the hard tail for this source . we report also the detection of two bursts with jem - x and their temporal and spectral properties .    in section  2 we show the observations and the data analysis tools . in section \n 3 we present the data analysis results from : flux monitoring , spectral analysis and x - ray burst analysis . \n finally the conclusions are summarised in section  4 . \n [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table2 ]    the ibis / isgri average spectrum has been extracted in the 20 - 150 kev energy range during the two periods corresponding to source detection , namely period 1 and period 3 ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) . \n we fitted the extracted spectra with a simple power law , a cut - off power law and a comptonized model with xspec ( v.11.3.2 ) . during period 1 \n we find that all these models provide a good agreement with the data , with a marginal evidence of improvement by using the cut - off power law or a comptonized model ( the probability of a chance improvement in @xmath8 is @xmath9 using the f - test ) . during period 3 , the increased statistics due to the longer exposure than for period 1 , \n enable us to confidently exclude a simple power law model ( with reduced @xmath10 with 5 degrees of freedom ) . \n we obtain a comparable good fit good fit with a cut - off power law ( @xmath11 ) and with a comptonized model ( @xmath11 ) . \n we find no evidence of spectral variability between period 1 and period 3 in the 20 - 150 kev energy range .    in order to constrain the model parameters \n , we extended our spectral analysis to low energies of 4 kev thanks to the simultaneous detection with jem - x during period 3 . \n analysis at low energies of this source have already been performed by @xcite with bepposax / mecs observations taken on the 31st of march 1998 . from their analysis , \n the 2 - 10 kev spectrum was equally well modelled by a simple power law , a thermal bremmstrahlung and a black body . \n interestingly , in the two former cases , high photoelectric absorption was required by the data , with an equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath12 of a few @xmath13@xmath14 . \n we then performed a simultaneous analysis of the jem - x and ibis / isgri spectra on the basis of the previous results . \n a constant normalisation factor has been introduced in the fitting models in order to take into account the systematic errors in the knowledge of the absolute jem - x and ibis / isgri inter - calibration . \n we find that , assuming a cut - off power - law model at high energies , none of the previous models used to fit the low energies ( sidoli et al . \n 1999 ) can fit the jem - x data . on the contrary , a multicolor disk blackbody component ( diskbb in xspec ) , typically invoked to model \n the emission from an accretion disk , provides a good fit to the data . \n the available statistics do not allow us to disentangle among a cut - off power - law or a comptonized model at high energies , thus we obtained similar results also assuming a comptonized model . \n at the same time , we were able to confidently exclude a simple power law model ( with @xmath15 ) rather than a cut - off power - law or a comptonized model . \n the best fit model parameters from these analysis are summarised in table 2 . \n we also compared the 2 - 10 kev flux obtained on march 1998 from the bepposax / mecs observations ( sidoli et al . 1999 ) with our estimate from the best fit models in the same energy range . \n we find a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath16 @xmath14 s@xmath2 that is consistent with the previous measure .    assuming the distance of 8.5 kpc for this source \n as quoted by @xcite , we computed the source luminosity from the flux measured during the period 3 in the 20 - 100 kev energy band as 1.7 @xmath17 @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 . \n two x - ray bursts from ks 1741 has been detected in the 4 - 15 kev band by the jem - x telescope during the integral revolution 53 ( march 22 2003 ) and 63 ( april 22 2003 ) . on the instrument image of the first burst ( see fig . \n [ fig : image_jemx ] ) we have superimposed the ibis position as it is reported with good accuracy ( 0.6 arcmin 90% error circle ) in the survey of @xcite . note that the jem - x position accuracy ( 3 arcmin 90% error circle ) is lower then the ibis ones due to shorter exposure time . \n as the jem - x position of ks 1741 - 293 , obtained during the x - ray burst , is in agreement with ibis , the burst is firmly associated to our source . \n the one - second resolved light curves obtained from jem - x data exhibit two x - ray bursts in the energy range 4 - 15 kev , one in revolution 53 ( science window 58 ) and the other in revolution 63 ( science window 92 ) . \n both bursts lasted around 20 s , with a maximum flux of 1.3 and 2.1 crab respectively . \n the burst morphology ( fig . \n [ fig : time_jemx ] ) confirms previous observations with a single peaked time profile unlike double peaked time profile reported for mxb 1743 - 29 @xcite . \n the jem - x spectra during the bursts have been extracted selecting the good time intervals ( gti ) 1176.359 - 1176.360 and 1207.4116 - 1297.4120 ijd for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bursts respectively . \n both spectra have been fitted with a black body model ( fig . \n 6 ) , with a temperature kt@xmath21 equal to @xmath22 kev for the first burst and @xmath23 kev for the second one at 90 % of confidence level . the 4 - 20 kev fluxes are 3.6 @xmath17 @xmath24 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 and 1.1 @xmath17 @xmath25 erg @xmath14 s@xmath2 , respectively . assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc , the radius of the first and the second bursts are @xmath26 km and @xmath27 km respectively . \n the burst emission is not detected by ibis . \n this   lack of high   energy ( @xmath28 20 kev ) detection can be explained by the soft spectrum of the source emission during the burst activity and by the short exposure . \n indeed , taking into account the ibis sensitivity , we estimate a 2 sigma flux upper limit of 140 mcrab in the 20 - 40 kev energy band for a 20 seconds exposure ( i.e. the burst time interval ) . extrapolating the jem - x burst spectrum we   obtain in this band a flux of 9 mcrab and 7 mcrab for the first and the second burst respectively . \n these values are significantly below the ibis 20 seconds upper limit . \n despite ks 1741 - 293 being reported for the first time many years ago @xcite , this source was poorly studied , in particular at high energies . \n this is mainly due to the source faintness , both in the soft and hard x - ray energy range , and to its position in the galactic centre crowed region , requiring good angular resolution . \n the ibis angular resolution , good sensitivity , large field of view and long exposure in the region of the galactic center are then appropriate to fulfil this task . \n in particular the ibis angular resolution ( @xmath29 ) allowed us to clearly resolve ks 1741 - 293 from other x - ray sources in the field of view , especially from the nearest source 1a 1742 - 294 .    using open time and core programme data , we have monitored , with a mcrab sensitivity in the 20 - 40 kev band , the hard x - ray emission for a time period of more then two years . \n we have obtained a clear ibis detection only during the visibility periods 52698 - 52792 mjd and 53052 - 53115 mjd , showing that hard x - ray emission from this source is not persistent . \n the measured orbital periods for lmxbs range from a fraction of hour to tens of hours ( see @xcite ) . during the @xmath30 visibility period \n the source shows a smooth flux variation by a factor of four , without evidence of periodicity in the light curve on a time scale of 60 days . during the first visibility period \n there is no evidence of source flux variation . \n we have obtained for the first time a wide band ( from 5 to 100 kev ) spectrum using the simultaneous jem - x and ibis data . \n the spectrum is fitted with a two component model . while the blackbody soft component could originate from the surface of an accretion disk , the neutron star surface , or both , the hard tail , fitted by a cut - off power law , or by a comptonized model @xcite , \n is due to a comptonization of soft photons in a hot plasma around the neutron star . \n we have detected two type i x - ray burst with jem - x , at a position clearly consistent with the ibis ks 1741 - 293 detection . \n the temporal analysis with jem - x confirms the single peak bursts of ks 1741 - 293 , as firstly reported by @xcite . \n the spectral proprieties of the hard tailed lmxbs are discussed in @xcite . \n ks 1741 - 293 can be included in this class of sources . \n authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for the useful comments . \n authors thanks m. federici ( iasf / rome ) for the continuous effort to update the integral archive in rome . \n this work has been supported by italian space agency by the grant i / r/046/04 . \n barett d. , adv . \n space res.43 , 28 , 307 , 2001 bazzano a. , et al , sp-552,309 , 2004 , proceedings of the 5th integral workshop bird a.j . , et al . , \n astro -

{"ContextTokens": 2610, "GeneratedTokens": 130, "SynthesizedBody": "with the discovery of fe  k@xmath0  emission at 6.4  kev  and spectral hardening at 2030  kev  in the x - ray spectra of seyfert  1 galaxies ( pounds et al . \n 1990 ) , it was a center figure in probing the physics around black holes.ascas observation about the mcg-6 - 30 - 15 s board and skewed profile reveal two important physical mechanisms - the gravitational and the doppler effect.there are also other sources which show board and skewed profile.various explanation and observation about the fe  k@xmath0have been presented ( see fabian 2000,reynolds & nowak 2003 for details.)another intriguing thing is that , the sources always show a x - ray continuum with power - law distribution , till now , there is no convincing explanation about the production of the x - ray continuum .    from both the observational and theoretical side , \n the iron line is expected to be the reflection from the accretion disk .a lot of computational method to compute the iron line profile from the vicinity of black hole has been invited(fanton 1997,bromley 1994,labor 1991),among which the most renowned is the ray - tracing method due to it s efficiency in computing.the differences in the line profiles from source to source have possibly implied variation in the geometry , the view angle , the structure of the bh - accretion disk system.with xmm s high s / n data , it greatly facilitate the astronomical community to study the iron k@xmath0 in agn . in order to model the fe  k@xmath0many detailed calculations about the accretion disk \n must be performed.many author have make computation considering the geometry , such as flat , concave , conical , thick.(hartnoll 2002),merloni founded that the inner boundary condition of accretion flows have a significant effect on the profile . \n the ionization state and fe abundance in the accretion disk also have been studied by ballantyne 1999,fabian 2002.nayakshins two - layer model in the surface of accretion disk also seems plausible.recent mhd studies have proposed that there may be exist spiral velocities in accretion disk which will brought quasi - humps in the profiles . \n however , for simplicity , the disk emissivity is usually assumed to have a power - law profile @xmath1(where @xmath2 is the distance from the center in units of schwarzshild radii),and the index of such power - law is generally assumed to be given by the accretion disc emissitvity index in a standard geometrically thin and optically think disk(shakura sunyaev 1973).the fact that both wilms et al.2001 and miller et al.2002 require a larger value of @xmath0 to fit the line profile has prompted speculation that , in the inner disc disc region , additional energy dissipation must be taking place.the long mcg-6 - 30 - 15 s observation with xmm - newton reported by fabian et al.2002 show that , the strong , skewed iron line is clearly detected and is well characterized by a steep emissity profile within 6gm / c@xmath3 and a flatter profile beyond . \n in contrast to explain the steep profile in the non - zero torque theory , which needs a comprehensive study of the mhd in accretion disk.we just make the simplest computation to deduced the flux striking the surface of the disk in the gr scheme , hence see the effects on line profiles , and the result is very useful in accounting for the steep emissivity in the inner part of the disk . \n numerical models of reflection spectra from accretion discs began with the simplest case : assuming a static , neutral and constant density slab of material irradiated by a power - law continuum of x - rays . \n george & fabian ( 1991 ) and matt , perola & piro ( 1991 ) performed monte - carlo calculations of the reflection spectra in such circumstances , and provided predictions on the equivalent width ( ew ) of fe  k@xmath0  for different reflection geometries.in this paper , we also assume the source is centredly located , static with a power law flux @xmath4,and this assumption is very close to the observation about the x - ray continuum . \n the gravitational field of a rotating black hole is described by the kerr metric(we use units c = g=1 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8    we can see that the metric depends only on two parameters , the mass @xmath9 of the black hole and the specific angular momentum @xmath10 . and it is straight forward to formulate that the photo in kerr metric should has the relation in different place.we assume the photo propagate from place@xmath11to place@xmath12 then we can get @xmath13 and due to the invariance in general relativity @xmath14 so we can deduce that @xmath15 notice here , in the photons prorating in the kerr metric , the a is changing , due to the frequency changing.so we can get @xmath16 as we know , in the newtonian space - time the intensity of the flux should not be changed , how ever , eq .  [ intense ] show that the intensity changed due to a factor.the same , we can get @xmath17 where @xmath18is the flux striking the disc in kerr metric , while@xmath19is the fomat in newtonian space - time . in the newtonian space-time.in the model of point like , static source up the black hole \n , the flux striking the disk should be @xmath20 in kerr black hole , we know that @xmath21 we set r , a , in unit of m , then@xmath19can have the detailed formula @xmath22 for a non - rotating black hole , we can get @xmath23 when we set r , h in unit of schwichild radii @xmath24,the formula change to @xmath25 from eq . \n [ qin ] we can see that the flux striking the accretion disc has a close relation with both the photo index @xmath0 , the accretion rate @xmath26,and the sources location.observations shows that the source x - ray continuum always have a photo index @xmath27 . \n when we compute the @xmath18 in this model , we find that in a extremely rotating kerr metric the flux concentrated on only a very small region near the center , while other place left nearly no illumination at all.it is apparently a gr effect.when it comes to the schwchild metric , the power law approximation is also not good to describe the emissivity , but it is rather flatter to the case in kerr metric.we can conclude that the need of steep power law model may due to a rapidly rotating black hole . \n our work is invoked by recent report of steep emissity in inner part of accretion disk(fabian 2002).in the observation of mcg-6 - 30 - 15,fabian use a broken emissivity law to model the data , and with good result.however,they assume that the steep emissivity is a result from two reflector in the disk . in our work \n we can see that , the steep emissivity may come from the effect of light bending near the center black hole.and the concentrating of flux , will give inner side a rather high ionization parameter,@xmath28 , which may result a line component at @xmath29kev.there are also other sources , such as iras 13224 - 3809(boller 2003),which should induce a steeper emissivity law.the steep emissivity law may be a evidence of a centering rapidly rotating black hole .    in present x - ray study , \n there are lots of uncertainty in modelling the iron lines in agn , the s / n is a big problem to determine the real shape of the line.former observation confirms that there exist many agn which contain board and skew iron line , indicating that the line is produced very near the black hole.however,recent xmm observation show that there does not ubiquitous exist board iron line , instead , a narrow cole at 6.4 kev is present.this has not been included in this paper .    our work show that in the gr effect , the emissity can not be simply regarded as a power law as a function of r , instead , it should be described by various factors such as a , the source s position the photo index.when computed in the gr we find in the kerr metric the large concentration of the flux in the accretion disc , rather left other part of the disk `` empty'',also , the large concentration in flux will undoubtedly invoke the model of ionized disk describe by ross 1999.and our work is only a simplified model to test the gr effects , further work such as the disk motion and density under high illumination which may affect the emissity should be invoked . \n ballantyne d.r . \n , fabian a.c . , 2001 , mnras , 328 , l11 ballantyne d.r . , \n ross r.r , 2002 , mnras , in press ( astro -

{"ContextTokens": 2063, "GeneratedTokens": 233, "SynthesizedBody": "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has clearly exhibited its ability to make discoveries with the observation of a new resonance  @xcite with even spin that decays to photons and z bosons as expected of the standard model ( sm ) higgs particle . \n thus precise measurements of the decays of this resonance into various channels ( whether standard or not ) , are of the utmost importance . at the same time , it is essential to verify our understanding of the existing channels , in particular , @xmath0 . \n how well are these photons defined ? can physics objects other than single photons leave signatures in the detector similar to that of a photon ? \n not surprisingly , the answer is yes  @xcite . \n given the granularity of the calorimeters , an object consisting of ( nearly ) collinear photons , typically labeled a photon - jet , will generate a signature similar to that of a single photon . \n the possibility that the higgs particle decays to multiple collinear photons is not new  @xcite . \n simple models where the higgs decays to almost massless scalars that each in turn decay to a pair of photons , typically do not give rise to events with four separately identifiable photons , but rather to pairs of photon - jets , each with 2 photons . \n slightly more complicated models can produce higgs decays to photon - jets with @xmath1 photons . \n we will discuss concrete models where the higgs decays to photon - jets with @xmath2 and @xmath3 photons per photon - jet . \n thus it is essential to develop tools to separate single photons from photon - jets from qcd - jets . \n otherwise we are unlikely to understand either the signal or the background . \n atlas recently made attempts to identify photon - jets from higgs decays  @xcite . \n these analyses rely on relaxing the isolation / shower shape criteria , which use the differing distributions of energy deposition within the calorimeter cells to quite successfully discriminate single photons from qcd - jets . \n unfortunately , the parameters of the underlying model can be easily adjusted so that the resultant photon - jets pass the strictest isolation / shower shape criteria just like photons . more importantly , loosening isolation criteria results in a larger fake rate for qcd - jets . \n discriminating photon - jets from qcd - jets is more challenging than separating single photons from qcd - jets . \n fortunately jet substructure techniques  @xcite have recently been developed to distinguish qcd - jets from jets containing boosted heavy particle decays , and we can use this work for detection of photon - jets . more broadly , \n ` jets ' , as defined by an infrared safe jet clustering algorithm , are being proposed as a universal language to describe _ all _ calorimeter objects including single photons , photon - jets and qcd - jets . by using the tools developed in jet substructure physics , we do not need to rely on isolation cuts . \n we supplement the traditional / conventional variables currently used to discriminate photons from qcd - jets with substructure variables that probe in detail the energy distribution within the jet . \n note that the photons - jets are composed of energetic photons distributed inside the jet , where the distribution is a result of the kinematic features of the model , e.g. , the masses and spins of the intermediate particles . \n the existence of this structure within photon - jet suggests that substructure variables will be efficient at finding and discriminating photon - jets . \n we show that our analysis is capable of separating photon - jets from both single photons and qcd - jets _ at least as _ efficiently as the traditional discriminators separate photons from qcd - jets \n .    there is another important advantage to applying jet substructure techniques to purely electro - magnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) objects . \n the introduction of ` grooming ' algorithms ( including filtering  @xcite , pruning  @xcite , and trimming  @xcite ) promised to suppress the undesirable contributions to purely hadronic jets from the underlying event ( the largely uncorrelated soft interactions surrounding the interesting hard scattering ) and from pile - up ( the truly uncorrelated proton - proton collisions that occur in the same time window ) . \n indeed , the recent results from studies at atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite indicate this grooming is effective . \n we expect that this substructure - based grooming will work as well for all ecal based objects . \n it should be noted that in the context of higgs physics , the decay to photon - jets is not the only example where the collinearity of the decay products adds complexity to the analysis . \n collinearity plays a role for traditional decays of the higgs boson when it is boosted . in ref . \n @xcite , the authors exploited the collinearity of the @xmath4-quarks in boosted higgs decays ( both quarks in a single jet ) to greatly enhance the chances of detecting the @xmath5 channel , featuring jet substructure as a mainstream tool ( see also refs . \n the application of jet substructure in higgs physics has now become a very active area of research , applied both to the sm higgs  @xcite as well to beyond the sm higgs scenarios  @xcite . for reviews , more detailed descriptions , and references \n see refs . \n @xcite . \n the paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n [ sec : simplified_models ] , we start with a simplified model for photon - jets . \n we propose a set of benchmark points , where we take different combinations of masses and parameters in the simplified model to produce photon - jets displaying a variety of distinct kinematics . in sec . \n [ sec : simulations ] we define the details of our simulation . \n we describe , in detail , how we generate samples of photon - jets , one for each of the benchmark points , qcd - jets , and single photons . \n we present our analysis in sec . \n [ sec : analysis ] . \n we describe all the variables that we use in this work to discriminate photon - jets from qcd - jets from single photons . \n then we combine these variables in a multivariate analysis . \n we train boosted decision trees ( bdts ) using the samples of jets and use these to optimize the discriminating power of our analyses . \n we also show how these bdts can be used to simultaneously separate photon - jets , photons , and qcd - jets from each other . \n our conclusions are presented in sec . \n [ sec : conclusion ] . \n by definition , photons - jets refer to calorimeter objects consisting of more than one hard photon . \n however , such a broad definition presents a challenge since all photon - jets are not the same . \n they differ in terms of the number of hard constituent photons as well as in the distribution of those photons within the photon - jet . to provide a systematic phenomenological study of photon - jets we classify these objects in more detail in terms of the production mechanism and consider a broad range . \n we will refer to the various production scenarios as ` benchmark ' scenarios . \n we find that a simple model in the spirit of ref . \n @xcite with two new particles is sufficient to characterize these benchmarks . \n the model includes a small number of interactions and we can vary the strength of these interaction and the new particle masses in order to generate the benchmark scenarios . in particular , we introduce two scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 of mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . without loss of generality , \n we choose the naming convention such that @xmath10 . \n neither @xmath6 nor @xmath7 carry any sm charges . \n we use the following interactions to generate photon - jets @xmath11 where @xmath12 are mass parameters , @xmath13 are dimensionless coupling constants , and @xmath14 is the electromagnetic field strength operator . \n this simple model bears a resemblance to a higgs portal scenario  @xcite because of the @xmath15 coupling . in the higgs portal \n language , @xmath6 and @xmath7 constitute a ` hidden ' sector while the coupling @xmath15 provides a tunnel to the corresponding ` hidden valley ' . the electromagnetic couplings ( proportional to the @xmath16 parameters ) provide ways for the new particles to decay back to sm particles , photons in this case . with respect to higgs physics \n , this simple model provides a realistic example where the sm higgs field decays through the new particles to multiple photons . in the limit @xmath17 , the resultant photons ( the decay products of @xmath6 ) \n are essentially collinear .    in table \n [ table : bench ] we list the benchmark scenarios ( labeled photon - jet study points or pjsps ) that we investigate in this work . all are generated by varying the parameters in eq .. the symbol @xmath18 in table  [ table : bench ] denotes that a non - zero value is selected for that parameter , which then determines the decay mode . \n we have chosen the benchmarks in such a way that the parameters denoted by @xmath18 only change the _ total _ width of the decaying particles . as long as \n the decays are prompt , the exact values of these parameters are irrelevant to the phenomenological properties of the photon - jets . \n .[table : bench ] the study points used in our analysis . for @xmath19 , @xmath7 does not participate in the decay chain since @xmath20 and the @xmath9 and @xmath21 columns are empty . by @xmath18 \n we denote that a non -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we estimate these numbers by integrating the energy deposited in an electromagnetic shower in a cell of size ( @xmath22 ) and situated @xmath23 from the origin of the shower . \n we assume that the cell is made of lead ( @xmath24 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2286573889959, "RequestID": "3915cca5045e28151210010edf12d21b660890e1", "TotalTokens": 2296}
{"ContextTokens": 1623, "GeneratedTokens": 80, "SynthesizedBody": "handling high current proton beams is a challenge for beam diagnostics in future proton accelerators . in order to achieve a high beam power , \n it is mandatory to understand the beam dynamics and to determine the beam size and profile with precision . in high power proton linacs \n , such understanding would allow a full characterization of the beam after each linac section . with a beam transverse size of 2 to , \n intercepting profile diagnostics such as otr screens or cherenkov monitors can be used only during tuning and specific beam operation modes . to determine the longitudinal profile , feschenko - type bunch shape monitors ( bsm @xcite ) \n can be used in the low energy sections of the linac , however , bsm may not be sensitive to short bunch lengths . in the higher energy sections , \n it is highly advisable to use non interceptive devices to avoid radiations or damage to the equipment . \n wall current monitors or other methods based on detecting the fields at the vacuum chamber boundary could be used , but they are intrinsically limited in resolution due to the rather low relativistic @xmath0 @xcite and do not have an adapted temporal resolution . \n therefore , a diagnostic based on smith - purcell radiation could be of high interest . \n we will investigate here the possibility of using a smith - purcell diagnostic for the measurement of proton beams longitudinal profiles , using a numerical simulation code presented hereafter . \n smith - purcell radiation can be described by the `` surface current '' theory @xcite : when charged particles travel over a grating , they induce an image charge on its surface and keep pace with it . \n the corrugations of the grating cause the created current to accelerate , which in turn leads to the emission of radiation . in our coordinate system \n , we assume that the protons travel perpendicularly to the grooves of a blazed grating . \n due to the periodic structure of the grating , the emitted wavelength @xmath1 depends on the observation angle @xmath2 defined in fig . \n [ fig : coordinates ] . \n the grating shape and pitch defines its efficiency , that varies depending on @xmath2 and on the second observation angle called @xmath3 . \n our simulation describes the smith -

purcell spectrum , which is a calculation made from the fourier transform of the temporal profile and chosen grating parameters . \n the parameters used for this study on proton beams are summarized in table [ tab : beamparameters ] . \n we assume that the beam transverse dimensions would allow approaching a grating at a distance @xmath16 from the beam center . \n .used beam parameters for the simulation [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : gratingparameters ] \n knowing the expected signal level , it is now necessary to verify that the device is sensitive to a longitudinal profile change , which is a crucial feature for a profile measurement tool . \n the sensitivity to a variation in the bunch fwhm length is shown in fig .

[ fig : bunchlength ] , is of the order of per bunch , and needs to be compared with the performances of the detectors used . for example , \n if the detectors measure an averaged signal over several ms , which is the case of the pyroelectric sensors often used in experiments involving electrons @xcite , they will detect the smith - purcell power produced by a whole train ( around bunches ) , thus a higher signal by several orders of magnitude , up to mj . \n however , these values do not take into account the transmission of the different optical elements that would need to be installed in front of the detectors . \n also , as seen in fig . \n [ fig : theta ] , the expected smith - purcell emission would occur in the millimeter - wave range where the background level needs to be evaluated to be able to distinguish it from the actual signal . \n if we use detectors that are sensitive only to signal variations , they will not impacted by the effect of the temperature . however \n , electromagnetic noise and other sources of radiations related to the beam can create background . \n since the smith - purcell radiation is linearly polarized , a way to decorrelate the signal and the background could then be to measure the two polarization components . \n angle , for different @xmath2 values . \n the emission source is the center of the figure , the detection optics would be placed on the right half of the figure.,width=340 ]    the efficiency of the grating is given in fig . \n [ fig : phi ] depending on the @xmath3 angle . \n this indicates that most of the radiation would be emitted along the x axis in a cone of approximately 40opening , allowing all signal to enter the optics . \n our simulations indicate that with the parameters used for our simulation a longitudinal bunch profile monitor based on coherent smith - purcell radiation installed at near a high intensity proton beam would be sensitive to changes in the pulse length and could be useful in the tuning phase of such accelerator . \n however such device has never been tested at low @xmath0 proton beams and preliminary tests on a high intensity proton source would be useful . \n the authors acknowledge george doucas from john adams institute in oxford for his useful advice .", "StartTimeOffset": 2300266285370, "RequestID": "c3975726bd489f100d71b946423cd67a5c05757c", "TotalTokens": 1703}

{"ContextTokens": 3786, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "turbulent flows display the tendency to generate flow structures , starting from an unorganized initial state . \n this structuring of turbulent flows is perhaps most impressive in freely evolving two - dimensional turbulence , where large scale vortices are generated through nonlinear interaction @xcite . even though intuitively one easily appreciates from visualisations that this self - organization of the flow increases its spatio - temporal coherence , it is not straightforward to give a quantitative measure of this coherence . in the present investigation \n we study the link between flow coherence and the strength of the nonlinearity during the self - organization process of two - dimensional turbulence starting from an initial state consisting of statistically independent modes . \n we will first illustrate how these quantities are related in nonlinear systems in general .    to illustrate our approach we consider a nonlinear system of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a function of space and time \n , @xmath2 is the nonlinear term and @xmath3 represents the linear terms . as a measure of the temporal coherence created by the self - organization process we can evaluate the rate at which on average the system evolves in time . \n such a measure is @xmath4 , where the brackets denote a space or ensemble average . \n if the mean - square time derivative decreases , it indicates that the temporal coherence of the considered field increases .    squaring both sides of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath5 \n we directly see that the coherence will be determined by an interplay of linear and nonlinear effects . \n a purely linear system will not display an interesting self - organization in the sense that the different modes are not coupled in the absence of nonlinearity . to simplify the problem \n we could therefore consider a purely nonlinear system in the absence of linear terms . in that case \n we have @xmath6 this shows that in the most elementary case of the nonlinear evolution of a system in the absence of any linear effects , the average temporal coherence is completely determined by the mean - square nonlinearity . \n we will consider the evolution of the latter quantity in two - dimensional turbulent flows . \n it is well known for freely decaying two - dimensional turbulence in a periodic domain that the final dynamic state consists of two slowly evolving coherent vortices . \n the vorticity of the resulting flow - field shows a monotonic correlation with the stream - function @xcite , corresponding to an equilibrium - state where the nonlinear interactions are small . since coherent structures \n are also observed at shorter times , local equilibrium states should reduce the nonlocal interactions already at short and intermediate times and we expect thus the mean - square nonlinearity to be small compared to the quantity in a non - coherent velocity field even at these shorter times . \n the definition of a non - coherent field is an interesting question itself . \n we will follow the idea of kraichnan and panda @xcite and compare to a field with the same energy distribution , consisting of independent fourier modes . \n this choice is not unique and does not allow to meaningfully quantify all possible non - gaussian features of turbulence , as for instance enstrophy production @xcite . \n for the present purpose , which is the analysis of the depletion of the mean - square nonlinear term , it seems however a good choice . \n the mean - square nonlinearity as compared to its value in a gaussian field was first investigated by kraichnan and coworkers  @xcite in three dimensional decaying turbulence . \n further studies @xcite aimed at indentifying mechanisms which can explain the depletion of nonlinearity through local flow structuring . \n one such mechanism , the alignment of velocity and vorticity , was suggested to play an important role in the dynamics of turbulence @xcite . \n the study of kraichnan and panda @xcite , put forward the idea that velocity - vorticity alignment might be one manisfestation of a more generic feature of turbulent flows , which is its tendency to diminish the strength of the nonlinearity . \n this seems indeed to be the case since the depletion of nonlinearity is also observed in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite and the advection term in the advection of a passive scalar also shows this tendency @xcite . \n our study is a logical extension of these works to the case of two - dimensional turbulence . \n one first lesson that we can learn from the outcome of the present work is that , if the nonlinearity is reduced in two - dimensional turbulence , it is not the velocity - vorticity alignment which is the underlying mechanism which explains the depletion of nonlinearity in both two- and three - dimensional turbulence , since the vorticity is always perpendicular to the velocity in two - dimensional flow . \n alignment , in general , can however play an important role , as was shown in @xcite , where a preferential alignment of the vorticity - gradient and stream - function gradient was observed in decaying two - dimensional turbulence . \n with respect to this latter work , the originality of the present approach is that we will compare statistics in a decaying turbulent flow with a gaussian reference field having the same energy spectrum at every time - instant , as proposed in @xcite . \n it allows to show how the temporal coherence of the flow evolves in time . \n we do not focus on the precise local relaxation mechanism and argue , following @xcite , that it is perhaps not the detailed topological mechanism which is universal , but the tendency to create coherence by decreasing , statistically , the norm of the nonlinear term . \n for an incompressible fluid flow , equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is given by the navier - stokes equations @xmath7 with the nonlinear term given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 the pressure divided by the fluid density , which is assumed homogeneous and constant , and @xmath10 the kinematic viscosity . in two - dimensions \n it is convenient to consider the evolution of @xmath11 , the component of the vorticity normal to the plane of the velocity , @xmath12 with @xmath13 in the absence of linear effects , it will be the quantity @xmath14 , which measures the temporal eulerian coherence of the vorticity field , as suggested by equation ( [ eq : coh ] ) . \n for a strongly coherent field this quantity will be small compared to the quantity in a non - coherent velocity field . \n as explained above , we will compare to a field with the same energy distribution , consisting of independent fourier modes , by measuring @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean - square vorticity advection term measured in a multivariate gaussian field with the same energy spectrum . \n the mean - square nonlinear term is not invariant under galilean transformations , _ \n i.e. _ adding a spatially uniform velocity field to the flow will change its value . \n adding such a field will also change the estimate in the gaussian field so that measure ( [ eq:2d_n_over_ng ] ) compensates , at least in part , for such effects . in the present work we will set the mean flow @xmath17 and only consider the statistically isotropic case . \n the evolution of equation  ( [ eq : vorteq_2d ] ) was computed using a two dimensional pseudo - spectral fourier code in stream function - vorticity formulation . \n the computation was performed on a @xmath18 square domain with periodic boundary conditions . \n the resolution was varied between @xmath19 and @xmath20 fourier modes in each direction . \n the initial velocity field is defined in fourier space and corresponds to a field of incompressible statistically independent fourier modes , given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a gaussian white noise process and @xmath23 is the kinetic energy spectrum . \n the value of @xmath24 sets the dominant correlation wavenumber of the initial energy distribution and is @xmath25 . \n the riesz - operator , @xmath26 projects the random noise on the plane perpendicular to the wavevector to ensure incompressibility of the initial velocity field . \n the kinematic viscosity @xmath10 and the corresponding values for the initial reynolds numbers based on the box - size and on the taylor lengthscale , respectively , are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] . \n .[tab:1 ] details of the simulations . \n we define @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the rms - value of one of the velocity components and @xmath29 the box - size . \n the taylorscale reynolds number is defined as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the temporal evolution of the kinetic energy @xmath32 and enstrophy @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 the energy and enstrophy dissipation rate . in a periodic two - dimensional decaying flow without energy and enstrophy sources , both the kinetic energy and enstrophy are monotonically decaying functions of time . \n since the energy dissipation @xmath37 , as soon as the enstrophy has decayed considerably , the energy will remain approximately constant at high reynolds numbers . \n this behaviour is shown in figure [ ris : et ] , which illustrates the time evolution of the kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate , respectively . \n figures  [ ris : snapshots_vortfld_2d ] depict snapshots of the vorticity fields of the @xmath38 run at @xmath39 ( a ) and at @xmath40 ( b ) . \n the condensation of all the vorticity into two counterrotating vortices is observed for long times . \n it will be shown now that this state corresponds to a flow with a very small magnitude of the nonlinearity .    in figure  [ ris : n_over_ngaus_snapshots ] \n we show the evolution of @xmath41 . \n as we can see from the figure , this ratio very rapidly decreases at the initial time . after this moment , during the further evolution of the flow , peaks are observed which correspond to the interaction between different vortices . \n the opposite , local minima correspond to a quiet state where there is no interaction between different vortices and all vortices are well separated . \n this is illustrated by the snapshots which are present on the figure . \n the moments of time which correspond to the snapshots are noted by arrows . we have checked that the same qualitative picture is observed during the other peaks and local minima of the time - evolution . \n the fact that vortex merging increases the value of the nonlinearity can be understood intuitively since when two vortices approach , the relative velocity between the cores of the vortices is parallel to their radial vorticity gradients so that the value of @xmath42 is high during these events . \n we have checked that the order unity peaks are not an artefact of the gaussian random fields we used for comparison . in figure [ ris : check ] \n we show the results for the mean - square nonlinearity compared to two independently generated gaussian fields for the @xmath43 run . \n it is observed that the low frequency structure of the time evolution is not significantly affected when changing the reference field . \n only a zoom at the fine time - structure shows a difference in behaviour .    at the end of the simulation only two weakly interacting vortices are observed , figure  [ ris : snapshots_vortfld_2d ]  ( b ) . at this time \n it is observed that the mean square nonlinearity is reduced to only a few percent of its gaussian value . \n it seems that in the two - dimensional case there are two timescales over which the nonlinearity is reduced : a very short one at the beginning of the simulation of the order of time over which the initial vortices form , and a long one , of the order of the time it takes to condense all the energy in the two counterrotating vortices in figure  [ ris : snapshots_vortfld_2d ] .    to give a statistical description of the multiscale character of the depletion of nonlinearity in 2d turbulence we define the nonlinearity spectrum of the navier - stokes equations as @xmath44 the vorticity nonlinearity spectrum is given by @xmath45 and the relation between the two spectra is @xmath46 therefore , the ratio of the spectrum of the mean square nonlinear term in the turbulent flow to the equivalent value in the gaussian flow does not depend on which nonlinearity we consider : @xmath47 however , the ratios of the integrated quantities are not necessarily the same , which is illustrated in figure  [ ris : twodifn ] , where we compare @xmath48 and @xmath41 for the @xmath38 run . \n it is shown , however , that the two ratios are very close . \n we show @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath51 in figure  [ ris : specwk_norm_2d ] ( a ) . \n it is shown that the spectra are an approximately constant function of the wavenumber in the intermediate range of wavenumbers . \n the ratio @xmath52 is shown in figure  [ ris : specwk_norm_2d ] ( b ) . \n it is shown that the depletion takes place in almost the complete spectrum . in three dimensional turbulence , according to closure theory , the depletion was constant throughout the inertial range of scales @xcite . \n note that the highest wavenumbers , beyond @xmath53 , are affected by the wavenumber truncation and the strong fluctuations at these scales are rather numerical artefacts than part of the turbulent dynamics . \n an obvious question is of course how the above results depend on the initial value of the reynolds number . \n are the results essentially inviscid , so that we can expect them to hold in the limit of infinitely high reynolds numbers , or do they depend on the relative strength of the viscous effects compared to that of the nonlinear term ? in figure [ fig : reeff ] the results are shown for the different simulations . \n it is observed that the rapid relaxation becomes roughly independent of the reynolds number for the @xmath43 , @xmath38 and @xmath54 simulations . \n the long - time evolutions are qualitatively similar . for numerical reasons , \n we have not carried out the @xmath54 simulation for long times , but the qualitative similarity between the other three simulations indicates that the long - time evolution , like the short - time evolution , is not qualitatively changed by the value of the reynolds number . \n both long and short time processes appear to be inviscid . \n in the present investigation we have shown how the mean - square nonlinearity evolves in 2d turbulence , compared to a gaussian reference field . \n in particular , we observed a two - step regime of the suppression of nonlinearity . \n the first step corresponds to the fast formation of vortices and could be qualified as rapid relaxation . \n the second phase corresponds to the evolution of the system through the mutual interactions of the vortices . \n if we consider only a short time interval , as in figure  [ ris : n_over_ngaus_snapshots ] ( top ) , it seems that the mean square nonlinearity falls to a value of the order of half the gaussian value and then remains constant , as seen qualitatively in 3d turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) . comparing the strongly fluctuating time - evolution of the ratio @xmath55 with flow - visualizations at different time - instants \n , it was observed that low values correspond to situations where vortical structures are well separated in space . whenever vortices interact , a strong increase of the ratio is observed . \n the first , rapid relaxation process is possibly caused by local alignment properties of the flow @xcite . the fact that at very long times the nonlinearity is further reduced was predicted by an entropy optimization argument by joyce & montgomery  @xcite , and more formally explained in @xcite . \n note that this final state of two vortices , depleted from nonlinear interaction was predicted by applying statistical mechanics to the global quantities ( enstrophy , energy averaged over the spatial domain ) leading to the prediction of the most probable final dynamic state in the limit of small viscosity . \n a recent review article @xcite gives an overview of existing attempts to predict the formation of coherence using the application of statistical mechanics to two - dimensional flows . \n these approaches mostly focus on the long - time limit of systems in the inviscid limit . \n the results in the present work suggest that also the rapid relaxation process is of inviscid nature , and might therefore also be treatable in the framework of euler s equations . \n we have not investigated the role of the boundary conditions on the depletion of nonlinearity . \n it is certain that the detailed long - time dynamics must be affected by this . \n indeed , it was shown that the final dynamic state is different when an unbounded fluid is considered @xcite or when rigid boundaries are taken into account @xcite . however , in all these cases the final state is characterized by large - scale coherent structures , that we can expect to be in a near equilibrium state with a low value of the mean - square nonlinearity , compared to a field consisting of random independent modes . \n the long - time tendency of the mean - square nonlinearity will thus not be changed imposing different boundary conditions . \n furthermore , it can be expected that the initial fast relaxation is relatively independent of the boundary conditions , as long as the initial correlation lengthscale is small compared to the domain - size . \n transposing the existing theoretical ideas of inviscid global relaxation to local flow structuring , might prove a good starting point to understand the rapid relaxation events observed in the present and different flow configurations . \n a suggestion of such an approach and first steps in this direction can be found in the work by servidio _ \n such an approach could lead the way to a statistical understanding of the self - organization of turbulent systems in general without appeal to specific topological considerations of the local flow structures . \n the authors are grateful to robert rubinstein for comments , valuable discussions and suggestions .", "StartTimeOffset": 2362429888304, "RequestID": "dfc5186efe8dab0a4e36db29f547ea6676ab677c", "TotalTokens": 3901}

[ fig02 ] for @xmath25 . at early times \n a shock has not yet developed , the profile looks like a free streaming of particles . \n but at later times we observe the creation of a shock plateau . \n formally we define the time of formation of the shock plateau when the maximum of the velocity distribution @xmath26 reaches the value @xmath20 of the ideal - fluid solution in fig . \n [ fig01 ] . from the right panel of fig . \n [ fig02 ] , we see that this happens at @xmath14 fm / c .    in ref . \n @xcite we have found the scaling behavior of the riemann problem : the time scale of the formation of shock waves @xmath27 is proportional to the @xmath0 ratio . from fig . \n [ fig02 ] we also infer that , for @xmath28 , a shock plateau has not yet developed at @xmath14 fm / c , whereas for @xmath29 , it has already fully formed . \n for @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 fm / c , which is the typical lifetime of the qgp produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic . \n therefore , an imperfect quark gluon fluid with @xmath30 will prevent the observation of mach cone signals at rhic . \n using the parton cascade bamps we have solved the relativistic riemann problem . \n the transition from ideal - fluid behavior to free streaming is demonstrated . \n numerical results from bamps agree well with those obtained from viscous hydrodynamical calculations using vshasta . \n considering the scaling behavior we found that the formation of shock waves in gluon matter with @xmath30 probably takes longer than the lifetime of the qgp at rhic . \n this work was supported by the helmholtz international center for fair within the framework of the loewe program launched by the state of hesse . \n e.  molnr acknowledges support by the alexander von humboldt foundation . the work of h.  niemi was supported by the extreme matter institute ( emmi ) . \n f.  wang [ star collaboration ] , j.  phys . \n g * 30 * , s1299 ( 2004 ) ; j.  adams _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 95 * , 152301 ( 2005 ) ; s.  s.  adler _ et al . _ \n [ phenix collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ * 97 * , 052301 ( 2006 ) ; j.  g.  ulery [ star collaboration ] , nucl . \n a * 774 * , 581 ( 2006 ) ; n.  n.  ajitanand [ phenix collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ * 783 * , 519 ( 2007 ) ; a.  adare _ et al . _ \n [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \n c * 78 * , 014901 ( 2008 ) . \n h.  stcker , nucl . \n a * 750 * , 121 ( 2005 ) ; j.  ruppert and b.  mller , phys . \n b * 618 * , 123 ( 2005 ) ; j.  casalderrey - solana , e.  v.  shuryak and d.  teaney , j.  phys . \n * 27 * , 22 ( 2005 ) ; v.  koch , a.  majumder and x.  n.  wang , phys . \n * 96 * , 172302 ( 2006 ) . \n s.  s.  adler _ et al . \n _ [ phenix collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * \n 91 * , 182301 ( 2003 ) ; j.  adams _ et al . _ [ star collaboration ] , _ ibid . _ \n * 92 * , 052302 ( 2004 ) ; b.  b.  back _ et al . _ \n [ phobos collaboration ] , phys . \n c * 72 * , 051901 ( 2005 ) . \n m.  luzum and p.  romatschke , phys . \n c * 78 * , 034915 ( 2008 ) ; h.  song and u.  w.  heinz , arxiv:0812.4274 . \n z.  xu , c.  greiner and h.  stcker , phys . \n * 101 * , 082302 ( 2008 ) ; z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n c * 79 * , 014904 ( 2009 ) . \n z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n c * 71 * , 064901 ( 2005 ) ; * 76 * , 024911 ( 2007 ) . \n e.  molnar , h.  niemi and d.  h.  rischke , arxiv:0907.2583 [ nucl - th ] . \n e.  molnar , eur . \n j.   c * 60 * ( 2009 ) 413 i.  bouras _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n lett .   * 103 * , 032301 ( 2009 ) z.  xu and c.  greiner , phys . \n lett .   * 100 * , 172301 ( 2008 ) . \n p.  huovinen and d.  molnar , phys . \n c * 79 * , 014906 ( 2009 ) . \n et al . _ , \n c * 79 * , 044914 ( 2009 ) v.  schneider _ et al . \n _ , j.  comput . \n phys .   * 105 * , 92 ( 1993 ) ; d.  h.  rischke , s.  bernard and j.  a.  maruhn , nucl . \n phys .   a * 595 * , 346 ( 1995 ) ; d.  h.  rischke , arxiv : nucl - th/9809044 . b.  betz , d.  henkel and d.  h.  rischke , arxiv:0812.1440 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2373789368249, "RequestID": "cbf4f09501276cfdff4a80c9523f5d7ae002406f", "TotalTokens": 2569}

integer dimensions , @xcite we believe that it is imperative to study the extent of the dimensionality contribution to the superfluidity in order to understand the experimental results .    in this paper \n , we examine the physical properties of ideal bose gas with fractal dimensions between @xmath0 ( thin film limit ) and @xmath1 ( the bulk limit ) . \n the results will be compared with experimental results obtained from liquid helium-4 in porous media . \n surprisingly , we find that most of salient features of experimental observations on liquid helium-4 in porous solids can be explained using the theoretical results from the ideal gas model in fractal dimensions . \n this indicates that the dimensionality contribution , not the mutual interactions , is the dominant factor for superfluidity in porous media . \n the ideal bose gas system at integer dimensions was studied long time ago.@xcite however , study at fractal dimensions was carried out only quite recently.@xcite the density of states which is essential to calculate thermodynamic properties of the bose gas in @xmath2-dimension , where @xmath2 is any real number , is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath2-dimensional coefficient which is known as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the gamma function , @xmath7 the mass , and @xmath8 the @xmath2-dimensional _ measure _ or volume .    in order to obtain physical quantities of the @xmath2-dimensional bose gas , it is necessary to obtain the grand partition function in @xmath2-dimension , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the thermodynamic fugacity defined by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the thermal wavelength defined by @xmath14 . with the coefficient @xmath4 , we can readily calculate the grand partition function in @xmath2-dimension . \n the @xmath15 is the bose gas function defined by @xmath16 the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath10 are restricted to @xmath18 and @xmath19 regions . \n the bose gas function can be also extended to non - integer dimensions,@xcite and has an integral expression , @xmath20 note that this representation is valid only when @xmath21 .    using the above expressions \n , we obtain the average number of particles in @xmath2-dimension , @xmath22 we use the above equations to calculate thermodynamic properties in fractal dimensions in the following . \n before we go into detailed calculations , we briefly summarize experimental findings on superfluid helium-4 in porous media , since we are interested in whether the dimensionality considered above plays any role in real situations . \n it is known that physical properties of superfluid helium-4 in porous media show quite puzzling behaviors . @xcite upon reducing the lab variables of porous media such as  pore filling , \"  thickness , \"  number of layers , \" or \n coverage , \" the capacity curves show the following generic behaviors independent of the porous media or substrates : ( i ) the critical temperature for superfluidity onset shifts downwards almost linearly . \n ( ii ) the bulk - like sharp cusp disappears and the peak gets smaller . \n furthermore , there appears a systematic crossing at low temperatures . \n ( iii ) the shape of the curve gets rounder and , eventually , becomes flat . \n these experimental findings are summarized in fig . \n these figures are reproduced from references [ 1 - 4 ] , so that comparison with the theory can be made transparent . here \n , we observe that the above experimental findings appear independent of detailed nature of porous media and also of interactions between particles . \n this fact strongly suggests that , at least , the qualitative nature of the above behavior may originate from geometric factors . \n ( iv ) another interesting physical property is the superfluid density shown in fig . \n 2 . the sample e has smaller density , which implies more connectivity of porous structure than the sample \n it is shown that the curves from different media do not cross one another . \n this again indicates that the superfluid density is strongly dependent on the porous structure . \n numerous theories have been suggested to explain the above experimental observations . \n @xcite however , so far no completely successful theory has emerged . \n for example , the kt model of the vortex mediated transition in two - dimensional space gives an excellent explanation of question ( i ) for very thin films of one or two layers but not for other samples . \n we now calculate the physical properties in fractal dimensions and compare the results with the experimental findings summarized above . \n fractal dimensionality measures disorderness in terms of the connectivity of the system . \n \\(i ) the critical temperature , @xmath23 , for the superfluidity of the ideal bose gas in fractal space can readily obtained from eq . \n ( [ anp ] ) to be given by @xcite @xmath24^{\\frac{2}{d}}}. \\label{ctem}\\ ] ] the almost linear behavior of @xmath23 as a function of dimensionality is plotted in fig . \n necessary parameters are taken from reference 25 . \n the formula can be simplified when @xmath2 approaches to 2 to be given by @xcite @xmath25 the results are surprisingly in good agreement with the experimental findings shown in fig . \n 1 . even though we completely neglected the interactions between bose particles , the @xmath26 limit has the same form with the kt theory prediction.@xcite note that the kt theory can not account the experimental results for thick films , but the present @xmath27 limit agrees with the correct bulk value . \n \\(ii ) the specific heat of the ideal bose gas in fractal space can readily obtained , too , from the grand partition function @xmath28 in eq . \n ( [ 23 ] ) . \n ( a ) when @xmath29 @xmath30 and , ( b ) when @xmath31 @xmath32 the @xmath33 curves for several values of fractal dimensions are plotted as functions of temperatures in fig . \n we observe that the cusp disappears when the dimension is less than 3 , and the peak height becomes smaller with decreasing dimensionality . \n also , fig . \n 4 shows that there exists a systematic crossover at low temperature regions . \n these results are in excellent agreement with the experiments shown in fig \n \\(iii ) in fig . \n 4 , we observe that the peaks of the specific heat curves become less and less prominent and , eventually , the curves become flat with decreasing dimensionality . \n we show that this behavior originates from a hidden hierarchy in the superfluidity transition with fractal dimensions . \n the first temperature derivative of the specific heat can be readily obtained from eqs . \n ( [ cvl ] ) and ( [ cvh ] ) . \n ( a ) when @xmath29 @xmath34 ( b ) when @xmath31 @xmath35 ^ 2 } + \\frac{d}{2}\\frac{g_{d/2}(z ) g_{d/2 -

{"ContextTokens": 3531, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "elliptical galaxies are anomalous in many respects when considered in the context of the standard ideas regarding galaxy and star - formation . despite the absence of star - formation today \n only minimal passive evolution has been identified to z@xmath01 , mainly from optical - ir colours of cluster sequences , which are marginally bluer than k - corrections predict ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) . at higher redshift \n , examples of luminous red galaxies are found with f and g - star dominated spectra ( dunlop 1996 ; spinrad 1998 ; broadhurst & frye 1999 ) . \n no bright blue precursors have been identified . \n the absence of precursors naively implies the early epoch was obscured by dust or restricted to unobservably high redshifts . \n benitez ( 1999 ) strongly limit any unobscured formation to z@xmath110 , in the deepest available vlt / nicmos images . \n support for early dust is controversial . \n claims of high star - formation rates from far - ir imaging of the hdf ( hughes et al 1998 ) have been corrected in the radio ( richards 1998 ) and identified with low redshift disk galaxies and agn . this is consistent with the non - detection of far - ir emission from targeted observations of optically luminous @xmath5 galaxies ( scott 1998 ) .    in the context of hierarchical models , \n it is natural to view e / so galaxies as the end product of a merging process and hence to predict declining numbers with increasing redshift . \n locally at least , merging of disk galaxies is seen to create some spheroidal shaped objects ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) . at faint magnitudes claims \n have been made for a decline in the space density of red and/or elliptical galaxies at z@xmath11 , ( kauffmann , white , & charlot 1996 ; zepf 1997 ; franceschini 1997 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; menanteau 1999 ; barger et al . \n 1999 ) mainly on the basis of optical imaging . \n conflicting with this is the simplicity of structural and color relations between elliptical galaxies ( faber & jackson 1976 ) , particularly in rich clusters where coeval monolithic formation is inferred ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) . \n if gas rich mergers of spirals are to produce the ellipticals then the enhanced alpha - element abundance generated by a brief merger induced episode of star - formation is unacceptably diluted by the pre - existing snia - enriched ism ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) . furthermore the mass of stars formed during a merger is limited by the general absence of an intermediate - age stellar population in post - merger ellipticals ( silva & bothun 1998 ; james & mobasher 1999 ) . \n metallicity is also a problem with monolithic collapse formation , as closed box star - formation does not account for the observed lack of low metallicity stars ( worthey 1994 ) but implies pre - enrichment of the gas ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) . \n recently , distant red ellipticals and other spheroid dominated galaxies at 1@xmath6z@xmath62 have been detected in the deepest combination of optical - ir images  a small nicmos / vlt field ( benitez 1999 , treu 1998 , stiavelli 1998 ) . \n here we analyse a much larger sample of distant red galaxies by combining optical - ir photometry from both hubble deep fields , to measure the rates of spectral and density evolution (  3 , \n 4 ) with photometric redshift measurements (  2 ) and discuss new implications for their formation (  4 ) . \n the observations used here are the deep hst optical images in the ubvi ( williams et al . \n 1996 , 1999 ) and the jhk images from kpno ( dickinson 1997 ) and from the sofi instrument on the ntt in the south ( da costa 1998 ) . \n we use the published zero - points , filter transmission and detector response curves . \n magnitudes are measured using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , and photometric redshifts are estimated by maximizing the likelihood with respect to a set of instantaneous burst spectra calculated using the @xmath7 = -0.2 $ ] bruzual / charlot spectrophotometric package ( leitherer et al.1996 ) . \n stars are distinguishable to very faint magnitudes by both a stellarity index ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and , interestingly for red stars , by a poor fit to redshifted red galaxy spectra . \n the first point to note is that the choice of metallicity does not significantly affect the redshift estimate . \n the break at 4000  is so sharp that with accurate optical - ir magnitudes the redshift can be determined to @xmath015% with a ruler . \n a comparison of photo - z s with the 10 spectroscopic redshifts of elliptical galaxies the hdf is very good with a hint of a @xmath8z=0.1 systematic overestimate . \n 48 objects are found with seds well matched to early type galaxies . \n the majority clearly fit a de - vaucouleurs profiles and not an exponential ( fig 2 ) . \n the remainder are too faint in the optical and of too low resolution in the ir to constrain the morphology . in other words \n , our sample contains all objects consistent with a de - vaucoulours profile and a passively evolving sed . \n half of these galaxies lie at z@xmath11 and extend to z=2.5 . \n few if any moderately bright blue ellipticals ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) are missed this way . \n the spectra are compared in the restframe ( fig 1 ) . a clear evolutionary trend emerges towards a mid f - star dominated spectrum by @xmath11 . \n hotter a - star dominated spectra would be very easily recognized if ellipticals evolved further according to a standard imf at z@xmath12 , such young ( @xmath61gyr ) precursors being very bright and blue . \n this simple result suggests that the passive evolution of elliptical galaxies begins at @xmath2 . for approximately @xmath01 - 2gyrs after formation the spectrum of such a stellar population has no detectable spectral evolution , consistent with the slow evolution found here above @xmath12 ( fig 1 ) . \n this level of evolution corresponds to a change in magnitude in the rest - frame b of only @xmath13 between z@xmath02 and the present . \n a small but detectable variance among seds is observed at any redshift ( fig 1 ) with evidence for greater homogeneity at high redshift . \n the bluest 3 objects marking the starting point of the color - colour tracks in fig 3 are estimated to lie in the range 1@xmath6z@xmath62 . \n these objects contain a small blue excess in u and b relative to an f - star spectrum ( fig 2 , bottom panel ) which is spatially distributed like the general light profile ( fig 2 ) , ruling out an agn contribution . accommodating this with some a - star light \n steepens the ir appreciably , requiring a redder imf for a good fit . \n nebular continuum emission is an interesting possibility . \n spectroscopy would be very helpful in understanding these relatively blue ellipticals . \n a proper assessment of density evolution requires simulated images to account for the very strong redshift dependent k - correction . \n simulations are made in all bands using the local luminosity function of early type galaxies ( pozzetti et al 1998 ) and matched in background noise , pixel scale and psf of each passband , using a variation of the machinery described in bouwens , broadhurst & silk ( 1998 ) . \n selection and photometry of both the observed and simulated images is performed identically . \n fig 3 shows a comparison with a model in which the density is fixed and only the observed minimal spectral evolution takes place to @xmath14=2.5 . \n it is clear that the numbers and luminosities of red galaxies has not changed much between z@xmath02 and the present , in agreement with the claim of benitez ( 1999 ) , but inconsistent with other estimates , in particular previous optical work . \n the unknown volume at high redshift translates into an uncertainty in the predicted numbers at z@xmath11 , so that both low @xmath15 and flat @xmath16 dominated models underpredict the data by @xmath030% . \n our findings show that the passive evolution of ellipticals evolves slowly to a mid - f star spectrum by @xmath11 . \n bluer ellipticals are conspicuous by their absence , and at face value , this simply suggests that the main sequence in elliptical galaxies does not extend above @xmath17 . \n it is also clear that most elliptical galaxies form at z@xmath11 given the lack of any significant decline in their space density with redshift , subject to a factor of  30% uncertainty from the unknown volume . \n these conclusions are surprising given the high metal content of ellipticals and implies some gas pre - enrichment . \n this requirement is more palatable in light of recent evidence of outflows in higher redshift star forming galaxies , in particular lensed galaxies for which there is sufficient signal to detect blueshifted ism absorption lines ( franx 1997 ; frye & broadhurst ; frye 1999 ) . \n such outflows will be preferentially enriched with alpha - elements from snii activity . \n independent of the observed outflows , renzini ( 1997 ) has argued convincingly that snii enrichment of the icm is indicated by the predominantly alpha - element enriched gas . in the context of hierarchical evolution early enriched material will cool onto the later forming more massive halos . \n locally , examples of near solar enriched cooling - flow x - ray gas is found in groups and clusters of galaxies centered on giant ellipticals of similar metallicity ( finoguenov & ponman 1999 ) . \n we suggest that cooling may be responsible for the formation of the stellar content of elliptical galaxies more generally , naturally leading to a bottom heavy imf consistent with our results . \n inviting this simple picture is the remarkable correspondence between the most luminous x - ray cooling gas with impressively large cd galaxies ( fabian , nulsen , & canizares 1991 ) . \n hence it is perhaps not surprising to find that such objects contain _ young _ stellar populations ( mehlert 1997 ) if this cooling gas forms visible stars . \n a clear test of the possible role of cooling flows in the formation of spheroidal galaxies will be provided soon by deep field x - ray imaging , like the planned deep axaf field ( giacconi 1999 ) . constraining the numbers of even higher redshift red galaxies \n requires deeper ir imaging to explore beyond z=2 . \n the isaac camera on the vlt has the area and efficiency to achieve this , extending @xmath18 magnitudes fainter than the relatively low resolution @xmath04 m ir imaging used here . \n barger , a.j . \n , et al . \n 1998 , , 501 , 522 . \n barger , a.j . \n , cowie , l.l . , \n trentham , n. , fulton , e. , hu , e.m . , \n songalia , a. , hall , d. 1999 , , in press , submitted to mnras , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3934, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "a classical thermodynamic heat engine converts heat energy into mechanical work by using a classical - mechanical system in which a gas expands and pushes a piston in a cylinder . \n such a heat engine obtains its energy from a high - temperature heat reservoir . \n some of the energy taken from this reservoir is converted to mechanical work . \n a heat engine is not perfectly efficient , so some of the energy taken from the heat reservoir is not converted to mechanical energy , but rather is transferred to a low - temperature reservoir ( planck 1927 ) . \n a classical heat engine running between a high - temperature reservoir and a low - temperature reservoir achieves maximum efficiency if it is reversible . while it is impossible to construct a working heat engine that is perfectly reversible , in the early 19th century carnot proposed a mathematical model of an ideal heat engine that is not only reversible but also cyclic ( carnot 1824 ) . \n the carnot engine consists of a cylinder of ideal gas that is alternately placed in thermal contact with high - temperature and low - temperature heat reservoirs whose temperatures are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    instead of a classical system of gas , \n we consider here a quantum - mechanical system of consisting a single particle in contact with a reservoir . \n the system is described by a time - dependent cyclic hamiltonian . \n the statistical ensemble of many such identically - prepared systems that we consider here is characterised by a density matrix . \n we assume that the system interacts weakly with its environment . \n it is known that it is possible to extract work from such a system ( e.g. , geva @xmath2 kosloff 1994 ; kosloff , _ et al_. 2000 ) . \n in particular , if the evolution of the density matrix is reversible , then we can construct a quantum - mechanical carnot engine ( bender , _ \n et al_. 2000 ) . \n the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the properties of quantum carnot engine . \n this is of importance because it improves our understanding of the relationship between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics , an area of considerable interest in quantum theory ( e.g. , leff @xmath2 rex 1990 ) . \n this paper is organised as follows : first , we explain the concept of a quantum engine by generalising the two - state model considered by bender , _ et al_. ( 2000 ) to an infinite - state square - well model and derive equations of states for isoenergetic and adiabatic processes . \n these results lead naturally to the quantum analogue of the clausius equality for a reversible cycle . \n we show that , unlike the result in classical thermodynamics , the clausius relation obtained here is not based on the change of entropy . \n we then introduce the von neumann entropy and obtain the maximum entropy state subject to isoenergetic requirements . \n we demonstrate that the maximum von neumann entropy is consistent with the thermodynamic definition of entropy , as well as the equations of states for quantum carnot cycle . as a consequence , \n we are able to determine the temperature of the energy bath directly from two of the diagonal components of the density matrix . \n we conclude by discussing several open problems . \n we can construct a simple quantum engine using a single particle of mass @xmath3 confined to an infinite one - dimensional square - well potential whose volume ( width ) is @xmath4 . for any fixed @xmath4 \n it is easy to solve the time independent schrdinger equation to determine the energy spectrum of the system : @xmath5 we assume that the width of the well initially is @xmath6 and that the initial energy of the system is a fixed constant @xmath7 . \n the initial state @xmath8 of the system is a linear combination @xmath9 of the energy eigenstates @xmath10 . \n thus , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath7 is bounded below by @xmath13 . \n note that the pure state @xmath8 characterises a typical element of the ensemble , whose statistical property is thus determined by the density matrix , given , in the energy eigenstates , by @xmath14 .    starting with the above initial configuration \n , we define a quantum cycle as follows : first , the well expands _ isoenergetically _ ; that is , the width of the well increases infinitely slowly while the system is kept in contact with an energy bath . \n note that the quantum adiabatic theorem ( born @xmath2 fock 1928 ) states that if the system were isolated during such an expansion , the system would remain in its initial state . \n that is , the absolute values of the expansion coefficients @xmath15 would remain constant . \n thus , if the system were isolated , the energy of the system ( the expectation value of the hamiltonian ) would decrease like @xmath16 .    however , during this expansion , we simultaneously pump energy into the system in order to compensate this decrease of the energy . \n thus , the well , which can be viewed as a one - dimensional piston , expands in such a way that the expectation value of the hamiltonian is held constant by exciting higher energy states . \n this implies that , unlike the isothermal process in classical thermodynamics , the temperature of the ` bath ' in an isoenergetic process is in fact changing . \n the explicit volume dependence of temperature is derived in section 5 .    during such an isoenergetic expansion , \n mechanical work is done by the force ( one - dimensional pressure ) @xmath17 on the walls of the well . \n the contribution to this force from the @xmath18th energy eigenstate is @xmath19 hence the force @xmath17 is given by the expectation value @xmath20 . using the relation @xmath21 and eq . \n ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we obtain the equation of state during an isoenergetic process : @xmath22 this result is identical to the corresponding equation of state for an isothermal process of a classical ideal gas , if we make the identification @xmath23 . \n note that the expansion coefficients @xmath24 of the wave function change as a function of the width @xmath4 while the well expands isoenergetically from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . \n second , the system expands _ \n adiabatically_. during an adiabatic process the eigenstates @xmath10 change as a function of @xmath4 , but the values @xmath15 remain constant . \n therefore , the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath27 decreases during the process because each @xmath28 decreases with increasing @xmath4 while all @xmath29 are kept fixed . \n the force @xmath17 in this case is determined by differentiating the energy @xmath30 with respect to @xmath4 . \n thus , the equation of state during an adiabatic process for the square - well potential is @xmath31 which is a quantum analogue of the corresponding equation for a classical ideal gas . \n the system expands adiabatically until its volume reaches @xmath32 . at this point \n the expectation of the hamiltonian decreases to @xmath33 . \n because the squared coefficients @xmath29 of the wave function remain constant during an adiabatic process , the value of @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 . \n following the adiabatic expansion , the system is compressed isoenergetically until @xmath35 , with the expectation value of the hamiltonian fixed at @xmath33 , and finally it is compressed adiabatically until the width of the system returns to its initial value @xmath6 . \n this cycle is reversible , and we find that the efficiency of the quantum engine is given by @xmath36 a formula analogous to the classical thermodynamic result @xmath37 of carnot ( 1824 ) . \n we have demonstrated above an example of a quantum system with a slowly - changing time - dependent hamiltonian from which work can be extracted . \n the key concept introduced here is an _ energy bath _ that maintains the expectation value of the hamiltonian . \n this idea can be developed further to establish the quantum counterparts of the classical thermodynamic relations . to begin with , \n let us first consider the theorem of clausius .    during an isoenergetic expansion , the amount of energy transferred to the system to maintain the expectation of the hamiltonian is determined by the integral @xmath38 where @xmath39 . \n the amount of energy absorbed during an isoenergetic compression can be determined similarly with the result @xmath40 . \n thus , for a closed , reversible cycle we obtain the quantum clausius equality @xmath41 because @xmath42 for a closed cycle .    in classical thermodynamics \n the clausius equality states that the total change @xmath43 of entropy in a reversible cycle is zero , where the differential of entropy @xmath44 is the ratio of the absorbed heat and the bath temperature . \n therefore , the relation ( [ eq:8 ] ) suggests that in quantum mechanics the entropy change in an isoenergetic process might be given by @xmath45 , the ratio of the absorbed energy to the bath energy . \n however , as we show below , this quantity does not determine the amount of entropy change , and hence the quantum clausius relation is not a condition for entropy . \n instead , it merely implies that the total energy absorbed , for given bath energies , must vanish in a reversible cycle . \n if the cycle is irreversible , then we have @xmath46 . \n to understand the change of entropy in a quantum carnot cycle we consider the von neumann entropy @xmath47 associated with the density matrix @xmath48 , expressed in terms of the energy eigenstates . \n let us first consider the isoenergetic process and introduce a scaling parameter @xmath49 such that @xmath50 . \n then , during an isoenergetic process the probability @xmath29 that the system is in the @xmath18th eigenstate changes in @xmath49 , subject to the constraints @xmath51 where we have chosen units in which @xmath52 and taken the initial condition @xmath53 \n . there are infinitely many combinations of @xmath29 satisfying these constraints , each of which determines the entropy . \n hence , quantum mechanically it appears that any one of such states is allowed in an isoenergetic process . \n however , there is a unique density matrix that satisfies the thermodynamic requirement of the change of entropy , and this is the state that maximises the von neumann entropy .    to show this \n , we must determine the density matrix that maximises the entropy subject to the constraints ( [ eq:10 ] ) and then obtain the associated entropy @xmath54 . \n we can perform this maximisation directly without using lagrange multipliers . \n the two constraints in ( [ eq:10 ] ) imply that two of the diagonal components , say @xmath55 and @xmath56 , of the density matrix are determined . therefore , \n if we differentiate the constraints ( [ eq:10 ] ) with respect to @xmath57 , we find that @xmath58 solving these linear equations , we obtain @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . substituting these expressions into @xmath61 and solving for @xmath29 , we get @xmath62 which is also valid for any choice of @xmath63 .    given the maximum entropy state ( [ eq:13 ] ) , we can now reexpress the constraints in the form @xmath64 where we have defined @xmath65 . this is obtained by substituting ( [ eq:13 ] ) in ( [ eq:10 ] ) , solving for @xmath66 , and equating the resulting expressions . \n similarly , using the parameter @xmath67 , the state represented in ( [ eq:13 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath68 therefore , the corresponding von neumann entropy is @xmath69 this is independent of @xmath70 because of the identity @xmath71 thus , given the width scale @xmath72 of the potential well , the relation ( [ eq:14 ] ) determines the value of @xmath67 , from which we can determine both @xmath29 and @xmath54 as functions of the single length scale parameter @xmath49 . \n we can now analyse the entropy associated with the isoenergetic process . \n we note first that the change of entropy associated with ( [ eq:16 ] ) does not agree with the quantity @xmath45 . \n more specifically , we verify that only asymptotically for large values of @xmath49 , that is , large energies , the two quantities are proportional to each other . in particular , because the value of @xmath54 in ( [ eq:16 ] ) is independent of the choices of @xmath73 and @xmath70 , we can set @xmath74 and @xmath75 without loss of generality . \n then , asymptotically we have @xmath76 for large @xmath49 . \n furthermore , the maximum entropy state @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 for all @xmath79 . therefore , @xmath80 and for large values of @xmath49 we use the asymptotic relation @xmath81 to determine the entropy change . \n the result gives @xmath82 when the width changes from @xmath25 to @xmath83 . \n on the other hand , from ( [ eq:7 ] ) we deduce that @xmath84 for any value of @xmath85 . \n this establishes the asymptotic proportionality . \n however , @xmath45 does not in general determine the entropy change . \n next , we show that the maximum von neumann entropy ( [ eq:16 ] ) is consistent with thermodynamic considerations . recall that an isoenergetic process must proceed infinitely slowly in order that the energy bath at any point during the process be in thermal equilibrium . \n thus , this process requires an infinite amount of time to be realised . \n then from the principles of statistical mechanics ( schrdinger 1952 ) we deduce that , if we set @xmath86 , the temperature of the bath is given by @xmath87 . \n this is because we can make the identification @xmath88 in eq . \n ( [ eq:15 ] ) . on the other hand , \n temperature is given in thermodynamics by the formula @xmath89 where @xmath90 . \n in the present consideration we have @xmath91 from the equation of state @xmath92 and the relation @xmath90 , while from ( [ eq:16 ] ) we find that @xmath93 . \n therefore , the thermodynamic definition of temperature in ( [ eq:19 ] ) gives @xmath94 which agrees with the statistical mechanical consideration above . \n we conclude therefore that the maximum von neumann entropy determines the density matrix of the system in an isoenergetic process . \n furthermore , the temperature of the energy bath can be obtained from ( [ eq:20 ] ) , where @xmath67 is determined by any two diagonal components @xmath95 , @xmath66 of the density matrix . in particular , the temperature of the bath changes continuously in @xmath49 during an isoenergetic process , even though the energy of the system is held fixed . \n we now consider the adiabatic process . in this case \n , there is no net energy absorbed by the system , so the thermodynamic entropy remains constant . on the other hand , because the diagonal components @xmath29 of the density matrix are constant during an adiabatic process , the von neumann entropy ( [ eq:9 ] ) also remains constant , in agreement with the thermodynamic consideration . \n these results can be expressed by the phase diagram in the entropy - volume plane , as shown in figure  1 . \n the diagram shows that the thermodynamic constraint @xmath42 is satisfied by , and only by , the maximum von neumann entropy . \n thus , we emphasise that the quantum state corresponding to the maximum von neumann entropy , as obtained by microscopic analysis , is entirely consistent with the thermodynamic equations of states .    [ ] \n in the analysis above we have considered only the square - well potential model , which can be interpreted as the quantum analogue of the classical ideal gas . \n a natural extension of this work would be to consider other hamiltonians . \n for example , for a harmonic potential whose energy eigenvalues are @xmath96 , a dimensional argument shows that the characteristic length scale is given by @xmath97 . \n therefore , the equations of states for the harmonic potential become identical to those for the square - well potential , although the volume dependence of the entropy is different from ( [ eq:16 ] ) . for other hamiltonians , \n however , the equations of states are not in general identical to those obtained here , and it would be interesting to find explicit examples of other models exhibiting nonideal behaviours .    another important issue is to understand whether there is any role played by the geometric phases , a concept that does not have an analogue in the classical carnot cycle . although the quantum carnot engine is indeed cyclic in terms of @xmath29 , the coefficients @xmath24 of the wave function of any one of the representatives in the ensemble inevitably pick up geometric phases as the system goes through a cycle . therefore , strictly speaking , the wave function is not cyclic in the quantum carnot cycle . \n the question then is whether there is any physically observable evidence of the geometric phase in the present context , and if so , how do we represent that in the mixed state context ( cf . \n uhlmann 1996 ) . \n finally , another interesting idea that should be studied is the possibility of constructing a _ cyclic _ quantum engine ( or a quantum refrigerator by reversing the cycle ) that requires only a finite amount of time to complete . note that each cycle of a classical carnot engine is infinitely long . \n however , in quantum mechanics , it is known , for example , that by choosing a specific form of time dependent hamiltonians , it is possible to construct a quantum - mechanical cycle in an essentially arbitrary short time scale ( mielnik 1986 ) . \n it would be of interest to determine if such an idea can be applied to create a finite - time carnot engine , or whether such dynamics would be incompatible with the requirement of maximising the von neumann entropy . \n an analysis on the performance of finite - time cycle in the presence of friction has been studied in feldmann @xmath2 kosloff ( 2000 ) . \n we wish to express our gratitude to a.  howie and m.  f.  parry for stimulating discussions . \n dcb gratefully acknowledges financial support from the royal society . \n this work was supported in part by the u.s . \n department of energy .", "StartTimeOffset": 2445454587277, "RequestID": "a9b149939cbdb71a931571bdf6bcf495b1946e1d", "TotalTokens": 4072}
{"ContextTokens": 3371, "GeneratedTokens": 123, "SynthesizedBody": "transaction costs preclude perfect replication of contingent claims and introduce a tradeoff between the risk and return to hedging . a standard approach to dealing with this tradeoff \n is to use utility functions for evaluating hedging errors ( hodges and neuberger 1989 ) and the utility indifference principle for pricing options ( davis et al . \n in contrast to the elegance of black - scholes delta hedging , these models typically lack explicit solutions and require powerful numerical methods to obtain case - by - case approximations of optimal hedges .    in some situations the particular structure of the optimal hedging strategy \n is known , which facilitates numerical analysis . \n one example is the black - scholes model with proportional transaction costs , where the hedging strategy of a trader with cara utility function is defined by a no - trade region ( davis et al . \n when the hedger s stock holdings are outside this region , she carries out a trade that brings the stock position onto the nearest boundary point . \n numerical methods that approximate value functions have proved successful in this model , see , e.g. , monoyios ( 2004 ) . \n a different approach is presented in zakamouline ( 2006 ) who derives analytic approximations of the two boundaries of the no - trade region . \n motivated by asymptotic results in whalley and wilmott ( 1997 ) , his approach combines a clever guess of a parametric functional form with the estimation of coefficients as functions of model parameters . \n these estimations , however , require a numerical approximation of the optimal hedging strategy . \n in this paper we propose an alternative approach to derive explicit hedging strategies for general nonlinear transaction costs . \n the approach is based on genetic programming which offers several advantages over classical numerical approaches . \n first , by construction it is constrained to output closed - form expressions that are functions of the model parameters . \n second , it delivers efficient results at low cost by solving the two tasks of finding an optimal hedging strategy and a closed - form representation for it in one integrated process . \n third , no assumption is made on the functional form of the approximation . \n genetic programming therefore avoids the disadvantage of ex post calibration methods and , at the same time , offers a technique that deals with cases in which there is no a priori information on the structure of the optimal solution . \n the closed - form approximations of hedging strategies derived with this heuristic method can be directly tested in different market situations to verify their efficiency before their integration into an automated trading system . \n the hard work of obtaining these hedging strategies is left to the computer . \n once this is done , hedging is without sweat .    in the example considered in this paper \n we determine closed - form expressions for the hedging strategy of an option writer with cara utility function under proportional and quadratic transaction costs . \n the price of the underlying follows a geometric brownian motion . \n solutions to this problem with a large range of parameter values are derived at various requirements on the simplicity of hedging strategies , ranging from full - fledged computer programs to short analytic functions . \n parameters include volatility , interest rate , strike price of the european call , and transaction cost parameters . \n information available to the hedger consists of stock price , black - scholes delta and gamma , time to maturity , and current portfolio holdings , in addition to the parameter values which are random but constant until maturity of an option . \n our method produces better results than zakamouline ( 2006 ) when transaction costs are proportional . under \n quadratic transaction costs we find simple near - optimal linear trading strategies that consist of a trade intensity and a no - trade reference solution . \n the no - trade path can be interpreted as a modified black - scholes delta and the trade intensity as a modified gamma . in summary \n , the paper demonstrates the practical use of genetic programming in deriving hedges under nonlinear transaction costs . \n we consider the hedging problem faced by a risk -

500 autonomous sub - populations of hedging strategies deployed on separate worker processors arranged in a circle topology . from time to time , the worker processes send their best program to a master process ; exchange good candidate solutions with their neighbors ; and generate a new set of test options . the master process uses a separate large fixed set of options to identify the current globally best strategy . \n a byte code program representation is used for genetic recombination ( crossover and mutation ) , and a machine code representation ( nordin 1997 ) is used for fast computation of hedging decisions . \n a simple built - in compiler translates byte code to machine code . \n our software also contains a byte code disassembler whose output can be processed by a c compiler , or analyzed with maxima or similar tools for symbolic math manipulation . \n we first apply the genetic programming ( gp ) method to the model with proportional transaction costs ( with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . \n two different treatments will be applied . \n trading strategies are first evolved using the gp approach without any information about the structure of the optimal hedge strategies . we choose to ignore the knowledge that under proportional transaction costs the optimal strategy is defined by a no - trade region because under other cost structures such a priori information is typically not available . in a second treatment , we derive a simple analytic closed - form expression to approximate the no - trade region .      the structure of the hedging strategies is given by . \n strategies are represented as computer programs whose operators include arithmetic expressions as well as _ min _ , _ max _ , conditional assignments , and forward jumps ( conditional and unconditional ) . \n the output from a program is interpreted as a decision of how much stock to buy or sell given the current combination of option parameters and variables . \n the programs can be used as is in an automated trading application , although they may be difficult to analyze due to the occurrence of conditional jumps and assignments . \n [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] provides an illustration of our results for an example option and stock price path . as in figure \n [ fig : tradingpc ] , the left panel depicts trade volumes for each day and each stock position in @xmath54 $ ] for a typical trading strategy evolved with the gp algorithm , but in the this case with quadratic transaction costs . \n the left panel shows that the trade volume is approximately a linear function of the stock position for most stock positions and most periods in time . \n intersecting the graph with the horizontal plane at zero on the vertical axis , one obtains a curve through combinations of time and stock positions where there is no trade , and such that for other nearby points on the graph , the trade volume on the corresponding day is a constant fraction of the difference between the corresponding no - trade position and stock position . \n these observations suggest that linear trading strategies will provide good performance under quadratic transaction costs . \n the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] shows the projection of the no - trade curve ( grey ) along with the gp hedge ( bold black ) , and the delta hedge ( dotted ) . \n also shown is the trade intensity ( black ) , defined as trade volume divided by the absolute difference between the current stock position and the no - trade stock position . \n the latter closely tracks the black - scholes delta . \n the hedging strategy adjusts the stock position towards the no - trade stock position , but this adjustment is quite slow , as the trade intensity is typically less than 20% . \n we therefore observe large deviations between actual stock holdings and the no - trade curve . \n closer to maturity the trade intensity is more volatile but then declines quickly ( resembling the widening of the no - trade region under proportional costs ) . \n this general pattern of sluggish adjustment leads to substantial savings in transaction costs compared to the black - scholes delta .      to explore the performance of linear hedging strategies under quadratic costs , we apply the gp algorithm to trading strategies of the form @xmath55\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the no - trade stock position and \n @xmath57 is the trading intensity , and both are analytic expressions . \n the functions are constrained to be independent of stock holdings but are allowed to depend on time , greeks , and the parameter vector @xmath30 which are suppressed in .    as in the proportional cost case , making use of information about the ( approximate ) structure of the optimal hedge leads to strategies that are slightly better than those obtained without such information . in the current case , the mean improvement in performance amounts to 0.3 cents per option . \n this improvement is of the same order of magnitude as in the proportional cost case , where the a priori information was known to be correct . \n we therefore conjecture that linear strategies of the form ( [ eq : stratqc ] ) are near - optimal for hedgers with cara utility functions and quadratic transaction costs when the initial stock position is not too far from its desired level . \n the following approximation was obtained by means of the same simplification approach as in section  [ sec : prop_notrade ] . \n it produces hedging decisions that perform as well as the best strategy in its class . for a given date @xmath58 , the no - trade stock position @xmath59 and the trading intensity @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 , as before . \n the paper demonstrates the merits of a gp approach to solving optimal hedging problems under transaction costs . \n this heuristic method delivers approximations that are analytic functions of various parameters describing the option contract , the dynamic of the underlying , and transaction costs . \n these explicit approximations to optimal hedging strategies can easily be tested and integrated into an automated trading system . \n other estimation methods , such as zakamouline s ( 2006 ) , derive closed - form approximations using ad hoc specifications of the functional form and an exact ( numerical ) solution for their calibration . \n in contrast to such approaches , ours is both simpler and more general , as it requires neither explicit solutions nor assumptions about functional forms . \n preliminary results indicate that our gp method also works well for exotic options , other nonlinear transaction costs and stochastic volatility models but that is beyond the scope of this short note . \n = 2em = -2em", "StartTimeOffset": 2467520763098, "RequestID": "3e22da2129e7051c9d407589ad266b29c7954362", "TotalTokens": 3494}
{"ContextTokens": 2790, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "small - scale ocean motions have an important effect on oceanic flows several orders of magnitude larger than them . \n the best - known bulk effect of small - scale processes is a substantial contribution to the transport of heat , salt , momentum , and passive tracers in all parts in the world s oceans . \n this effect is usually included in ocean circulation models by modifying the transport and mixing properties of the fluid from their molecular values to larger ones , giving rise to eddy - diffusion approaches of increasing sophistication and predictive power @xcite . \n the transport processes parametrized by these effective changes of the diffusive fluid properties have been shown to control important aspects of the earth s climate @xcite .    beyond eddy diffusion approaches , physical effects of small - scale activity are still poorly understood . \n for this reason , the nature and variability of small - scale oceanic motions have been exhaustively examined in different oceanographic contexts @xcite . \n given the nature of small - scale activity  disordered , fluctuating and turbulent  a contribution to diffusion and dispersion effects is obvious on physical grounds . but a more coherent influence of processes occurring at small - scales on large scales motions is unexpected unless some oceanographic factor is able to get a significant mean component out of the fluctuating behavior . \n bottom topography is one of such factors breaking the symmetry of the fluctuation statistics , and thus provides a dynamical link for energy transfer from the small to the large scale . \n evidence has been accumulated in the last decade showing that mean flows following the topographic contours are often found in the vicinity of topographic features of different scales @xcite . \n these topographically generated currents have been shown to influence both local and global aspects of the earth s climate @xcite . \n for example , large - scale motions related to topographic anomalies have been found in the north and south atlantic playing a major role in determining regional circulation and climatic characteristics @xcite . \n coriolis force , topography and fluctuations have been pointed out as the main ingredients to generate these along - isobaths coherent motions @xcite . \n briefly , coriolis force links topography to the dynamics of ocean vorticity . \n thus changes in ocean depth provide a symmetry breaking factor distinguishing according to their vorticity content otherwise isotropic mesoscale fluctuations . \n the result is that the mean effect of small - scale fluctuations does not average to zero yielding the existence of mean flows . \n finally , the topographic structure determines the circulation patterns of the originated currents .    on the basis of present knowledge , \n anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) tendencies are expected over bumps ( depressions ) for generated mean flows over topography . \n however , [ 1998 ] pointed out that these circulations tendencies could be strongly dependent on the properties of the small - scale variability . \n they theoretically addressed the possibility that the above mentioned circulation pattern could be even reversed ( cyclonic ( anticyclonic ) circulations over bumps ( depressions ) ) by the action of the small scales . \n the same effect is predicted when considering bottom friction instead of viscosity as the damping mechanism @xcite . \n the present letter attempts to elucidate , by means of computer simulations , if the direction of these mean flows is sensitive to the statistical characteristics of the small - scale , as it was argued on theoretical grounds . \n to explore in detail the possible relations between large and small scales in the presence of topography an ideal ocean represented by a single layer of fluid subjected to quasigeostrophic dynamics will be considered . \n baroclinic effects which in real oceans give rise to meso - small scale activity are modeled here by an explicit stochastic forcing with prescribed statistical properties @xcite . \n this term might also be considered as representing any high frequency wind forcing components and other processes below the resolution considered in the numerical model . \n this random forcing , in combination with viscous dissipation , will bring the ocean model to a statistically steady state . while highly idealized , the simplifying modeling assumptions above arise from our interest in isolating just the essential processes by which small - scale variability leads to topography - generated currents .    within our approximations , \n the full ocean dynamics can be described by @xcite :    @xmath0 = \\nu \\nabla^4 \\psi + f \\ , \\ ] ]    the ocean dynamics described by eq . \n ( [ eq ] ) is an f - plane quasigeostrophic model where @xmath1 is the streamfunction , @xmath2 is the above mentioned stochastic vorticity input , @xmath3 is the viscosity parameter and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the coriolis parameter , @xmath6 the mean depth , and @xmath7 the local topographic height over the mean depth . \n the poisson bracket or jacobian is defined as @xmath8= { \\partial a \\over \\partial x } { \\partial b \\over \\partial y } - { \\partial b \\over \\partial x}{\\partial a \\over \\partial y}\\ .\\ ] ]    a set of numerical simulations has been carried out to determine the dependence of the large scale pattern circulation on the structure and variability of the small - scales . \n the description of the numerical model and different parameters employed in the simulations are summarized in appendix a. a randomly generated bottom topography is used in all the cases . as a way of changing in a continuous manner the statistical properties of the forcing @xmath2 we assume it to be a gaussian stochastic process of zero mean , white in time , and spatial spectrum given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wavenumber . \n a positive exponent @xmath11 represents relative - vorticity fluctuations more dominant at the large scales , whereas negative @xmath11 represents fluctuations dominant at the smaller scales . \n the distribution of fluctuation variance among the scales can thus be controlled by varying @xmath11 . \n the spectrum of the energy input corresponding to the above stochastic vorticity forcing is also white in time , with a wavenumber dependence given by the relation @xmath12 . \n we have started first considering a situation where the small - scale variability is described by @xmath13 . \n this power - law has been observed for vorticity forcing induced by winds in the pacific ocean @xcite . \n the model has been integrated until a stationary state is achieved . \n figure 1b shows the mean currents obtained from this specific simulation . in the mean state \n the currents do not average to zero , despite the isotropy of the fluctuations and dissipation . \n instead the final mean state is characterized by the existence of large - scale mean currents strongly correlated with bottom topography . the spatial correlation coefficient between the streamfunction and the bottom topography is for this case @xmath14 . \n this positive spatial correlation implies the existence of mean anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) circulations over bumps ( depressions ) . as a next step , \n we have modeled the action of small - scales as a noisy process with a correlation described by the power - law @xmath15 . \n this spectrum describes a situation where the small - scale variability is more energetic than the one induced by the previous @xmath16 power - law . \n the response of the system is drastically changed by this small - scale activity . as shown in figure 1c \n the mean state of the ocean displays a pattern of circulation practically uncorrelated with bottom topography . \n specifically , the spatial correlation coefficient is @xmath17 . \n increasing again the exponent of the power law to @xmath18 , we obtain the generation of mean currents anticorrelated with bottom topography , as it can be observed from figure 1d . \n the spatial correlation coefficient is @xmath19 in this case of high small - scale activity , indicating the existence of mean cyclonic ( anticyclonic ) motions over bumps ( depressions ) . \n note that figures 1c and d display topography - generated currents much weaker than those obtained for the @xmath16 power - law case , figure 1b . \n this feature comes from the scale - selective character of the viscosity , more efficient at small scales where the forcing energy is most localized in the @xmath15 and @xmath20 cases . besides this effect \n , it should also be mentioned that forcing with a @xmath16 spectral power - law directly provides more energy input to the large - scale components than the @xmath15 and @xmath20 forcings . \n additional numerical simulations , for different initial conditions and noise and topography realizations , consistently confirm the results of the simulations presented in fig .  1 , that is the sensibility of the large - scale circulations not only to the particular structure of the underlying topography but also to the characteristics of the small - scale variability of the environment . \n in particular , as the small - scale content in the vorticity forcing is augmented with respect to the large - scale one , mean currents are always seen to reverse direction . \n on the basis of the property of potential - vorticity conservation , anticyclonic ( cyclonic ) motions are traditionally expected over topographic bumps ( depressions ) @xcite . \n if potential vorticity is not preserved because of the presence of some kind of forcing mechanism , then different circulation patterns can be generated . \n small - scale activity constitutes a systematic and persistent forcing of the circulation in the whole ocean . due to the relatively small and fast space and time scales that characterize this variability , \n the physical characteristics of this forcing are usually described in terms of their statistical properties @xcite . in other words , \n small - scale activity can be considered as a fluctuating background in which the large - scale motions are embedded . \n the relevance of the role played by this fluctuating environment in modifying the transport and viscous properties of the large scales is widely recognized . beyond these diffusive and viscous effect of the small - scale activity , \n the numerical results presented in this letter show that in the presence of bottom topography , statistical details of the variability of the small - scales can induce different large - scale oceanic circulations . \n the strength of this effect will be affected by the spectral characteristics of the topographic and forcing fields as well as by the real baroclinic nature of the ocean . \n preliminary computer simulations indicate that the strength of the mean currents increases when the topography contains more proportion of large - scale features . \n this effect and the dependence of the current direction on the forcing spectral exponent , presented in fig . \n 1 , nicely validates the theoretical results in @xcite . \n extension of the theoretical methods to the baroclinic case is in progress . \n however , a complete analysis of the influence of different forcings and topography shapes can only be addressed numerically . \n the shape of the topography was already shown to play a fundamental role in the energy transfer between different scales in baroclinic quasigeostrophic turbulence @xcite . \n finally , the results shown in this letter stress the need for a better observational characterization of the space and time variability of oceans at small - scales in order to achieve a complete understanding of the large - scale ocean circulation . \n numerical simulations of eq . \n ( [ eq ] ) have been conducted in a parameter regime of geophysical interest . \n a value of @xmath21 was chosen as appropriate for the coriolis effect at mean latitudes on earth and @xmath22 for the viscosity , a value usual for the eddy viscosity in ocean models . \n we use the numerical scheme developed in [ 1992 ] on a grid of @xmath23 points . \n the distance between grid points corresponds to 20 km , so that the total system size is @xmath24 km . \n the algorithm , based on arakawa finite differences and the leap - frog algorithm , keeps the value of energy and enstrophy constant when it is run in the inviscid and unforced case . \n the consistent way of introducing the stochastic term into the leap - frog scheme can be found in [ 1997 ] . \n the amplitude of the forcing has been chosen in order to obtain final velocities of several centimeters per second . \n the topographic field is randomly generated from a isotropic spectrum containing , with equal amplitude and random phases , all the fourier modes corresponding to scales between 80 km and 300 km . \n the model was run for @xmath25 time steps ( corresponding to 206 years ) after a statistically stationary state was reached . \n the streamfunction is then averaged during this last interval of time .    financial support from cicyt ( amb95 -

{"ContextTokens": 3785, "GeneratedTokens": 147, "SynthesizedBody": "radio - frequency modulation allows the frequency precision of a stabilised laser to be coherently translated to adjacent wavelengths , and pairs of optical frequencies to be generated with low differential frequency noise . \n when achieved by electro - optic modulation , or direct modulation of the current through a diode laser , however , the different frequencies continue to propagate in the same beam mode \n . spatial separation hence requires a frequency - dependent transmission or deflection . \n a commonly - used device for this is the mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) : with an appropriate path difference within the device , the sidebands emerge from one output port and the carrier from the other . for certain wavelengths , \n a similar effect can be achieved by employing the frequency - dependent faraday effect in an atomic vapour @xcite . \n mach - zehnder interferometers find applications as filters and frequency - dependent beam - splitters and combiners @xcite for a variety of applications in optics @xcite , metrology @xcite and quantum information @xcite . \n fiber - optic interferometers offer several advantages over free - space devices , such as improved output beam quality , easier integrability with other fiber - optic systems , lower sensitivity to vibrations and air currents , and a generally higher extinction ratio thanks to the ease and accuracy with which the beams may be recombined . \n previous applications have included passively - stable microscopic devices for refractive index measurement @xcite , interferometers that intentionally remain unstabilised for sensing purposes @xcite , and devices that have been actively stabilised by dithering @xcite or locking to the side of an interference fringe @xcite . \n polarization - dependent methods such as hnsch  couillaud locking , which we have previously used to stabilise a free space interferometer @xcite , can not easily be applied to fiber - optic devices because of the high temperature - dependence of the birefringence upon which polarization - maintaining fibers depend . here , we demonstrate a similarly robust alternative stabilisation method that is suitable for fiber - based interferometers , using a convenient variation of frequency - modulation stabilisation @xcite . \n the stabilisation of an interferometer to maximize or minimize the transmission at a given wavelength presents the difficulty that a deviation to either side of the optimum configuration has the same effect upon the transmitted intensity ; this parameter itself therefore gives no indication of the sign of the correction required . \n one solution is to perturb the interferometer in a slow , periodic ` dither ' and monitor the relative phase of variation of the transmitted intensity . \n a popular alternative is to accept a small offset and stabilise the transmitted intensity to a value just below its peak or above its minimum . in both cases , \n being near a turning point in the measured parameter , the interferometer must be significantly perturbed or displaced for a measurable signal to be obtained . \n a more elegant technique , commonly used for the spectroscopic stabilisation of lasers and optical resonators , is to generate sidebands at frequencies either side of the wavelength required and measure the differential effect upon these components . \n in contrast to the large , slow perturbations of a dither , these components may be generated by the weak but rapid variations of frequency or phase modulation . \n the system remains in its stabilised configuration , and most of the optical power remains at the desired wavelength . \n phase - sensitive detection of the beat note in the transmitted intensity then yields the error signal directly @xcite .    here , partly for practical expedience and to avoid parasitic amplitude modulation \n , we use a variation upon conventional frequency modulation stabilisation and generate the sidebands by acousto - optic modulation of a fraction of the incident light , which we then direct backwards through the interferometer via the spare output port of the instrument . where true frequency modulation uses beating of the sidebands with the carrier to provide a periodic alternation between the two sidebands \n , we achieve this directly by using a suitably aligned chopper wheel : although somewhat inelegant , this approach allows a large sideband spacing while requiring only low frequency detection circuitry . \n the derived error signal is used to control the temperature , and hence refractive index , of one arm of the interferometer via a thermoelectric cooler ( tec ) upon which one of the fibers is mounted ; it would alternatively be possible to stretch the fiber using a piezoelectric actuator , as in @xcite . \n our apparatus is shown schematically in figure [ mzisetup ] . \n the mach - zehnder interferometer is a custom device , supplied by ozoptics @xcite , with internal fiber arms 0.3  m long , one of which is attached to a thermoelectric cooler to regulate its temperature . \n an incident laser beam with frequency @xmath0 , bearing sidebands at @xmath1  2.7 ghz , is directed into port a of the mach - zehnder interferometer ; the sidebands are intended to emerge from port d , while the rejected carrier should be sent to port c. a fraction of the incident beam is split off from the main path and sent to the acousto - optic modulator , which produces two spatially distinct beams with frequencies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 80  mhz . \n these are alternately fed backwards through the interferometer to the photodiode pd1 . using an indication of the chopper wheel phase provided by pd3 \n , a microcontroller determines the error signal , which is proportional to the difference in transmitted intensity between the two aom beams , and adjusts the current supplied to the thermoelectric cooler accordingly . \n the error signal is given theoretically as follows . \n if the fiber lengths within the instrument are @xmath4 , and the fibers have a frequency - dependent refractive index @xmath5 ( including waveguide dispersion ) , then the accrued phase difference @xmath6 between the two paths will be    @xmath7    and the difference in phase difference @xmath8 between optical frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath9 will hence be    @xmath10,\\ ] ]    which may be expanded , assuming constant dispersion , to give    @xmath11   = \\frac{\\delta l \\omega_m}{c } \\left[\\eta(\\omega_0 ) + \\omega_0 \\frac{d\\eta}{d\\omega}\\right ]   = \\frac{\\pi \\omega_m}{\\omega_s } ,   \\label{disp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the difference between frequencies that will be separated by the interferometer and is given by    @xmath13}.   \\label{omegas}\\ ] ]    the fraction of light transmitted between diagonally opposite ports of the interferometer will then be proportional to @xmath14 , and the error signal will hence be proportional to    @xmath15    where @xmath16 as defined in equation ( [ disp ] ) above.the form of the error signal @xmath17 is hence given by    @xmath18    this is equal to zero and has finite gradient at both @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n it is therefore suitable for stabilising the interferometer to maximize transmission of the carrier to either output port according to the sign of the feedback @xcite . \n a plot of this signal as a function of the frequency of the input beam is shown in figure [ theoplot ] . \n the separation of two closely spaced frequency components of a phase - modulated laser beam is a function that is often required in atomic physics experiments @xcite and laser stabilisation schemes @xcite . for our atomic physics experiments , for example , in which we stimulate raman transitions between the ground hyperfine states of @xmath21rb , \n we modulate a 780  nm laser beam by passage through a 2.7  ghz electro - optic phase modulator ( the remaining 300  mhz being provided by subsequent acousto - optic modulation ) , giving the spectrum shown in figure [ sidebandplot](a ) , in which @xmath2215% of the power is split between the two first - order sidebands . for use in our experiments \n the central carrier must be largely eliminated . \n many previous solutions incur a significant power loss @xcite or offer only a limited extinction ratio @xcite . \n the mach - zehnder interferometer allows the efficient separation of components that differ in frequency by an odd multiple of @xmath12 , defined in equation ( [ omegas ] ) . with an optical path difference @xmath23 specified for our device as 56.0@xmath10.5  mm , @xmath12 = 2.7  ghz , and we may reject the carrier and send only the sidebands to the chosen output port of our interferometer , resulting in the spectrum shown in figure [ sidebandplot](b ) , in which the carrier has been suppressed by over 30 db through interferometric means . \n in addition to this , the carrier and sidebands are both attenuated by @xmath224  db by passage through the interferometer , owing to the poor beam quality of the incident light which limited the coupling efficiency into the interferometer . \n although a path difference tolerance was specified for the practical device , no measurable difference was found between the positions of minimum carrier transmission and maximum transmission of the first - order sidebands . \n mhz relative to the carrier . \n interferometric suppression of the carrier is in excess of 30  db . ]      the system in figure [ mzisetup ] was constructed and the signals from each photodiode were sent to a simple digital control system based around an arduino microcontroller @xcite . \n the interferometer itself was constructed to our specifications by ozoptics @xcite , with the inter - arm path difference set such that @xmath24 2.7  ghz . \n although our specifications allowed small inequalities in power division at the beamsplitters , we in practice observe no measurable effects . with the input at port a and a constant total laser power \n , the signal from photodiode pd2 can be used to derive the proportion @xmath25 of the optical power emerging from the interferometer s outputs that leaves via port d. equal powers must be coupled into the interferometer from each of the frequency - shifted beams entering port c ; failure to do so results in narrowing of the locking region and a slight alteration of the lock point . \n figure [ errvstransplot ] shows the variation of the power transmission @xmath25 and the error signal @xmath26 during a rapid scan of the inter - arm path difference in the interferometer , performed by making a sudden change to the current supplied to the tec . \n the error signal not only exhibits a zero value corresponding with each minimum of @xmath25 , but also the desired antisymmetric form about these points .     from port a to port d , and error signal @xmath26 , shown as functions of time during a rapid scan of the interferometer over several fringes . \n the noise on the error signal is primarily electrical in origin . ] \n the power transmission @xmath25 was recorded for a period in excess of 2 hours , during which the interferometer was actively locked to a minimum of @xmath25 ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) . \n fast fourier transforms of @xmath28 , over both this period and another period of equal length during which the interferometer was left unstabilised , are shown in figure [ fft ] . \n the time - average of @xmath25 during this period was @xmath29 ( corresponding to an interferometric extinction of 32.0  db ) . \n we believe this to have been limited by the response rate of our feedback system , as measurably non - zero values of @xmath25 were generally accompanied by a notable deviation of the error signal from zero . \n extinction could therefore be improved by increasing the response rate of the feedback system , for example by replacing the tec with a fiber - stretching piezoelectric transducer , as in @xcite . \n we have demonstrated a stable locking method for a fiber - optic mach - zehnder interferometer with a macroscopic inter - arm path difference . our device allowed the time -

3 years of the lhc operation ) . \n the possibility of detection at lhc of a heavy right - handed neutrino @xmath6 considered in the framework of the left - right symmetric model @xmath7 @xcite has been discussed in ref . \n @xcite ( see also related papers @xcite ) \n . the corresponding production reactions could be @xmath26 @xmath27    we studied the production and detection in cms of such @xmath7 heavy neutrino mixed with ordinary neutrinos . \n the production reaction is @xmath8 , the heavy neutrino decay channel being the same as for @xmath13 . \n the cms discovery potential in this case is expressed in terms of the @xmath28 region , in which the discovery is possible . \n in our simulations we used pythia 6.152 @xcite , modified for the simulation of signal events . \n the dependence of the signal cross section on the heavy neutrino mass is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cs ] . \n the cms fast detector simulation program cmsjet 4.703 @xcite was used . \n the following cuts on the transverse momentum were applied : 20 @xmath5 for electrons and muons , 40 @xmath5 for jets . \n lower cut for muons , which is default in cmsjet , does not improve the sensitivity . \n the isolation of leptons in the calorimeter was determined using the cone radius 0.3 and allowing maximal @xmath29 of 5 @xmath5 in the cone ( the cmsjet default ) . \n in our analysis we proceeded through the following steps :    * events with 2 isolated leptons of the same flavour and opposite signs were selected . \n events with more than 2 leptons were rejected . \n the invariant mass @xmath30 of these two leptons is the first candidate event variable . * \n events with at least 2 jets were selected . from all jets a pair with invariant mass @xmath31 closest to the mass of the w boson was chosen . \n @xmath32 is the second variable . \n * from the 4-momenta of these two jets and the 4-momentum of a lepton the invariant mass @xmath33 is calculated . \n a peak in the distribution of this mass is to be searched for ( fig . \n [ fig : sign300 ] ) . * \n the @xmath34 of an event is the last variable of our analysis . \n the @xmath35 production is the obvious source of background events . they were simulated with standard pythia with lepton decay modes of @xmath23 and hadron decay modes of @xmath24 forbidden . \n the variable @xmath30 was used to suppress this kind of background . in ref \n @xcite events with @xmath30 close to the @xmath24 mass central value were rejected . however , the tail of the @xmath24 mass distribution is rather long . at the same time the signal events usually have big @xmath30 ( fig . \n [ fig : sign300 ] ) . for this reason \n there was simply a lower cut on @xmath30 at values well above the @xmath24 mass central value . \n the @xmath36 production turned out to be one of the most dangerous backgrounds . \n the first estimates were made with pythia , but the final ones , used in the sensitivity estimations , with toprex @xcite . \n this program correctly takes into account the spin correlations between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 and uses tauola code for @xmath39 decays . \n toprex gives @xmath40 smaller number of initial ( with loose cuts ) candidate events than pythia . \n only leptonic @xmath23 decay modes were allowed ( including @xmath41 ) . \n it was checked that other decay modes do not contribute . \n one of the most powerful cuts for the rejection of this background is the upper @xmath34 cut ( fig . \n [ fig : etcut ] ) . \n another dangerous background is the @xmath42 production . \n this process has a large cross section and requires a lot of simulation with pythia . in order to reduce the required cpu time only events with \n @xmath43 were simulated . \n it was checked with loose cuts that the above cut does not change the estimated number of background events for a given luminosity . \n this background is suppressed by the same cut as the @xmath35 production and by the @xmath44 cuts on leptons and jets . in fig .  [ \n fig : mzcut ] one can see the long tail of the @xmath24 invariant mass in this background process and how the @xmath30 is used for its suppression . \n the other possible sources of background are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 productions . in our calculations we took @xmath47 . however , the cross sections are small and this background is not dangerous .    in fig . \n [ fig : figcms ] the distribution of candidate event invariant masses expected in cms with @xmath48 is shown , assuming a 300 @xmath5 heavy neutrino mixed with @xmath49 with electron or muon neutrino . \n the only found sources of events with same sign leptons that could be a background to the production of heavy majorana neutrino are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 productions . due to small cross section of these processes \n the search for majorana neutrino is almost a background - free search . \n for each value of @xmath50 a probability @xmath51 of signal events to pass all cuts and to have @xmath33 in some range around @xmath50 ( `` good events '' ) was calculated . \n the total number of background events passing the same cuts and having @xmath33 in the same range was calculated for a given luminosity . the sensitivity and the discovery potential of the cms experiment to the search for heavy isosinglet neutrino \n has been estimated using the method of ref . \n @xcite . using the efficiency @xmath51 the sensitivity in terms of cross section was calculated . \n this cross section divided by the cross section for the maximal mixing strength @xmath52 gives a limit in terms of a mixing strength . \n for each value of @xmath50 the cuts and the @xmath33 range were optimized to obtain the best sensitivity . \n the 95% c.l . \n sensitivity as a function of @xmath50 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : sensit ] . within 10% \n it is the same for both the cases of mixing with an electron and muon neutrino . \n the cms @xmath53 discovery potential estimated by the same method is shown in fig . \n [ fig : sensitbk ] .    the cms sensitivity to the heavy neutrino production violating lepton number ( majorana case ) \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig : sensitss ] and the cms discovery potential in fig . \n [ fig : sensitss5s ] . \n here we assumed that 50% of heavy neutrinos decay with lepton number violation that leads to same sign lepton pairs . \n it is almost zero background search . \n some background events were found in the @xmath46 sample , but their contribution is very small due to low cross section . \n events with our signature and same sign leptons can be produced in the chain decays of @xmath54 , one lepton being produced at the first step , in the @xmath37 or @xmath38 decay , and another at the second step , in a b meson decay ( here @xmath55 oscillations should be taken into account ) . \n however , this background is strongly suppressed by the requirement of isolation in combination with a lepton @xmath44 cut and by the cut on the missing @xmath29 . \n another scenario with a heavy neutrino was proposed in @xcite . in this scenario \n the heavy neutrino @xmath6 can be produced through its coupling with the heavy @xmath56 boson , the latter being coupled with quarks and three heavy neutrinos @xmath6 . \n one of the @xmath6 neutrinos is relatively light ( a few hundred @xmath5 ) and can decay through its mixing with @xmath3 or @xmath4 , other @xmath6 are very heavy . \n we assumed that the lightest @xmath6 is @xmath57 . \n we checked that the results with @xmath58 being the lightest do not differ much . in this scenario \n we have to look for a heavy majorana neutrino producing same sign leptons . in fig . \n [ fig : cswr ] the cross sections for different masses of @xmath56 are shown . \n they do nt depend on the heavy neutrino mixing parameters . \n we do nt study @xmath56 masses below 1500 @xmath5 , assuming that they are excluded by indirect analyses @xcite .    in ref . \n @xcite the @xmath54 production was found to be the most dangerous background . \n the level of this background was plotted as a function of the lepton @xmath44 cut and was not yet zero with a 20 @xmath5 cut . however , in that work the missing @xmath29 cut was not used . in our study \n this cut kills the @xmath54 events survived after lepton isolation cuts and the lepton @xmath44 cut . \n in this paper we presented the results of our study of a possibility to detect the heavy isosinglet neutrino @xmath13 at lhc in the cms detector . in the first part of our study we assumed only the nonzero mixing of this neutrino with @xmath3 or @xmath4 neutrinos . \n we found that it is possible to detect sterile neutrinos with masses up to 800 @xmath5 ( for the masses near this value and above it a mixing @xmath59 sufficient for the detection becomes unrealistically high ) . in the second part we assumed the existence of additional interaction with a participation of a heavy neutrino , namely the @xmath60 model with a heavy @xmath56 boson @xcite . \n we assumed also that this heavy neutrino @xmath6 is mixed with ordinary neutrinos @xmath3 or @xmath4 , that makes possible the same decay mode as for @xmath13 . \n we found that for @xmath9 it is possible to discover in cms the heavy neutrino @xmath6 ( l is electron or muon ) with a mass up to 1500 @xmath5 . \n we are grateful to s. slabospitsky for his help in the work with the program toprex and for useful discussions . \n we are indebted to the participants of daniel denegri seminar on physics simulation at lhc for useful comments \n .    9 s.l . \n glashow , nucl . \n *

{"ContextTokens": 2901, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "ultrarelativistic charged hadrons ( protons or nuclei ) give rise to strong electromagnetic fields . consequently , in hadronic collisions at the lhc , the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron or can interact directly with the other hadron @xcite . \n the study of these photon - photon and photon - hadron interactions offers a unique opportunity to study fundamental aspects of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n in particular , the two - photon particle production have been extensively discussed in literature ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs . \n @xcite ) , with a recent revival of interest due to the experimental results on the exclusive two - photon production of @xmath0 and @xmath4 pairs by @xmath5 interactions reported by the cms collaboration @xcite . \n the observation of these processes demonstrated the feasibility of measuring such events within the current experimental apparatus available at the lhc , allowing novel studies of qcd at very high energies and searches for beyond standard model physics ( see , e.g. , ref . \n @xcite ) . \n the basic ingredient in the analysis of the photon - induced processes is the description of the equivalent photon distribution of the hadron , given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of the hadron energy carried by the photon and @xmath8 has to be identified with a momentum scale of the process . \n the equivalent photon approximation of a charged pointlike fermion was formulated many years ago by fermi @xcite and developed by williams @xcite and weizsacker @xcite . \n in contrast , the calculation of the photon distribution of the hadrons still is a subject of debate , due to the fact that they are not pointlike particles . in this case \n it is necessary to distinguish between the elastic and inelastic components . \n the elastic component , @xmath9 , can be estimated analysing the transition @xmath10 taking into account the effects of the hadronic form factors , with the hadron remaining intact in the final state @xcite . \n in contrast , the inelastic contribution , @xmath11 , is associated to the transition @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and can be estimated taking into account the partonic structure of the hadrons , which can be a source of photons ( see , e.g. refs . \n @xcite ) .    in a recent paper \n @xcite we have proposed , for the first time , the study of the diffractive quarkonium photoproduction in @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies as a probe of the photon distribution of the proton . \n our results indicated that , for the models considered , the contribution of the inelastic processes is of the same order or larger than the elastic one , with the predictions for the rapidity distributions being largely different , which makes the experimental discrimination feasible , with the detection of the two protons into the final state being indispensable to separate the inelastic and elastic events . \n our goal in this paper is to extend our previous analysis for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production by two - photon interactions in @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies ( for related studies see refs . \n our study is strongly motivated by the recent results reported by the cms collaboration , which shows that the experimental technique currently applied allows the measurement of the two - photon production of pairs with large invariant mass in a scenario with non - negligible pileup @xcite , and by the perspective of setup of forward detectors by the cms and totem collaborations @xcite , which will enhance the kinematic coverage for such investigations , bringing more data to elucidate the proper model for the photon . \n it is important to emphasize that the uncertainty present on the current measurements is an important aspect regarding the observation of rare processes that have not been measured in laboratory , like the exclusive production of photon pairs in @xmath2 , @xmath14pb and pbpb collisions , with predictions presented for the first time in ref . \n then , the study of the different approaches for the photon flux is important to provide accurate predictions to be compared with data . in this sense , \n the purpose of this paper is to investigate the available approaches for the two - photon processes in @xmath2 collisions and to determine the regions of the phase space that allow the discrimination among these possible models . \n this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism for the two - photon particle production and discuss the different models for the photon flux . in section [ sec : res ] \n , we present our results for the effective photon - photon luminosities and for the two - photon @xmath0 and @xmath1 differential cross sections . \n finally , in section  [ sec : sum ] we summarize our main conclusions . \n following ref .  @xcite we will write the cross sections for the @xmath3 production of a final state @xmath15 @xmath16 or @xmath17 of invariant mass @xmath18 in a factorized form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cross section for the hard subprocess @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the effective photon - photon luminosity for the production of the system @xmath15 at rapidity @xmath23 . \n the effective luminosity is given in terms of the photon distribution of the incident hadrons as follows @xmath24 the photon distribution of a nucleon consist of two parts : the elastic and inelastic components . \n in the elastic case , we have the coherent emission of photons from the hadron , without the dissociation of the incident hadron . \n in contrast , in the inelastic case the photons are emitted by the quarks and antiquarks present in the hadrons , and the incident hadron is excited in a low - mass state . \n consequently , we can define three different classes of @xmath3 events : ( a ) the _ elastic _ processes , where the final state @xmath15 is produced with the two incident hadrons remaining intact , and the effective luminosity is proportional to @xmath25 ; ( b ) the _ semielastic _ processes , where one of the incident hadrons remain intact and the other dissociates , with @xmath26 $ ] and ( c ) _ inelastic _ processes , where the two incident hadrons dissociates and @xmath27 . \n these three classes are represented in fig . \n [ diagrams ] . in all these processes \n , the final state will be characterized by the presence of the state @xmath15 and two rapidity gaps , with the hadrons or the low - mass hadron beam fragments traveling in the beam direction ( for related studies see , e.g. ref . \n @xcite ) .    in principle \n , these different processes can be separated by the tagging of the two very forward scattered hadrons and by the requirement of the presence of large rapidities gaps in the central detector . \n unfortunately , forward detectors were not available during run i of the lhc , and the next run starting in 2015 is going to produce a sizable pile - up obliterating the observation of rapidity gaps . \n therefore , experimental separation of those contributions is a hard task and demands better knowledge of final - state kinematics in an observed event . in run \n i , the cms collaboration have separated the signal of two - photon production of pairs ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) by selecting lepton tracks from the information recorded in the tracking system , which can be used to analyze exclusive events even in a scenario with large number of interaction per bunch crossing ( high pileup ) . \n offline , events have been selected with no additional tracks associated to the @xmath28 vertex . since both elastic and non - elastic processes contribute in this case , \n we have higher photon luminosities , although larger uncertainties in the theoretical predictions , due to the lesser theoretically controlled inelastic photon flux ( see below ) . \n currently , there is a great expectation due to the installation of the cms - totem precision proton spectrometer ( ct - pps ) @xcite , which will be setup in a first stage in one of the cms sides at about 200 metres from the interaction point . \n certainly , this new detector will improve the analysis of exclusive processes and allow us to access a variety of physics topics at high luminosities . \n however , a precise determination of the semielastic contribution will be still fundamental before the search of new physics in two - photon processes .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      ( color online ) upper panels : ratio between the sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections and the elastic cross section ; lower panels : ratio between the inelastic cross section and sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections . ] \n in this paper we have investigated the contribution of inelastic , semielastic and elastic processes for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production by two - photon interactions in @xmath2 collisions considering different models for the inelastic photon distribution . \n we demonstrated that these distinct models implies very distinct behaviours for the effective photon - photon luminosities and differential cross sections . \n it implies that the use of the two - photon particle production mechanism to search rare events will be not a easy task before the determination of the correct description of the inelastic photon distribution . \n in particular , since in a first moment only one of the very forward detectors of ct - pps will be installed , which would not eliminate the semielastic processes . \n our results indicate that the analysis of the rapidity distribution for @xmath1 production can be a discriminator among the possible models for the photon distribution . \n in particular , the determination of the distribution for central rapidities already differentiate the distinct models . \n moreover , the analysis of the invariant mass dependence of the ratio between the sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections and the elastic one also can be used to determinate the inelastic photon distribution . finally , we believe that the analyses carried out with the data of the two - photon production of pairs , in conjunction with the exclusive vector meson production discussed in ref . \n @xcite , will allow us to precisely determine the adequate description of the photon distribution , which still is an important open question in high energy physics . \n this work has been supported by cnpq , capes and fapergs , brazil . \n g. baur , k. hencken , d. trautmann , s. sadovsky , y. kharlov , phys . \n rep . * 364 * , 359 ( 2002 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves and m.  v.  t.  machado , mod . \n a * 19 * , 2525 ( 2004 ) ; c.  a. bertulani , s.  r.  klein and j.  nystrand , ann . \n nucl . part . \n sci . * 55 * , 271 ( 2005 ) ; k.  hencken _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rept .   * 458 * , 1 ( 2008 ) . \n j.  de favereau de jeneret , v.  lemaitre , y.  liu , s.  ovyn , t.  pierzchala , k.  piotrzkowski , x.  rouby and n.  schul _ et al . \n _ , arxiv:0908.2020 [ hep - ph ] ; s.  atag , s.  c.  inan and i.  sahin , jhep * 1009 * , 042 ( 2010 ) ; s.  c.  inan , phys . \n d * 81 * , 115002 ( 2010 ) ; e.  chapon , c.  royon and o.  kepka , phys . \n d * 81 * , 074003 ( 2010 ) ; r.  s.  gupta , phys . \n d * 85 * , 014006 ( 2012 ) ; h.  sun , eur . \n j.  c * 74 * , no . 8 , 2977 ( 2014 ) ; p.  lebiedowicz , r.  pasechnik and a.  szczurek , nucl . \n b * 881 * , 288 ( 2014 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves , w.  k.  sauter and m.  thiel , phys . \n d * 89 * , 076003 ( 2014 ) ; p.  lebiedowicz and a.  szczurek , phys . \n d * 91 * , no . \n 9 , 095008 ( 2015 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves and w.  k.  sauter , phys . \n d * 91 * , 035004 ( 2015 ) ; s.  fichet , g.  von gersdorff , b.  lenzi , c.  royon and m.  saimpert , jhep * 1502 * , 165 ( 2015 ) .                                        j.  ohnemus , t.  f.  walsh and p.  m.  zerwas , phys \n .  lett . \n b * 328 * , 369 ( 1994 ) ; g.  bhattacharya , p.  kalyniak and k.  a.  peterson , phys . \n d * 53 * , 2371 ( 1996 ) ; d.  denterria and j.  p.  lansberg , phys . \n d * 81 * , 014004 ( 2010 )", "StartTimeOffset": 2606579957014, "RequestID": "b4557750529e614a08f191c15d7e92284563df9f", "TotalTokens": 3127}
{"ContextTokens": 2701, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "with the quickly development of nano technology , the scale of electrical devices becoming smaller and smaller , and the ability of single nano machine is very limited due to its size , therefore , sharing information among nano machines is good for the use of single nano machine through the connection of them , which organise the nano network . achieving the communication of nano machines has two main ways which are nano electrical communication through carbon nanotubes and molecular communication through information molecules . among them , molecular communication(mc ) is the most potential way to achieve , which relies on the bio - inspired method and fits for the biological environment . \n + at the open space of biological environment , the three dimensional space is fit for molecular communication@xcite to model channel . in mahfuz \n et al s articles , they elaborated on the spatiotemporal distribution of information messages under the binary concentration - encoded modulate methods . \n mahfuz s researches have a great impact on the study of molecular communication , which gives us a new modulate methods . \n for the binary concentration - encoded modulate methods , it s much fit for the biological environment , and without considering the inner structures of the molecules . \n also in akan s paper , he studied the ligand and receptor process of molecular communication , in order to study the details of how molecules bind with the receptors , which is based on the binary concentration - encoded modulate methods . \n + all of their works help us understand the molecular communication clearly . \n as we know in molecular communication different modulation methods or different transportation environment can make different channel . \n most studies are based on the three dimensional environmental , and fews are concentrate on the one dimensional environment . \n comparing with the three dimensional , one dimensional can make sure the receiver receive all the information molecules for a long time , and the one dimensional situation is simple enough , therefore , it is worth for us to study it and it has a wealth of applications . \n for instance , in nariman s molecular communication test - bed , which is studied based on the one dimensional environment . also in extremely tiny pipe , the transmitter and receiver nano machines on sides of the pipe can regard as in the same line . additionally , \n when transmitter and receiver nano machines are in extremely small distance , we can consider they are in one dimensional environment . \n + in this paper , we mainly considered in the tiny slim pipe , how the continuous information molecules are transmitted . and how the information transmission is affected by the transmission frequency and the distance of transmitter and receiver . \n the study can help us know how the frequency affect the communication between nano machines . also can help us to place the nano machines in the future . \n + the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec_mc_model ] , we produced a molecular comunication model ; in section [ sec_sample_threshold ] we introduced the sample method and the threshold of the receiver ; in section [ sec_analysis ] , we analyzed some parameters which affect the model ; in section [ sec_conclusion ] , we make a conclusion of our work . \n we model a communication system composed of a pair of devices which are connected by an extremely slim pipe , each called a nanonetworking - enabled node(nen , ie . \n , nano node or nano robot)@xcite . \n the communication system is described as fig.[fig_mc_model ] . in molecular communication via diffusion(mcvd ) , the nens communicate with each other through the propagation of certain molecules via diffusion@xcite . \n the tn transmits the encoded information molecules in the propagation medium , the communication phase being known as the sending phase . \n the transmitted molecules propageated by the channel , the bind with the rn , which is known as the ligand - receptor binding@xcite . \n since the tn and rn nano machine are connected by the extremely slim pipe , surely , we can consider the tn and rn in the one dimensional environment , then we can study its spatiotemporal distribution of signal strength in one dimensional environment . \n the emission of information can be an instantaneous or a continuous emission . \n as the instantaneous release of information molecules , in a single puff , would be ideal design for communications requiring rapid fade - out . \n on the other hand , the source emitting message molecules continuously at a constant rate , to some extent might be useful for status telemetry , navigational beacons or periodic sampling monitors@xcite . in this paper \n we regard the emission is continuous . \n + the spatiotemporal distribution of molecules transmitted by the tn that will be available at rn is calculated by the well - known roberts equation explained in @xcite . \n we assume that a point source type tn continuously emitting molecules at a rate @xmath0 molecules per second , x is taken as the distance down the pipe from the source , @xmath1 is the cross -

off modulation method to transmit information . by transmit 1 bit , the tn will emitting a quantity of molecules @xmath8 , and transmit 0 bit , the tn will emitting nothing to the channel . \n we utilize @xmath9 stands fot the emitting frequency of tn , and @xmath10 is the emitting period . in the emitting period , we can emitting molecules continuously , or transmitting nothing as described in eq.[equation_on_off ] or fig.[fig_on_off_modulation ] . \n in this paper , we regard @xmath0 as a constant value @xmath12 which is the average molecules in the emitting period . \n as aforementioned we transmit `` 1 '' when emitting a quantity of molecules , and transmit `` 0 '' when emitting nothing . \n in this situation , the distance between tn and rn is x , as fig.[fig_single_duration_spray ] describes , we try to transmit bit sequences `` 10110 '' . \n when molecules were transmitted to the receiver(rn ) , the rn needs to decide the information is `` 1 '' or `` 0 . \n therefore , we need to set a threshold for the receiver , by comparing the available information molecules(aim ) to the threshold , we can know the information is ' ' 1 `` if the aim is great or equal than the threshold , and in vice versa , the information is ' ' 0 \" . in the rn side , it s no need to sample the value of aim for each time instant , according to the nyquist \n shannon sampling theorem , we can get the sampling value at time instant of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the length of the bit information , we only need to compare the @xmath14 to the threshold . in fig.[fig_single_duration_spray ] , the red arrow is the sampling instant , and the interference is the noise information molecules from the previous molecules informations , in this paper , for a simple description , we only need to consider one bit information of the previous information molecules . \n in this section , we study how the distance and emitting frequency affect the transmission under the environment of air medium . and at last \n , we do the simulation to testify the difference of information transmission in one dimensional(1-d ) situation and three dimensional(3-d ) situation . in this section , \n we only transmit two bit information `` 10 '' , for it can help us analysis the aim in the first bit `` 1 '' , and interference in the second bit `` 0 '' . \n we assume that the @xmath12 is 10000 molecules / sec , @xmath16 is 30@xmath17 , the diffusion coefficient in air medium is @xmath18=0.43@xmath19 , we utilize the model in eq.[equation_spatiotemporal_1d ] to do the simulation at different distances , such as @xmath3 are 0.05@xmath20,1@xmath20,10@xmath20 respectively .    through the fig.[fig_distance_varies ] , we find that with the increase of distance between tn an rn , the aim in the rn side is become smaller and smaller , but the interference is becoming larger and larger . \n therefore , we need to set the distance at short distance , in order to transmit enough information molecules , and improve the probability of successful information transmission .      assuming that the @xmath12 is 10000 molecules / sec , \n the distance between tn and rn is @xmath21 , and the diffusion coefficient in air medium is @xmath22 . using the model in eq.[equation_spatiotemporal_1d ] \n , we do the simulation at different emitting frequencies , such as @xmath23,@xmath24 and @xmath25 .    through the fig.[fig_distance_varies ] \n , we find that with the increase of @xmath9 , the aim in the rn side is become smaller and smaller , also the interference is becoming smaller and smaller . \n since the aim and interference increase or decrease simultaneously , we need to make a compromise for the change of frequency , in order to transmit enough information molecules , and improve the probability of successful information transmission \n .      we need to do some researches to study the differences between one dimensional situation and three dimensional situation . \n we use the same basic values of the parameters described before , except for the distance @xmath26 , the frequency @xmath27 . \n the three dimensional model of molecules transmission is adapted from @xcite . \n the simulation result shows in fig.[fig_compare_1d_3d ] .    from fig.[fig_compare_1d_3d ] , we know that the 3-d line higher than 1-d , and the interference is almost the same . \n in one dimensional situation can make sure the receiver the information molecules completely in certain time , however , the available information in three dimensional situation is higher . \n we think the reason is that in three dimensional situation , there are a large quantities of molecules in certain time slot , but to the one dimensional situation the information molecules needs to transmit sequencely which result the through out is smaller . \n in this paper , we studied continuous molecules were transmitted in one dimensional molecular communication . \n we use binary concentration - encoded method to encode information molecules into bit `` 1 '' or `` 0 '' , also we introduce sample theorem and threshold for the receiver to decode information molecules . \n to study the molecular communication deeper , we studied that how the metrics of distance and frequency affect the molecules concentration , and we learned that the longer the distance the lower of the available information molecules in rn , but higher in interferences , and the frequency has two sides on the available molecular communication , either positive or negative , therefore , we should make a compromise between the available information molecules and the interferences from the former information bits . \n finally , we made a comparison between one dimensional situation and three dimensional situation , and we find that in three dimensional situation , the rn side has a higher available information molecules , but can not make sure the rn receives the molecular information for one hundred percent . \n + still there are many areas need to study , for the future research work , we can promote our research from three aspects . \n for the first , we can study how the variation of different emit rates affect the molecules concentration . \n for the second , we should find a method to make a cut - off between the frequency and the interference , in order to make the communication more accurate and high efficiency . for the third \n , we should consider to combine the advantages of the three dimensional and one dimensional situation to improve the available information molecules . \n this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( 61173190 ) and the fundamental research funds for the central universities(gk201501008 ) . \n h.  b. yilmaz , a.  c. heren , t.  tugcu , and c .- b . \n chae , `` three -

varying monotonic plasma density profile is well understood and can be calculated analytically or using a ray - tracing method , turbulent or otherwise perturbed profiles require detailed numerical modelling using a full - wave method . in order to deal with cases in which the perturbations are 3d in nature , \n a new 3d full - wave code , emit-3d , has been developed to carry out these simulations . \n recently , a diagnostic known as sami ( synthetic aperture microwave imaging ) has been developed to take advantage of emission due to mode conversion from electron bernstein waves ( ebws ) @xcite . \n this is the inverse of a process which has been investigated as a potential means of heating and current drive in overdense fusion plasmas , such as stellarators @xcite and spherical tokamaks @xcite . \n installed on the mast spherical tokamak , the sami diagnostic produces high time - resolution ( @xmath1s ) 2d images of o - mode emission due to ebws generated at ec harmonics in the plasma core . \n these are measured in the 10 - 35 ghz range , with each frequency corresponding to a radial position through the plasma edge @xcite . \n however , large fluctuations have been observed in the measured signal during inter - elm periods ; these demand explanation . \n a candidate explanation for these fluctuations is the influence of inter - elm filaments on the mode conversion and propagation of the emission . \n there is evidence for the presence of filamentary blob structures at the edge of nearly all tokamaks , as well as alternative configurations such as stellarators and reversed - field pinches ; they are thought to be responsible for a significant fraction of cross - field transport at the edge of fusion - relevant plasmas @xcite . \n they have been observed between elms on mast @xcite , and since their density range has been measured to be @xmath2 m@xmath3 , some filaments will have peak densities close to or above cutoff , particularly at the lower end of the sami frequency range . \n this paper quantifies the effect of typical mast inter - elm filaments by varying filament parameters to investigate their interactions with beams . \n previous simulations have been carried out to study rf scattering from cylindrical filaments for ion cyclotron resonance heating ( icrh ) and lower hybrid ( lh ) applications using a full - wave method @xcite , and spherical blobs for ec and lh waves , using fokker - planck and ray - tracing methods @xcite , geometric optics analysis @xcite and full - wave modelling @xcite . since emission can be obliquely incident with a finite width along the filament axis , this scattering problem is in some respects inherently 3d . \n the new code is therefore used to carry out these simulations in 3d . by comparison with the 2d full -

order expansions could also be employed . \n after some algebraic manipulation , explicit update coefficients for each current density component are obtained , with no storage of old components required after a timestep . \n as static backgrounds are assumed over the timescale of a single simulation , these update coefficients can be calculated once at the beginning of a simulation and do not require updating . \n data - level parallelisation using mpi is implemented to reduce computation time , which can be quite significant : 3000 timesteps on a @xmath29 grid take approximately 7 hours on 80 cpu cores . \n a benchmarking test of the code is its ability to reproduce the analytic dispersion relations for the o- ( ordinary ) and x- ( extraordinary ) modes observed in a magnetised plasma . very close agreement is observed for both ; x -

in the @xmath31-direction , the beam profile remained close to the original gaussian of the source . \n that is , no scattering out of the plane was observed . \n the peak @xmath56 in the @xmath9-direction ( fig . \n [ fig : pos_sd ] ) , observed when the filament and beam axes coincide , is greater than the result for vacuum by a factor of 3 . as their separation increases past @xmath57 , power distributions with @xmath58 are observed , suggesting that the filament may be acting to focus the beam , although this is only a small effect . \n the point of maximum emission @xmath44 ( fig . \n [ fig : pos_maxem ] ) was maximally displaced by a filament centred on the beam axis , with two equal maxima located at @xmath59 . as the filament moved away , this became a single maximum which returned towards , and then slightly beyond , the centre point at larger separations . \n a single beam was recovered , but its shape was still influenced by the presence of the filament , with a dual -

extent of the computational domain . as cutoff was reached and exceeded at the filament centre and backscattering began to play a significant role , the total backplane power decreased to @xmath69 of its original value . \n again , excellent agreement of emit-3d with ipf -

z plane shown . \n contours on a log scale . \n spatial coordinates shown on axes of leftmost image ] \n these results show the synergistic effects of two filament parameters , density and width , on the observed scattering angle . while filaments with widths of several times the beam wavelength can cause large deviations at higher frequencies ( e.g. a filament of gaussian width 2.5 cm , close to the mean width for mast , will scatter a 30 ghz beam by @xmath77 ) , filament density becomes an important effect at lower frequencies , even for underdense filaments ( e.g. a filament of peak density @xmath83 m@xmath3 , again typical for mast , will scatter a 10 ghz beam by @xmath64 ) . \n it is therefore shown that filamentary plasma structures can have a significant influence on the propagation of microwaves across a broad frequency spectrum , with consequences for both electron cyclotron diagnostics and heating . \n since spherical tokamaks maintain plasma densities comparable to other tokamaks with a lower magnetic field and thus have lower electron cyclotron frequencies , these effects can be particularly important . \n in particular , inter -

{"ContextTokens": 2210, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are among the most beautiful astronomical objects . \n they are the result of the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath0 ) . in the most simple scenario , pne \n are formed when the progenitor stars lose their external envelopes at the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and cross the hr - diagram on their way to the white dwarf cooling sequence . while crossing the hr - diagram the central stars of the pne ( cspne ) become sufficiently hot to ionize the previously ejected material @xcite .    besides being interesting and fascinating objects in themselves \n their properties are also useful for other fields of astrophysics @xcite . \n pne and cspne offer unique insight into the nucleosynthesis during previous evolutionary phases like the agb . \n extragalactic pne can be used to understand metallicity gradients and their temporal evolution in galaxies . \n also , the pne luminosity function ( pnlf ) has proven to be a good distance indicator as far as @xmath1mpc , but we still do not understand why . the formation and detectability of pne depends strongly on the relationship between two different timescales . \n the evolutionary timescale of the cspne , which provides the ionizing photons , and the dynamical timescales of the circumstellar material ejected at the end of the agb . \n if the cspn evolves too fast the pn will be ionized for a short time , and thus will have a low detection probability , or might even not be ionized at all . on the other hand , \n if the star evolves too slowly , the ionization of the nebula will take place when the ejected material has already dispersed too much to be detectable . in this work \n we address the first of these timescales . \n namely , we present preliminary results from full stellar evolution computations of the post - agb and cspne phases that include an updated treatment of macro and microphysics . \n this stage is one of the least understood phases of low- and intermediate mass stars and there are some indications that current models are not accurate enough , e.g. a ) the two available grids of post - agb models do not agree on the predicted timescales @xcite , b ) the cspne mass - luminosity relation seems to be at variance with the constraints coming from hydrodynamically consistent model atmospheres , c ) consistency between the masses of white dwarfs and those of cspne determined by asteroseismology requires faster evolutionary speeds . in addition , until now we do not understand why the cut - off of the pne luminosity function is constant in most galaxies . \n last , but not least , showed that c - rich molecular opacities are key to predict the right effective temperatures once the agb models become carbon rich ( @xmath2 , by number fraction ) . \n these inconsistencies and the fact that available post - agb models are based on very old radiative opacities and microphysics calls for a restudy of the problem . \n the computations presented in this work have been performed with lpcode stellar evolution code . \n a detailed description of the code can be found in , and references therein , here focus on the physical ingredients , and updates , which are particularly relevant for the present work . in the pre - wd regime lpcode \n uses the opal eos_2005 equation of state for h- and he rich mixtures and a simplified eos for other compositions . \n updated high- and low- temperature radiative opacities are included according to @xcite and @xcite . \n this includes pretabulated c - rich molecular opacities . \n the @xmath3n(p,@xmath4)@xmath5o reaction rate , that sets the overall efficiency of the cno - cycle , was taken from @xcite . \n convective mixing is treated within mixing length theory ( mlt ) and a diffusive convective picture , including an exponentially decaying velocity field outside formal convective boundaries ( with a free parameter @xmath6 , see for details ) . from the calibration of the solar model with diffusion \n we obtain @xmath7 . \n the value of @xmath6 in convective cores is set to @xmath8 from the calibration of the width of the upper main sequence . \n this equivalent to an overshooting extension of 0.2 times the pressure scale height . \n the values of @xmath6 in the pulse driven convection zone ( pdcz ) during the thermal pulses in the agb is set to @xmath9 which allows to reproduce the range of he , c and o ratios observed in pg1159 type stars @xcite . \n the @xmath6-value at the bottom of the convective envelope is taken to be @xmath10 . \n winds are a decisive aspect of agb evolution since they determine when the tp - agb phase ends . to include the impact of the transition from an o - rich agb to a c - rich agb star we implemented different wind prescriptions for the o- and c - rich dust driven winds . \n for the sake of consistency we choose dust driven wind prescriptions derived by the same authors and methods , ( @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 is the pulsation period ) . for the pre - dusty winds we included the @xcite which seems to reproduce some rgb and agb observables better than the standard reimers prescription @xcite . \n finally , for the hot radiative driven winds we adopted a mass loss prescription , @xmath14 , which is based on the results of and similar to the one adopted by . between the the hot and cold wind regime , @xmath15 , \n there are no available prescriptions and we had to rely on interpolations . \n -diagram of the computed sequences for z=0.01 . ]    ) from different sources as compared with our results for h -

agb remnant form @xmath24 to the point of maximum effective temperature ( `` knee '' , see fig . \n [ fig : kiel ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is well known that the computation of the very end of the tp - agb is riddled with convergence problems . \n this implies that a lot of human time ( baby - sitting ) is required to compute the transition from the tp - agb to the cspne phase . \n even when codes converge , convergence happens at the expense of a prohibitively small timesteps ( even down to @xmath26 hour ) . despite all numerical improvements our computations are not the exception \n consequently , the number of complete simulations presented in this work is rather small . in fig . \n [ fig : kiel ] we show the @xmath27-diagram ( `` kiel diagram '' ) for our @xmath28 sequences . \n table [ tab : grid ] shows the most relevant quantities of our tp - agb and post - agb stellar models . \n a comparison of the @xmath17-@xmath18 relationship of our models ( table [ tab : grid ] ) with semiempirical determinations from stellar clusters @xcite , common proper motion pairs or the galactic bulge suggest that our values of @xmath18 may me somewhat low . \n this is very likely the consequence of too strong third dredge up during the tp - agb @xcite . \n in fact , this causes the formation of c - rich stars already at the first thermal pulse in our low metallicity sequences ( z=0.001 and @xmath29 and 2.5 m@xmath30 ) . \n this might lead to disagreements with the carbon star luminosity function and thus to a need to re - calibrate the overshooting parameters during the tp - agb . \n however , it should be notice that the value of @xmath31 is required to reproduce the abundances of pg1159 type post - agb stars , leaving only @xmath32 as a possible free parameter .    a comparison of our timescales with those of previous models and semiempirical determinations ( see fig . [ \n fig : crossing ] ) allow us for some very interesting preliminary conclusions . \n on one hand , in the range of remnant masses where our models overlap with those of the agreement is quite good . \n this is particularly interesting in the light of the different numerical codes and wind prescriptions adopted . \n this suggests that the details of mass loss might not play a crucial role in the determination of post - agb timescales . \n given the uncertainties behind this ingredient of stellar evolution computations , this might be a good news . \n on the other hand , our models predict much shorter ( up to a factor of @xmath33 ! ) \n post - agb timescales than those of @xcite and . in the light of the agreement between our timescales and \n those of this suggests that stellar evolution computations based on old microphysics might have significantly overestimated the length of the cspne phase . \n interestingly enough our much shorter timescales are in agreement with the results from studies of pne that suggests that cspne should evolve several times faster than predicted by old stellar evolution models . \n last , but not least , our models do not predict a strong dependence of the post - agb timescales with metallicity . \n in addition , the post - agb mass - luminosity relation of modern models is different from that of old grids . \n all these results , if confirmed , will have an impact in the predictions of models for the formations of pne in different stellar populations . \n in particular , the impact of modern post - agb computations in the formation of the pnlf needs to be assessed .", "StartTimeOffset": 2710611893267, "RequestID": "301e22687d38a41e954b2d116366449bbc05d01d", "TotalTokens": 2337}

resolution spectropolarimeter mounted on a two - metre telescope , only a very small number of lines could be studied . with the new observations of ap stars in all four stokes parameters ( stokes @xmath1 ) using espadons and narval as described by silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) it is possible to not only study a larger sample of ap stars , this new higher quality data allows the study of @xmath0  cvn at a resolution not previously possible . \n new higher resolution , higher signal to noise data allows us to probe more subtle spectral features which have been unresolved or buried in the noise in the musicos observations . \n @xmath0  cvn made an ideal candidate as the first star to map the magnetic topology using the new espadons and narval data and the invers10 code , because of the existence of the magnetic topology maps produced using musicos data . \n having this previous map set allows us to confirm that the new data are compatible with the old data and that newly modelled magnetic field is consistent with the field derived from the musicos maps . \n as is discussed by silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) , the new observations obtained with espadons and narval were of much superior quality . \n the espadons and narval spectra offer a higher resolution than the musicos spectra ( with @xmath5 ) , and a larger wavelength coverage from 369 - 1048 nm ( with gaps at 922.4 to 923.4 nm , 960.8 to 963.6 nm and 1002.6 to 1007.4 nm ) and a much higher signal - to - noise ratio . \n ( the median signal - to - noise ratio of the reduced observations is over 700 per 1.8  kms@xmath6  pixel ) . \n an illustration of the improvement in data quality is given in fig . \n 1 which shows a comparison between the stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 profiles of hd 32633 in the fe ii 5018   line between espadons / narval and musicos , with the new data showing much clearer signatures and greatly reduced noise . at the same time \n silvester et al . \n ( 2012 ) showed that the new data were consistent with the musicos data of wade et al . \n to allow direct comparison with the original musicos maps of kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) , we reconstructed the magnetic field topology of @xmath0  cvn using the strong iron lines of fe ii 4923    and fe ii 5018   using the new espadons / narval data . \n the mdi mapping is performed using the invers10 code ( as described by piskunov & kochukhov ( 2002 ) , kochukhov & piskunov ( 2002 ) and kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) ) . \n invers10 constructs model line profiles based on an assumed initial surface distribution of free parameters ( element abundance and magnetic field geometry ) and then iteratively adjusts the parameters until the computed line profiles are in agreement with the observations . a direct comparison of the radial , meridional and azimuthal fields between the two data sets is shown in fig . \n [ field - maps - rec ] in a rectangular representation . \n good agreement can be seen between the maps reconstructed from the two data sets for all three field components , with the difference plot showing little structure . \n this indicates that the two maps are consistent and that the magnetic field is stable over this time period of 10 years spanned by the two data sets . \n as has been found in previous mapping of @xmath0  cvn ( kochukhov & wade 2010 ) , the magnetic field topology show complex substructure which could not be described by a dipolar or quadrupolar geometries . with these new data \n it is important to investigate whether that this is still the case and confirm that the observed profiles can not be correctly fitted with a more simple field topology . to confirm that this is indeed the case , \n the profiles for a set of 5 strong and weak iron lines were compared to model profiles one would obtain for a dipolar and dipolar plus quadrupolar geometry . to accomplish this comparison we have fitted four stokes parameter observations with a modified version of invers10 in which a direct description of the three field components was substituted with a multipolar parameterization similar to the one described by donati et al . \n further details about our implementation of mdi with multipolar expansion are provided by kochukhov et al . \n ( 2013 ) .    as illustrated in fig . \n [ othergeofit ] , it can be seen that neither model is in good agreement with the profiles , in particular with the stokes @xmath7 profiles . \n we can therefore conclude even with the new data , that a simple field topology can not describe the field structure of @xmath0 cvn . \n we have also started to investigate which chemical elements are suitable for use in the reconstruction of surface abundance structures in @xmath0 cvn . \n the basis of line selection was to start with the lines used in the mapping by kochukhov et al . \n ( 2002 ) and then to expand the list using the line list of pyper ( 1969 ) , cohen ( 1970 ) and to a lesser extent roby and lambert ( 1990 ) . \n this was combined with a visual inspection to eliminate lines from the list which were not clearly present in the spectrum , did not show variability or were heavily blended with other lines . in addition lines which suffered from non - lte affects were avoided . for the chemical abundance mapping only stokes @xmath2 profiles were to be used in the mapping , so lines did not have to exhibit linear polarisation signatures , but had to show clear variability in the absorption line . \n the results of this investigation will be presented in a future paper ( silvester et al . \n , in prep ) . \n we have shown that the new espadons / narval data lead to a magnetic field topology consistent with the one found by using musicos data . \n this also provides direct observational evidence of the magnetic field stability in @xmath0 cvn over a decade timescale . \n we have also shown that the observations of iron lines in all stokes parameters can not be explained by a pure dipolar or quadrupolar model . \n further investigations into the importance of line selection when reconstructing the magnetic field topology of @xmath0 cvn will be performed in paper two ( silvester et al . , \n submitted ) . \n this will be followed by a study of all the abundance maps obtainable for @xmath0 cvn with the new data set ( silvester et al . \n , in prep ) . \n babcock , h. w and burd , s. , 1952 , apj , 116 , 8 borra , e.f . , and landstreet , j.d . , 1977 , \n apj , 212 , 141 borra , e.f . , and vaughan , a.h . , 1978 , apj , 220 , 924 braithwaite , j. and nordlund , a. , 2006 , a&a , 450 , 1077 cohen . \n j.g . , 1970,apj , 159,473 donati , j .- f . , \n howarth , i. d. , jardine , m. m. , petit , p. , catala , c. , landstreet , j. d. , bouret , j .- c . , \n alecian , e. , barnes , j. r. , forveille , t. , paletou , f. , manset , n. , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 629 farnsworth g. , 1932 , apj 76 , 313 kochukhov , o. , bagnulo , s. , wade , g. a. , sangalli , l. , piskunov , n. , landstreet , j. d. , petit , p. , sigut , t. a. a. , 2004 , a&a , 414 , 613 kochukhov , o. , piskunov , n. , ilyin , i. , ilyina , s. , tuominen , i. , 2002 , a&a 389 , 420 kochukhov , o. & piskunov , n. , 2002 , a&a 288 , 868 kochukhov , o. , bagnulo , s. , 2006 , a&a , 450 , 763 kochukhov , o. and wade , g.a , 2010 , a&a , 513 , a13 kochukhov , o. , wade , g. a. , shulyak , d. , 2012 , mnras , 421 , 3004 kochukhov , o. , mantere , m. j. , hackman , t. , ilyin , i. , 2013 , a&a , 550 , 84 piskunov , n. , kochukhov , o. , 2002 , a&a , 381 . \n 736 pyper , d.m . , 1969 , \n apjs , 18 347 roby , s.w . , and lambert , d.l . , 1990 , apjs , 73 , 67 rosen , l. , kochukhov , o. , a&a , 2012 , 26 , 548 , silvester , j . , \n wade , g.a . \n , kochukhov , o. , s. bagnulo , s. , folsom , c.p . \n , hanes , d. , 2012 , mnras , 426 , 1003 wade g.a . , \n donati j .- f . , \n landstreet j.d . , \n shorlin s.l.s . \n , 2000a , mnras 313 , 823", "StartTimeOffset": 2736805746997, "RequestID": "d8510e2bc5db852964d303f577dfeaad8a48bf07", "TotalTokens": 2739}

singular integrals can be approximated by the product of the two cubic volumes divided by the distance between their midpoints . \n a simple calculation gives , @xmath38 if we introduce the notation , compare equation ( [ eq.scaling ] ) , @xmath39 we now have , @xmath40 since the number of terms in the sum grows as @xmath27 it is of interest to take advantage of symmetries to reduce it as much as possible . doing this \n we find that , @xmath41 is an alternative way of writing equation ( [ eq.no.sing ] ) . \n putting , @xmath42 we have that , @xmath43 assuming that @xmath44 . \n if we put this into ( [ eq.no.sing ] ) , or ( [ eq.i.sum.rewritten ] ) , we get , @xmath45 the smaller the box , the smaller the error , so there is hope that this expression will converge to the correct value of @xmath4 when @xmath25 goes to infinity , i.e.  that @xmath46 the approximation ( [ eq.basic.approximation ] ) then immediately gives the following estimate for @xmath4 , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 a value which turns out to be correct to two significant digits . \n this is encouraging but the convergence for increasing @xmath25 is slow , see table [ table.1st.approx ] . when @xmath49 the error is still @xmath50 . \n the exact value is from eqs.([eq.c.analytical.expression ] ) and ( [ eq.c.20.dig ] ) . \n .[table.1st.approx ] this table illustrates the slow convergence of @xmath51 . \n note that computation time goes as @xmath27 . \n [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ table.2nd.approx ] some results of this approach are shown . after finding four different sets of quantities \n a standard linear equation solver delivers four solutions to the linear set of equations . for @xmath4 \n this is clearly seen to give excellent values . \n the three other integrals converge much more slowly but seem to approach @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively . \n here we will use crude estimates of the hartree energy @xcite of electrons that move in a cube of homogeneous positive charge density . using this crude theory \n we will investigate whether the electrons tend to delocalize in the cube or if a state with localized electrons has lower energy . \n we assume that the electrons either are delocalized in the cube and have constant charge density in the cube or that they localize in one octant of the cube and have constant charge density there . \n this means that we can treat either 8 electrons or 8 electron pairs . with these assumptions \n the electrostatic interaction energy can be found from the results above . \n the kinetic energy is estimated essentially by means of the uncertainty principle and the pauli exclusion principle . \n we start with 8 electrons in delocalized states . \n they are assumed to move in a cube of side @xmath16 and positive charge @xmath54 . \n the energy is then the sum of the kinetic energy , @xmath55 , \\ ] ] and the electrostatic energy , @xmath56 in the kinetic energy the two first electrons are assumed delocalized over the cube without nodes in the wave function . \n the remaining six must then go into the three degenerate states with one node . \n the first term in the electrostatic energy is the self energy of the positive background . then follows the attraction between the background and the eight delocalized electrons . \n the final term is the sum of the @xmath57 electron - electron pair repulsion terms . \n simplifying this gives the total energy @xmath58 the energy of this closed shell delocalized state should now be compared to the energy of the ferromagnetic localized state with the electrons in one corner each . \n we find , @xmath59 for the kinetic energy since all 8 electrons now sit in cubes ( octants ) of side @xmath60 . \n they are however alone in their corners ( octants ) so the pauli principle is automatically obeyed . \n the electrostatic energy becomes @xmath61 simplification of this using eq . \n ( [ eq.exact.expression ] ) gives the total energy @xmath62 if we introduce atomic units ( @xmath63 ) so that length is measured in units of the bohr radius we can plot the two energy curves , @xmath64 and get the results of fig . \n [ fig8 ] . \n finally we give the corresponding results for 16 electrons sharing orbitals pairwise . in the electrostatic energy one \n can then essentially change the particle charge @xmath15 to @xmath65 and add the contributions from the repulsion within the pairs . \n this gives the two curves , @xmath66 for the delocalized and localized energies respectively . \n these curves are plotted in fig . \n [ fig16 ] . \n one notes that the localized states always have lower electrostatic energy simply because in these states the electrons are better at avoiding each other . for small @xmath16-values \n the delocalized states always have lower energy because of the uncertainty principle . \n the curves in these plots resemble those of wigner @xcite who predicted that localization gives lower energy in metals at low densities \n . this phenomenon is called wigner crystallization . \n i am not aware of any comparable study of the electrostatic interaction energies of homogeneous cubic charge distributions . \n the algebraic and combinatoric tricks used to eliminate the coulomb singularities in the integrals seem partly new , as well as the result of eq . \n ( [ eq.result.for.the.four ] ) . \n it is possible that these ideas can be generalized to more general integration problems involving the coulomb singularity . \n it is a further bonus that these insights into the electrostatics of cubes and their sub - cubes can be used to make simple estimates for the hartree energy of electrons distributed in cubes in different ways . \n such simple model systems are of value for the qualitative understanding of more complex systems .                z.  f. seidov and p.  i. skvirsky . gravitational potential and energy of homogeneous rectangular parallelepiped . \n e -

smbh ) . \n hence , the x  ray  emission reprocessed by the inner accretion disk is imprinted by gr effects such as doppler boosting , gravitational redshift and light bending , that shape the spectral features including the k@xmath0 emission line profile @xcite . \n x  ray  time - resolved spectroscopy of agn is therefore our ultimate tool to probe gr effects under extreme gravity conditions . \n the emission from the approaching side of the disk is enhanced due to doppler boosting , while it is diminished from the receding side . since the central engine is unresolved , obscuration by optically thick matter of the different x  ray  emitting regions by structures in our line of sight ( los ) is a promising manner to distinguish the reflection from different parts of the disk @xcite , and a method to investigate relativistic effects in agn x \n ray  spectra by means of eclipses has been proposed @xcite . \n variable x \n ray  absorption in agn has been noticed on all time scales , not depending of their luminosity or morphology @xcite . \n the absorber has been identified with clouds of the dusty , clumpy torus at the pc  scales and long timescales @xcite , or the blr at short timescales @xcite . in the latter , the observed absorption variability points to cloud sizes of the order of few gravitational radii , thus comparable to the x  ray  emitting regions . \n so , detailed modeling of such events can enable us to draw an accurate picture of the system s geometry . \n this high variability has been explained through fast column density changes as a result of material in the blr crossing our los @xcite . \n agn spectra are composed of at least two components : the continuum power law emission , from the corona , and the reflection  dominated component , from the accretion disk @xcite . \n both components arise from regions of the accretion flow only a few  @xmath1 away from the central smbh @xcite . \n the geometry that we assume for the system consists of a smbh , characterized by its mass ( @xmath2 ) and spin parameter ( @xmath3 ) , around which an optically thick but physically thin ionized accretion disk extends from the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) out to @xmath4 . \n several configurations have been proposed for the disk and the continuum x \n ray  source : the hot and radiatively compact spherical corona with radius between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ; the slab geometry @xcite ; the patchy structure @xcite ; and the jet base interpretation @xcite , just to mention some of them . \n we adhere to the slab geometry : in the following , the corona is a parallel plane at a negligible distance above the disk . \n the inner radius of the corona is forced to be coincidental with the isco , while its outer radius is only a few @xmath1 . \n for the reprocessed component , we assume it to arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk , between the isco and an outer limit determined by the disk s emissivity index which is constrained to satisfy that at least @xmath7 of the reprocessed emission comes from the innermost @xmath8@xmath9@xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath10 . \n the eclipsing cloud is assumed to be co  rotating with the disk at a velocity of 3000kms@xmath11 , typical of the blr of the system . since these kind of obscuration events are more likely to be detected in unobscured sources , we disregard the torus of the unification models within the framework of this work . \n we build our model within @xcite , as a power law accounting for the x  ray  continuum , plus the x  ray  reflection code xillver @xcite accounting for the reflection component . \n these two components are multiplied by the kynconv relativistic convolution model @xcite , which adds all relativistic effects due to strong gravity and fast motions close to the smbh , allowing to obscure part of the emission with a circular cloud whose size and position can be determined . \n we model the accretion disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , with a typical ionization of @xmath12ergcms@xmath11 and solar abundances . \n the energy cutoff is frozen to 300kev . \n the main parameters that can be tuned are : the inclination @xmath13 of the system with respect to our los ; the black hole spin @xmath14 ; the emissivity index @xmath15 ; the cloud position ; and the cloud size . \n the column density @xmath16 and ionization log@xmath17 of the cloud are set by the ionized absorption code @xcite . \n we model the galactic absorption as a neutral absorption component . \n we build this model as an upgrade of our previous gr - model @xcite . \n below we explain the role of every parameter involved in it . \n absorption due to material in our galaxy is modelled by means of the photoelectric absorption component in . \n we choose an intermediate arbitrary intermediate value of @xmath18 . \n absorption due to partially ionized material in the host galaxy is modelled with . \n the equivalent column density ranges from @xmath19 ( compton  thin ) to @xmath20 ( compton  thick ) , typical for clouds in the blr . its ionization takes values between @xmath21 ( neutral ) and @xmath22 ( highly ionized material ) . \n the radius and position of the cloud are determined by a set of parameters of the relativistic code , all in terms of gravitational radii . \n the primary continuum emission from the corona is modelled with a simple power law component with photon index set to a typical value of @xmath23 . \n the continuum normalization is chosen so that the unabsorbed @xmath24kev  x  ray  flux is @xmath25erg@xmath26s@xmath11 , typical for bright , local agn . \n an exponential high  energy cutoff of @xmath27kev  is set . \n the reprocessed emission is modelled by means of the x \n ray  reflection code @xcite . \n the photon index is the same as for the continuum . \n the iron abundance is set to solar and the disk ionization is fixed to a typical value of log@xmath28 in order to allow the existence of enough reflection features . \n we set the same cutoff as for the power law . \n finally , the reflection normalization is fixed in order to get a reflection fraction between 1 and 2 , i.e.  the disk to cover at least one half of the sky as seen from the central engine , in agreement with observations . \n lightcurves created by a circular cloud eclipsing a plane \n parallel annular source inclined @xmath29 . \n the cloud radius is @xmath30@xmath1 and the annular source has inner and outer radii of @xmath31@xmath1 and @xmath32@xmath1 respectively . \n the solid grey line is the monte carlo simulated flux during an eclipse involving a newtonian isotropically  emitting disk , and the dashed black line represents the fit to two gaussians . \n the solid green line is the flux simulated from the kynconv relativistic model , emitted from a disk around a rotating black hole with spin @xmath33 ( isco = @xmath34@xmath1 ) . \n the dotted green line is the fit to two gaussians . \n , scaledwidth=61.8% ]    the inclination of the system , defined as the angle between the normal to the disk and our los , directly determines how asymmetric the flux - lightcurves are during an eclipse with respect to the position of the black hole . when the system is observed face  on , doppler boosting is undetectable from our point of view : there are no approaching nor receding regions in the disk , since its orbital plane is perpendicular to our los . \n therefore the flux - profiles observed are symmetric . \n the larger the inclination is , the greater is the doppler boosting effect , so that the more noticeable is the asymmetry of these profiles , independently of every other parameter . \n an example of a lightcurve produced during an eclipse of a plane \n parallel annular x \n ray  source inclined @xmath29 is shown in fig . \n [ comparison_newton_rel ] . the newtonian case is included in the figure in order to ease comparison with the gr one . \n notice that the flux from the approaching side of the disk ( left wing ) is several times greater than that from the receding side ( right wing ) in the gr - dominated scenario . \n different values of the isco , and hence the smbh spin , imprint the eclipse lightcurves too . in the cases where the cloud size is comparable to the isco , it is possible to measure the isco with great precision in an unprecedented manner when the size of the cloud is known , by simply measuring the distance between the peak preceding and following the smbh position in the lightcurves \n when larger clouds are involved in the eclipse , gr effects are still detectable , although measurement of the isco becomes infeasible . \n it is important to mention that the secondary peaks of the lightcurves obtained in some of the configurations described here are beyond the limits of detectability of available instruments . \n however , detectability by future x \n ray  observatories such as the athena mission must be further investigated . yet , most of the actual physical situations still represent interesting cases that we can discern by using current technology . \n the singular shapes of the light curves described in section[model ] can explain the second rise observed in some other light curves detected in actual observations taken during blr clouds eclipses . \n variable partial covering in the time  resolved spectral analysis of the seyfert galaxy ngc1365 is well explained by a model consisting of a constant continuum absorbed by a constant column density , plus a variable partial  covering component @xcite . \n the covering fraction variations are highly significant and clearly show the signature of a complete transit of an eclipsing cloud . \n the same behaviour is shown by swiftj2127.4 + 5654  @xcite . \n this inspires us to dig into the analysis of these relativistic effects by means of fits to real spectra . in the following paragraphs \n , we describe our study of gr effects in the eclipse detected in our  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n first we fix some parameters based in previous unabsorbed observations . \n the inclination angle is fixed to the common value of @xmath35 @xcite . \n also , we fix the smbh spin to @xmath36 @xcite . \n the photon index is fixed to @xmath23 @xcite . \n the emissivity index of the disk is fixed to @xmath37 @xcite . \n metal abundances are consistently set to solar @xcite . \n the ionization of the reflector is fixed to @xmath38ergcms@xmath11 @xcite . \n we adopt the high  energy cutoff @xmath39kev  @xcite . \n we fix the column density of the neutral eclipsing cloud to @xmath40@xmath26 @xcite . \n finally , we assume that the cloud follows a keplerian orbit co  rotating with the smbh and the accretion disk , moving at velocity @xmath41kms@xmath11  @xcite . for a black hole mass of @xmath42@xmath43 , \n this is @xmath44@xmath1ks@xmath11 . \n the occultation event characterised in swiftj2127.4 + 5654  lasts @xmath45ks , so that considering the upper limit in the velocity as the correct value , the cloud would travel a distance of @xmath9@xmath1 within this lapse @xcite . \n we divide the spectra in 24 equal sub \n spectra , consequently each one of these sub  spectra covers @xmath46@xmath1 in the cloud s orbit . \n we force the position @xmath47@xmath1 to coincide with the lowest flux observations , so that our observation starts when the cloud is at @xmath48@xmath1 and ends when it reaches @xmath49@xmath1 . \n the only parameters that are not frozen are the normalizations of the power law and the reflection component , and the radii of the obscuring cloud and the corona . \n these four parameters are free to vary . \n the normalization of the reflection component , as well as the cloud and source radii are constrained to be the same for all of the 24 spectra . \n the normalizations of the power law are allowed to vary independently for every spectrum . \n we performed fits with all the 24 spectra extracted from the  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n the results of the fit are poorly constrained ( @xmath50/dof@xmath8@xmath51 , see left column of table[tab : swift_fit ] ) . \n we further investigate any possible improvement by allowing the column density of the cloud to vary . \n the fit gets much better ( @xmath50/dof@xmath52 , see right column of table[tab : swift_fit ] ) . \n absorption is negligible in all spectra above @xmath53kev , becoming important in the soft and intermediate x  rays . \n c c c parameter & @xmath54 fix & @xmath54 free + @xmath55@xmath26 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + nors . \n pl & @xmath64 & @xmath65

@xmath72@xmath1 . \n the cloud s radius is @xmath73@xmath1 , i.e.  the cloud represents around @xmath8@xmath74 of the source in size ( @xmath8@xmath75 in projected surface ) . \n the cloud is only a few times ( less than one order of magnitude ) thicker than when @xmath54 was fixed , with column density of @xmath76@xmath26 , in stead of the originally fixed value of @xmath77@xmath26 . \n these results on the geometry of the system are complementary to those obtained when the gr eclipsing cloud code was not used ( see @xcite ) , with cloud and source sizes @xmath78@xmath79@xmath80@xmath1 , and @xmath81@xmath79@xmath82@xmath1 , respectively : both the cloud and the source are slightly larger , most likely in order to account for the larger column density ( @xmath8@xmath83@xmath26 in stead of @xmath8@xmath84@xmath26 ) . \n we have introduced a new relativistic x  ray  spectral model for characterising x \n ray  occultation events , involving key parameters such as the size of the x  ray  emitting regions ( the innermost accretion disk and/or the corona ) , the disk s emissivity index , the column density , ionization state , linear size and velocity of the obscuring cloud , the black hole spin , and the inclination of the system with respect to our los . tests on  simulated data show that our instruments detect anisotropic emission from the disk : gr effects enhance the emission from the side of the disk approaching towards the observer , while emission from the receding parts decreases . \n we show how an eclipse of the x  ray  emitting regions by a cloud in the blr of the system can be used to probe the close environments of the central smbh . \n since the tests carried out have been satisfactory , we fit our relativistic model to real data from a long  observation of swiftj2127.4 + 5654 . \n we define an annulus - like x  ray  source , parallel and close to the accretion disk , whose inner radius is fixed to @xmath71@xmath1 from previous unabsorbed observations . \n we compute its outer radius to be @xmath72@xmath1 . \n the radius of the eclipsing cloud is @xmath73@xmath1 , and its column density is @xmath76@xmath26 . as compared to our previous , non - relativistic work , \n the sizes of the cloud and the source are lightly larger , probably in order to balance the larger column density calculated in the gr scenario . \n financial support

its only role is to measure the amount of expansion taking place along those trajectories .    in this \n _ brief report _ \n , we make an explicit study of the effect of modifying the friedmann equation by considering the flow equations in the simplest braneworld inflation scenario , based on the randall  sundrum type ii model @xcite . \n the flow equations are a set of differential equations linking a set of slow - roll parameters defined from the hubble parameter @xmath0 . in the standard cosmology , following the notation of kinney @xcite , the parameters can be defined as @xmath1 where primes are derivatives with respect to the scalar field @xmath2 . using the relation @xmath3 where we define the number of @xmath4-foldings @xmath5 as _ decreasing _ with increasing time , \n yields the flow equations @xmath6(^\\ell\\lambda_{{\\rm h}})+^{\\ell+1}\\!\\!\\ !      \\lambda_{{\\rm h } } \\ ;

{"ContextTokens": 2070, "GeneratedTokens": 264, "SynthesizedBody": "emission of light fragments ( lf ) from nuclear reactions is an interesting open question . \n different reaction mechanisms contribute to their production ; the relative roles of each , and how they change with incident energy , mass number of the target , and the type and emission energy of the fragments is not completely understood . \n none of the available models are able to accurately predict emission of lf from arbitrary reactions . however , the ability to describe production of lf ( especially at energies @xmath4  mev ) from many reactions is important for different applications , such as cosmic - ray - induced single event upsets ( seus ) , radiation protection , and cancer therapy with proton and heavy - ion beams . \n the cascade - exciton model ( cem ) @xcite version 03.03 and the los alamos version of the quark - gluon string model ( laqgsm ) @xcite version 03.03 event generators in the monte - carlo n - particle transport code version 6 ( mcnp6 ) @xcite , describe quite well the spectra of fragments with sizes up to @xmath0he across a broad range of target masses and incident energies ( up to @xmath1  gev for cem and up to @xmath2  tev / a for laqgsm ) . \n however , they do not predict well the high - energy tails of lf spectra heavier than @xmath3he . \n most lf with energies above several tens of mev are emitted during the precompound stage of a reaction . \n the current versions of the cem and laqgsm event generators do not account for precompound emission of these heavier lf . \n the aim of our work is to extend the precompound model in the codes to include such processes , leading to an increase of predictive power of lf - production in mcnp6 . \n this entails upgrading the modified exciton model currently used at the preequilibrium stage in cem and laqgsm . \n it will also include expansion and examination of the coalescence and fermi break - up models used in the precompound stages of spallation reactions within cem and laqgsm . \n extending our models to include emission of fragments heavier than @xmath3he at the precompound stage already gives preliminary results with much better agreement with experimental data . \n our models consider that a reaction begins with the intranuclear cascade , referred to as the inc . \n the incident particle or nucleus ( in the case of laqgsm ) enters the target nucleus and begins interacting with nucleons , scattering off them and also often creating new particles in the process . the incident particle and all newly created particles \n are followed until they either escape from the nucleus , are absorbed , or , for nucleons , reach a threshold energy ( roughly 10 - 30 mev ) and are then considered  absorbed \" by the nucleus . \n the preequilibrium stage uses the modified exciton model ( mem ) to determine emission of protons , neutrons , and fragments up to @xmath3he from the residual nucleus . \n we discuss the mem in more detail below . \n this stage can have a highly excited residual nucleus undergoing dozens of exciton transitions and particle emissions . \n the preequilibrium stage ends when the residual nucleus is just as likely to have a @xmath5 exciton transition as a @xmath6 exciton transition .    in the evaporation stage \n , neutrons and protons in the residual nucleus can  evaporate , \" either singly or as fragments . \n the cem evaporation stage is modeled with a modification of the furihata s generalized evaporation model code ( gem2 ) @xcite , and includes light fragments up to @xmath7 mg .    during and after evaporation \n , the code looks to see if we have an isotope that has @xmath8 and is fissionable . if it is , and there is fission , then the code also allows evaporation from the fission fragments . \n there are two models that are not directly parts of this progression : coalescence and fermi break - up . \n the inc stage only emits neutrons , protons , and pions ( and other particles , when using laqgsm at high energies ) , so the coalescence model \n coalesces \" some of the inc neutrons and protons into larger fragments , by comparing their momenta . \n if their momenta are similar enough then they coalesce . \n the current coalescence model can only coalesce up to @xmath3he fragments , the same as the preequilibrium stage . \n the fermi break - up is an oversimplified multifragmentation model that is fast and accurate for small atomic numbers ; in the current cem model it is used when any residual nucleus or fragment has a mass number less than 13 . \n the mem used by cem and laqgsm @xcite calculates @xmath9 , the emission width ( or probability of emitting particle fragment @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 where the partial transmission probabilities , @xmath12 , are equal to @xmath13 eq . \n ( [ lambdatransmission ] ) describes the emission of neutrons and protons . for complex particles , \n the nuclear level density @xmath14 becomes more complicated and an extra phase - space factor @xmath15 must be introduced : @xmath16    eq .  ( [ gammabeta ] ) for @xmath15 is a only a rough estimation that we improve by parameterizing it over a mesh of residual nuclei energy and mass numbers in our codes @xcite . \n as the mem uses a monte - carlo technique to solve the master equations describing the behavior of the nucleus at the preequilibrium stage ( see details in @xcite ) , it is very easy to extend the number of types of possible lf that can be emitted during this stage . \n we generalize the mem to consider the possiblity of emission up to 66 types of nucleons and lf , up to @xmath7 mg . as a starting point , for the inverse cross sections , coulomb barriers , and binding energies of all lf we use the approximations adopted by gem2 @xcite . \n extending the fermi break - up model to include heavier lf ( up to @xmath17 ) allows us to use it for nuclei with @xmath18 , yielding increased accuracy for reactions with light targets . \n below are examples of calculations by cem ( with the expanded fermi breap - up model ) compared to experimental data @xcite . \n c only . ] \n be target . ] \n results from the extended fermi break - up model achieve good agreement with experimental results for these light targets .            expanding the mem to include heavier lf ( up to @xmath7 mg ) yields increased accuracy for several reactions we investigate . \n figure  [ p200alli ] compares new simulations from our expanded model with data by machner et al . \n @xcite for 200 mev p + @xmath19al . \n we also find that the integral spectra for n , p , d , t , @xmath20he , and @xmath3he ( not shown ) , are not significantly impacted by this lf emission expansion . \n figure  [ p1200ni ] compares our results for 1200 mev p + @xmath21ni with new data by budzanowski et al . \n @xcite . \n similar results for different lf spectra are obtained for several other reactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n our results indicate that expanding the mem to include lf preequilibrium emission significantly increases accuracy of the high - energy spectra compared to experimental data . \n extending the cem model to include emission of light fragments ( lf ) heavier than @xmath3he ( up to @xmath7 mg ) in the preequilibrium stage results in significantly improved accuracy compared to experimental data for several reactions , especially in the high - energy tails of the spectra . \n future work includes finding a global parametrization for @xmath22 , incorporating the expanded event generators into mcnp6 , adding coalescence of heavier fragments , further exploring fermi break - up , and upgrading the evaporation model . \n gudima et al . , nucl . phys . * a401 * , 329 ( 1983 ) . \n mashnik et al . , lanl report la - ur-08 - 2931 , los alamos 2008 , arxiv:0805.0751 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. k. k. gudima et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-01 - 6804 , los alamos , 2001 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. t. goorley et al . \n . technol . * 180 * , 298 ( 2012 ) . \n h. machner et al . \n c * 73 * , 044606 ( 2006 ) . \n y. uozumi et al . , nucl . \n instr . meth . \n a * 571 * , 743 ( 2007 ) . \n m. hagiwara et al . \n , j. nucl . \n technol . * 49 * , 571 ( 2012 ) . \n a. budzanowski et al . , phys . \n c * 82 * , 034605 ( 2010 ) . \n s. furihata , nucl . \n b * 171 * , 252 ( 2000 ) . \n s. mashnik et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-12 - 01364 , los alamos , 2012 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. l. kerby et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-12 - 24190 , los alamos , 2012 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/.", "StartTimeOffset": 2873783685016, "RequestID": "0f5bed38cb96b9346db03faa23498809024b16ac", "TotalTokens": 2334}
{"ContextTokens": 1904, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "many compact relativistic objects have strong outflows of plasma , which emit non thermal radiation in internal collisions ( e.g. clumps in quasar , micro quasar and agn jets , internal shocks in gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and when colliding with the surrounding medium ( e.g. afterglows in gbrs , supernova remnants ; terminal agn shocks ) . \n the non  thermal radiation is emitted in strongly collisionless shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n despite their importance and universality collisionless shocks are poorly understood . \n the non  thermal radiation is believed to be emitted in the shock by relativistic particles accelerated by strong electromagnetic fields . \n naturally this fact poses the questions which mechanism is responsible for the electromagnetic field and how are the particles accelerated to the ultra \n relativistic energies implied by observations . in @xcite @xcite suggested that the weibel or two stream instability was responsible for creating a strong magnetic field in the shock interface . \n it was recently confirmed numerically in computer experiments using particle  in  cell ( pic ) codes . \n [ @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ] . \n @xcite @xcite ] showed that the magnetic field reaches an energy content of a few per cent of the equipartition value . \n fermi acceleration has , so far , been used to explain the existence of a power law distributed non  thermal electron population . \n it has been shown to occur in test particle monte carlo simulation under assumptions of the structure of the magnetic field ; but as pointed out by @xcite ( 2004 ) , to further the progress , self consistent models taking into account the back reaction and the detailed microphysics has to be made . \n recently , @xcite ( 2004 ) showed that particle distribution functions ( pdfs ) inferred from grb observations are in conflict with those predicted by fermi theory and diffusive shock acceleration . in this proceeding we report on 3d pic models , also presented in @xcite , of counter streaming plasma shells as a description of the shock interface in grb afterglows . \n to perform the numerical experiments we use a relativistic 3d pic code as described in @xcite ( 2004 ) that works from first principles by solving the full maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field and move the particles according to the lorentz force . \n we set up two counter streaming ion election populations in the rest frame of the densest population . \n the density jump is 3 . \n the inflow lorentz boost of the less dense population is @xmath0 ( run i ) and @xmath1 ( run ii ) in the two experiments , that we report on here . the boundaries are periodic in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 direction , transverse to the flow , and open in the @xmath4 direction parallel with the flow . \n the box sizes are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . \n the electron skin depth is @xmath7 and @xmath8 grid zones respectively , and we use a mass ratio of @xmath9 to resolve both the ion and the electron dynamics . \n we use 16 particles per cell and our boxes contained almost @xmath10 particles . \n the plasmas are initially unmagnetised and cold ( @xmath11 ) . \n in the computer experiments we see how the inter penetrating jets undergo the two  stream instability . \n first , the electrons , being the lighter particles , collect into caustic surfaces and then current channels ; in accordance with the linear theory @xcite . then they reach a non  linear saturation point and the channels simply merge forming thicker and thicker channels . when the magnetic field becomes strong enough the heavier ions are deflected into the magnetic voids between the channels and start undergo the two  stream instability too . \n since the ion instability is catalysed by the electron instability the initial growth rate depends on the electron instability growth rate . when the caustic surfaces of the ions collapse into current channels the electrons , being the lighter particles , are heated and scattered by the magnetic field of the ion channels . \n attracted by the electric potential of the ion channels the electrons start to debye shield channels . \n the debye shielding quenches the electron channels , while at the same time it supports the ion channels . \n the large random velocities of the electrons allow the ion channels to keep sustaining strong magnetic fields . \n this is qualitatively different from the case of a pair plasma , where no shielding mechanism operates . \n the evolution is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . to the left \n we see the initial electron dominated phase , while to the right  further downstream in the shock  the ions dominate the dynamics forming dense ion channels ; the more diffuse electrons shielding the channels , and the resulting transverse magnetic field indicated with arrows . \n the efficiency of conversion of the injected kinetic to magnetic energy , @xmath12 , is around one per cent . \n the full extent of the plasma dynamics operating in collisionless shocks is still not known , but in @xcite ( 2004 ) it was estimated that for a mass ratio @xmath13 of 16 and inflow lorentz boost @xmath1 ( run ii ) the ion channels would survive over 1500 ion skin depths . \n we speculate that with a more realistic mass ratios the debye shielding would be more effective and therefore the ion channels would survive over even larger scales .    , \n at distances less than a debye length from the ion channels electrons are subject to a transverse acceleration towards the ions since the electric field is not fully neutralised . \n there also exists a strong magnetic field and in total this translates into a two component transverse oscillation and acceleration along the flow direction . \n it was shown by @xcite ( 2004 ) that the ion channels are distributed according to a power law and later @xcite ( 2005 ) , showed that this is a consequence of the self similarity in the process of merging ion channels . the acceleration a debye shielding electron receives depends on the size of the ion channel . as a direct consequence of the power law distributed ion channels \n the electron pdf obtain a non  thermal energy tail as shown in fig . \n this is a local acceleration mechanism , that only depends on the local electromagnetic field . because the electrons are decelerated when moving away from the channel ; the principal energy losses are radiative ( e.g.  bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and jitter radiation ) . \n it also implies that no high energy electrons are available for recursive acceleration processes through this mechanism . \n we have confirmed this by an exhaustive search through a representative dataset of @xmath14 particles . by tracking back and forth in time \n we found only @xmath15 possible candidate particles , that had managed to escape retaining their energy . \n it happened at places where the ion channel made sudden bends and mergers and the electromagnetic fields were not well approximated as static fields . \n none of them showed any sign of recursive acceleration . \n downstream of the shock in run ii . \n the dot  dashed line is a power law fit to the non thermal high energy tail . \n the dashed curve is a lorentz boosted thermal electron population . \n [ fig3],width=264 ] \n in this contribution we have presented the results of self consistent pic computer experiments of collisionless shocks . \n we have shown how the two  stream instability naturally generates a highly intermittent dominantly transverse magnetic field containing a few per cent of the equipartition energy . \n the extent of the two stream instability in the case of an ion  electron plasma is unknown ; it clearly depends on the inflow lorentz boost , the density jump and the mass ratio . for @xmath1 a density jump of 3 and an electron  ion mass ratio 16 @xcite ( 2004 ) estimated the instability to be sustained up to 1500 ion skin depths . for realistic mass ratios this could be closer to @xmath16 ion depths . in the neighbourhood of the ion structures electrons \n are continuously accelerated and decelerated . \n the mechanism is local and the power law distributed pdf is created is situ . \n hence the observed radiation may be tied directly to the local conditions of the plasma . in this experiment with @xmath1 \n we found a power law index of @xmath17 . \n the mechanism does not rule out fermi acceleration . \n the lack of evidence in our numerical experiment for any recursive acceleration processes can be due to the limited extent of the simulated region . \n it may , though , overcome some of the difficulties pointed out by @xcite ( 2004 ) . \n @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 should not be understood as free parameters . to unravel the dependence on the outflow velocity and density jump a parameter study or better theoretical understanding of the non \n linear evolution is needed . \n it is also clear that the non  thermal electron acceleration , the ion current channels and the magnetic field generation are beyond an mhd description and techniques respecting the full phase  space description of the plasma is needed to further the understanding of collisionless shocks .", "StartTimeOffset": 2902256956472, "RequestID": "c55ad46ae1862c8ade9b45ddcafc2559aaf1d1a6", "TotalTokens": 2133}

{"ContextTokens": 3606, "GeneratedTokens": 86, "SynthesizedBody": "our purpose is to analyse a set of a0-type , non - giant stars , in order to define a sample to be used as _ standard stars _ for further studies . \n these stars have parallaxes mesured from the hipparcos experiment and their position in the hr diagram will be used to derive their evolutionary status . \n the spectra obtained in the h@xmath2 region are used to detect peculiarities as well as to check the fit with theoretical spectra computed with @xmath0 and @xmath1 values determined from calibrations of colour indices . \n all stars with a spectral type a0v in the bright stars catalogue ( 1982 ed . ) \n ( hereafter bsc ) , excluding those recognized as peculiar , shell stars and sb2 have been selected ; this sample contains 230 objects . \n spectroscopic data refer to a second sample of a0 stars brighter than the 7th magnitude extracted from a larger set of a - type stars defined in the framework of our eso key programme ( gerbaldi et al . 1989 ) . \n slightly more than 70 a0 type stars were extracted from this set , for which spectra were obtained in the spectral range 4200 - 4500    using the echelec spectrograph attached to the 1.52-m eso telescope . \n all the observations were done at the european southern observatory ( eso ) , la silla , chile . \n the already known peculiar stars , ap and am , were a priori excluded from the sample . \n the atmospheric parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 were derived from calibrated colour indices because we had not enough data to derive @xmath0 from the infrared flux method ( blackwell et al . \n very few attention has been given up to now to the dwarf stars in the range of spectral types a0  a3 where the balmer line profiles vary with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n any calibration of colour indices in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 rely upon : + @xmath3 synthetic indices + these are affected by the ingredients used to compute the atmosphere models and then the synthetic spectra ( chemical abundances , convection ... ) + the synthetic indices are used to define the _ zero point _ by comparing their values to those of some standard stars . \n + @xmath3 _ well determined _ values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 + the most commonly used @xmath0 values are those deduced by code et al . \n ( 1976 ) using the angular diameters measured by hanbury - brown et al . \n ( 1974 ) and the energy distribution from the uv to the infrared . \n the @xmath1 values are obtained from binary systems . \n very recently new measurements of the stellar angular diameters have been done in australia ( see booth , 1997 ) , but they have not been incorporated into the re - calibration of any photometric system . the accuracy of the infrared flux method to determine @xmath0 has been extensively discussed by mgessier ( 1994 , 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ) . \n the best sources of information for @xmath0 and @xmath1 for our sample of early type stars , are the uvby@xmath4 and geneva photometric systems . \n several calibrations of the uvby@xmath4 system exist ; we shall use that by moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) ( hereafter quoted md ) which has been tested and refined since more than a decade . \n the md calibration relies upon synthetic colours and indices from relyea and kurucz ( 1978 ) , philip and relyea ( 1979 ) , schmidt ( 1979 ) and kurucz ( 1979 ) . \n the zero point has been adjusted by means of stars with _ well determined _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 values . \n the photometric calibration for b - type stars has been re - evaluated by castelli ( 1991 ) . \n tests on this calibration done by balona ( 1994 ) and by napiwotzki et al . \n ( 1993 ) have shown that no important modification of the md calibration is needed for early a - type stars . \n napiwotzki et al . \n ( 1993 ) suggested a small correction to be done on @xmath1 for @xmath5  k. smalley and dworetsky ( 1995 ) re - evaluated the _ fundamental _ values of @xmath0 as determined by code et al . \n ( 1976 ) using recent flux measurements ; no significant differences were found by these authors . \n to conclude , up to now , no revision of the md calibration of the uvby@xmath4 is required for dwarf a0 stars . \n the calibration of the geneva photometry for early - type stars is very recent ( knzli et al . 1997 ) ; this system is quite independent from the previous one in the sense that it does not include any narrow band centered on a balmer line ; moreover , its calibration is done using recent kurucz flux computations and it is based on a different and larger set of standard stars . \n it is therefore interesting to compare the results obtained from these two systems and to analyse the coherence of the parameters obtained from different aspects of the emitted stellar flux . \n before computing the atmospheric parameters , the observed colour indices must be de - reddened . for the bright stars of our sample , their visual magnitude being less than 7.0 mag , \n the reddening is expected to be null or negligible .    even though the reddening is expected to be negligible , we tested it ; we used the programme uvbybeta by moon ( 1985 ) in order to check the consistency of the observed values in term of `` normality '' of the star . \n we know that any `` blueing '' can be interpreted as due to a bp - ap effect , and any strong reddening requires to have a close look at the spectrum . \n the determination of the amount of reddening is based on an empirical calibration of the uvby@xmath4 system , so it is free from any atmospheric model . \n jordi et al . \n ( 1997 ) have discussed the reddening law of hilditch ( 1983 ) adopted by moon ( 1985 ) ; they have shown that moon overestimates the e(b - y ) value compared to another de - reddening law : the one by grosbol ( 1978 ) . due to the fact that the stars of our sample have a small value of their colour excess e(b - y ) , \n the error made by using one or the other reddening law will be small . \n we have shown ( gerbaldi et al . \n 1997 ) that a moderate reddening of e(b - y)=0.01 produces a difference in @xmath0 of 200k ( see figure 1 in ref . \n cited ) ; on @xmath1 determination , the effect is negligible ( see figure 2 in ref . cited ) . \n the stars which are outside the mean relation have values of the parameters a@xmath6 and r which are outside the limits of the grids used by the md programme ; it is a numerical effect which produces an incorrect result .    in fact a small non - zero value for e(b - y ) \n can arise from uncertainties on the colours as well as on the _ group choice_.      dereddening procedures for a0-type stars require to assign these stars to one of these groups : + @xmath3 early group : 2.59 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 2.88 + @xmath3 intermediate group 2.87 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 2.93 + in moon s ( 1985 ) programme uvbybeta the information concerning the spectral type is added . \n the assignement to a group is sometimes ambiguous , errors in group selection can not be avoided and this may produce uncertain dereddened colours . \n we have estimated the effect on @xmath0 , @xmath1 of a wrong group selection , which can be due to an observational error on the value of @xmath4 . to select the stars to do such a test , we have considered an error on @xmath4 of @xmath9 , so the @xmath4 limits are 2.869 and 2.890 .    from our sample of a0v stars we have 28 stars with 2.869 @xmath7 @xmath4 @xmath7 2.880 and 22 stars in the range 2.880 @xmath7 @xmath4 @xmath7 2.890 . \n for each selection of stars we computed @xmath0 , @xmath1 twice , that is in each group : early and intermediate . \n the results are displayed on figs . 1 and 2 . \n for the stars which normally belong to the _ early _ group the computations in the _ intermediate _ group give a difference ranging between -70 k and 80 k. for the stars which normally belong to the _ intermediate _ group the computations in the _ early _ group give a difference ranging between -160 k and 60 k. the effect on the colour excess e(b - y ) is at most of @xmath10 ( fig . \n since there is no programme to compute independently the colour excess in the geneva photometric system , we have compared the @xmath0 and @xmath1 values only for stars with no reddening . \n we consider , as above , normal a0v stars from the bsc , but with a further restriction such as : @xmath11 e(b - y ) @xmath12 \n . there are slightly more than 140 objects . for both photometric calibrations the parameters \n were computed using e(b - y)=0 . \n we note ( see fig . \n 4 ) that the values of @xmath0 computed with the md calibration are systematically higher than those derived from the geneva photometry calibration by knzli et al . ( 1997 ) . \n the mean value of the difference between these two @xmath0 is -70  k with a rms of 137  k.    there is also a small systematic effect on the @xmath1 determination : for @xmath13 the value from geneva photometry is higher than that from the md calibration of uvby@xmath4 colours and it is the reverse for @xmath14 . \n we had spectra at a resolution of 28000 for slightly more than 70 stars , most of them being classified a0v and the few remaining ones having a luminosity class iv or iii , or no luminosity class at all . \n the reduction of the spectra was done as described by burnage & gerbaldi ( 1990 , 1992 ) . \n synthetic spectra were computed using the kurucz solar - abundance models ( 1993 ) , and for the atmospheric parameters as computed by the md programme . \n a careful comparison of the synthetic and the observed spectra allows us to detect a small number of : + @xmath3 hot am star + @xmath3 shell star + @xmath3 stars with distorded line profiles which are obviously a signature of binarity . \n + after such a selection we find that about half of the stars in the original sample can be considered normal a0 dwarf stars . \n it is striking to note how many binary stars with similar components have been found from this spectroscopic survey . \n with the subsample of normal stars selected above , we have plotted the hr diagram ( fig . \n 5 ) . in abscissa \n , @xmath0 is that from the md calibration , and @xmath15 is derived from the hipparcos parallax data . \n we remark that there is no direct relation between the luminosity class given by the mk classification and the @xmath15 value ; stars belonging to luminosity class v cover a broad range of @xmath15 . \n the evolutionary tracks by claret & gimnez ( 1992 ) are overplotted on this diagram . \n the spread on fig . \n 5 points out the difficulty to calibrate the spectral type a0 and luminosity class v in terms of @xmath15 . \n this spread is so large that it prevents the detection of binaries simply from an anomalous position in the hr diagram of stars for which only the spectral classification is known . \n balona , l. : 1994 , _ mon . not . \n r. astron . \n _ , * 268 * , 119 blackwell , d.e . , petford , a.d . , \n shallis , m.j . \n et al . : 1980 , _ astron . \n _ , * 82 * , 249 booth , a.j . : 1997 , _ iau symposium _ * 189 * , eds . \n bedding et al . , \n kluwer , 147 burnage , r. and gerbaldi , m. : 1990 , _ \n 2nd eso / st - ecf data analysis workshop _ , \n d. baade , p. grosbol , eso garching , 137 burnage , r. and gerbaldi , m. : 1992 , _ 4nd eso / st - ecf data analysis workshop \n p. grosbol , r.c.e . \n de ruijsscher , eso garching , 159 castelli , f. : 1991 , _ astron . \n _ , * 251 * , 106 claret , a. , gimnez , a. : 1992 , _ astron . \n _ , * 96 * , 255 code , a.d . , \n davis , j. , bless , r.c . \n , hanbury - brown , r. : 1976 , _ astrophys . \n j _ , * 203 * , 417 gerbaldi , m. , mayor , m. : 1989 , _ the messenger _ , * 56 * , 12 gerbaldi , m. , et al . : 1997 , _ highlight in astronomy , 23rd ga of the iau , jd16 _ , in press grosbol p. : 1978 \n , _ astron . \n astrophys . , \n _ , * 32 * , 409 hanbury - brown , r. , davis , j. , allen , l.r . : 1974 , _ mon . not \n r. astron . \n _ , * 167 * , 121 hilditch , r.w . , \n hill , g. , barnes , j.v . \n : 1983,_mon . not . \n r. astron . \n _ , * 204 * , 241 jordi , c. , masana , e. et al . : 1997 , _ astron . \n _ , * 123 * , 83 knzli , m. , north , p. et al . : 1997 , _ astron . \n _ , * 122 * , 51 kurucz , r.l . : 1979 , _ astrophys . j. , suppl . \n _ , * 40 * , 1 kurucz , r.l . : 1993 , cd - rom 18 mgessier , c.:1994 , _ astron . astrophys . _ , * 289 * , 202 mgessier , c.:1995 , _ astron . \n _ , * 296 * , 771 mgessier , c.:1997a , _ iau symposium _ * 189 * , eds . \n bedding et al . , \n kluwer , 61 mgessier , c.:1997b , _ iau symposium _ * 189 * , eds . \n bedding et al . , \n kluwer , 153 moon , t.t . : 1985 , _ comm . from the univ . of london obs . \n _ , * 78 * and revision in : 1985 , private communication moon , t.t . \n , dworetsky , m.m . : 1985 , _ mon . not . \n r. astron . \n _ , * 217 * , 305 napiwotzki , r. , schnberner , d. , wenske , w. : 1993 , _ astron . \n _ , * 268 * , 653 philip , a.g.d . , relyea , l.j . \n : 1979 , _ astron . j. _ , * 84 * , 1743 relyea , l.j . , \n kurucz , r.l . : 1978 , _ astrophys . \n j. , suppl . \n _ , * 37 * , 45 schmidt , e.g. : 1979 , _ astron . \n j. _ , * 84 * , 1739 smalley , b. , dworetsky , m.m . \n : 1995 , _ astron . \n _ , * 293 * , 446", "StartTimeOffset": 2923727853983, "RequestID": "14d14bcb80a6eb3eace770bbf0d3d955e97088ff", "TotalTokens": 3692}

. in the rg language , this amounts to find acceptable interpolations for the rg flows in intermediate regions between fixed points . in the case of scalar field theory , the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential suppression of the large field configurations operating at strong coupling . \n this problem can be cured by introducing a large field cutoff @xmath2 which eliminates dyson s instability . \n one is then considering a slightly different problem , however a judicious choice of @xmath2 can be used to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy with the original problem ( i. e. , the problem with no field cutoff ) . \n this optimization procedure can be approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and naturally bridges the gap between the weak and strong coupling expansions . \n the workshop on qcd in extreme environments was held right after the lattice 2004 conference . \n the talk of k. wilson about the early days of lattice gauge theory was a very inspirational moment of lattice 2004 . \n he stressed the importance of , in his own words , `` butchering field theory '' in the development of the rg ideas and recommended that we keep doing it . in the following \n , we will be butchering field theory in the space of field configurations . \n we are interested in the effects of a large field cutoff on observables ( we expect the effect to be small if the field cutoff is large enough and the observable is not a product of too many fields ) and on the coeffients of the perturbative series for the observables ( we expect the effect to be drastic for the large order behavior ) . for scalar fields , \n there are many ways to accomplish this task . \n the configurations can be ranked according to the largest absolute value of the field or according to the average over the sites of even powers of the field . \n the larger the power is , the more emphasis is put on the configurations with the largest field values . as one may suspect , there exists correlations among the results obtained with different cutoff procedures . for gauge theory , we can define the concept of small or large field configurations in the landau gauge and in a gauge invariant way . \n this was one of the questions that we discussed at lattice 2004 and an account can be found in ref . \n @xcite . instead of duplicating \n , we will rather give an elementary discussion of our motivations and existing results in the scalar case and explain how we expect to extend them in the gauge case . \n recent progress are briefly discussed at the end . \n the best way to understand why the perturbative series of @xmath4 problems in various dimensions generically have a zero radius radius of convergence is to consider the integral @xmath5 the peak of the integrand of the r.h.s . \n moves too fast when the order increases . \n more precisely , @xmath6 is maximum at @xmath7 such that @xmath8 . \n the truncation of @xmath9 at order @xmath10 is accurate provided that @xmath11 . a good accuracy in the region where the integrand is maximum requires @xmath12 , which implies @xmath13 . \n note also that the exponential function converges uniformly over a finite interval but _ not _ over @xmath14 and consequently one can not interchange the sum and the integral . \n on the other hand , if we introduce a field cutoff , the peak moves outside of the integration range and we get a converging expansion @xmath15 in general we expect that for a finite lattice , the partition function @xmath16 calculated with a field cutoff is convergent and @xmath17 has a finite radius of convergence . \n the problem with the field cut differs from the original problem but the difference can be made exponentially small . \n the method works well in nontrivial examples . \n this has been checked @xcite for the hierarchical model and in the continuum for quantum mechanical problems ( the anharmonic oscillator and the double - well potential ) . \n in this section , we describe graphical representations of the accuracy reached at different orders in perturbation theory . \n we typically want to know the number of ( correct ) significant digits that can be obtained at a given order for a given coupling . \n three situations are represented in fig . \n [ fig : sd ] . for @xmath18 \n , the accuracy always increases when we increase the order . in the case of @xmath19 , \n this is the case only if @xmath20 and the lines have a focus point at @xmath21 . on the other hand , for the integral discussed in the previous section , \n the lines move left as they rotate and one sees an envolope that delimitates a `` forbidden region '' for the accuracy of perturbation theory . at fixed and not too large coupling , the accuracy first increases and then decreases with the order . \n the `` rule of thumb '' consists in stopping when the accuracy is optimal , in other words , when we reached the envelope discussed above . \n note also that the lines flatten near 14 on the left of the graph . \n this simply reflects that we have only 14 digits of accuracy in our numerical calculation of the integral . \n ( upper left ) and @xmath22 ( upper right ) , and orders 1 , 2 , ... , 20 for the integral discussed in section 2 ( lower ) . as the order increases , the lines `` rotate '' clockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=259 ]    ( upper left ) and @xmath22 ( upper right ) , and orders 1 , 2 , ... , 20 for the integral discussed in section 2 ( lower ) . as the order increases , the

increases , the lines `` rotate '' clockwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    when a field cut is introduced , the series apparently become convergent and we can make a significant , but localized in coupling , incursion in the forbidden region of perturbation theory . \n this is illustrated for three different field cuts in fig . \n [ fig : cutanh ] in the case of the ground state of the anharmonic oscillator .    in an ideal world \n , we would pick a field cut large enough to reduce the errors ( due to the field cut ) to an acceptable level . \n we would then calculate enough terms in order to reach an accuracy consistent with this level . in practice , \n we are usually limited to calculations up to a certain order . \n the field cut can then be chosen in order to minimize the error at that order . from fig . \n [ fig : cutanh ] , one can see that it is possible to pick a cut that makes the accuracy optimal in the neighborhood of some given value of the coupling @xmath23 . when the numerical answer is known , it is easy to adjust the field cut in order to optimize the accuracy . \n when the answer is not known , one can use an approximation . in ref . \n @xcite , we showed that for the integral eq . \n ( 1 ) , the strong coupling expansion can be used to determine approximately the optimal field cut . this way strong and weak coupling expansions can be combined coherently .    up to now \n , we have defined the field cut locally in configuration space ( at each lattice site ) . \n it is however possible to proceed differently and to use the average of even powers of the fields to sort the configurations . \n there exist correlations among these indicators @xcite . \n we now report our attempts to extend the modification of perturbation theory discussed above in the scalar case to lgt . \n perturbation theory for lgt has been developed almost 20 years ago @xcite . \n exact calculations up to 3 loops @xcite and numerical calculations for 8 @xcite and 10 loops @xcite are available . \n it proceeds in 3 steps .    1 .   with the convention @xmath24 , we set @xmath25 at every link . \n we extend the range of integration of @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( anything else would be unpratical ! ) 3 . \n we then expand in powers of @xmath28    in step 2 , we added the integration `` tails '' . \n this presumably makes the series nonconvergent ( asymptotic ) as one can observe in the case of large argument expansions of bessel functions . in step 3 , \n one needs to expand the haar measure in power of @xmath28 . \n as the original haar measure is compact and provides a natural field cut , we would like to see what happens when the integral get decompactified in step 2 . \n for this purpose , we consider the simple example of a one link @xmath29 integral . \n we use the parametrization of @xmath29 @xmath30 with @xmath31 covering the 2-sphere and @xmath32 . with this parametrization \n we cover the @xmath29 manifold exactly once . \n alternatively , we could extend the range to @xmath33 , but then we need to identify opposite points on the sphere if we want to avoid a double coverage . in these coordinates , \n the invariant haar measure reads @xmath34 after we switched to the @xmath35 measure @xmath36 , we obtain the haar correction @xmath37}$ ] . \n note that @xmath38 $ ] has a radius of convergence @xmath39 , but all the coefficients are negative . \n so when we expand _ in the exponential _ , the large negative contributions in the region @xmath40 effectively cutoff these contributions . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : haar1 ] . \n however , in perturbation theory we have @xmath41 and we need to expand the exponential in powers of @xmath28 . \n the measure then `` periodicizes '' and we obtain a multiple coverage of the manifold as shown in fig . \n [ fig : haar2 ] . \n the logarithm of the haar measure is also used in the context of gluon equations of state @xcite .    . \n the ground state of the double - well potential @xmath42 can be expanded in powers of @xmath43 . except for the zeroth order contribution , \n all the coeffients of the series are negative and their magnitude grow factorially with the order . \n the borel transform has poles on the positive real axis . \n the difference between the beginning of the perturbative series and the numerical values is bounded by the instanton effect @xmath44 qualitatively similar features are expected for the perturbative expansion of @xmath45 in pure gauge @xmath46 defined as @xmath47 with @xmath48 the comparison between the numerical values and successive orders are shown in fig . \n [ fig : num ] .     for the double well potential ( left ) . \n the blue / green lines represent the first orders of perturbation theory .

successive orders in perturbation theory \n are shown in fig . \n [ fig : acc ] . \n note that unlike the scalar case , the weak coupling ( large @xmath49 ) is now displayed on the right of the figure .    . \n for the double - well ( left ) , the significant digits are bounded by the instanton effect @xmath50 ( red curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=288]0.4 in . for the double - well ( left ) , the significant digits are bounded by the instanton effect @xmath50 ( red curve).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    appropriate field cuts can restore the instanton effects in the perturbative series @xcite . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : dwcut ] where the modified series allows us to go above the instanton envelope . \n we expect to be able to achieve similar results for @xmath0 . \n in particular , we expect to be able to use the strong coupling expansion to obtain an optimal choice of field cut , since the validity of this expansion seems to extend close to the scaling window . \n [ fig : strong ] indicates that the radius of convergence of the strong coupling expansion is between 4 and 6 for @xmath49 . \n this series was calculated using the expansion of the free energy of ref . \n at the time of the workshop , we presented results related to the questions discussed below . \n since our understanding has evolved in the meantime , we will give a brief summary and refer to recent preprints for more details . \n we have attempted to follow the same procedure as for the scalar models , for gauge models using the landau gauge where @xmath51 should play a role analogous to @xmath52 in scalar models . \n we found correlations between the lattice average of this quantity and the average action . \n however , we found no correlations between the average and the maximum value . \n these results are explained in more detail in the proceedings of lattice 2004 @xcite . \n the lack of correlation is due to the imperfect way the landau gauge condidtion is implemented numerically . \n this is being remedied @xcite . \n we considered wilson s @xmath46 lattice gauge theory ( without fermions ) at negative values of @xmath53 and for @xmath54=2 or 3 . \n we showed that in the limit @xmath55 , the path integral is dominated by configurations where links variables are set to a nontrivial element of the center on selected non intersecting lines . for @xmath56 , \n these configurations can be characterized by a unique gauge invariant set of variables , while for @xmath57 a multiplicity growing with the volume as the number of configurations of an ising model is observed . in general , there is a discontinuity in the average plaquette when @xmath43 changes its sign which prevents us from having a convergent series in @xmath43 for this quantity . for @xmath56 , \n a change of variables relates the gauge invariant observables at positive and negative values of @xmath49 . for @xmath57 \n , we derived an identity relating the observables at @xmath49 with those at @xmath49 rotated by @xmath58 in the complex plane and showed numerical evidence for a ising like first order phase transition near @xmath59 . \n so far we see no obvious connections to the known singularities @xcite . \n these results are discussed in more detail in a recent preprint @xcite . for another approach of problems at negative coupling \n @xcite . \n we revisited the question of the convergence of lattice perturbation theory for a pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions . using the most recent calculation of the weak coupling expansion of the plaquette average \n , we showed that the extrapolated ratio and the extrapolated slope suggest a nonanalytical power behavior at @xmath60 with an exponent @xmath61 in agreement with an existing analysis @xcite . \n we found indications for a possible singularity in the third derivative of the free energy on @xmath62 and @xmath63 lattices . \n as the lattice size increases , the statistical errors become large and a significantly larger number of independent configurations is needed in order to draw definite conclusions . \n this will be discussed in a forthcoming preprint @xcite . \n [ [ a - proposal - for - a -

{"ContextTokens": 1902, "GeneratedTokens": 92, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most powerful pulsars in gamma rays is the crab pulsar @xcite , psr j0534 + 220 , which is the remnant of a historical supernova that was observed in 1054 a.d . \n it is located at a distance of 6500 light years , has a rotation period of @xmath033 ms , a spin - down power of @xmath1erg s@xmath2 and a surface magnetic field of @xmath3 g @xcite .    within the corotating magnetosphere , charged particles \n are accelerated to relativistic energies and emit non - thermal radiation from radio waves through gamma rays . in general , gamma - ray pulsars exhibit a break in the spectrum between a few hundred mev and a few gev . \n mapping the cut - off can help to constrain the geometry of the acceleration region , the gamma - ray radiation mechanisms and the attenuation of gamma - rays . \n although past measurements of the crab pulsar spectrum are consistent with a power law with exponential cut - off , flux measurements above 10gev are systematically above the best - fit model , suggesting that the spectrum is indeed harder than a power law with exponential cut - off @xcite . however , the statistical uncertainty of the previous data was insufficient to allow a definite conclusion about the spectral shape . \n in this paper we summarise the recent detection of the crab pulsar above 100gev with veritas . \n veritas , the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system , is an array of four 12 m diameter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located in southern arizona , usa @xcite . \n after evidence for pulsed emission was seen in 45 hours of data from the crab pulsar that were recorded between 2007 and 2010 , a deep 62-hour observation was carried out on the crab pulsar between september 2010 and march 2011 . \n the observations were made in `` wobble '' mode with an 0.5 degree offset . after eliminating data taken under variable or poor sky conditions or affected by technical problems , the total analysed data set comprises 107 hours of observations ( 97 hours dead - time corrected ) carried out with all four telescopes . \n the data were taken with the standard veritas trigger setting , and analysed with the standard veritas analysis tools . \n details about the analysis can be found in @xcite . \n the phase - folded event distribution , hereafter pulse profile , of the selected veritas events is shown in figure [ profile ] . \n the most significant structures are two pulses with peak amplitudes at phase 0.0 and phase 0.4 . these coincide with the locations of the main pulse and interpulse , hereafter p1 and p2 , which are the two main features in the pulse profile of the crab pulsar throughout the electromagnetic spectrum . in order to assess the significance of the pulsed emission , we use the h - test @xcite . \n the test result is 50 , which translates into a statistical significance of 6.0 standard deviations that pulsed emission is present in the data . \n the pulse profile has been characterised by an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit ; see the solid black line in figures [ zoomp1 ] and [ zoomp2 ] . in the fit \n , the pulses are modeled with gaussian functions , and the background is determined from the events that fall between phases 0.5 and 0.9 in the pulse profile ( referred to as the off - pulse region ) . \n the positions of p1 and p2 in the veritas data are thus determined to lie at the phase values @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and are shown by the vertical lines figure 1 . \n the full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the fitted pulses are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . \n the pulses are narrower than those measured by fermi - lat at 100 mev by a factor of two to three . \n the energy - dependent narrowing of the pulses is a strong probe of the nature of the magnetospheric particle acceleration region and can be used to shed some light on its geometry , electric field , and gamma - ray emission properties . \n the gamma - ray spectrum above 100gev was measured by combining the signal regions around p1 ( phase -0.013 to 0.009 ) and p2 ( phase 0.375 to 0.421 ) . \n this can be considered a good approximation of the phase - averaged spectrum . \n however , the existence of a flux component that originates in the magnetosphere and is uniformly distributed in phase can not be excluded and would be indistinguishable from the gamma - ray flux from the nebula . \n figure [ sed ] shows the veritas phase - averaged spectrum together with measurements made with fermi - lat and magic . in the energy range between 100gev and 400gev measured by veritas , \n the energy spectrum is well described by a power law @xmath8 , with @xmath9 tev@xmath2 @xmath10 s@xmath2 and @xmath11 . \n the detection of pulsed gamma - ray emission between 200gev and 400gev , the highest energy flux point , is only possible if the emission region is at least 10 stellar radii from the star s \n surface @xcite .    combining the veritas data with the fermi - lat data \n we can place a stringent constraint on the shape of the spectral turnover . \n the previously favoured spectral shape of the crab pulsar above 1gev was an exponential cut - off @xmath12 , which is a good parametrisation of the fermi - lat @xcite and magic @xcite data . \n we note that the fermi - lat and magic data can be equally well parametrised by a broken power law but those data are not sufficient to distinguish significantly between a broken power law and an exponential cut - off . \n the veritas data , on the other hand , clearly favour a broken power law as a parametrisation of the spectral shape . \n the fit of the veritas and fermi - lat data with a broken power law of the form @xmath13 $ ] results in a @xmath14 value of 13.5 for 15 degrees of freedom with the fit parameters @xmath15 tev@xmath2 @xmath10 s@xmath2 , @xmath16gev , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see solid black line in figure 2 ) . \n a corresponding fit with a power law and an exponential cut - off yields a @xmath14 value of 66.8 for 16 degrees of freedom . \n the fit probability of @xmath19 derived from the @xmath14 value excludes the exponential cut - off as a viable parametrisation of the crab pulsar spectrum . \n the conclusions do not change if systematic uncertainties in the energy scale of both experiments are taken into account . \n the detection of pulsed gamma - ray emission above 100 gev provides strong constraints on the gamma - ray radiation mechanisms and the location of the acceleration regions . for example \n , the shape of the spectrum above the break can not be attributed to curvature radiation because that would require an exponentially shaped cut - off . \n in addition , assuming a balance between acceleration gains and radiative losses by curvature radiation , the break in the gamma - ray spectrum is expected to be at @xmath20gev @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the acceleration efficiency ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the radius of curvature in units of the light - cylinder radius @xcite . though @xmath24 can be larger than one , only with an extremely large radius of curvature would it be possible to produce gamma - ray emission above 100gev with curvature radiation . \n it is , therefore , unlikely that curvature radiation is the dominant production mechanism of the observed gamma - ray emission above 100gev . \n two possible interpretations are that either the entire gamma - ray production is dominated by one emission mechanism different from curvature radiation or that a second mechanism becomes dominant above the spectral break energy .    this research is supported by grants from the u.s . \n department of energy office of science , the u.s . national science foundation and the smithsonian institution , by nserc in canada , by science foundation ireland ( sfi 10/rfp / ast2748 ) and by stfc in the u.k . \n we acknowledge the excellent work of the technical support staff at the fred lawrence whipple observatory and at the collaborating institutions in the construction and operation of the instrument . \n a.  n.  otte was in part supported by a feodor lynen fellowship from the alexander von humboldt foundation . \n 99 e.  aliu et al . \n ( veritas collaboration ) , _ science _ , 2011 , 734 vol . \n 69 -

complexity method to achieve the optimum solution  the maximum - likelihood solution and as such , iterative decoding is sub - optimal .    in this paper , we present a method to improve the sub - optimality of the iterative decoding and demonstrate its applications to perpendicular magnetic recording in the presence of media noise . \n the improved method , which is known as the received - vector - coordinate - modification ( rvcm ) algorithm , follows on the previous works of the authors  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite . \n this method is similar to the works of  @xcite and  @xcite . \n this paper also investigates the use of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) mismatch  @xcite to mitigate the effect of media noise . \n the rest of the paper is organised as follows . \n section  [ sec : channel ] describes the perpendicular recording channel used . \n the description of the rvcm algorithm is outlined in section  [ sec : rvcm ] and the performance of this algorithm is demonstrated in section  [ sec : performance ] . \n section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this paper . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] shows the block diagram of the perpendicular recording system model used in this paper . \n the user data , denoted as @xmath0 , is a sequence of of input symbols taking values of @xmath1 . \n some error - protection redundancy is added to the sequence @xmath0 by the error - correcting - codes ( ecc ) encoder forming codeword sequence @xmath2 . to simulate the write current , \n the sequence @xmath2 is mapped to @xmath3 according to @xmath4 operation . \n the scaling factor of @xmath5 is to ensure the transition takes values of @xmath6 . \n we assume that the read head produces zero voltage in the region of magnetic transitions and some voltage in the region of constant magnetic polarity . \n we approximate the single - transition step response , denoted as @xmath7 , using the hyperbolic - tangent function  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the saturation level or the amplitude from zero to peak ( normalised to unity ) and @xmath10 is the time taken for @xmath7 to go from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . \n it is assumed that @xmath13 and @xmath10 are normalised to the symbol period , @xmath14 . throughout the paper , it is assumed that @xmath15 . \n we define the response of two adjacent transitions ( dibit - response ) @xmath16 as : @xmath17 and the readback signal @xmath18 is simply the convolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 plus some noise : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the overall noise in the recording system which consists of media , jitter and electronic noise , i.e. @xmath21 .    the media noise , @xmath22 originates from the imperfections of the media and its effect is significant in the magnetic transition regions . \n typically , media noise is approximately four times the electronic noise at transition regions . in our system model \n , we consider the media noise as additive - white - gaussian - noise ( awgn ) with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath24 , which exists in the transition region only . as \n shown in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] , the media saturation noise depends on the saturation level and it is evaluated as @xmath25 . unlike media noise which is media dependent , the jitter noise @xmath26 is due to timing imperfection only . to model the sampling jitter noise , @xmath26 , the @xmath27th order taylor approximation is used . the jitter estimation block shown in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] is done with @xmath28th order taylor series expansion of @xmath7 . \n the jitter probability density function is assumed to be uniform , limited by a maximum value . \n the electronic noise , @xmath29 is awgn with mean of @xmath23 and variance of @xmath30 . \n the recording system in fig . \n [ fig : block - diagram ] caters for many different simulation cases with varying degree of electronics , media and sampling jitter noise . \n we define the channel snr as : @xmath31    the noisy readback signal is equalised to @xmath32 pr target which is only optimal for electronic noise at the considered @xmath10  @xcite . \n it serves for comparison purposes only . \n the maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder of the pr channel exchanges extrinsic with the ecc decoder to deliver solution which is used for performance evaluation . \n it has been shown that the rvcm algorithm provides considerable coding gain for parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes  @xcite,@xcite and ldpc codes  @xcite . \n the algorithm can be applied directly to perpendicular recording and is described briefly below . \n let @xmath33 denote an @xmath34tuple vector at the output of the map decoder , that is the a - posteriori probability ( app ) of the map decoder . \n let @xmath35 denote the reliability sequence of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . \n assume that @xmath38 is an integer where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a vector of length @xmath38 . \n * step 1 . * : :    store the vector @xmath41 , let the integer    @xmath42 be initialised to @xmath23 . \n * step 2a . * : :    set @xmath43 and    @xmath44 . \n restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath45 ) . * \n * : :    set @xmath46 . \n restart the iterative    decoder , store the decoded vector    ( @xmath47 ) and restore    @xmath48 , i.e.    @xmath49 \n . * step 3 . * : :    if @xmath50 then set @xmath51 and    continue to * step 2*. otherwise , stop the algorithm and from the list    of all decoded vectors    @xmath52 ,    @xmath53 , choose a    decoded vector that has the minimum euclidean distance . \n it is assumed    that the iterative decoder always outputs a codeword .    from the steps above , \n it is clear that the complexity of the algorithm depends on @xmath38 . \n one of the major obstacles concerning the rvcm algorithm is the difficulty in finding the symbol(s ) that , if modified , can converge the iterative decoder to the maximum - likelihood solution  @xcite,@xcite . \n these symbols are referred as the critical symbols and their distribution is uniform with no sign of vulnerable or favourite symbol positions . \n on the other hand , due to their uniform distribution , it is likely that we can find one of the critical symbols if we confine our search to a small group , i.e. keeping the value of @xmath38 low . in this way \n , we can reduce the computational complexity for the price of sub - optimum performance . as we will show later that \n , the gain obtained by confining @xmath38 to a small value is still significant compared to the performance of the standard iterative decoder . \n there are various methods for selecting the critical symbols , see  @xcite for details . in this paper \n , we restrict the selection to one method only , that is the reliability of the app at the output of the map decoder . \n we evaluate the performance of the rvcm algorithm on some short - block length turbo and ldpc codes . fig . \n [ fig : turbo - sm0 ] and  [ fig : turbo - sm4 ] show the error rate performance of the turbo code under the standard iterative and rvcm decoders . \n the turbo code considered is the @xmath54 tail - biting turbo code , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58interleaver . \n significant improvement is noticed and the increase in performance gets better as snr increases . \n it is worth noting that the results in fig . \n [ fig : turbo - sm4 ] were obtained using snr mismatch technique . with this technique , \n the improvement in performance over standard iterative decoder is even greater as snr increases . in the presence of media noise , \n snr mismatch methods do not provide the same performance as observed with electronics noise only  @xcite , however better targets for media noise are being investigated by the authors . \n error performance of rvcm decoder on the turbo code in the presence of electronic noise only , width=220 ]    error performance of rvcm decoder on the turbo code in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    error performance of rvcm decoder on the @xmath59 cyclic ldpc code in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    performance of the @xmath60 cyclic and @xmath61 codes in the presence of electronic and media noise , width=220 ]    similar performance improvement is observed for the ldpc codes , see fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] . \n the @xmath59 cyclic ldpc code , which has minimum - distance of @xmath62 , was constructed using a method described in  @xcite . as mentioned earlier , the rvcm algorithm allows one to trade off the performance against the computational complexity . from fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 127 - 84 ] , despite the performance obtained by setting @xmath63 is approximately @xmath64db inferior to that by setting @xmath65 , the coding gain from the standard iterative decoding is significant . for the case of @xmath63 , we select the critical symbols based on the reliability measure at the output of the map decoder . from the vector @xmath41 , we construct a vector @xmath66 of length @xmath38 such that @xmath67 . in fig . \n [ fig : gf2 - 255 - 175 ] , we compare the performance of the @xmath60 cyclic code and that of the @xmath68 quasi - cyclic code . \n we can see that the rvcm algorithm provides significant gain , within one order of magnitude improvement , over the bp algorithm . at approximately @xmath69 ber , \n the performance of the cyclic code with rvcm is within @xmath70db away from the longer code under bp decoding . \n we have shown that the application of the rvcm algorithm to perpendicular magnetic recording shows promising results . \n simulation results show that improvement of within one order of magnitude is possible . \n short block length offers an attractive error - correction scheme in which rvcm algorithm can be fully exploited by setting @xmath65 . \n a bank consisting of @xmath71 parallel rvcm decoders can be built on chips and the decoding of short - block length data has low latency . \n the performance of longer block - length codes , up to a certain error - rate , can be outperformed by the application of rvcm algorithm to shorter codes . \n the exact point , at which the longer codes start to perform better , depends on the code structure . \n we also extended our investigations on using some non binary cyclic ldpc codes  @xcite and we observe similar improvement as in the binary cases . \n further investigations in identifying the critical symbols will allow the application of rvcm algorithm to long powerful codes . \n the authors would like to thank prof . \n barry k. middleton of university of manchester for the channel noise discussion . \n e.  papagiannis , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  tomlinson , `` analysis of non convergence blocks at low and moderate snr in scc turbo schemes , '' _ spsc 2003 8^th^ international worksop on signal processing for space communications , catania , italy _ , pp .  121128 , sep . \n e.  papagiannis , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  tomlinson , `` approaching the ml performance with iterative decoding , '' _ international zurich seminar on communications , zurich , switzerland _ , pp .  220223 , feb . \n c.  j. tjhai , e.  papagiannis , m.  tomlinson , m.  a. ambroze , and m.  z. ahmed , `` improved iterative decoder for ldpc codes with performance approximating to a maximum likelihood decoder .

periodic rather than periodic , with a decreasing cycle from start to end . but are the fluctuations due to a single azimuthal perturbation ( i.e. , a  hotspot \" ) , or from a global pattern of disturbance with a speed not directly associated with the underlying keplerian period @xcite ? in this _ \n letter _ we examine the nature of the observerd quasi - period , and focus on its implications for the flow of matter through the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . a principal result of this study is a ray - tracing simulation of the general - relativistically ( gr ) modulated lightcurve produced as the disrupted plasma spirals inwards towards the disk s  stress edge \" @xcite . \n magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of sgr a * s disk demonstrate the growth of a rossby -

period associated with the pattern speed rather than the keplerian motion @xcite . \n however , mhd simulations of black - hole accretion suggest that magnetic reconnection might take place within the plunging region , due to the presence of a non - axisymmetric spiral density structure , initially caused by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) associated with differential rotation of frozen - in plasma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in this case \n , the accreting flow is no longer keplerian because of a radial velocity component . \n if sgr a * s quasi - period of @xmath5 1725 minutes is associated with this kind of process rather than a pattern rotation , it would place the corresponding emission region at @xmath6@xmath7 radii , below the isco ( where @xmath8 ) for a schwarzschild bh . \n theoretically , we may therefore distinguish the isco from the radius at which the inspiraling material actually detaches from the rest of the magnetized disk  the so - called _ stress _ edge @xcite . \n the x - ray modulation would then be associated with the ever - shrinking period of the emitting plasma as it spirals inwards from the magnetic flare . \n interest in `` hotspots '' began in the early 1980 s in connection with quasi - periodic flux modulations observed in bhs accreting from a binary companion . \n the hotspots are possibly overdense emission regions associated with magnetic instabilities . but even with a hotspot , a newtonian disk does not produce a modulation since its aspect does not affect the total luminosity observed from it . \n other than a dynamical periodicity ( such as that due to an azimuthal , radial , or vertical oscillation ) , only gr effects can produce time - dependent photon trajectories resulting in a modulated lightcurve ( see e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n even so , the  standard \" disk picture of hotspot modulation has been based on keplerian motion , for which one then expects a time variability directly related to the keplerian frequency . here \n , the modulation is not associated with such a fixed keplerian frequency , but from a shrinking orbit and a monotonically decreasing period ( see   [ model ] ) . \n the relevance of hotspots has already appeared in ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for review ) . \n what is lacking , however , is a non keplerian treatment of the motion with the intent of probing the stress edge itself . \n so where exactly is the inner edge of the accretion disk in sgr a * ? \n this is a question asked in a broader context by @xcite , whose mhd simulations of the plunging region in a pseudo - newtonian potential identified several characteristic inner radii . here , we assume a non - spinning bh , so our model pertains solely to the schwarzschild case . \n the monotonic decrease of the period during the flares suggests that we are witnessing the evolution of an event moving inwards across the isco . the inflow time scale , @xmath9 , which determines the rate at which plasma can move from one orbit to another , is given by @xmath10 minutes @xcite and is approximately 23.5 minutes at @xmath11 , corresponding to the isco for a non - rotating ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) bh . \n this time scale does not explicitly depend on a viscosity parameter since the viscosity is directly tied to the mri physical process via the induced maxwell stress @xcite . \n the inflow time scale defined here characterizes local processes occurring within the innermost portion of the disk during the flares . by comparison , \n the dynamical time scale , @xmath13 , is roughly @xmath14 minutes at this radius @xcite . \n thus , the azimuthal asymmetry giving rise to the modulated flux during the flare may be due to a transient event associated with either a dynamical or viscous process close to the isco @xcite .    for a bh mass of @xmath15 m@xmath16 , the inflow time scale at @xmath17 ( inferred from the _ average _ period ) \n is just slightly larger than the average period , so the event could be due to the sudden reconfiguration of magnetic field lines frozen into plasma rapidly approaching the isco and then flowing across it towards the event horizon . \n matter flowing past the isco may still remain  magnetically \" coupled to the outer accretion flow , so a dynamically more meaningful radius is the so - called _ stress edge _ , where plunging matter loses dynamical contact with the material farther out @xcite . \n this may simply be defined as the surface on which the inflow speed first exceeds the magnetosonic speed .    in their simulations \n , @xcite determined that this surface occurs somewhere between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . \n the specific angular momentum @xmath20 , in terms of the orbital angular frequency @xmath21 , continues to fall below @xmath19 , though @xmath22 may not necessarily trace its keplerian value , @xmath23 . in the absence of any magnetic coupling across @xmath19 \n , matter would retain all of its specific angular momentum at the isco , so that the accreted value of @xmath24 , which we will call @xmath25 , would then simply be @xmath26 . \n instead , the mhd simulations show that @xmath27 , for which @xmath28 is then @xmath29 , within the range of values indicated by the location of the trans - magnetosonic surface .    if the period in sgr a * is decreasing monotonically , @xmath30 will not follow its keplerian value below @xmath19 . therefore we will adopt the formulation @xmath31 to fit the data in   3 . \n clearly , @xmath32 corresponds to keplerian rotation ; @xmath33 is @xmath34 in the extreme case of angular momentum conservation . \n a reasonable fit to the data would therefore be associated with @xmath35 . at the boundary @xmath19 , \n we expect @xmath36 , which then forces the constant @xmath37 to have the value @xmath38 . \n we calculate @xmath28 using the quasi - periods 17 and 25 minutes emerging from the x - ray lightcurve ( see   [ model ] ) , and this is plotted as a function of @xmath33 in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . \n the radius @xmath28 falls within the range @xmath6@xmath39 for all permitted values of @xmath33 . the corresponding accreted specific angular momentum , for the same parameters as used before ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] ) , is @xmath40 as a function of @xmath33 . \n the ratio @xmath41 from the mhd simulations would require @xmath42 , for which @xmath43 . \n these results are consistent with the mhd simulations , indicating that the infalling plasma below the isco remains magnetically coupled to the outer disk , though the dissipation of angular momentum is not quite strong enough in this region to force the gas into keplerian rotation . \n with @xmath21 known , we now incorporate strong gravitational effects in a geometrically and optically thin disk , describing the inspiraling disturbance using coordinates ( @xmath44 ) in the co -

rays are produced via inverse compton scattering from the seed photon number flux . \n thus , with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the synchrotron emissivity in units of energy per unit volume per unit time , the soft photon flux scales as the emitted power divided by the characteristic area . \n that is , @xmath96 , which is going to be roughly the same scaling as the seed photon density , so @xmath97 . \n the inverse compton scattering emissivity is therefore @xmath98 . \n thus , @xmath99 , and the surface intensity is @xmath100 , which gives finally @xmath101 . \n the flux at a given azimuthal angle @xmath102 and radius @xmath103 is calculated from a numerical computation of @xmath104 , followed by a calculation of the doppler shift , lensing effects , and the flux @xmath105 as a function of the arrival time . \n for the persistent emission we use the best fit spectral parameters to the _ chandra _ data @xcite , described above as a surface emissivity @xmath88 . \n the observed flare normalized flux is modeled with two polynomials , one between 0100 minutes and the second from 100 - 160 minutes ( see also * ? ? ? \n the value @xmath67 is fixed at 11 to have the six observed cycles ( see fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] , solid line ) . the free parameters to fit the data are the inclination angle @xmath106 and the @xmath33 value . \n the integrated flux is calculated for an extended spiral wave 90@xmath107 long in the azimuthal direction and @xmath108 in the radial direction , plus the persistent emission . \n the mhd simulations show that in the innermost part of the disk a spiral - arm often expands out to @xmath109 ( see , e.g. , hawley 2001 ) . \n the radial extent of the inspiraling region is set by the observed condition that six cycles should fit within the overall migration of the plasma from the isco to the stress edge . in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ( solid line ) , we show the best fit model for @xmath110 and @xmath111 . \n if we adopt the simple view that the last period corresponds to the isco , then sgr a * with a mass of @xmath112 must be spinning at a rate @xmath113 . with a more realistic analysis of the magnetic coupling between matter in the plunging region and that beyond the isco \n , we conclude that the peak of the instability probably occurs at @xmath114 , where the period is @xmath115 minutes , and the flaring activity continues as the plasma spirals inwards , ending several orbits later when the matter crosses the stress edge at @xmath116 . \n the significance of the fit for an inspiraling disturbance is @xmath117 , compared to @xmath118 for a fixed keplerian period ( see dotted curve in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) . \n an inspiraling disturbance is preferred over a fixed orbit by a factor 2.6 in the reduced @xmath119 . \n the residuals in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] show that the model using a fixed period produces modulations that are progressively shifted in phase with respect to the data , by as much as @xmath120 minutes by the end of the flare . \n the inspiraling model , on the other hand , follows the evolution of the flare and therefore fits the data much better . \n plasma on such an orbit also produces a constant pulsed fraction@xmath121 of @xmath122 , compared with a linear increase from @xmath123 to @xmath124 for the inspiralling wave ; this effect is due to a radially - dependent gravitational lensing effect . \n together , these two effects render the inspiraling scenario a better explanation for the data than the fixed orbit disturbance .", "StartTimeOffset": 2982174933587, "RequestID": "264c5176f08ef880744fac0bb8c8c640d6368fc6", "TotalTokens": 4131}

case approximation ratio of @xmath0 under @xmath1-norm for 01 valued matrices , and of @xmath2 under @xmath3-norm for real valued matrices . \n finally , note that our final solution is constructed on top of a standard clustering algorithm ( applied twice , once in row vectors and the other in column vectors ) and therefore , it is necessary to multiply our ratio with the approximation ratio achieved by the used standard clustering algorithm ( such as @xcite ) . for clarity \n , we will lift this restriction in the following proofs by assuming that the applied one - way clustering algorithm provides directly an optimal solution to the standard clustering problem . \n this basic algorithmic problem and several variations were initially presented in @xcite with the name of direct clustering . \n the same problem and its variations have also been referred to as two - way clustering , co - clustering or subspace clustering . in practice , finding highly homogeneous biclusters has important applications in biological data analysis ( see @xcite for review and references ) , where a bicluster may , for example , correspond to an activation pattern common to a group of genes only under specific experimental conditions . \n an alternative definition of the basic biclustering problem described in the introduction consists on finding the maximal bicluster in a given matrix . \n a well - known connection of this alternative formulation is its reduction to the problem of finding a biclique in a bipartite graph  @xcite . \n algorithms for detecting bicliques enumerate them in the graph by using the monotonicity property that a subset of a biclique is also a biclique  @xcite . \n these algorithms usually have a high order of complexity . \n we assume given a matrix @xmath8 of size @xmath9 , and integers @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which define the number of clusters partitioning rows and columns , respectively . \n the goal is to approximate the optimal biclustering of @xmath8 by means of a one - way row clustering into @xmath10 clusters and a one - way column clustering into @xmath11 clusters .    for any @xmath12 \n we denote @xmath13 = \\{1,\\ldots , t\\}$ ] . \n we use @xmath14 , where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] , to denote the submatrix of @xmath8 induced by the subset of rows @xmath17 and the subset of columns @xmath18 . \n let @xmath19 denote an induced submatrix of @xmath8 , that is @xmath20 for some @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] . when required by the context \n , we will also refer to @xmath20 as a bicluster of @xmath8 and denote the size of @xmath19 with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . \n we use @xmath24 and @xmath25 to denote the median and mean of all elements of @xmath19 , respectively . \n the scheme for approximating the optimal biclustering is defined as follows . \n +    p0.94 * input : * matrix @xmath8 , number of row clusters @xmath10 , number of column clusters @xmath11 +   + @xmath26 + @xmath27 +   + * output : * a set of biclusters @xmath14 , for each @xmath28 , @xmath29 +    the function @xmath30 denotes here an optimal one - way clustering algorithm that partitions the row vectors of matrix @xmath8 into @xmath10 clusters . \n we have used @xmath31 to denote the transpose of matrix @xmath8 .    instead of fixing a specific norm for the formulas \n , we use the dissimilarity measure @xmath32 to absorb the norm - dependent part . for @xmath1-norm \n , @xmath32 would be defined as @xmath33 , and for @xmath3-norm as @xmath34 . given @xmath19 of size @xmath35 \n , we further use a special row norm , @xmath36,j))}$ ] , and a special column norm , @xmath37))}$ ] . \n we define the one - way row clustering , given by kcluster above , as a partition of rows @xmath38 $ ] into @xmath10 clusters @xmath39 such that the cost function @xmath40 is minimized . \n analogously , the one - way clustering of columns @xmath41 $ ] into @xmath11 clusters @xmath42 is defined such that the cost function @xmath43 is minimized . \n the cost of biclustering , induced by the two one - way clusterings above , is @xmath44    notice that we are assuming that the one - way clusterings above , denoted @xmath45 on rows and @xmath46 on columns , correspond to optimal one - way partitionings on rows and columns , respectively . \n finally , the optimal biclustering on @xmath8 is given by simultaneous row and column partitions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , that minimize the cost @xmath49 \n given the definitions above , our main result reads as follows . \n there exists an approximation ratio of @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for @xmath1-norm and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath3-norm and @xmath55 . \n [ thm : main ]    we use the following intermediate result to prove the theorem . \n there exists an approximation ratio of at most @xmath50 , that is , @xmath56 , if for any @xmath8 and for any partitionings @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath8 , all biclusters @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , satisfy @xmath60 [ lem : alpha ]    first we note that the cost of the optimal biclustering @xmath61 can not increase when we increase the number of row ( or column ) clusters . \n for example , consider the special case where @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) . \n in such case , each row ( or column ) is assigned to its own cluster and the cost of the optimal biclustering equals the cost of the optimal one - way clustering on columns @xmath64 ( or rows @xmath65 ) . \n hence , the optimal biclustering solution is bounded from below by @xmath66    summing both sides of equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) , @xmath67 and using equations ( [ eq : lr ] ) , ( [ eq : lc ] ) and ( [ eq : l ] ) , gives @xmath68 , which together with equation ( [ eq : lower ] ) implies the approximation ratio of @xmath69 . \n theorem [ thm : main ] is proven separately in sections [ sec : l1 ] and [ sec : l2 ] using lemma [ lem : alpha ] . \n section [ sec : l1 ] deals with the case of having a 01 valued matrix @xmath8 and @xmath1-norm distance function , while section [ sec : l2 ] deals with real valued matrix @xmath8 and @xmath3-norm . \n consider a 01 valued matrix @xmath8 and @xmath1-norm . to prove theorem \n [ thm : main ] it suffices to show that equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) holds for each of the biclusters @xmath57 of @xmath8 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n therefore , in the following we concentrate on one single bicluster @xmath70 .    without loss of generality , \n we consider only the case where the bicluster @xmath19 has at least as many 0 s as 1 s . in such case \n , the median of @xmath19 can be safely taken to be zero and the cost @xmath71 is then fixed to the number of 1 s in the matrix . to get the worst case scenario towards the tightest upper bound on @xmath50 in equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) , we should find first a configuration of 1 s such that , given @xmath72 , the sum @xmath73 is minimized . \n denote by @xmath74 and @xmath75 the sets of rows and columns in @xmath19 which have more 1 s than 0 s , respectively . \n denote @xmath76 , @xmath77\\setminus o_c)$ ] , @xmath78\\setminus o_r , o_c)$ ] , @xmath79\\setminus o_r,[m]\\setminus o_c)$ ] , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . \n note that @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath18 and @xmath84 are simply blocks of bicluster @xmath19 , which we need to make explicit in our notation for the proof .    changing a 0 to 1 in @xmath82 or \n a 1 to 0 in @xmath84 decreases @xmath73 by two , while changing a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 in @xmath83 or @xmath18 changes @xmath73 by at most one . \n it follows that _ swapping _ a 1 in @xmath83 or @xmath18 with a 0 in @xmath82 ( see figure [ fig : swaps]a ) , or swapping a 1 in @xmath84 with a 0 in @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig : swaps]b ) decreases @xmath73 while @xmath72 remains unchanged . in other words , in a solution that minimizes @xmath73 no such swaps can be made . in the remainder of this subsection , we assume that the bicluster @xmath19 satisfies this mentioned property . \n it follows that ( i ) @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath18 are blocks of 1 s , ( ii ) @xmath82 is a block of 1 s and @xmath84 is a block of 0 s , or ( iii ) @xmath83 , @xmath18 and @xmath84 are blocks of 0 s . \n denote by @xmath85 the number of 1 s in a given block . \n it follows that @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . \n we denote @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 and rewrite equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) as @xmath95 with constraints @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 $ ] @xmath98 $ ] , as well as ( i ) @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 $ ] ; ( ii ) @xmath99 , @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 ; or ( iii ) @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 . \n the optimization problem has two solutions , ( i ) @xmath108 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath105 , and ( ii ) @xmath109 , @xmath99 and @xmath107 , both solutions yielding @xmath110 when exactly half of the entries in the bicluster @xmath19 are 1 s . \n this proves theorem [ thm : main ] for 01 valued matrices and @xmath1-norm . \n notice that the above proof relies on the fact that the input matrix @xmath8 has only two types of values . \n therefore , the proof does not generalize to real valued matrices . \n an example of a matrix with approximation ratio of 2 is given by a @xmath111 matrix @xmath112 with @xmath113 columns in the first column group , @xmath113 columns in the second column group and @xmath114 columns in the third column group , clustered to two row clusters , @xmath115 , and one column cluster , @xmath116 , at the limit of large @xmath113 . \n the optimal one - way clustering of rows is given by @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and the optimal biclustering of rows by @xmath119 , @xmath120 . \n consider now a real valued matrix @xmath8 and @xmath3-norm . \n we want to prove theorem [ thm : main ] for the real valued biclusters @xmath19 of @xmath8 . \n to find the approximation ratio , it suffices to show that equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) holds for each bicluster @xmath121 , which are determined by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n using the definitions of @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 we can write @xmath125 , where @xmath126,j))+\\mathrm{mean}(y(i,[m]))-\\mathrm{mean}(y)$ ] . hence , equation ( [ eq : thbound ] ) is satisfied for @xmath127-norm and real valued matrices when @xmath54 . \n we have shown that approximating the optimal biclustering with independent row- and column - wise standard clusterings achieves a good approximation guarantee . \n however in practice , standard one - way clustering algorithms ( such as @xmath4-means or @xmath4-median ) are also approximate , and therefore , it is necessary to multiply our ratio with the approximation ratio achieved by the standard clustering algorithm ( such as presented in @xcite ) to obtain the true approximation ratio of our scheme . \n still , our contribution shows that in many practical applications of biclustering , it may be sufficient to use a more straightforward standard clustering of rows and columns instead of applying heuristic algorithms without performance guarantees . \n we thank nikolaj tatti for reading through the manuscript and giving useful comments .", "StartTimeOffset": 3010824902243, "RequestID": "691ffb3e27122fc071f5be540e380ef399f52e6f", "TotalTokens": 3769}

( 1 ) suggest that two nonlinear effects are crucial for oscillations in this system . \n they destabilize @xmath14 and @xmath0 rich surfaces , correspondingly .    in fig . \n 2 we show snapshots of the surface at two different time moments . fig . \n 2a corresponds to the time moment when there are no @xmath6 molecules left on the surface . note that in the original zgb model , for the parameters we have chosen , the system goes to the state fully covered by @xmath8  @xcite \n however , the presence of the inert molecules shown in fig . 2a as the brightest spots , prevent such a fully @xmath8 covered state . \n moreover , these inert molecules allow for the presence of enough vacant sites ; these are shown as black areas in fig . \n 2 . in these vacant areas , \n @xmath0 molecules can be absorbed ; their coverage can grow if they are isolated by the inert molecules from @xmath8 covered areas . by taking into account this nonlinear effect , which includes interaction among @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 , the reaction term in eqn . \n ( 2 ) can be modified as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the blocking coefficient . \n 2b shows nucleation of the @xmath8 covered state on the @xmath6 rich surface . \n as an adsorption of @xmath17 requires two free sites , nucleation of the @xmath8 island may seem an unlikely process , if one starts from the fully @xmath6 covered state as an initial condition . \n however , there is an another nonlinear effect which may lead to explosive growth of an @xmath8 island . \n suppose that the desorptions of two @xmath6 molecules have vacated a pair of adjacent sites . on these sites \n , @xmath17 can be absorbed , and if this happens , @xmath6 and @xmath8 will immediately react . \n as the surface is rich with @xmath6 , the reaction will free four sites . on these four sites \n , two @xmath17 molecules can be absorbed . \n this cascade may lead to explosive growth of the @xmath8 island . \n therefore , there is an another nonlinear effect which is particularly noticeable during a nucleation of an @xmath8 island on a @xmath6 rich surface . in the lowest order of nonlinearity , due to the nonlinear increase of available adjacent free sites through the reaction \n , the growth of @xmath8 can be termed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the coefficient for the nonlinear growth of adjacent free sites . \n we verified that @xmath20 can also serve well for this term . \n the two nonlinear effects manifest themselves randomly in monte carlo simulations . for a macrospcopic description , \n we consider them deterministic processes . \n thus , eqn . \n ( 2 ) can be modified into the form :    @xmath21    we want eqn . \n ( 3 ) as simple as possible . \n we include the reaction term @xmath22 in the first equation only because its effect in the second equation is assumed to be small . \n this assumption stems from a microscopic process : a pair of @xmath8 can not be blocked by a single inert molecule . \n the reason why we include @xmath23 in the second equation only is also taken from a microscopic fact : for the adsorption of @xmath0 , the presence of two free adjacent sites is not essential . \n we note that the two effects were also described by jansen and nieminen  @xcite ; however , they did not include them explicitly in the rate equations . \n we also note that eqn . \n ( 3 ) is much simpler than the rate equations in the pair approximation of eqn . \n ( 1 ) , which do not show oscillations in the parameter range of interest  @xcite . eqn . \n ( 3 ) is an approximate model , and it is desireable to derive it systematically . \n because of its nonlinear terms , analytic treatment of eqn . \n ( 3 ) is difficult . \n nevertheless , it can be studied numerically . \n for example , one may use the software `` xppaut '' by b. ermountrout  @xcite . \n we found that for the occurrence of a hopf bifurcation it is not necessary that both @xmath16 and @xmath19 were nonzero in eqn . \n however , we found that parameter space for oscillations are larger if both @xmath16 and @xmath19 are nonzero .      in the present case , it is difficult to find analytic expressions for the steady states of eqn . \n ( 3 ) . in fig . \n 3 we show a numerical integration of eqn . \n ( 4 ) . here , in contrast to its dynamics shown in fig . \n 1 , the inert molecule concentration remains high . \n we suppose that the main reason for this is that @xmath26 is finite in fig . 3 , but @xmath27 in fig . 1 . \n also , a better choice of the rate constants can be made in order to compare dynamics in the rate equations and monte carlo simulations  @xcite . \n a hopf bifurcation in this system is shown in fig . \n 4 . thus , the nonlinear effects we outlined in the previous section may indeed lead to stable oscillations . \n a two parameter bifurcation diagram is shown in fig . 5 . \n we found that with the increase of @xmath26 , the parameter region for a hopf bifurcation widens . \n we found that such an increase is accompanied by the emergence of saddle nodes .      in the present case , \n the steady states are given by , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a solution to @xmath31    once again we were able to analyze stability of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath30 numerically only . \n oscillations for the present case are shown in fig . \n we note that in the present case , except the hopf bifurcation , saddle node bifurcations occur in the system .      as in the previous case , the steady states of eqn . \n ( 3 ) can be expressed through a polynomial . \n again , we were able to solve the polynomial numerically only . \n as a result , a linear stability analysis of these steady states has turned out to be difficult . \n numerically detected oscillations for the present case are shown in fig . \n note the exceptions of @xmath26 s value and @xmath25 ;

however , the fastethernet would be a bottleneck on the milc code with kogut - susskind quarks . \n even so , a 32 node system with a minimum performance of 1280 and 1660 mflops , for @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites per node , respectively , could be built for under $ 10,500 . \n this works out to a cost / mf of between $ 6.3 and $ 8.2 .    in sec .  2 \n , we describe the key issues for good performance . \n section 3 gives details of single node performance . \n section  4 points the reader to a web site with extensive benchmarks , gives cost estimates for several designs and compares cost - performance ratios for these clusters and a number of supercomputers . for additional information about emerging technologies for clusters \n see ref .  @xcite . \n a very simple approach to achieving good performance for domain decomposition codes like lattice qcd codes is to optimize single node performance and to try to avoid degrading performance too much when one has to communicate boundary values to neighboring nodes . \n the key to a cost effective design is an appropriate balance . \n floating point performance is more easily adjustable than network performance because processors come in many speeds , but there are only a few choices for the network . \n a simple performance model of the kogut - susskind conjugate gradient algorithm gives this bandwidth requirement to overlap communication and floating point operations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the _ achieved _ bandwidth in megabyte / s , @xmath5 is the _ achieved _ floating point speed in megaflop / s on matrix - vector multiplication and an @xmath6 portion of the grid is on each node . \n we assume there are neighboring nodes in each direction , _ \n i.e. _ , 16 or more nodes \n . the constant factor 0.364 is specific to ks quarks . \n however , the @xmath7 behavior is typical of the domain decomposition approach to parallelism and comes from the surface to volume ratio . \n figure [ fig : performance ] shows a log - log plot of measured bandwidth on a ping - pong test for three types of hardware and the performance model for several processor speeds . \n the messages vary in size from 800 bytes to 30 kb for problem sizes of interest . \n the arrows near the bottom of the graph correspond to different l values . \n the fastethernet and myrinet curves come from measured performance on the roadrunner ( rr ) supercluster at the albuquerque high performance computer center . \n two curves are shown for myrinet . with the newer drivers \n , bandwidth is better and smoother . \n the quadrics curve comes from the teracluster at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) . \n the measurement was done using the netpipe program from the ames scalable computing laboratory @xcite . \n the straight lines come from the performance model presented above and are plotted for matrix times vector speeds of 50 , 100 , 200 and 400 mf . \n we need to run at a large enough value of l so that the measured bandwidth is above the straight line ( for whatever speed our processor achieves for the corresponding value of l ) . because of cache effects \n , the processors will achieve higher speeds when @xmath8 is small , but that requires the highest bandwidth . \n thus , pushing up the communication rate for small messages is important . \n being able to run for a small value of @xmath8 with high efficiency allows running a fixed size problem at high total performance . \n we see that none of the networks achieves more than a small fraction of its peak bandwidth for the message sizes of interest . a system design based on achieving that peak bandwidth \n would almost certainly be communication bound , _ \n i.e. _ , money would have been spent on floating point capacity that could not be used . \n there are large differences in the prices of fastethernet , myrinet and quadrics hardware . \n choice of network can obviously play a critical role in system performance and cost - effectiveness . \n the single node performance is likely to depend upon such issues as the quality of the cpu , the performance and size of cache(s ) , the bandwidth to main memory and the quality of the compiler . for message passing performance , \n key issues are the latency , peak bandwidth , processor overhead and the message passing software . \n it is important to make the right choices when designing your system .    for the cpu \n , one can choose among intel celeron , pentium ii , piii , piv , itanium ; amd athlon , thunderbird , duron ; compaq alpha and other possibilities . \n the celeron may have limited performance because it only has a 66 mhz front side bus ( fsb ) . \n if access to memory is important ( as it is for this application ) the 100 or 133 mhz fsb of the pii and piii will be useful . \n the piv is quite new and currently expensive . \n itanium is soon to be available and some results are provided below . the alpha has great performance , but it is expensive . \n there are currently several memory types available for different processors . \n they include pc100 , pc133 , rambus , double data rate ( ddr ) , which is also known as pc1600 or pc 2100 . \n pc100 and pc133 are fairly mature at this stage , and there is little difference in price ( currently about 0.5$/mb ) . \n rambus was quite expensive at introduction , but has recently decreased quite a bit ( currently slightly more than 1$/mb ) . \n ddr is just now coming to market ( micron ) , but it does not carry too much of a premium ( currently similar to rambus ) . \n motherboards that use ddr memory are just coming to market . \n pick the right amount of memory for your problems : you never want your code to swap , but neither do you want to buy a lot of memory that you never use . \n choice of motherboard is crucial . \n it must be matched to the processor and memory . \n the support chip can have an important impact on performance ( as we explore below ) . \n the motherboard determines the number of processors per node . \n we discuss below whether dual processor systems are more or less cost - effective for a particular application . \n the motherboard will also determine whether you have a faster or wider pci bus than the initial standard 33 mhz-32bit bus . \n this may be important if you have a higher speed network like myrinet . \n the last critical choice is the network hardware and software . \n it properly deserves its own section , but to save space we briefly discuss it here . \n fastethernet is the commodity network . \n other choices such a myrinet , giganet , gigabit ethernet , quadrics qsnet and sci from dolphin / scali have higher performance , but are quite expensive compared to fastethernet . \n ( including the card and switch , you can expect to spend about $ 1,500 per node , except for quadrics which is over $ 3,000 per node . ) because of the big jump in price and performance , it is necessary to make sure the system maintains balance between cpu and network . regarding software choices , under fastethernet , mvia@xcite and gamma@xcite software \n have reduced latency compared with standard tcp / ip . \n i have recently tried vmi under myrinet which is being developed at ncsa and found it to be superior to running under standard gm ( myrinet supplied ) driver .      turning next to single node performance \n , we note that it is easy to waste a lot of money on a poor system design . to illustrate this \n , we consider the various speed amd athlon processors available and their prices on two particular days . \n although we focus on athlon here , the same considerations apply to intel or other processors . \n figure [ fig : price_vs_speed ] shows that processor price is a rapidly increasing function of speed . \n it can also be a rapidly decreasing function of time , especially for the faster processors . \n dividing the price by the speed of the chip , we find that the relative expense rises rapidly for the faster chips @xcite . \n on april 7 , 2000 , there was an apparent sweet spot at 600 mhz . \n the faster chips have a higher price - performance ratio . depending upon the costs of the other components of the system \n , the entire system may have a higher or lower price - performance ratio .    for our qcd codes , \n access to memory is quite important . in our first example \n , we compare a celeron chip with a 66 mhz fsb and a pentium ii chip with a 100 mhz fsb . \n the pentium s clock speed is only 6% faster than the celeron , but its performance is 38% faster for @xmath96 and 23% faster for @xmath108 . \n this is because of its larger cache and 52% faster fsb . \n when we overclock the celeron , it has a slower fsb but a faster cpu speed than the pii , and performance is about equal except for @xmath96 where the smaller cache probably is the source of the difference . \n this work was supported by the u.s . \n doe under grant de - fg02 - 91er 40661 . \n special thanks to the milc collaboration , the albuquerque high performance computer center , indiana university , llnl , national center for supercomputing applications , pittsburgh supercomputer center and san diego supercomputer center .", "StartTimeOffset": 3039013770649, "RequestID": "2c94c42912931e026df44c15ef8aba9b4b11607d", "TotalTokens": 2947}

carbon bond ( b ) ( see fig . \n 1 ) . for these positions , different orientations of the molecules are examined and the adsorption energy is calculated for all of them . the adsorption energy ( e@xmath11 ) is the energy of the isolated graphene sheet and isolated molecule minus the energy of the fully relaxed graphene sheet with the molecule adsorbed to it . \n the strength of the molecular doping is discussed in light of the density of states and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) of the adsorbate . \n the position of these orbitals , visible as peaks in the dos , is practically independent of the orientation and adsorption site of the molecule , so we only show the total dos for one geometry per molecule . we can now distinguish two charge transfer mechanisms : i ) \n a charge transfer can occur due to the relative position in the dos of the homo and lumo of the adsorbate . \n if the homo is above the fermi level of pure graphene ( the dirac point ) , there is a charge transfer to graphene . \n if the lumo is below the dirac point , charge will transfer to the molecule . \n ii ) the charge transfer between adsorbate and graphene is also partially determined by the mixing of the homo and lumo with the graphene orbitals ( hybridisation ) . this mixing scales with the overlap of the interacting orbitals and the inverse of their energy difference . \n + it is more difficult to discuss the adsorption energy in this way because of the large amount of possible interacting orbitals present in graphene . \n our investigation starts with the non -

there are exactly two no - equivalent voids within the zincblende unit cell . as shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] along the [ 001 ] direction there are not two but four alternating non - equivalent atomic layers . \n the difference between the a(b ) and c(d ) layers is that the in(p ) atoms have exchanged sites with the voids . \n this exchange of atomic positions is important since it lead to four non - equivalent interfaces between inp and bifeo@xmath0 in our study . \n finally we have to mention that the lattice constant of inp coincides with the bifeo@xmath0 lattice constant multiplied by the square root of two : @xmath3 . \n thus as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the diagonal of the bifeo@xmath0 two - dimensional square unit cell can be assumed to be the side of the corresponding unit cell of the inp ( denoted with red color in the figure ) and thus epitaxial growth between inp and bifeo@xmath0 can be assumed . \n ( b ) possible terminations of the bifeo@xmath0 alloy along the [ 001 ] direction . with the red lines we denote the limits of the two - dimensional unit cell of inp ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) which has a lattice constant : @xmath4 . ]    for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 multilayers we studied four different cases with respect to the relative position of the atoms at the interface between the two spacers . along the growth axis we took into account eight atomics layers which are repeated in the [ 001 ] direction . \n initially we studied the structure ... feo@xmath2//in / p / in / p / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//in ... , and thus in the first case we have two non - equivalent interface in our structure : a p / bi and an in / fe ones . \n a close examination of figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] reveals that , in the case just mentioned : ( a ) with respect to the p / bi interface p atoms are situated in the diagonal connecting bi atoms ( compare ( a ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] with the d layer in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) , and ( 2 ) with respect to the in / fe interface in atoms are situated in the midpoint between fe nearest neighbors ( take into account a layer in fig . [ fig2 ] and combine it with the ( b ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . \n direction taking into account also the vacant sites . \n the structure is built using four alternating pure atomic layers a , b , c and d. the difference between a(b ) and c(d ) is that the in(p ) atoms and the voids have exchanged sites . ]    in the second case under study in and p atoms have exchanged sites with respect to the first case under study and thus now we have along the [ 001 ] direction a ... feo@xmath2//p / in / p / in / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//p ... structure , _ \n i.e. _ the inequivalent interfaces are now in / bi and fe / p . \n notice that as in the fe / in interface in case 1 , also in the p / fe interface , which occurs in case 2 , the p atoms at the interface are located in the midpoints between the fe atoms ( if we examine only the in - plane projection of the multilayer ) just above the oxygen atoms and this results to vanishing magnetism in case 2 under study as will be discussed later in the next subsection . \n as we mentioned above the structure of inp along the [ 001 ] direction should be viewed as consisting of four atomic layers ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) since voids play a crucial role in interfaces . if in the two previous cases 1 and 2 we exchange layer a(b ) with layer c(d ) in fig . \n [ fig2 ] we get two new cases 3 and 4 with different arrangement of the atoms at the interface . in case 3(4 ) , the succession of the atomic layers is similar to case 1(2 ) . \n when we compare case 1(2 ) with case 3(4 ) , we conclude that the p(in)/bi interfaces are similar since the p(in ) atoms are now situated at the other diagonal connecting the bi atoms . \n critical is the other in(p)/feo@xmath2 interface since now in case 3(4 ) the in(p ) atoms are located just above the fe atoms while in case 1(2 ) they were located above the oxygen atoms at the midpoints between neighboring fe atoms .      in all cases under study \n our results converged to the ferromagnetic solution independently of the initial conditions and initial arrangement of the spin moments . as in - plane lattice \n constant we have chosen the @xmath5   @xmath6   ( 11.1 a.u . ) which is the experimental lattice constant of inp and moreover for the lattice constant of 4.153   bifeo@xmath0 exhibits very pronounced magnetic properties.@xcite as a result of the epitaxial growth along the [ 001 ] axis the lattice constant was 14.182   ( 26.8 a.u . ) . \n spacer ( fe@xmath7 at the middle of the spacer and fe@xmath8 at the feo@xmath2 interface for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation ) . \n positive dos corresponds to the majority spin ( spin - up ) electrons and negative dos to the minority spin ( spin - down ) electrons . \n the fermi level has been assigned to the zero energy . ]    in fig . \n [ fig3 ] we present the density of states ( dos ) of the fe d - orbitals for all four cases under study . \n we denote as fe@xmath7 the fe atoms within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and with fe@xmath8 the fe atoms located at the interface . \n we have also to note here that for the multilayer structures under study , we have a complete lift of the degeneracy of the fe d - orbitals and we can not refer anymore to the double - degenerated @xmath9 and triple degenerated @xmath10 orbitals as in bulk bifeo@xmath0 . in case 2 where we have \n a p / bi interface our calculations have converged to a non - magnetic solution . \n the loss of magnetism in this case should be attributed to the reduced hybridization between the neighboring fe and p atoms at the interface . \n the latter have as valence 3p electrons which are less extended in space with respect to the in 5p valence states and do not hybridize with the fe d - orbitals at the interface . in case i , \n the d - band is shifted to higher energy values for the spin - down electrons with respect to the spin - up electrons . \n this is more easy to visualize for the fe@xmath8 atoms since their hybridization with the p - orbitals of in leads to more pronounced electronic properties ( smaller bandwidth with respect to the fe@xmath7 atoms and thus more intense picks ) . \n the latter is also reflected on the spin magnetic moments presented in table [ table1 ] where the spin magnetic moments are considerable larger for fe@xmath8 with respect to fe@xmath7 . \n .fe spin magnetic moments in @xmath1 within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 epitaxial ultrathin multilayers for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation of different cases ) . \n the bifeo@xmath0 spacer contains two inequivalent atoms : fe@xmath7 at the middle of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and fe@xmath8 at the interface . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar is the situation for the fe spacer where for the two smaller lattice constants we could not even converge our calculations . \n as shown in table [ table3 ] only for the largest value of the lattice constant we got significant values of the fe spin magnetic moments , which even for this case , are considerable smaller than the spin magnetic moments of fe atoms of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer ( @xmath110.2 @xmath1 for fe spacer compared to @xmath11 0.8 @xmath1 for bifeo@xmath0 spacer ) and are about one order of magnitude smaller than in bulk fe . \n we have also included in table [ table3 ] the results for the interface structure of fig . \n [ fig6 ] , denoted as `` case 5-ii '' where we have changed the positions of the v(fe ) atoms at the interface . \n overall also in this case the magnetic properties of the spacer are not significant . only in the case of the fe / bifeo@xmath0 multilayer half the fe atoms at layer 1 ( located at the interface with feo@xmath2 ) present a significant spin magnetic moment of about 0.5 @xmath1 which is still much lower than the bulk fe value . \n we expand our study on the magnetic properties bifeo@xmath0 presented in refs . and to the case of ultrathin epitaxial multilayers using the quantum - espresso first - principles electronic structure \n method.@xcite we have studied several cases of these ultrathin epitaxial bifeo@xmath0 multilayers using different types of spacers covering a wide range of electronic materials : inp semiconductor , ferromagnetic fe and metallic v. irrespectively of the spacer the magnetic properties of the multilayers were found to seriously degrade due to the low - symmetry of the film and in some cases magnetism vanished completely . \n thus ultrathin multilayers of bifeo@xmath0 are not suitable for spintronic applications \n . more extended calculations covering more thick multilayers and including quantum molecular dynamics are needed in the future to determine in more detail the properties of the interfaces of bifeo@xmath0 with other alloys . \n y. h. chu , l. w. martin , m. b. holcomb , m. gajek , s .- j . \n han , q. he , n. balke , c .- h . \n yang , d. lee , w. hu , q. zhan , p .- \n yang , a. fraile - rodriguez , a. scholl , s. x. wang , and r. ramesh , _ nature materials _ 7 , 478 ( 2008 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3057703314682, "RequestID": "c7e5442b16304e83cfd5d677bbe08e32c77cb85d", "TotalTokens": 3491}
{"ContextTokens": 4032, "GeneratedTokens": 237, "SynthesizedBody": "there has recently been considerable attention focused on the study of supersymmetric models of elementary particle interactions . \n this is especially true in the context of grand unification theories , where remarkable studies have been done in the hope of solving the gauge hierarchy problem or unifying the gravitational interaction within the superstring formalism . \n supersymmetric extension of the gravity(supergravity ) seems necessary in introducing soft breaking terms and making the cosmological constant vanish simultaneously . in supergravity models , \n spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry or super - higgs mechanism may generate soft supersymmetry breaking terms that allow to fulfill such phenomenological requirements . \n however , the super - higgs mechanism implies the existence of a supergravity breaking scale , intermediate between the planck scale(@xmath0 ) and the weak scale(@xmath1 ) . \n the intermediate scale is expected to be of o(@xmath2gev ) . here \n we expect that this intermediate scale is implemented by the mechanism of gaugino condensation in the hidden sector which couples to the visible sector by gravitational interactions . the effective action for gaugino condensation is well studied by many authors@xcite . \n the main purpose of this paper is to reproduce these results and seek for new features in these theories by means of the nambu - jona - lasinio method@xcite . \n in section 2 and 3 we consider an intermediate scale effective lagrangian for supersymmetric qcd with @xmath3 colors and @xmath4 flavors and also consider the effect of the dilaton dependent coupling constant . \n these theories have classical flat directions . \n if matter fields develop expectation value @xmath5 on these directions , the original @xmath6 gauge symmetry is broken and the effective low energy lagrangian has two parts . \n these are the kinetic terms for low energy pure supersymmetric yang - mills theory and the nambu - goldstone field , and their interaction term of order o(1/@xmath5 ) . \n taking @xmath5 to infinity , the resultant theory is a pure yang - mills theory without any interaction , so we tend to think that even in the existence of higher interaction terms we can extend the analysis of pure yang - mills theory . but \n this is merely a naive expectation so it seems important to analyze the theory from another point of view . from this standpoint , using the nambu - jona - lasinio method we examine the effect of the higher terms that affect on gaugino condensation . \n section 4 includes the extension to supergravity . \n gaugino condensation in supersymmetric gauge theories has been extensively studied by many authors both in global@xcite and local@xcite theories . in this section \n we examine the vacuum structures of supersymmetric qcd(sqcd ) theories with @xmath7 by using the nambu - jona - lasinio method . \n we follow ref.@xcite in deriving the effective lagrangian . \n the results presented below nicely agree with the previous studies which are given by instanton or effective lagrangian analysis . \n our starting point is a lagrangian with a gauge group @xmath6 with @xmath8 flavors of quarks . \n these superfields can be written with component fields as : @xmath9 the gauge fields @xmath10 are included in vector multiplets @xmath11 accompanied by their super - partners , gauginos @xmath12 and auxiliary fields @xmath13 . \n the total theory is given by @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] classically , this theory has a global @xmath15 symmetry . \n the @xmath16 symmetry is just like that of ordinary qcd , corresponding to separate rotation of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields . \n the symmetry @xmath19 is a r - invariance , a symmetry under which the components of a given superfield transform differently . \n this corresponds to a rotation of the phases of the grassmannian variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 just as in ordinary qcd , some of these symmetries are explicitly broken by anomalies . \n a simple computation shows that the following symmetry , which is a combination of the ordinary chiral @xmath23 and the @xmath19 symmetry , is anomaly - free . \n @xmath24 from now on , we call this non - anomalous global symmetry @xmath25 . \n since this model has flat directions , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath17 and @xmath18 may develop their vacuum expectation values along these directions . if @xmath26 , the gauge group is not completely broken . \n moreover , we can see that instantons can not generate a superpotential in this case , so considering another type of non - perturbative effects in this model seems important .    for simplicity , here we consider the case : @xmath6 gauge group is broken to @xmath27 . \n the low - energy theory consists of two parts : kinetic terms for the unbroken pure @xmath27 gauge interaction and one for the massless chiral field . \n in addition to these terms , we should include higher dimensional operators . a dimension - five operator , in general , \n is generated at one - loop level@xcite . \n this can be obtained also from the renormalization of the effective coupling@xcite : @xmath28w^{\\alpha}w_{\\alpha}\\ ] ] of course , this term itself is not dimension five . redefining the field as @xmath29 , this term produces a dimension five operator , namely @xmath30 . \n @xmath31 must be chosen to be invariant under all non - r symmetries . \n detailed arguments on such an field dependence of coupling constant are given in ref.@xcite and references therein . \n the non - anomalous r-symmetry of the original theory must be realized in the effective low - energy lagrangian by the shift induced by @xmath31 . that determines the r-charge of @xmath31 to be @xmath32 .    for simplicity \n , we consider a generalized form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the field dependent coupling constant . \n @xmath35 here @xmath36 is a constant chosen to realize the anomaly free ( mixed ) r-symmetry of the original lagrangian . in our case , we take @xmath37 . @xmath38 in eq.([1 ] ) is not calculable and one may expect other complicated forms . \n here we consider the simplest example for convenience . \n the gauge group of the low energy theory is @xmath27 . \n what we concern is the auxiliary part of this lagrangian : @xmath39 ( this term can be derived directly by 1-loop calculation . ) \n we can simply assume that the cut - off scale of this effective lagrangian is @xmath5 . \n the factor of @xmath40 appears because we have rescaled gaugino fields to have canonical kinetic terms . \n the equation of motion for @xmath41 is : @xmath42 this equation means that @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath41 so we can think that @xmath43 is the order parameter for the supersymmetry breaking . using the tadpole method@xcite \n we can derive a gap equation directly from ( [ 2a ] ) . \n @xmath44 of course one can derive ( [ 2b ] ) by explicit calculation of 1-loop effective potential . \n let us examine the solution . \n after integration we can rewrite it in a simple form . \n @xmath45 ( see also fig.1a . ) in the strong coupling region , this equation can have non - trivial solution . \n the explicit form of the potential is shown in fig.1b . \n ( here we ignore the trivial solution @xmath46 because such a condensation - vanishing solution does exist also in the effective ( composite ) lagrangian analysis of pure yang - mills theory , but it is usually neglected . ) let us examine the behavior of this non - trivial solution . in pure supersymmetric yang - mills theories , gaugino condensation is observed even in the weak coupling region because of the instanton calculation and witten index argument that suggests the invariance of witten index in the deformation of coupling constants@xcite . \n if we believe that the characteristics of the low energy lagrangian of massless sqcd is also similar to pure sym , the weak coupling region should be lifted by gaugino condensation effect . on the other hand , if we believe that non - compactness of the moduli space is crucial and believe that gaugino condensation should vanish in the weak coupling region , we can think that the potential represented in fig.1c is reliable and potential is flat in the weak coupling region . \n we can not make definite answer to this question , but some suggestive arguments can be given by adding a small mass term to the field @xmath31 . \n @xmath47 existence of this term suggests that the moduli space is now compact . \n the resulting gap equation is drastically changed . \n we can naturally set @xmath48-components vanish , and the equation turns out to be a non - trivial equation for `` @xmath31 '' . \n relevant terms are : @xmath49 the equation of motion for @xmath41 suggests that @xmath43 is now proportional to @xmath31 and no longer an order parameter for the supersymmetry breaking . \n the gap equation is given by : @xmath50 in general , this equation has a solution @xmath51 ( see fig.2a and 2b ) which does _ not _ break supersymmetry(fig.2c ) , and does not change witten index for any(non - zero ) value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case , the potential energy is always @xmath54 for any value of @xmath55 . because the moduli space is compact in this case , it is reliable that there is no phase transition of gaugino condensation . \n now let us examine the limit @xmath56 . in our model @xmath31 does not run away to infinity . \n if we take @xmath31 so large that the theory is weakly coupled , then non - trivial solution disappears and only the solution @xmath57 is left . \n this contradicts the assumption , so we think @xmath31 is finite and the potential is stabilized . \n taking @xmath56 , we can find a solution @xmath58 ( see fig.2d ) i.e. : @xmath59 this means that we can find a solution at @xmath60 , here @xmath61 is a constant ( @xmath62 ) . \n because we have fixed the symmetry breaking scale @xmath5 and considered it as a cut - off scale for the low energy effective theory , we can not find a runaway solution for @xmath63 from this low energy lagrangian . \n in this section we mainly focus on the supersymmetric yang - mills theory in which the gauge coupling constant is dependent only on the dilaton field @xmath64 . the lagrangian is now written as : @xmath65 here we assume @xmath66 . \n relevant part of the lagrangian is : @xmath67 here @xmath55 means the renormalized coupling constant . using the tadpole method we can find the following gap equation , @xmath68 which can be rewritten as : @xmath69 this equation relies only on the parameter @xmath70 . \n this gap equation has the same characteristics of massless sqcd , so the dilaton potential is flat in the weak coupling region . \n the potential is almost the same as fig.1c . \n then what would happen if we add a small mass term , for example , @xmath71 ? \n now the auxiliary part of the lagrangian is : @xmath72+\\frac{f^{*}_{s}f_{s}}{(s+      \\overline{s})^{2}}\\lambda^{2}\\ ] ] this means that the dilaton field @xmath64 is now becomes an order parameter for @xmath43 . \n the gap equation is now given by : @xmath73 this equation has a non - trivial solution at finite value once we fix @xmath70 . \n let us comment on the phenomenological models . \n if a small mass term is induced by the small spacetime curvature or some effects of higher theories , and assuming that our analyses are collect in such theories , we can expect that the analysis above may be used to analyze the dynamical dilaton potential and its runaway problem . \n it is important that we found a vacuum with finite @xmath64 , without introducing multiple gauge groups . \n in the standard superfield formalism of the locally supersymmetric action , we have : @xmath74      + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath75 . in the usual formalism of minimal supergravity \n , the weyl rescaling is done in terms of component fields . however , in order to understand the anomalous quantum corrections to the classical action , we need a manifest supersymmetric formalism , in which the weyl rescaling is also supersymmetric . \n it is easy to see that the classical action([lag ] ) itself is not super - weyl invariant . \n however , the lack of the super - weyl invariance can be recovered with the help of a chiral superfield @xmath76(weyl compensator ) .    for the classical action ( [ lag ] ) , the khler function @xmath77 , the superpotential @xmath78 and the gauge coupling @xmath79 are modified@xcite : @xmath80 @xmath81 is the constant chosen to cancel the super - weyl anomaly . \n the super - weyl transformations contain an r - symmetry in its imaginary part , so we can think that this is a natural extension of @xcite in which a compensator for the r - symmetry played a crucial role . \n let us examine the simplest case . \n we include an auxiliary field @xmath82 and set the form of @xmath78 and @xmath79 as : @xmath83 and rescale the field @xmath76 as : @xmath84 where h is some auxiliary field . \n finally we have : @xmath85 from the equation of motion for the auxirialy field of the super - weyl compensator , we have the relation : @xmath86 and the tree level scalar potential is : @xmath87 the equation of motion for the auxirialy field([aux0 ] ) suggests that eq.([pot1 ] ) can be interpreted as a four - fermion interaction of the gaugino : @xmath88 this four - fermion interaction becomes strong as @xmath89 reaches 0 . \n the strong coupling point is : @xmath90 using the tadpole method we can have a gap equation : @xmath91 the solution for the gap equation([g ] ) is given in fig.3a . \n we can see that there is always a solution for non - zero gaugino condensation . \n ( we have implicitly assumed that the vacuum expectation value for the auxiliary field for the weyl compensator superfield is @xmath54 . ) for a second example , we include the dilaton superfield @xmath64 . \n now @xmath79 is not a constant and depends on the field @xmath64 : @xmath92 and the khler potential for the dilaton superfield is : @xmath93 here we should include the effect of the dilaton field in the scalar potential . \n the tree level scalar potential is : @xmath94 the auxirialy field for @xmath64 is : @xmath95\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{4}w\\frac{1 + 12s_{r}\\xi^{-1}}{s_{r}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath96 and @xmath97 . \n the tree level potential can be given in a simple form @xmath98 where @xmath99.\\ ] ] in this case , the gap equation is given by : @xmath100 now let us consider the difference between our result and ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the solution for the gap equation is estimated after fixing the coupling constant at @xmath101 which is introduced by hand . \n it is true that the effective potential is singular at @xmath102 ( [ strong ] ) , but without introducing the cut - off , we can find a solution for ( [ gg ] ) at finite value.(see fig 3a )    another important point is the stability of the dilaton potential . \n it is suggested in @xcite that the dilaton potential has a stable vacuum without introducing multiple gauge groups if we use the nambu - jona - lasinio method . \n related topics are also discussed in @xcite . \n can we explain this phenomenon along the line of the previous section ? \n the scalar potential ( [ sc ] ) contains a dilaton bilinear that can be interpreted as a mass term . \n as is shown in section 3 , such a mass term would stabilize the dilaton potential . \n we examined the formation of gaugino condensation in the hidden sector within a nambu - jona - lasinio type approach . \n first we considered global supersymmetric gauge theories that have the @xmath6 gauge group and @xmath8 matter fields . \n we can find the phase transition in massless sqcd , but in the massive theory , we can not find such a phase transition . we can conclude that gaugino condensation is always non - zero in massive sqcd . \n we also examined a model with a dilaton dependent coupling constant . \n the result is similar to sqcd . \n we found a stabilized dilaton potential when we add a small mass term . \n we also extended our analysis to supergravity . \n we thank k.fujikawa , t.hotta and k.tobe for many helpful discussions . \n s.ferrara , l.girardello and h.p.nills , phys.lett.b125(1983)457 + j.p.derendinger , l.e.ibez and h.p.nills , phys.lett.b155(1985)65 + m.dine , r.rohm , n.seiberg and e.witten , phys.lett.b156(1985)55 + c.kounnas and m.porrati , phys.lett.b191(1987)91 + s.ferrara , n.magnoli , t.r.taylor and g.veneziano , phys.lett.b245(1990)243 + a.font , l.e.ibez , d.lust and f.quevedo , phys.lett.b245(1990)401 + h.p.nills and m.olechwski , phys.lett.b248(1990)268 + p.bintury and m.k.gaillard , phy.lett.b253(1991)119 , nucl.phys.b358(1991)194 + b.de carlos , j.a.casas and c.muoz , nucl.phys.b399(1993)623", "StartTimeOffset": 3078874093284, "RequestID": "383d0d020ee01e8f8866ec7ecaafcc658e148fc8", "TotalTokens": 4269}

negative matrix . \n therefore , the solution of eq . \n ( [ eqfors ] ) satisfies @xmath56 if @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the spectral radius of @xmath59 . from frobenius s theorem , @xmath58 is equal to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath59 , and thus we conclude that eq . \n ( [ eqfors ] ) has a meaningful solution if the largest eigenvalue of @xmath59 is less than 1 . \n noting that @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath58 is less than 1 for large @xmath5 , and a non - condensed phase appears , provided that @xmath64 . \n in contrast , we always have a condensed phase at small @xmath5 due to the divergence of the @xmath65 elements . \n as we decrease @xmath5 from a large value , the @xmath65 values increase and diverge when @xmath66 ; @xmath58 also diverges in this case . \n therefore , the wealth is condensed if @xmath67 . \n to test our theory , we compare the results with numerical simulation results on several networks . \n we begin with the network created by the erds - rnyi algorithm and then consider several networks created by the ws model@xcite to test the effect of clustering . \n it is shown that our theory fails when the rewiring rate @xmath68 is too small , but good agreement is obtained when @xmath69 . finally , we test our theory on a real network \n . it would be ideal to apply the theory to a real economic network , but as there is currently no available data , we use the american college football network obtained by girvan and newman@xcite instead . for this case , the pdf obtained from the simulations shows good agreement with our theory . \n for all the simulations , @xmath70 is set to 1 . \n the network created by the erds - rnyi algorithm , shown in fig . \n [ 140327_24aug12 ] , has 200 nodes and a mean degree of @xmath71 .    in fig . \n [ 170117_22aug12 ] we plot the pdfs obtained by numerical simulation for @xmath72 , and 2.0 . \n the pdfs obtained using our theory are indicated by the solid line and show good agreement with the numerical simulation for all @xmath10 for the @xmath73 case , but there are minor discrepancies at small @xmath10 values in the cases of @xmath74 and 0.5 . \n the discrepancy is due to the @xmath75 assumption used for deriving eqs . \n ( [ 170529_22aug12 ] ) and ( [ 170556_22aug12 ] ) . the maximum @xmath45 value calculated by eqs . \n ( [ eqfors ] ) and ( [ 133408_24aug12 ] ) is 0.33 for @xmath74 and 0.09 for @xmath76 , while @xmath77 . \n thus , the @xmath78 approximation is not valid as @xmath79 is larger than 0.3 . \n however , the approximation is valid for the @xmath73 case as the maximum @xmath45 value is 0.01 . \n next , we consider three networks created by the ws algorithm . \n the networks have @xmath80 nodes and a mean degree of @xmath81 with different rewiring rates of @xmath82 , and 0.2 . \n [ 155309_15aug12 ] shows both the networks and pdfs . in the case of @xmath83 , \n our theory differs from the numerical simulation , while we find good agreement for the @xmath84 and @xmath85 cases . \n +    to investigate the reason for this discrepancy , we examine the scatter plots of @xmath10 and @xmath86 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 in fig . \n [ scatterplot ] . for @xmath83 \n , we find that there is a strong correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath86 that weakens for @xmath84 . \n the differences can be quantified by the correlation , which is 0.74 for @xmath83 and 0.48 for @xmath84 . \n this result suggests that the discrepancy is caused by the breakdown of independent assumption . \n it is reasonable to question here when and why the independent assumption fails . \n the small - world property does not appear to affect the independence of wealth because the networks show high - clustering and small betweenness for both the @xmath83 and 0.1 cases . \n we return to this point in the discussion section . \n the american college football network obtained by girvan and newman@xcite includes 115 nodes and 613 edges . \n the simulated pdfs for @xmath74 and 0.5 are shown in fig . \n [ 093508_20aug12 ] . in both cases , \n our theory reproduces the pdf well . \n the agreement between theory and simulation seems excellent . \n we have not understand the reason for this good agreement , however , one possible reason is that this network has community structure . as girvan and newman showed , this network has clear communities . as we will see in the later section , \n the spatial correlation of wealth would be small for globally coupled network . \n therefore it is natural to assume that wealth correlation is also small , if the network is consisted from several densely connected subgraphs . \n however , we still need further study to explain this excellent agreement . \n here , we have developed a theory for the bm model on complex networks . by generalizing our previous work \n , we were able to propose a theory applicable to a complex network with a given adjacency matrix . using the adiabatic and independent assumptions \n , we derived the equations that determine the static pdf of the wealth . \n the result was compared to numerical simulations , and we found our theory works well on a erds - rnyi network , ws networks with @xmath87 , and the american college football network . \n we also found that the theory did not perform well for a ws network with @xmath88 as the independent assumption is no longer valid . \n the theory does not apply to a ws network with a small @xmath68 value because of the large spatial correlation in this case . \n thus , we may ask when and why the spatial correlation becomes large . while it is difficult to give a complete answer to this question \n , the following discussion suggests that the properties of the laplacian are essential to this problem . \n suppose that @xmath5 is very large and the fluctuations of @xmath10 are very small . \n under such circumstances , we can approximate @xmath89 in eq . \n ( [ 083834_8aug12 ] ) as @xmath90 and obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the laplacian matrix @xmath93 . to investigate the correlation in this toy model , \n we assume for simplicity that the network is undirected and connected . \n introducing the eigenvalues and corresponding normalized eigenvectors of @xmath94 as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we can write @xmath97 \n . then @xmath94 is diagonalized and eq . \n ( [ 150804_20aug12 ] ) can be written as @xmath98 the static distribution of @xmath99 is calculated as @xmath100\\;.\\label{133706_28aug12}\\ ] ] the @xmath101 term does not have a static distribution because @xmath102 . however , because @xmath103 , this term gives the uniform change , @xmath104 , and does not contribute to the correlation .    from eq . \n ( [ 133706_28aug12 ] ) and the relation @xmath105 , we obtain the covariance @xmath106 our independent assumption implies that the off - diagonal elements of eq . \n ( [ 145452_24aug12 ] ) are smaller than the diagonal elements . \n this condition is satisfied if every @xmath107 is `` localized '' , in other words , has only one large components . \n it has been shown by some researchers that eigenvectors is localized in many complex networks @xcite . \n our theory will be applicable to these network models . \n we also consider here the case for which the adiabatic assumption is not valid . \n if the node degree is large enough , then @xmath108 changes at a much slower rate than that of @xmath10 . \n therefore , this assumption will be valid if the degree of each node is large . \n on the other hand , if the degree of each node is small , then not only the adiabatic assumption but also the use of the central - limit theorem can not be justified . \n for example , our theory will not work well for the `` star''-network in which almost all nodes have a degree of 1 . \n we note that theory for the bm model in the wealth - condensed phase is still elusive , as the standard central - limit theory is not applicable when @xmath109 diverges . \n thus , to discuss the static properties , we will need to generalize the central - limit theorem so that it can be adopted even if the variance diverges . \n finally , we note that our developed technique is applicable to other dynamical systems subject to noise . \n stochastic dynamics on complex network is attracting the interests of many reserchers recently , however , dynamics with multiplicative noise has not studied so far . \n we believe this method will shed new light on other problems regarding the dynamics on complex networks . \n 99 t. nishikawa , a. e. motter , y .- c lai , and f. c. hoppensteadt , phys . \n lett . * 91*,014101(2003 ) . \n t. ichinomiya , phys . \n e * 70 * 026116(2004 ) . \n h. nakao and a. mikhaikov , nature phys . \n * 6 * 544(2010 ) . \n j. bouchaud and m. mzard , physica a * 282 * 536 ( 2000 ) . \n v. pareto , _ \n cours dconomie politique _ macmilan , london 1897 . \n d. garlaschelli and m. i. loffredo , physica a. * 338 * 113(2004 ) . \n w. souma , y. fujiwara , and a. aoyama , _ arxiv : cond -

{"ContextTokens": 1996, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "the btev detector is a collider detector with two back - to - back forward spectrometers ( @xmath4 ) having sub - detectors in each arm for charged particle tracking , em calorimetry , rich particle i d and muon detection @xcite . at the core of the detector is a 30 station si - pixel inner tracker spanning @xmath5120 cm centered at the ir ( @xmath6 = 30 cm ) and immersed in a 1.6 tesla dipole field . \n there are over @xmath7 active rectangular pixels measuring 50 @xmath8 400 @xmath9 . \n each pixel station has two planes , one with narrow pixel dimension oriented in the @xmath10-direction and the other with narrow dimension in the @xmath11-direction . \n btev will operate at a luminosity of @xmath12 @xmath13 s@xmath14 corresponding to @xmath15 interactions per beam crossing at a crossing rate of 7.6 mhz . \n average event sizes will be @xmath5200 kb after zero - suppression of data is performed on - the - fly epsf    by front - end detector electronics . since every beam crossing will be processed , this translates to an extremely high data rate of @xmath51.5 tb / sec !    to handle this high rate , btev will employ a three - level hierarchical trigger architecture @xcite ( see fig . \n [ btevtrig ] ) . \n sparsified data from all detector components will be sent via optical links to level 1 ( l1 ) buffers . \n data from the pixel and muon detectors will also be sent to the l1 trigger processor . \n trigger decisions from the l1 muon and vertex trigger will be passed on to the global level 1 ( gl1 ) trigger manager whose decisions will be stored as a list of accepted crossing numbers by the information transfer control hardware ( itch ) . \n l1 will reject  99% of all incoming events reducing the data rate by a factor of @xmath5100 to @xmath515 gb / sec . \n levels 2 & 3 ( l2/3 ) will be implemented with a cluster of commodity cpu nodes . a request from an idle l2 node \n will be sent to the itch which will respond by assigning an accepted crossing number to that node . \n this node will then request a subset of the data ( pixels+forward tracking ) for that crossing from the l1 buffer managers . \n a switch will combine pixel data with forward tracking data for the same crossing and route them to the buffer of an l2 node allowing a more refined analysis that will further reduce the data rate by a factor of @xmath510 . \n if that passes the l2 selection criteria , the same processing node will then enter the l3 phase and request data from the rest of the sub - detectors be transferred from the l1 to the l3 buffers ( l2/3 buffers will simply be the ram attached to the processing node ) . using complete information from the detector , l3 will reduce the crossing rate by an additional factor of @xmath52 . since l3 will also be able to further compress the data in the accepted crossings by a factor of @xmath54 , the expected data rate out of l3 is @xmath5200 mb / sec . \n the first phase of the l1 vertex trigger algorithm is the track finding phase @xcite which starts by finding the beginning and ending segments of tracks in two separate regions of the pixel planes , an inner region close to the beam axis and an outer region close to the edge of the pixel planes . \n the search for the beginning and ending segments of tracks is restricted to these inner and outer regions respectively . \n segments are found using hit clusters from three adjacent pixel stations in the defined regions . \n inner segments are required to point back to the beam axis while outer segments are required to project outside pixel plane boundaries . \n once these segments are found , they are then matched to form complete tracks in the segment matching stage . \n after complete tracks are found , the vertexing phase @xcite determines the momentum of each track and calculates its transverse distance from the beam axis . \n primary vertices are found by looping through all tracks with transverse momentum @xmath16 gev / c that appear to originate close to the beamline . \n remaining tracks are then tested for their detachment from the primary vertices found . \n a l1 vertex trigger is generated if there are at least 2 tracks in the same arm of the btev detector satisfying the following criteria : @xmath17 ( gev / c)@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 mm where @xmath2 is the impact parameter . \n our studies indicate that the l1 vertex trigger is able to reject 99% of all minimum - bias events while accepting @xmath560 - 70% of the @xmath0-events that would survive our offline analysis cuts . \n a block diagram of the l1 vertex trigger is shown in fig . [ l1vtx ] . \n data from all 30 stations of the pixel detector are sent to fpga based pixel processors that group individual pixel hits into clusters . \n hit clusters from three neighboring pixel stations are routed to fpga based hardware that find beginning and ending segments of tracks in the track finding phase . \n epsf    segments found in this stage are sorted by a switch according to crossing number and routed to a dsp in the track / vertex farm . \n this dsp performs the segment matching step of the track finding phase and the entire vertex finding phase . \n based on initial studies done for the btev proposal @xcite , we estimate the average processing time for the combined segment matching plus vertex finding phase to take @xmath5330 @xmath21s on a single 167 mhz ti tms320c6711 floating point dsp . since the time between beam crossings is 132ns , this will require a total of @xmath52,500 dsp in the track / vertex farm in order to examine every beam crossing . \n since hand - optimized assembly code can be difficult to maintain and debug , we are working on an optimized c version of the l1 segment matching and vertexing code . \n a version is currently running on a c6711 dsk board in which we have replaced costly function calls with intrinsics that map directly to built - in dsp instructions and completely rewritten major sections of the code . \n preliminary results indicate that this optimized c version is only a factor of @xmath54 - 5 slower than the hand - optimized assembly version used for initial timing estimates . \n while we expect substantial gains in dsp chip performance in the next few years , we will continue to explore ways to improve code performance , resorting to hand - optimized assembly programming only when necessary . \n we are developing a prototype board for the segment matching and vertexing portion of the l1 trigger with four dsp s on mezzanine cards . \n onboard fpga input and output buffers will have an lvds interface to a host computer through which simulated data can be sent . \n buffer managers in the fpga will channel data to and from each dsp via dma transfers . \n trigger results from each processor will be sent through an fpga interface to an on - board @xmath21-controller that will format the results and forward them to gl1 through arcnet . \n a host computer serving as a pixel trigger supervisor monitor will be connected to a second on - board @xmath21-controller through arcnet , allowing commands to be sent to the board , initialization of the dsp s , and providing hardware monitoring and fault detection . \n jtag ports will also be available for real - time debugging and initial start - up of the prototype . \n we are also implementing the l1 segment finding algorithm in fpga s and doing simulations and queuing studies of the algorithm with matlab .    as a final note btev will greatly benefit from a newly approved nsf funded project called rtes ( real time embedded systems ) @xcite which will develop a semi - autonomous , self - monitoring , fault - tolerant and adaptive framework for addressing issues facing complex computing architectures like that of btev . \n we have designed a level 1 vertex trigger that will address the demanding requirements of btev . \n we are currently working on optimizing a high - level version of the vertex trigger algorithm and developing a prototype board for investigating various aspects of the l1 vertex trigger hardware . \n a. kulyavtsev et al . , btev proposal , fermilab , may 2000 . \n p. lebrun , the btev triggers and data acqusition systems , talk presented at the session on new detector technologies , at the meeting of the division of particles and fields of the american physical society , columbus , oh , august 9 - 12 2000 . \n gottschalk , btev detached vertex trigger , nucl . \n instrum . meth . a 473 ( 2001 ) 167 . \n r. isik , real - time pattern - recognition for hep , university of pennsylvania , preprint upr-233e , 1996 . \n r. isik , w. selove , k. sterner , monte carlo results for a secondary - vertex trigger with on - line tracking , university of pennsylvania , preprint upr-234e , 1996 . \n gottschalk , the btev daq and trigger system- some throughput , usability and fault tolerance aspects , proc . \n chep 2001 , beijing , sept . 3 - 7 2001 , p. 628 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3099260202668, "RequestID": "e73f212a10a7e74672852ffcc44c3a43f96d115d", "TotalTokens": 2166}

{"ContextTokens": 3584, "GeneratedTokens": 276, "SynthesizedBody": "a hundred years after the discovery of cosmic rays ( crs ) there is little doubt that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the sources of the bulk population of crs in the galaxy with energies up to a few times 10@xmath3 ev ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and may well produce crs to 10@xmath4 ev ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is the most likely mechanism to accelerate cr particles in the forward and reverse shocks of the snr shells \n . the high efficiency of the dsa mechanism has been demonstrated by nonlinear modeling ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . \n however , snrs do not comprise a uniform population of similar objects . \n there is a wide variety of different snrs since their evolution , cr acceleration , and non - thermal emission depend strongly on both the circumstellar and interstellar environments @xcite . \n it is important that a substantial fraction of core - collapsed supernovae likely occur in compact clusters of young massive stars and are associated with molecular clouds . \n the most massive stars explode first and their shocks are propagating through a complex environment created by both the very strong radiation of young massive stars and radiatively driven stellar winds . \n we discuss in  1 the results of modeling cr acceleration and the nonthermal emission of a supernova exploding in the stellar wind of its progenitor star following @xcite . \n in addition to an isolated snr , in a compact rich cluster of young massive stars the distances between the young stars may be about 10 - 15 pc and therefore crs may also be accelerated when the mhd flows produced by the supernova shell interact with a stellar wind from a nearby massive star . \n particle acceleration in the region where the expanding supernova shell approaches a powerful stellar wind is discussed in  2 ( see also * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n at a later stage of the young stellar cluster evolution ( an age of about ten million years ) multiple supernova explosions with great energy release in the form of shock waves inside a superbubble is a favorable site for particle acceleration . \n the collective acceleration from both stellar winds of massive stars and core collapsed supernovae in superbubbles was discussed in @xcite . \n early type stars with masses above @xmath5 ( of b0  v type and earlier ) are thought to create hot , low - density bubbles with radii @xmath6pc surrounded by a massive shell of matter swept up from the parent cloud by the stellar wind . \n a sn exploding in the early stages ( i.e. , the first few million years ) of the ob association evolution would interact with a cavern created by the pre - supernova wind . in this case , a strong supernova shock propagates for a few thousand years in tenuous circumstellar matter with a velocity above @xmath7km / s before reaching the dense massive shell . \n magnetic field fluctuations in the shock vicinity may be highly amplified by instabilities driven by the cr - current and cr - pressure gradient in the strong shocks @xcite . \n this is an important factor for determining the highest energy particles accelerated by the shocks .    a nonlinear , spherically symmetric model of the core - collapsed snr \n rx j1713.7 - 3946 that includes a hydrodynamic simulation of the remnant evolution coupled to the efficient production of crs by dsa at the supernova forward shock was studied in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : snrxj ] ) . \n high - energy crs that escape from the forward shock are propagated in surrounding dense material that simulates either a swept - up , pre - supernova shell or a nearby molecular cloud . the continuum emission from trapped and escaping crs , along with the thermal x - ray emission from the shock - heated ism behind the forward shock , integrated over the remnant , \n was compared against broadband observations . \n overall , the gev - tev emission is dominated by inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from cr electrons if the supernova is isolated regardless of its type , i.e. , not interacting with a @xmath8 shell or cloud . \n if the snr is interacting with a much larger mass @xmath9 , pion production by the escaping crs may dominate the tev emission , although a precise fit at high gamma - ray energies will depend on the still uncertain details of how the highest energy crs are accelerated by , and escape from , the forward shock ( fs ) . \n importantly , even though cr electrons dominate the gev - tev emission , much more energy is put into cr ions and the efficient production of cr ions is an essential part of our leptonic model .    an important factor that allows a good fit to the broadband spectrum of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  with leptons , particularly including the highest energy hess points , stems from the fact that the pre - sn wind magnetic field , in which the sn explodes , is considerably lower than 3@xmath10 g due to the expansion of the wind . \n this allows the electrons to be accelerated to higher energies before radiation losses dominate . \n we take a pre - sn wind with speed @xmath11 , mass - loss rate @xmath12 , and temperature @xmath13 , all of which are assumed constant . \n the parameter @xmath14 determines the wind magnetic field at a radius @xmath15 from the explosion according to @xmath16 the constant parameter @xmath14 is the ratio of magnetic field energy density to kinetic energy density in the wind and can be related to properties of the star by ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) @xmath17 here , @xmath18 denotes the surface magnetic field of the star , @xmath19 is the stellar radius , @xmath20 is the star rotation velocity , and @xmath21 is the terminal speed of the wind . \n obtaining @xmath22 by fitting the spectrum of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 , as was done in @xcite , constrains the progenitor star parameters . as noted by @xcite , values of @xmath23 indicate that the stellar wind dominates the magnetic field , producing a roughly radial field far from the star .    for the parameters used in @xcite ( see also * ? \n * ) , the upstream magnetic field at the forward shock at the current age of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  is @xmath24 g and the @xmath6@xmath10 g  field immediately downstream from the shock is amplified by a factor of about 50 above the unshocked wind magnetic field ( see figure  [ fig : prof ] ) . \n the low unshocked wind field reconciles efficient cr acceleration , and the accompanying strong magnetic field amplification ( mfa ) , with the low magnetic field that is required for leptons to produce the highest energy gamma - ray emission with ic . \n it may also provide the relatively wide ( @xmath25 parsec - scale size ) profile of the ic emission consistent with the observed tev profile . \n the discussion of the possible effect of the reverse shock can be found in @xcite . \n we confirm that the circumstellar medium ( csm ) can strongly influence the non - thermal emission from core - collapsed sn ib / c and sniib snrs , and emphasize again that the magnetic field of the progenitor massive star may be well below the average interstellar medium ( ism ) values of a few micro - gauss alleviating an apparent contradiction between the low postshock magnetic field values required by the leptonic origin of high energy gamma - rays with the strong magnetic field amplification expected in efficient dsa . \n it is also important to emphasize that , even though electrons dominate the high - energy emission , the dsa model we are discussing accelerates cr ions efficiently . \n the results we illustrated here ( figures  [ fig : snrxj ] and [ fig : prof ] ) place 25 to 50% of the forward shock ram kinetic energy flux into relativistic ions at any instant . \n only 0.25% or less of the instantaneous ram kinetic energy flux goes into relativistic electrons . \n leptons dominate the model emission simply because leptons radiate far more efficiently than ions , not because ions are missing . \n furthermore , the best - fit parameters for this remnant result in maximum proton energies of @xmath26ev . \n iron nuclei would be accelerated to @xmath27ev , well into the cr `` knee '' regime . \n [ fig : snrxj ]        [ fig : prof ] yr . \n the third panel shows the mass within @xmath15 at @xmath28 and the fourth panel shows the escaping cr number density . \n the diffusion parameters used in @xcite are listed in the fifth panel . \n escaping crs are only followed beyond the fs and they leave the spherically symmetric simulation freely at the outer radius of @xmath29pc . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n the blast wave of the snr is expected to accelerate the wind material producing ultra - relativistic ions and electrons . \n the highest energy crs escape from the snr forward shock and can reach the termination shock of the stellar wind of a nearby massive star . in figure \n [ fig : snr_sw ] we show a highly simplified situation where the snr shock approaches the the stellar wind from a young ob - star . for efficient acceleration in such a system , the distance @xmath30 between the shocks should be about a pc and we estimate that this stage may last about 1,000 yrs . \n we modeled the energetic particle acceleration in the region where the expanding supernova shell is approaching a powerful stellar wind of a young massive star as it is illustrated in figure  [ fig : snr_sw ] . at the evolutionary stage where the mean \n free path of the highest energy cr is comparable to the distance between the two shocks , @xmath30 , the system is characterized by a very hard spectrum of accelerated crs as discussed in @xcite . \n the hard cr spectrum produces unusual spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of synchrotron and ic emission as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] . \n the sed is derived for the moment of close approach of the shell with the stellar wind with @xmath31 pc . for comparison , \n we show in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , with the dotted lines , the sed produced by an isolated snr shock at a similar age . \n [ fig : snr_sw ]      the effect of different environments in which an isolated snr may evolve on the maximum cr energy , and the time evolution of the maximum energy , was discussed in @xcite . in their model , the maximum cr energy is generally reached in the ejecta - dominated stage , much before the start of the sedov - taylor stage . \n it was concluded that , for sne evolving within the winds of their massive stars , the maximum energy is reached very early in the evolution . \n as shown in @xcite , a supernova exploding in a young stellar cluster and interacting with a nearby strong stellar wind will produce higher maximum energy crs in the colliding mhd flows compared to an isolated snr . \n furthermore , the snr can produce high - energy crs at the sedov - taylor evolution stage . \n the evolution of a snr , after the star explosion , is characterized ( in chronological order ) by the free expansion phase , the sedov - taylor stage , and the radiative stage . during the free expansion \n phase the forward shock velocity of the ejecta is approximately constant . at the sedov - taylor stage , \n the ejecta starts to decelerate when the swept - up mass becomes comparable to the ejecta mass . \n the transition from the free expansion phase to the sedov - taylor stage occurs around the time @xmath32 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) where    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 is the number density of the interstellar medium , @xmath35 is the snr explosion energy , @xmath36 is the mass of the ejecta , and @xmath37 is the mass of the sun . \n the evolution of the forward shock radius @xmath38 and shock velocity @xmath39 during the sedov phase of the snr expansion are given by the following equations :    @xmath40    @xmath41    for the calculation of the maximum momentum evolution we use the approach proposed in @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the particle velocity , @xmath45@xmath10 g  is the unperturbed magnetic field strength , @xmath46 , and the mass ejected with the snr explosion is @xmath47 .    in figure  [ fig : sedov ] we illustrate the evolution of @xmath48 accelerated in the system in which the forward shock of the snr approaches the strong stellar wind from a young ob star being at the sedov - taylor stage . \n the snr - stellar wind collision may also occur well before the sedov - taylor phase depending on the compactness of the stellar cluster and inter - cluster matter distribution . at some moment during the sedov - taylor stage of the snr evolution the forward shock of the snr is close enough to the termination shock of the stellar wind to produce efficient acceleration with the sharp increase in @xmath48 shown in the figure . \n the spectra of crs accelerated in the colliding flows are harder than those from dsa produced by a single shock @xcite . in the figure  [ fig : spectrum ] \n we compare the ic and synchrotron emission from the electrons accelerated in a colliding shock with that from electrons from a single shock . \n for this example , the local interstellar photon spectrum was constructed taking into account background ir fluxes typical for ob - associations , as measured by @xcite . \n the electron distribution functions used in the spectra calculations were computed with a time - dependent model that accounts for nonlinear flow modifications in the vicinity of the shocks , and radiation losses for the electrons . \n it is clearly seen that the emissivity of the snr - sw system is considerably higher than that for the single snr shock due to the hard electron spectrum up to @xmath49 gev . \n supernova remnants are the most likely candidates to accelerate galactic crs up to the knee regime and perhaps beyond the knee . \n core - collapsed supernovae are thought to be statistically the dominating class of supernova events . \n the effect of the clustering of core - collapsed supernova progenitors , and the interaction of supernova ejecta with the circumstellar matter produced by the wind of the progenitor star , affect both the maximum energy crs can obtain and the cr composition . in this paper we discussed briefly a few recent results illustrating the effects of both the strong wind of the progenitor massive star , and the collision of a supernova shock with the powerful wind of a nearby young massive star . \n in particular , we emphasized the importance of the structure of the magnetic field in the stellar wind of the progenitor star . in the case of slow rotation of the progenitor star , the wind magnetic field at large distances from the star may be well below the typical @xmath50@xmath10 g  value for the ism . in this case \n , the strong snr forward shock can accelerate cr ions efficiently with the expected strong mfa and still have low enough fields behind the shock ( i.e. , @xmath6@xmath10 g ) so relativistic electrons can obtain high enough energies to produce the high - energy gamma - ray emission via ic before radiation losses take over . in the case of a supernova explosion in a compact cluster of young massive stars , the collision of the supernova shock with the stellar wind of a nearby star is likely and the combined effect of shock and stellar wind may result in a substantial increase in the maximum cr energy , @xmath51 . this increase in @xmath51 \n can occur even during the stage when the maximum cr energy from the isolated snr was declining ( see figure  [ fig : sedov ] ) . \n the characteristic spectrum of non - thermal emission from the snr - sw collision is expected to be very hard ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) , a prediction that can be tested observationally . \n a.m.b . and d.c.e . \n thank f.  aharonian , w.  hofmann and f.  rieger for the excellent symposium `` high energy gamma -

{"ContextTokens": 3567, "GeneratedTokens": 202, "SynthesizedBody": "there is an ongoing theoretical debate about the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets . \n two opposite extremes exist : core accretion and disk instability . in core accretion , a solid core forms first by the collisional accumulation of planetesimals and planetary embryos , and then accretes a gaseous envelope from the protoplanetary disk gas ( mizuno 1980 ) . in the disk instability mechanism , a gaseous protoplanet forms first in a gravitationally unstable , gaseous disk ( boss 1997 ) , and then a solid core forms by the settling and coagulation of dust grains within the protoplanet . \n while core accretion is generally assumed to be the dominant formation mechanism for giant planets , considerable theoretical uncertainty remains about both formation mechanisms ( e.g. , durisen et  al . 2007 ) . \n given this murky situation , observational constraints are likely to be crucial for deciding which mechanism , if either , dominates ( boss 2006 ) . \n millimeter wave telescopes should be able probe the planet - forming midplanes of optically - thick disks . \n the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) may be able to directly image gaseous protoplanets formed by disk instability , or to detect the strong self - absorption of hco@xmath0 emission lines caused by these dense clumps of molecular gas ( narayanan et  al . \n . the latter type of detections might also be achieved by the submillimeter array ( sma ) . \n here we consider the observational appearance of light scattered by the irregular surfaces of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk that is in the process of forming gaseous protoplanets by the disk instability mechanism . \n the disk model studied here ( from boss 2001 ) is the same as the one investigated by narayanan et  al . \n ( 2006 ) , and this work thus provides an important comparision between what can be accomplished at optical and at millimeter wavelengths in terms of constraining giant planet formation mechanisms . \n many others have studied the observable properties of ysos ( young stellar objects ) . \n this includes the spectral energy distributions of unresolved sources ( e.g.   yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin 1993 ; boss & yorke 1995 , 1996 ; wood et  al . \n 1998 , 2002 ; robitaille et  al . 2006 ) and imaging of smooth axisymmetric disk models ( e.g.   whitney & hartmann 1992 , 1993 ; yorke et  al . 1993 ; sonnhalter , preibisch , & yorke 1995 ; kessel , yorke , & richling 1998 ; yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ; lucas et  al . 2004 ) . in this paper \n , we discuss high - resolution imaging of a disk undergoing a dynamical process . \n the basis for our modeling is a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation rather than an analytic disk model since we are interested in the perturbations that indicate activity in the disk rather than the overall emission . \n the disk model we adopt was calculated by boss ( 2001 ) , and is described in detail in that paper . \n the hydrodynamics of the disk were calculated three - dimensionally in spherical coordinates , with @xmath1 as the distance from the central star , @xmath2 as the angle with respect to the axis of the disk s rotation , and @xmath3 as the azimuthal or longitudinal angle . \n pressures and temperatures were calculated on a grid with @xmath4 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath1 between 4 and 20 au and @xmath5 uniformly spaced intervals in @xmath3 between 0 and @xmath6 . in @xmath2 , \n @xmath7 values were sampled , with @xmath8 . \n the system consists of a 1 @xmath9 central protostar , surrounded by a gaseous disk of mass @xmath10 between 4 and 20 au . from an initially smooth disk , \n the system was evolved several hundred years , until a gravitationally bound clump began to form . in this study \n , we will examine snapshots of the simulation at 335 , 339 , and 346 years . \n simulated scattered light images are generated by treating the surface of the disk as an isotropic scatterer , with half the incident flux being absorbed and remainder scattered isotropically . \n the surface of the disk is defined to be where the disk becomes optically thick to stellar irradiation . \n that is , if we define @xmath11 to be the optical depth , the surface is where @xmath12 . \n we assume the dust is well - mixed with the gas , using opacities calculated by dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) for a grain size distribution with maximum grain size @xmath13 mm , power - law index of @xmath14 , with a dust temperature of 100k . \n they calculate the planck opacity integrated over a stellar blackbody spectrum at 4000 k as @xmath15 g@xmath16 @xmath17 . \n the peak wavelength for this spectrum is 0.73 @xmath18 m , corresponding to r -

of - sight along a given direction @xmath26 , we calculate where the optical depth reaches 2/3 and define that to be the location of the disk surface , sampling it with a resolution of @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30/n_r = 0.016 $ ] . \n the flux of stellar irradiation incident on the disk at a distance @xmath1 is @xmath31 the angle of incidence of stellar irradiation on the disk surface is @xmath32 where @xmath33 points from the surface to the star , and @xmath34 is normal to the surface . \n the finite size of the star is the reason for including the @xmath35 term . to calculate the scattered flux , \n we assume that surface acts like an isotropic scatterer so that half the flux is absorbed into the disk and reprocessed into thermal radiation and the other half is scattered back out isotropically . \n if we define @xmath36 to be the flux emitted by the star , then we can express the scattered light emission relative to the stellar flux : @xmath37 \n in figure [ dencompare]a , we show the simulated scattered light image of the disk as calculated above , at a time of 339 years . \n the flux is normalized to the stellar emission , and is displayed in the logarithm as indicated by the color bar . \n note that the brightest intensity is at best @xmath38 of the stellar emission , and the minimum intensity shown is @xmath39 of the stellar emission . \n the dark radial streaks seen in the simulated image are shadows of dense clumps at the inner boundary of the simulation , at 4 au . at the distances and scales involved in the simulation , \n it is appropriate to treat the star as a point source , which is why the shadows diverge . \n the area interior to 4 au has been blacked out to ignore numerical artifacts at the inner boundary of the simulation . \n the planet - forming clump is located at the position of the white asterisk . \n there is no apparent correlation between the position of the forming planet and structure in the scattered light image .    in figure [ dencompare]b \n , we show the density structure at the disk midplane of the simulation . the density enhancement corresponding to the position of the forming planet can be clearly seen . \n however , the density structure at the disk s midplane bears no resemblance to the scattered light image . in figure [ dencompare]c \n , we show the density structure of the disk at @xmath40 , in projection . \n this is close to the height of the scattering surface of the disk . comparing figures [ dencompare]a and [ dencompare]b , it is readily apparent that the scattered light emission traces the density structure in these tenuous surface layers of the disk rather than probing the overall density structure in the disk . \n the densities displayed in figures [ dencompare]b and [ dencompare]c cover completely different ranges , demonstrating this fact . \n the structures seen in scattered light are corrugations created in the initially smooth surfaces of the disk from the highly dynamical evolution of a marginally gravitationally unstable disk ( boss 2001 ) . \n the corrugations indicate activity within the disk , even though they are not directly correlated spatially .    in figure [ psfconv ] \n , we demonstrate the time evolution of the scattered light image . from top to bottom , we show simulated images of the disk at 335 , 339 , and 346 years . for scale \n , the central blackout region has a diameter of 8 au . \n the intensity scale is the same as in figure [ dencompare]a and can be inferred from the contours , which indicate flux relative to the stellar emission of @xmath41 ( solid ) , @xmath42 ( dashed ) , and @xmath43 ( dotted ) . \n the left column shows the theoretical scattered light image , with perfect resolution , with the location of the forming planet indicated by the white asterisk . \n these simulated images show that the corrugations evolve on time scales of only a few years , short enough to be easily observationally detectable . \n such surface irregularities are seen in other disk instability simulations as well ( e.g. , boley & durisen 2006 ) and can be attributed to spiral shock fronts breaking on the disk surface . \n observations of features indicative of disk instability would be a major advance for planet formation theory . an 8-m class telescope with adaptive optics \n would be diffraction limited at @xmath44 at 1 @xmath18 m . a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt ( giant magellan telescope ) or tmt ( thirty meter telescope ) , which are expected to have first light in the next decade , would have diffraction limits of less than @xmath45 at 1 @xmath18 m . \n to illustrate what actual observations of our theoretical disks might look like , we have convolved the images in the left column of figure [ psfconv ] with gaussian psfs ( point spread functions ) with fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath45 ( center column ) and @xmath44 ( right column ) . \n we assume that the disk is face - on to the observer at 140 pc , the approximate distance of taurus . \n a resolution of @xmath45 is just sufficient to begin resolving the corrugations in the scattered light image , while a resolution of @xmath44 reveals only some indistinct hints of structure . \n the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) adaptive optics coronograph at the gemini observatory should be diffraction - limited at 1 micron with an 8-m aperture . however , its estimated performance is a contrast ratio of 13 mags , or @xmath46 at @xmath47 from the star , with decreasing performance closer to the star . \n this suggests that the spatial features we have modeled may not be observable with current 8-m class telescopes , and would have to wait until a 30-m class telescope such as the gmt comes online . \n high - contrast imaging on the gmt , which is being developed for imaging exoplanets , should be able to achieve a contrast ratio of @xmath42 at @xmath48 at 1.65@xmath18 m ( angel et  al . \n 2006 ) . in comparison \n , the inner edge of the simulated disk at 4 au would be at @xmath49 from the central star . \n this dashed contours in figure [ psfconv ] indicate a contrast ratio of @xmath42 , so the variability in the scattered light patterns from disk instability should be observable by the gmt \n . optical or infrared interferometry might also be good ways to observe disk instability . \n this method has already been used to detect structure in the inner 1 au of some t tauri disks ( e.g.   akeson et  al . \n .    the temporal variations may be observable if the disk is revisited over several years . \n observing this phenomenon requires finding a class i yso with the right orientation and without too much obscuration by an envelope . \n bipolar outflows that are common to many ysos may clear away envelope material along the poles , allowing a clear view to the inner regions of the disk that are of interest .    since the contrast between the disk to the star is @xmath38 at best , temporal variations in overall brightness of the unresolved source are more likely due to stellar activity than to disk activity . if the disk is resolved , then disk activity should be readily distinguished from stellar activity since the scattered light should scale with stellar brightness . \n stellar activity that affects the luminosity of the star isotropically should not affect the contrast ratio between star and disk . \n anisotropic variations , such as cold or hot star spots , can be distinguished from disk activity because these variations will have the same period as the rotation period of the star , which is on the order of days for typical young stars . \n for example , hh30 is an edge - on disk system whose periodic fluctuations in brightness are caused by illumination from a hot spot on the star sweeping across the surface of the disk as the star rotates , similar to a lighthouse ( wood et  al . \n 1998 ; wood & whitney 1998 ; cotera et  al . 2001 ) . \n this variability occurs on time scales of days and is periodic . \n in contrast , the features we have modeled vary over years and are irregular . by monitoring an object over a series of several nights \n , short - term effects can be filtered out and the year - to - year variations can be studied to determine if activity characteristic of disk instability is occuring . \n in contrast to the variability characteristic of disk instability , planet formation by core accretion should be more quiescent , resulting in a distinct shadow at the position of the forming planet core ( jang - condell 2005a , 2005b ) . \n the mechanisms are also separated in pre - main sequence evolutionary epochs : disk instability is expected to occur during the class i phase of star / planet formation , where there is substantial disk and envelope material infalling toward the star . \n core formation has a much longer expected time scale , so those signatures are detectable during the class ii phase , after the envelope has cleared but the disk still remains . \n since scattered light images of optically thick disks give information about the tenuous upper layers of the disk rather than the overall large - scale structure , one should be cautious when trying to infer disk structure from scattered light images . \n for example , the outer disk of ab aurigae ( fukagawa et  al . 2004 ) extends out to hundreds of au , and over that path length , even a small amount of material can easily block stellar illumination . \n this effect should be considered before drawing strong conclusions about the underlying disk structure . \n although scattered light emission is not directly correlated to the planet forming in the disk , the presence of structure in the scattered light emission coupled with high time variability can be an indicator of planet forming activity . \n we can at least identify disks where planets are forming even if we can not say exactly where in the disk it is taking place . \n the gmt might well be able to detect these rapid variations in scattered light on spatial scales of interest ( @xmath50 5 to 10 au ) for giant planet formation , and thus shed light on the processes occuring deep inside optically thick protoplanetary disks . \n emission from the disk itself at longer wavelengths should be a better probe of the overall disk structure both because the optical depth is smaller at longer wavelength and because direct emission from the disk has better contrast with respect to the star than scattered light . \n observations of gravitationally unstable disks in the millimeter and sub - millimeter , such as those predicted by ( narayanan et  al . \n 2006 ) , will be a useful complement to those predicted in this paper . \n we thank john chambers for helpful discussions in the preparation of this paper , and our anonymous referee for helpful comments that greatly improved it . \n the authors acknowledge support by the nasa astrobiology institute under cooperative agreement nna04cc09a .", "StartTimeOffset": 3140673460326, "RequestID": "8916f56b8d2362372d387bdfab373c1e9dfe7500", "TotalTokens": 3769}
{"ContextTokens": 2477, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "the seemingly disjoint topics of strong gravitational lensing and of the host galaxies that surround the luminous qsos at high redshift , enjoy a symbiotic relationship . \n _ hosts constrain lensing :  _ gravitationally lensed radio lobes can provide - through their spatially extended nature - more constraints on the lensing potential than the two or four point source images that are found in optically selected or radio - quiet qsos . as the majority of high - z qsos are radio - quiet , the extended stellar light of the host galaxies that surround qsos , can provide a welcome subsitute for extended radio emission ; the host galaxies form  optical einstein rings  or small arcs when lensed . \n recent examples include pg  1115 + 080 ( impey 1998 ) , mg  1131 + 0456 ( kochanek 1999 ) , q  0957 + 561 ( keeton 1999 , _ in prep . \n _ ) , and b  1938 + 666 ( king 1998 ) . \n because gravitational lensing preserves the surface brightness of the source , different images of the same host position in the source plane should only differ in surface brightness through differential dust extinction along the various image paths . in this way \n , optical images of the lensed hosts could provide a more sensitive probe of the ism in distant galaxies than the point sources alone ( falco 1999 ) . \n _ lensing helps to see host galaxies :  _ gravitational lensing magnifies both the nuclear qso emission and the surrounding host galaxy . for the unresolved nucleus this magnification simply results in a flux increase without observable changes in the source morphology ; in contrast , the extended host emission is `` stretched away '' from the nucleus at a constant surface brightness . if the psf falls off with radius @xmath2 , as for hst , gravitational lensing changes the local contrast in favor of the extended light proportional to the square of the magnification . \n 0.3truein    in the data of the castles ( see _ http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles/_ ) project several factors come together to provide unprecedented sensitivity to detecting qso host galaxies : ( 1 ) hst provides a relatively stable psf with a fwhm of @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) for a qso at @xmath4 , the host galaxy is an order of magnitude more prominent at @xmath5 compared to the agn than at optical wavelengths ; ( 3 ) the low near - ir background from space improves the sensitivity to low - surface brightness features in the outer parts of the host galaxy ; ( 4 ) gravitational lensing further improves the host \n agn contrast as discussed above .    for these reasons \n , we initiated a study of the host galaxies around gravitationally lensed quasars . \n as the lens magnification is physically unrelated to the source structure , our sample of lensed qsos should not be significantly biased compared to other samples , save some possible luminosity bias . in this paper \n , we summarize briefly the state of other host galaxy studies (  2 ) , describe the results from the castles study (  3 ) and compare them to recent theoretical models of central black hole and host galaxy growth at high redshifts (  4 ) . \n explicit empirical demonstrations that qsos are indeed active nuclei surrounded by host galaxies have been pursued for 25 years , but have been hampered , especially for distant sources , by contrast problems with the much brighter nucleus , particularly because @xmath6 . \n nonetheless , for qsos at @xmath7 , host galaxy detections have now become routine both at visible and near - ir wavelengths ( hutchings and neff 1992 ; mcleod and rieke 1995 ; bahcall 1995 ) , and a fairly coherent picture is emerging : radio - quiet qsos ( rqq ) typically live in early - type disk galaxies ( s0-sb ) whose luminosity range is centered around @xmath8 ; radio - loud qsos live in slightly more luminous hosts ( @xmath9 ) . while tidal interactions may be conducive to qso activity they are not necessary . \n mcleod ( 1999 ) showed that in all nearby qsos ( @xmath10 ) there is a maximum nuclear luminosity for any given h - band host luminosity ( figure 1 ) . converting the host luminosity into a stellar mass , @xmath11 , and applying to these qsos the locally inferred relation @xmath12 ( magorrian 1998 ) between @xmath11 and the nuclear black hole ( bh ) \n mass , mcleod ( 1999 ) deduce that these qsos can shine at most with @xmath13 .    at higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) \n the host galaxy picture becomes observationally less clear . \n the hosts of radio - loud qsos ( rlq ) have been detected in sizeable samples with reasonable completeness ( @xmath15 ) , mostly through near - ir imaging from the ground ( kotilainen 1998 , carballo 1998 ) . \n these have become possible in part because rlqs at these epochs seem to live in extremely luminous galaxies . \n the observed rlq hosts do not seem to have comparably bright present - day counter parts , but it is still not entirely clear whether most of their ( rest ) optical emission really is stellar . in most ground - based searches for rqq hosts beyond @xmath16 the detection completeness has been very low : findings are still published on individual objects ( aretxaga 1998 ) . \n the relatively few existing detections ( hutchings 1985 ) , and by implication the non - detections , suggest that the rqq hosts are of modest luminosity . \n the existing observations leave open a number of important questions about the hosts of distant qsos , which we can address through the lensing studies :    * are all qsos embedded in substantial host galaxies , or are there `` naked '' qsos ? * do the most luminous qsos ( mostly rqqs ) at their heyday ( @xmath4 ) , live in the most luminous galaxies at their epoch ? * \n do the hosts of rqqs and rlqs differ increasingly with growing redshift ? * is there the same maximum nuclear luminosity at a given host luminosity in distant qsos than at @xmath10 ? as qsos were more luminous in the past , and most galaxies were in lower mass fragments , one might expect an evolution of such a relation . \n to study gravitationally lensed qsos systematically , the castles project has obtained deep f160w ( h - band ) images ( typically for one orbit ) of most known lens systems . \n we have begun to derive de - magnified h - band magnitudes for the host galaxies wherever they are detected . in the four image systems we should expect that at least some portion of the host is highly magnified and becomes a detectable arc . \n indeed , in most highly magnified cases there is such a qualitative detection , indicating that `` naked quasars '' are rare , if they exist at all . \n however , the demagnification of such systems ( pg  1115 + 080 , fig . \n 2 ) can be quite complex ; certainly , the de - magnification of two - image lenses ( q0957 + 561 , fig . \n 2 ) is more straightforward .    in figure 3 , we have summarized the magnitudes ( and upper limit ) for an initial set of six objects ( rix 1999 ) . clearly , these host galaxies of rqqs are much fainter than bright radio galaxies ( @xmath17 ) at similar redshifts . \n for comparison , figure 3 also shows the apparent brightness of two galaxies with two different star formation histories ( sfh ) that both result in @xmath18 galaxies at the present epoch . \n if the hosts had formed all their stars at high redshift ( an @xmath18 s worth ) , they would appear much brighter . \n however , if the hosts formed stars continuously similar to the milky way , the predicted magnitudes match the observations . \n this is consistent with qso living in unexceptional host galaxies with typical sfhs that lead to @xmath18 now . \n it is instructive to compare the relation between nuclear and host luminosity for our sources at @xmath0 to the low redshift results of mcleod 1999 . \n the large filled circles in figure 1 represent the initial results from castles and show that at higher redshift the hosts are comparatively much fainter than at later epochs . \n this discrepancy would increase considerably if we compared the minimum stellar mass ( rather than h - band luminosity ) at high and low redshift . indeed , after accounting for about one magnitude of h - band m / l evolution , we would be lead to conclude that these luminous qsos at high redshift have super - eddington luminosities , _ if the same @xmath19 @xmath20 relation were to hold . \n _    instead , it appears more plausible to infer that the central bhs grew faster at early epochs than the surrounding hosts , so that @xmath21 in this case , a less massive and less luminous host galaxy could sustain a more luminous nucleus . \n recently , kauffmann and hhnelt ( 1999 ) have explored the connection between galaxy formation and central bh growth through semi - analytic models , trying to explain evolution of the galaxy population and of the qso luminosity function simultaneously . \n their models predict a quite steep evolution in the @xmath22 vs @xmath23 relation ( see figure 4 ) , but one that exactly matches our findings . \n support for the castles project was provided by nasa through grant numbers go-7495 and go-7887 from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n aretxaga , i. , le mignant , d. , melnick , j. , terlevich , r.j . , & boyle , b.j . \n 1998 , , 296 , 643 bahcall , j.n . , kirhakos , s. , & schneider , d. 1995 , , 450 , 486 carballo , r. , snchez , s.f . \n , gonlez - serrano , j.i . , benn , c.r . , & vigotti , m. 1998 , , 115 , 1234 falco e.e . \n 1999 , astro - ph/9901037 hutchings , j.b . , & \n neff , s.g . \n 1992 , , 104 , 1 hutchings , j.b . \n 1995 , , 110 , 994 impey , c.d . \n 1998 , , 509 , 551 kauffmann , g. , & hhnelt , m. 1999 , astro - ph/9906493 king , l.j . \n 1998 , 295l , 41k kochanek , c.s . \n 1998 , astro - ph/9809371 kotilainen , j.k . , \n falomo , r. , & scarpa , r. 1998 , , 332 , 503 magorrian , j. 1998 , , 115 , 2285 mcleod , b.a . , rieke , g.h . , & storrie - lombardi , l.j . \n 1999 , , 511 , l67 mcleod , k.k . , & rieke , g.h . \n 1995 , , 454 , 77 rix , h .- w . \n , 1999 , _ in prep .", "StartTimeOffset": 3164696131414, "RequestID": "2419813b958748f41766cadb038a33a2cee82b03", "TotalTokens": 2652}

like structure suggested by @xcite does not exist . \n detection of the emission at 12 from the star ( 20  pc at 6  kpc ) suggests that there can be a weak extended molecular emission near v838  mon , below the sensitivity of our observations . \n observations with a better sensitivity are needed to verify if this molecular matter can be related to the echoing matter . \n v838 mon itself was observed in the three lowest rotational transitions of co with longer integration times . \n observational details are summarized in table  2 .    in the co ( 10 ) \n transition the v838  mon position was observed only once . \n we did not find any emission stronger than @xmath24  k ( @xmath11 ) . \n we also observed 8 positions around the star , i.e. points with offsets of @xmath25 , with shorter integration times . \n in all these positions we did not detect any emission higher than @xmath26  k ( @xmath11 ) . \n the area covered by these 9 points corresponds to that of the light echo in the fall of 2005 . \n thus the echoing matter is not seen at the sensitivity of our observations .    in co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) we have spectra obtained in april and december 2005 . in the spring spectra \n we have found emission only in the co  ( 21 ) transition at a radial velocity of @xmath27  km  s@xmath4 , almost the same as the velocity of the sio maser emission @xcite . in the spectra obtained in december with much longer integration times we have found two components in both transitions . apart from the already known component at @xmath28  km  s@xmath4 , an emission is also seen at a radial velocity of @xmath29  km  s@xmath4 . \n the line intensities , widths and peak velocities are presented in table  3 . \n all the lines are very narrow . \n the component at @xmath30  km  s@xmath4 is stronger in the co ( 21 ) transition , while that at @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 is stronger in co ( 32 ) . \n when one compares the line intensities in april and december it looks like the strength of the component at @xmath32  km  s@xmath4 decreased . however , the observed change is close to the measurment uncertainty so this finding is not conclusive . \n the beam widths of our observations in co ( 21 ) and ( 32 ) are rather large ( 130  and 82  , respectively ) . \n therefore we can not say whether the emission detected at the v838 mon position comes from the closest stellar vicinity or from regions which are located at a few tens of arcmin from the star . \n it should be noted that a search for molecular emission ( including co and sio maser ) in 2003 gave negative result @xcite . the detected emission in the co lines may indicate that a molecular activity has started close to v838  mon , but its origin is unclear \n . further observations with a better angular resolution would be of particular interest in this point . \n ccccccc date&line&@xmath12&@xmath33&@xmath15&velocity range&@xmath19 + & & [ k]&[khz]&[km  s@xmath4]&[km  s@xmath4]&[k ] + 04 apr.&21&168&165.4&0.21&106.4 @xmath13 171.4&0.043 + & 32&273&339.1&0.29&121.4 @xmath13 186.4&0.083 + & & & & & & + 02 nov.&10&245&142.1&0.37&139.5 @xmath13 188.7&0.072 + & & & & & & + 26 dec.&21&310&165.4&0.21&206.8 @xmath13 233.5&0.014 + & 32&418&339.3&0.29&289.5 @xmath13 250.4&0.022 +    ccrccc date&line&&&fwhm&int . \n intensity + & & [ km  s@xmath4 ] & & [ km  s@xmath4]&[k km  s@xmath4 ] + 04 apr.&21 & 53.3 & 0.553&1.174&0.691 + 26 dec.&21 & 11.1&0.099&1.075&0.114 + & & 53.3 & 0.323&1.179&0.406 + & 32 & 11.0&0.188&1.148&0.230 + & & 53.2&0.156&1.500&0.190 +      the kosma 3 m telescope is operated by the klner observatorium fr submillimeter astronomie of the i.  physikalisches institut , universitt zu kln in collaboration with the radioastronomisches institut , universitt bonn . \n claussen , m. , healy , k. r. , starrfield , s. , & bond , h. e. 2005 in aas meeting 207 , 182.12 brand , j. & blitz , l. 1993 , a&a , 275 , 67 dame , t. m. , hartmann , d. , & thaddeus p. 2001 \n , apj , 547 , 792 deguchi , s. , matsunaga , n. , & fukushi , h. 2005 , pasj , 57 , 933 van loon , j. th . , \n evans , a. , rushton , m. t. , & smalley , b. 2004 , a&a , 427 , 193 rushton , m. t. , coulson , i. m. , evans , a. , nyman , l .-  . , \n smalley , b. , geballe , t. r. , van loon , j. th . , \n eyres , s. p. s. , & tyne , v. h. 2003 , a&a , 412 , 767 tylenda , r. , soker , n. , & szczerba , r. 2005 , a&a , 441 , 1099", "StartTimeOffset": 3179515817760, "RequestID": "c27472d710e5879b810e1538ba548624326b5da6", "TotalTokens": 3516}

{"ContextTokens": 3452, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "according to the current standard cosmological model , the dynamics of the universe would be dominated by two unknown components : dark - matter ( dm ) , responsible for structure formation , and dark - energy ( de ) , that causes the accelerated expansion . \n although there are several candidates for both dm and de , there is still no evidence of either of them in laboratory physics . from the point of view of simplicity \n , it would be interesting to explore the possibility that a single component plays the role of both de and dm , reducing from two to one the unknown constituents of the universe . \n a model that provides a single description of de and dm through unifying - dark - matteror simply quartessence @xcite has attracted a lot of interest recently . a prototype of this model is given by the quartessence chaplygin model ( qcm ) @xcite .    both the background and linear fluctuations were extensively studied for qcm , and were compared to observational data . \n the generalized chaplygin gas ( as quartessence ) appears to be compatible with all available data regarding the expansion history ( see e.g. ref . \n @xcite and refs . \n therein ) . for adiabatic perturbations , \n a linear analysis was done for the cmb @xcite  and lss @xcite . in this case , only qcm models close to the `` @xmath0cdm limit '' are allowed . \n recently , it was shown that problems ( pointed out in @xcite ) , such as the existence of instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum of qcm , can be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy perturbation is considered . \n such non - adiabatic model is consistent with the 2df power spectrum for any value of the model parameters in the permitted interval , as long as the effective shape parameter assumes certain values @xcite . \n an averaging problem  was also pointed out as a shortcoming of quartessence @xcite . \n however , it is straightforward to show that the above mentioned non - adiabatic quartessence does not suffer this kind of problem @xcite . \n thus , up to the present time , we can say that adiabatic quartessence is disfavored by the data , but it is not possible to distinguish non - adiabatic quartessence from concordance models like @xmath1cdm and quintessence using the previously considered observables . \n however , as we shall see , measurable differences in the predictions of these models appear clearly in the nonlinear regime , in particular in the skewness of the matter distribution in large scales . in our investigation \n we specifically consider three different quartessence models . \n all of them have the @xmath1cdm model as a limiting case for the background solution . \n the analysis of these three cases indicates that our result should be applicable to more generic quartessence models .    while most studies of the nonlinear regime deal with the clumping of pressureless fluid ( dm ) , in the case of quartessence it is imperative that one includes the effects of pressure . \n accordingly , we apply , and somewhat extend to include relativistic pressure , a method for the computation of density cumulants developed in refs . @xcite . \n in our approach we consider the following newtonian - like equations @xcite @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 equations ( [ poisson ] ) , ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) are , respectively , the poisson , euler and energy conservation equations , where relativistic effects of pressure ( inertia and active gravitational mass ) have been included . in these equations \n @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for , the energy density , pressure , velocity field , and gravitational potential of the cosmic fluid , and we take @xmath9 . in the linear regime , for @xmath10 ( see bellow ) , system ( [ poisson]-[cont ] ) gives exactly the same equations as the relativistic perturbation theory in a particular gauge @xcite . \n also the ( nonlinear ) energy conservation and the raychadhuri equations derived from this system are formally identical to the general relativistic ones @xcite in this case , which provides a motivation for the above system . \n it is useful to split the dynamical variables into their background and inhomogeneus parts , i.e. we write : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . here \n @xmath15 is the hubble parameter , @xmath16 stands for the scale factor , and the overbar `` @xmath17 '' denotes background ( average ) quantities . introducing comoving coordinates @xmath18 , neglecting shear and vorticity , and taking into account the background equations ( assuming critical density ) , we obtain , after some algebra , the following differential equation for the density contrast @xmath19 ,    @xmath20- { \\delta ' } ^2 \\left [ \\frac{4/3+c_{eff}^2}{1+w+\\delta(1+c_{eff}^2)}\\right]\\nonumber \\right . \\\\ & & \\left . + \\delta \\delta ' \\left [ \\frac{(w -

order equation . \n if we start with gaussian initial conditions , it is associated with the emergence of non - gaussian features in the matter density field . \n further , @xmath31 can be related to the skewness of the cosmic field @xcite . in this case , \n the unsmoothed skewness is given by @xmath34 . \n we now consider the following quartessence models : @xmath35 when @xmath36 , all the models above have @xmath0cdm as a limiting case for the background . at first and \n higher order in perturbation theory , however , these quartessence models with @xmath36 , have distinct behavior as compared to that of dark - matter in @xmath0cdm .    in figs . \n @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 we show contours of constant skewness values at present time for the above models . in our numerical computation , we consider that at @xmath40 , the growing modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 assume the einstein - de sitter behavior : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and such that @xmath43 at that time . \n we also include in the figures two curves with constant effective matter density parameter ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . here , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the present value of the background energy density . \n we should expect the region between these two curves to be , roughly , the one allowed by current observational data . \n for instance , in @xcite it was shown that , for qcm , constraints from cluster x - ray data ( that are the most restrictive ones ) , essentially correspond to these curves . \n the same holds for the other quartessence models . from the figures it is clear that , for all the considered models , the skewness in these regions assumes values between @xmath48 \n this strongly contrasts with what is expected in @xmath0cdm and quintessence , where one obtains @xmath49 , weakly sensitive to the cosmological parameters @xcite .    at first sight \n this difference could be interpreted as an indication that quartessence models are inconsistent with large - scale skewness measurements @xcite . \n however , care should be taken when analyzing this issue . \n whereas in the discussion above baryons were neglected , measurements of skewness from large - scale galaxy distribution , are based on counting luminous objects , not the dark component . eqs . \n ( 1)-(5 ) can be easily generalized to include baryons @xcite . \n the main outcome is that the quartessence skewness is not substantially affected by the presence of a small amount ( @xmath50 ) of baryons , but on the other hand , the baryonic skewness ( @xmath51 ) is nearly constant with redshift , i.e. @xmath52 . \n therefore , again baryons behave differently from the dark component as in the adiabatic quartessence power - spectrum case @xcite . \n we remark that this holds even for @xmath53 . \n further investigation is necessary to clarify to what extent do skewness measurements from galaxy distribution constrain quartessence models . although more challenging to observe , a potentially powerful probe is the lensing ( convergence ) skewness @xcite , that is sensitive to both baryons and quartessence . according to @xcite \n current lensing observations are still too noisy to allow strong constraints on cosmological parameters . on the other hand , as discussed above , quartessence predictions for the skewness are quite different from @xmath0cdm models and its variants . \n thus , we expect that present and upcoming data might discriminate among these two classes of models .    in the present work , we have not quantitatively compared quartessence predictions with observations . \n our goal here is more modest ; we essentially use figs . \n @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 to stress out the important fact that non - adiabatic quartessence and concordance models like @xmath0cdm and quintessence could be observationally distinguished by skewness measurements . \n we leave this investigation for a future work @xcite . \n finally , we remark that our results do not apply straightforwardly to quartessence models with a scalar field with , for instance , a non - canonical kinetic term @xcite , but these models have yet to be tested against background and power spectrum data . \n a. kamenshchik , u. moschella , and v. pasquier , phys . lett . \n b * 511 * , 265 ( 2001 ) ; m. makler , _ gravitational dynamics of structure formation in the universe _ , phd thesis , brazilian center for research in physics ( 2001 ) ; n. bili , g.b . \n tupper , and r.d . \n viollier , phys . lett . \n b * 535 * , 17 ( 2002 ) ; m.c . \n bento , o. bertolami , and a.a . sen , \n d * 66 * , 043507 ( 2002 ) . \n l. amendola , f. finelli , c. burigana , and d. carturan , jcap * 07 * , 005 ( 2003 ) . \n see also d. carturan , f. finelli , phys.rev . \n d * 68 * , 103501 ( 2003 ) and r. bean and o. dore , phys.rev . \n d * 68 * , 023515 ( 2003 ) for the case of the chaplygin fluid as only dark energy . \n e. gaztaaga and j.a . \n frieman , astrophys . \n j. * 437 * , l13 ( 1994 ) ; f. hoyle , i. szapudi , and c.m . \n baugh , mon . not . \n * 317 * , l51 ( 2000 ) ; i. szapudi , m. postman , t.r . \n lauer , and w. oegerle , astrophys . j. * 548 * , 114 ( 2001 ) ; i. szapudi _ et . \n _ , astrophys . \n j. * 570 * , 75 ( 2002 ) ; for review see f. bernardeau , s. colombi , e. gaztaaga , and r. scoccimarro , phys . rep . * 367 * , 1 ( 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3234562413763, "RequestID": "a43f6fb7f481548b4a175b5ae93a0b419c16bab9", "TotalTokens": 3637}

parallel limit in which angle between the galaxy pair in a survey is small . additionally , these expressions allow for a much more productive use of redshift surveys since all galaxy pairs can be utilized in a given wide angle survey . \n it can also be used in adjunct with more sophisticated methods of analysis such as construction of eigenvectors for a kl analysis ( vogeley and szalay 1996 ) . \n the symmetries in the geometric configuration of redshift surveys have been elegantly described in hc96 , who recognized that the correlation function in redshift space is tied to a triangle formed by the observer and the two galaxies which lie upon two arbitrary lines of sight . \n the correlation function should be a function of this triangle , but otherwise invariant under rotations about the observer . \n such invariant triangles can be characterized by one size and two shape parameters . \n we will use two angles to describe the shape of the triangle , and express the scale dependence of the correlation function as a function of @xmath11 , the distance between the two points .    in this coordinate system , which is illustrated in fig . \n 1 , the two points are located at points @xmath12 and @xmath13 \n . the observer is at the origin , at rest in comoving frame . \n the angle between the two normal vectors is @xmath14 , that is @xmath15 . \n the separation between the two points is @xmath16 , with a normal vector @xmath17 . \n the angles between @xmath18 and @xmath17 are @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . \n the symmetry axis for @xmath21 and @xmath22 is found by halving the angle @xmath14 . \n the angle between this symmetry axis and @xmath23 is @xmath24 . \n we assume that @xmath25 , thus @xmath26 . \n the angles are related to each other as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . \n this introduction implies our choice of the two angles , @xmath24 and @xmath29 , which together with @xmath30 completely describe the shape of the triangle . \n these angles are particularly convenient since @xmath29 is given by our geometry and @xmath24 smoothly approaches the angle familiar in the plane - parallel limit as @xmath29 tends to 0 . \n there is another geometric relation between the two angles : if @xmath29 is not 0 , then the smallest value @xmath24 can take is @xmath29 , and its largest value is @xmath31 . \n this is not due to the choice of coordinates but rather to the geometry of the problem . \n we will provide an expression for the distortions of the correlation function as a series expansion in terms of the angle @xmath24 , where the coefficients have a simple @xmath32 and @xmath29 dependence , together with a dependence on the parameter @xmath1 that we wish to measure . \n so far our approach has been quite similar to most earlier work except for the introduction of a convenient set of angles which will simplify the results considerably . \n it has been a persistent problem to get a simple power spectrum or correlation function beyond the kaiser ( 1987 ) plane - parallel limit . \n the difficulty lies in that the fourier space transfer function , the ratio of the distorted and undistorted power spectrum contains a strong mode - coupling ( zaroubi and hoffmann 1996 ) . \n thus , the transfer function is not multiplicative but contains an integral over a non - local kernel with a strong @xmath33-dependence . \n this dependence strongly affects the multipole coefficients which would otherwise make a precise determination of @xmath1 quite straightforward . \n one alternative has been to use only galaxy pairs at small angular separations ( e.g. cole 1994 , 1995 ) . \n it is interesting to consider what the reasons are for this non - locality . with a finite @xmath29 \n , the original symmetry of the problem is lost , and the geometry is inherently two - dimensional . \n this effect is thus arising from ` aliasing ' ( kaiser and peacock 1991 , szalay 1993 , landy 1996 ) , i.e. projections of the spherically isotropic power to the lower dimensions of the survey geometry . \n interestingly enough , even though the power spectrum is definitely non - local , the redshift space correlation function can still be computed in spherical coordinates , and it can be expressed in a closed form , as will be shown below .    in the following section 2.2 , we will first derive a representation of the redshift distortion problem in terms of spherical tensors . \n this development , being a representation independent expansion , is independent of our choice of coordinate system described above . in section 2.3 \n , we will reintroduce our coordinates and show how the coefficients of this expansion can be most economically expressed using these coordinates . \n we can assume without a loss of generality , that the observer is at rest with respect to the cmb frame . \n as shown by hc96 , this effect can be trivially included . \n the linear expansion of the overdensity at a redshift space coordinate @xmath34 relates to the real - space overdensity at @xmath23 , with @xmath35 , as a function of the radial velocity @xmath36 and its line - of - sight derivative @xmath37 , as first introduced by kaiser ( 1987 ) , @xmath38 here @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the selection function which is a slowly varying function of @xmath32 , the radial distance from the observer . due to the fact that the velocity scale is much smaller than the typical depth of todays redshift surveys , \n this term is very small and is generally ignored . \n we will include this term for completeness in our results but would like to make one other point why this term is additionally small . if the redshift survey is defined by a boundary on the sky , a given selection function , and a range of the radial coordinate @xmath41 , then @xmath42 will be averaged , weighted by the selection function . integrating by parts \n one can show that this term is small and becomes zero as the lower limit becomes 0 and the upper limit @xmath43 , the case of full surveys . \n the peculiar velocity can be written concisely as a fourier integral , with the usual @xmath0 , as @xmath44 in order to simplify subsequent calculations , we introduce here the spherical tensor @xmath45 as @xmath46 one can then reexpress the redshift - space overdensity at the point @xmath23 in terms of @xmath45 as @xmath47 this use of spherical coordinates makes it easy to express the correlation of the different @xmath45 components , at positions @xmath48 and @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the legendre polynomial , @xmath52 and @xmath8 is the power spectrum with the definition @xmath53 . \n the redshift - space two - point correlation function of finite - angle is given in terms of @xmath54 , where we will use @xmath55 . \n @xmath56 +       \\frac{2}{3 } \\beta^2\\left [ \\alpha_1 s_{12}^1 +       \\alpha_2 s_{21}^1 \\right ]       -\\,\\beta^2 \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 s_{11}^2   \\label{eq : a8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both the legendre polynomials and the plane wave @xmath57 can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are spherical bessel functions and spherical harmonics , respectively . \n we can express the integral of three @xmath60 s over @xmath61 with the wigner @xmath62-symbols . \n we also introduce the bipolar spherical harmonics @xmath63 which transform as a spherical harmonic with @xmath64 with respect to rotations ( varshalovich 1988 ) . \n @xmath65 with @xmath66 these can form a rotationally invariant scalar , dependent on @xmath67 , where @xmath68 indicates the shape of the triangle formed by the three unit vectors . \n any quantity that is a scalar function of @xmath68 is independent of what angles or parameters we may choose to describe the triangle shape . \n this invariant scalar @xmath69 is symmetric in @xmath70 . \n @xmath71 with this notation , equation ( [ eq : a6 ] ) reduces to @xmath72 where @xmath73      the above expression shows the correlation function can be written in terms of a series , factorized into size @xmath32 and shape @xmath68 dependent terms , providing a representation independent expansion . \n equations ( [ eq : a8 ] ) and ( [ eq : a12 ] ) give an expression of the redshift - space correlation function . \n re - expanding in terms of @xmath74 , the @xmath68 dependence is contained in the coefficients @xmath75 : @xmath76 it is at this point that the use of any particular coordinate system becomes paramount . \n since the coefficients @xmath75 \n are functions of the shape of the triangle under consideration , a judicious use of coordinates can simplify the problem considerably , as will be shown below . \n the terms proportional to @xmath77 have been saparated , since these disappear in the plane - parallel limit . after a somewhat tedious reduction procedure , most of it carried out in mathematica \n , we obtain the following results : @xmath78 and @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\    & \\,\\,\\ , + &    \\frac15 ( \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 ) \\beta^2    \\sin\\theta    [ \\cos^2 \\theta p_1(\\sin\\gamma ) -

   \\frac23 \\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 \\beta^2 p_2(\\cos\\gamma ) . \n \\label{eq : a46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first set of coefficients , which do not contain @xmath42 , capture most of the relevant physics . for the sake of completeness \n , the second set gives the @xmath42-dependent terms @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 which must be included for calculations in which @xmath84 and @xmath85 can not be neglected \n .    from these expressions , it is evident that a good choice of coordinate system matters a great deal . \n using the system discussed above ( angles @xmath29 and @xmath24 , separation @xmath32 ) , leads to remarkably simple expressions for the coefficients @xmath86 . \n other systems we explored generally contained a lot of associated legendre polynomials . it is easily seen in the above expression that taking the limit @xmath87 reproduces kaiser - hamilton s plane - parallel result . \n we have presented a derivation of the redshift space correlation function between galaxies at two infinitesimal volume elements separated by an arbitrary angle , and have obtained very simple closed form analytic expressions for the correlations . \n these equations show that the effects of a finite angle are quite important . \n these are illustrated graphically in figure 2 which indicates how the redshift distortions change as the angle between the two lines of sight is increased from 0 to 120 degrees . \n since most of the next generation redshift surveys are wide angle with the majority of pairs separated at angles greater than 10 degrees , the use of these expressions will dramatically increase the amount of information which can be extracted from the surveys resulting in more robust measurements and smaller shot noise contamination . \n also , if the survey is not contiguous but consists of several slices like the las campanas survey ( landy etal 1996 ) , or the 2df survey which will be formed from hundreds of pencilbeams , this approach can use all the data together to estimate the infall distortions . \n another promising approach to study the large scale behavior of the power spectrum is with building up a karhunen - loeve basis ( vogeley and szalay 1996 ) . \n the first step in that method is to subdivide the survey into small cells ( in redshift space ) and then construct their correlation matrix . \n most pairs of cells will have a large relative angle . \n thus , with the expressions presented here , computing the correlation matrix is a trivial exercise . \n once the appropriate basis has been created , one can use the fisher matrix to select the set of eigenmodes most sensitive to @xmath1 , yielding an optimal estimation of the value of @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we believe that our results allow a much more elegant treatment of the redshift distortions in a general geometry than before with the added benefit that all galaxy pairs may be utilized to construct a signal . \n bardeen , j. , bond , j.r . , kaiser , n. , szalay , a.s . \n 1986 , , 304,15 cole , s. , fisher , k.b . , weinberg , d.h . \n 1994 , , 267 , 785 cole , s. , fisher , k.b . , weinberg , d.h . \n 1995 , , 275 , 515 davis , m. , peebles , p.j.e . 1983 , , 267 , 465 hamilton , a.j.s . \n 1992 , , 385 , l5 hamilton , a.j.s . , culhane , m. 1996 , , 278 , 73 heavens , a.f . , \n taylor , a.n . \n 1995 , , 275 , 483 landy , s.a . , \n schectman , s.a . , \n lin , h . , \n kirshner , r . \n oemler , a.a . , tucker , d . \n 1996 , , 456 , 1 lilje , p. , efstathiou , g.p . \n 1989 , , 236 , 851 kaiser , n. 1987 , , 227 , 1 kaiser , n. and peacock , j.a . \n 1991 , , 379 , 482 peebles , p.j.e . \n 1980 , the large scale structure of the universe , ( princeton university press : princeton ) szalay , a.s . , \n broadhurst , t.j . , \n ellman , n. , koo , d.c . , ellis , r.s . \n 1993 , proc . \n , 90 , 4853 varshalovich , d.a . , moskalev , a.n . , \n khershonski , v.k . \n 1988 , quantum theory of angular momentum ( world scientific ) vogeley , m.s . \n szalay , a.s . \n 1996 , , 465 , 34 zaroubi , s. , hoffmann , y. 1996 , , 462 , 25", "StartTimeOffset": 3251207732358, "RequestID": "432cb168ee7f23823db8d42b1163ddac340b3525", "TotalTokens": 4100}

{"ContextTokens": 3193, "GeneratedTokens": 224, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years , advanced production techniques have made it possible to create metals , alloys and ceramics with grain sizes down to 5 nm . for metals , \n this represents a reduction of the grain size by approximately four orders of magnitude compared to most conventionally produced metals . \n as can be expected , such a dramatic change in the microstructure leads to significant changes in the mechanical properties of the metals . \n for example , the hardness of typical nanocrystalline metals is far higher than what is seen in their coarse - grained counterparts ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n nanocrystalline metals are an attractive group of metals to model , as the small grain size provides a `` cut - off '' of the typical length scales , where structures appear during deformation \n . in coarse - grained materials structures appear on vastly different length scales , making it very difficult to model the properties of these materials . \n the models must include processes that occur on length scales from the sub - nanometer scale of the atomic processes in dislocation cores , to the micro- or even millimeter scale of grain and subgrain structures @xcite . \n atomic - scale simulations of systems of these sizes are beyond the reach of even the most powerful of todays supercomputers . \n one is thus forced to split the system into sub - problems at different length - scales , and only treat sub - problems at the atomic scale with atomistic models . \n on coarser length scales other modeling paradigms must be used , such as dislocation dynamics and continuum plasticity calculations . \n dividing the problem into sub - problems at different length scales often results in a better understanding of the problem , as it draws attention to the structures which are relevant at a given length scale ( for example , when studying the formation of dislocation structures it is clearly more relevant to focus on dislocations as the fundamental concept rather than on individual atoms ) . \n on the other hand , one becomes dependent on this understanding , when creating the coarse - grained models , as many assumptions about the relevant phenomena at different length - scales will by necessity be built into the multi - scale model . \n the low grain size of nanocrystalline metals `` compresses '' this range of length scales to a range , where the whole deformation problem can be modeled at the atomic scale , as many grains in the polycrystalline material can be handled in an atomic - scale simulation . \n this makes it possible to perform unbiased simulations of the deformation process , where no _ a priori _ assumptions are made about the deformation mechanisms .    in recent papers \n , we have presented simulations of the plastic deformation of nanocrystalline cu and pd @xcite . \n other authors have presented simulations of the structure and elastic properties of nanocrystalline metals and semiconductors @xcite , and of the plastic deformation of ni under constant stress loading @xcite . in this paper \n we review our simulations of the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline metals , and present simulations of the effects of impurities in the grain boundaries . \n we have attempted to generate three - dimensional systems with a microstructure similar to that observed experimentally in samples generated by inert gas condensation ( igc ) . \n the grains appear to be randomly oriented , approximately equiaxed , and dislocation free . \n the grain size distribution is close to log - normal ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n we try to create systems that match this description . \n the grains are produced using a three - dimensional voronoi tesselation : random grain centers are chosen , and space is divided into regions in such a way that each region consists of the points in space closer to a given grain center than to any other grain center . \n each region is then filled with a randomly oriented fcc lattice . \n an example of a two - dimensional voronoi tessellation is shown in figure [ fig : voronoi ] . \n the generated samples are annealed for 50ps at 300k to relax the grain boundary structure . \n we found that the annealing time and temperature are uncritical , but that the properties of the system are different if _ no _ annealing is done . \n the interactions between the atoms are modeled using the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite . \n emt is a many - body potential providing a realistic description of the metallic bonding , in particular in face - centered cubic ( fcc ) metals and alloys of fcc metals . \n computationally , emt is not much more demanding than pair potentials , but provide a significantly more realistic description of the metallic bonding . \n the systems were deformed using a molecular dynamics ( md ) procedure . \n a conventional md simulation was performed , but at each timestep the atomic coordinates in the pulling direction ( the @xmath0 coordinates ) were rescaled in order to deform the system gradually . at the same time , the box dimensions in the transverse directions are allowed to shrink to keep the transversal components of the stress ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) close to zero @xcite . \n the change in system dimensions is slow at the timescale of the simulation , the relative elongation is @xmath3 each timestep . with a timestep of 5 fs , this nevertheless results in a very high strain rate ( @xmath4 ) . \n the results presented here are not very sensitive to the strain rate , although some dependence is seen ( typical stresses increase by 20% when the strain rate is changed from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) @xcite . \n +    figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the deformation of a typical sample with an average grain size of 5.21 nm . \n the atoms have been color coded according to the local crystal structure @xcite . \n white atoms are in local fcc order , and thus situated inside the grains . \n light grey atoms are in local hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) order , these atoms are at stacking faults . \n atoms in all other local environments are colored dark grey . \n these are typically atoms at grain boundaries and in dislocation cores . \n some dislocation activity is seen in the system , as witnessed by the generation of stacking faults . \n the dislocation activity is not sufficient to account for the observed plastic deformation . \n a detailed analysis of the deformation shows that the main deformation mode is sliding in the grain boundaries @xcite .    as the volume fraction of atoms in the grain boundary increases with decreasing grain size \n , one would expect that increasing the grain size increases the strength of the material as long as the grain boundaries remain the carriers of the deformation . \n this is indeed what we see in the simulations . \n figure [ fig : stress ] shows the stress - strain curves obtained from simulations of systems with various average grain sizes . a `` reverse hall - petch effect '' , i.e. a softening of the material with decreasing grain size , \n is observed . \n the simulations of the deformation of nanocrystalline metals show a reverse hall - petch effect in cu and pd for the grain sizes studied . \n this softening of the material , when the grain size is reduced is caused by plastic deformation in the grain boundaries . \n there appears to be two different deformation mechanisms active at different grain sizes . in metals with the very small grain sizes studied here , the dominating deformation mechanism is sliding in the grain boundaries through a large number of essentially uncorrelated events , where a few atoms move with respect to each other at each event @xcite .    at much coarser grain sizes , \n dislocations are known to be the dominating carriers of deformation . \n in that regime , a hardening of the material is seen , when the grain size is reduced , as the grain boundaries act as barriers to the dislocation motion . \n experimentally , this behavior is seen to continue far down into the nanocrystalline range . \n as the grain size is reduced , dislocation - mediated deformation becomes more and more difficult . on the other hand , the volume fraction of the grain boundaries increases , favoring a deformation mechanism where the grain boundaries carry the deformation . \n furthermore , as the grain size is approaching the grain boundary thickness , it becomes geometrically easier for slip to occur on more than one grain boundary , without large stress concentrations where the grain boundaries meet @xcite . \n the emerging picture is one where two deformation mechanisms compete . \n one is active at very small grain sizes , another at larger grain sizes . \n this leads to a maximum in the yield stress and hardness of nanocrystalline metals at intermediate grain sizes , see figure [ fig : maximum ] . \n there have been many reports in the literature of a `` reverse hall - petch effect '' at sufficiently small grain sizes . however , the hardness measurements are very sensitive to sample defects , and in particular to sample porosity @xcite . in high - quality cu samples , the hall - petch effect is seen to continue at least down to grain sizes around 15 nm @xcite \n .    there does not appear to be any _ unequivocal _ experimental evidence for a reverse hall - petch relationship in porosity free nanocrystalline metals . \n there are , however , indications of a break - down of the ordinary hall - petch relation at grain sizes below 15 nm in high quality copper samples produced by inert gas condensation @xcite . \n the ordinary hall - petch effect appears to cease , although a reverse hall - petch relation is not seen . \n it is still difficult to make direct comparisons between simulations and experiment , as there is little overlap in grain size . \n as the experimental techniques improve , there is hope that more experimental data will be gathered on high - quality samples with grain sizes below 1015 nm . \n it should then become clear if the hall - petch effect does indeed break down at these grain sizes . at the same time , computer simulations of larger systems might lead to observations of the cross - over region between the reverse and the ordinary hall - petch effect . that cross - over region is beyond the reach of the largest simulations presented here . \n the grain boundaries remain the main carriers of the deformation even when the grain size is increased to 13.2 nm , but be _ do _ observe a slight increase in dislocation activity as the grain size is increased . \n as the main deformation mechanism is sliding in the grain boundaries , it could be expected that altering the structure and composition of the grain boundaries might have an effect on the properties of the material . \n one such modification is the addition of impurity atoms in the grain boundaries . \n we have chosen to study the effects of silver impurities . \n a reason for choosing silver was that silver and copper are immiscible , low concentrations of silver impurities in nanocrystalline copper can therefore be expected to segregate to the grain boundaries . we have not studied the segregation process itself , as it is beyond the scope of this study . \n segregation is a slow , diffusional process that can not be studied directly with md simulations due to the timescales involved . \n other approaches ( such as monte carlo or kinetic monte carlo simulations ) may be more appropriate . \n instead of simulating the segregation process , we have generated systems that model nanocrystalline copper after such a segregation has occurred . \n it is done by replacing 25% of the atoms in the grain boundaries with silver atoms , see figure [ fig : initag ] . \n the system is then annealed and deformed in the same way as the pure systems . \n +   +    figure [ fig : compare ] shows how the stress - strain curves have changed , when silver is introduced in the grain boundaries . \n the general trend seems to be a slight softening of the material , although the effect is very weak and not seen in all systems . \n figure [ fig : flowstress ] shows the flow stress levels for the different simulations , i.e.  the stress level at the horizontal part of the stress - strain curve ( for simplicity the flow stress was defined as the average stress for @xmath7 ) . \n we again see the tendency for the silver - containing systems to be softer .    in the simulations of impurities in the grain boundaries , the mechanical behavior is close to what is seen in the pure systems . \n as the major part of the deformation happens in the grain boundaries , one could expect that adding impurities in the grain boundaries could have a relatively large effect on the mechanical properties . \n the simulations presented here show that this is not the case , when silver is used as impurities in copper . \n we see a tendency towards a weakening of the material , but the effect is barely detectable . \n the atomic bonding in copper and silver are of a similar nature , and the size of the atoms are not very different . \n this may account for the absence of a stronger effect of alloying in the grain boundaries . \n atomic - scale simulations have been used to study the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline copper with and without impurities in the grain boundaries . in both cases , we find that the main deformation mode is sliding in the grain boundaries through a large number of apparently uncorrelated events , each involving only a few atoms . \n some dislocation activity is seen in the grains , the dislocations are probably necessary to allow the grains to deform a little , as they glide past each other . \n we observe a _ reverse hall - petch effect _ , \n i.e.  a hardening of the material as the grain size is increased : as the amount of grain boundary atoms is decreased , the deformation becomes harder . at the same time \n the dislocation activity is seen to increase a little with grain size . \n this effect is seen in the entire range of grain sizes that we have studied ( 3 to 13 nm ) , but at some point we expect that dislocation motion will begin to dominate the behavior of the system . \n when that happens , the yield strength should begin to _ decrease _ with increasing grain size . \n adding silver to the grain boundaries has only a weak effect on the properties of the material . \n the strength of the material is seen to decrease marginally , when the silver is introduced . \n we expect that other elements , which chemically behave in a way that is more different from copper will have a larger effect , but such simulations remain to be made . \n this work was financed by the danish technical research council through grant no . \n parallel computer time was financed by the danish research councils through grant no . \n center for atomic -

where the channel consists of an arbitrary transformation of the input states @xcite . \n encoding classical information into quantum states of physical systems gives a physical implementation of the constructs of information theory . \n the majority of research into quantum communication channels has focused on the memoryless case , although there have been a number of important results obtained

polarized and @xmath53 as real .    due to the smallness of the wave vector @xmath1 , as compared to the electron momentum , one can expand all quantities in powers of @xmath1 . \n expanding by @xmath1 we can write the argument of the delta - function as @xmath54 ( we choose the direction of axis x along @xmath0 ) . at the same time , @xmath1 is comparable with @xmath55 and we keep ourselves from subsequent expansion of the delta - function .      if @xmath18 is independent on the energy of electrons then the integration in eq.([jjj ] ) can be done directly . \n the current has different values inside and outside the region @xmath14 . \n if @xmath14 then we have @xmath59 these values represent resonant photon drag rde . \n it remains constant if @xmath60 . \n the value of resonant current is determined by @xmath61 . for the photon flow @xmath62@xmath63s@xmath64 , \n @xmath65 s , @xmath66a / cm . \n this approximately corresponds to a power of @xmath67 for photons with energy @xmath68 . \n if @xmath69 , then there is only nde current . \n it is proportional to @xmath1 : @xmath70 the value of nde is significantly smaller then the rde value .    in agreement with the simple estimates \n the rde has always the direction opposite to the direction of light wave vector . \n its polarization dependence is explained by the dependence of the directional diagram of excitation : most of carriers are excited perpendicular to the polarization . at the same time \n the fermi sea limits the transitions by the direction of the photon wave vector . \n this circumstances together determine lower x - component of current if @xmath71 in comparison with the case @xmath72 and also the appearance of y - component of the rde current .    in agreement with the system symmetry \n , @xmath73 exists only if the polarization has both @xmath74 and @xmath75 components . \n the rde current exists in a narrow window @xmath14 which shrinks if @xmath60 . \n but inside this window rde is much stronger than nde so the later can be neglected in this window .     versus normalized frequency @xmath76 . \n the solid curve shows the longitudinal component of current @xmath77 , the field is polarized along the projection of the wave vector on the plane ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath73 at @xmath79 . \n the dashed curve shows @xmath77 at @xmath80 . \n , width=283 ]    ; @xmath77 is shown by dash curve , @xmath73 is shown by solid curve.,width=283 ]    the sign of x - component of nde depends on polarization . \n this contradicts to a simple assumption according to which the current is mainly determined by kicks which photons give to electrons . the origin of this difference is the dependence of the directional diagram on the small wave vector @xmath0 via the parameter @xmath51 : at some polarizations electrons prefer to be excited in opposite direction to @xmath0 . \n this explains the change of sign . \n 3 demonstrates the dependence of rde current components on the frequency in the window @xmath14 where rde exists . \n the current vanishes at the edges of the window . \n the component @xmath77 is larger for the polarization along the y axis . \n the component @xmath73 appears only for tilted polarization of the light . \n 4 shows the dependence of @xmath77 and @xmath73 on the angle @xmath81 between the vector of polarization @xmath53 and the wave vector @xmath0 . \n we have studied the electron contribution to the photon drag current . in fact \n , in the considered system the hole contribution also presents . \n the symmetry between holes and electrons in a neutral system means that these contributions double . \n however , the result will be changed if to take into account the difference between electrons and holes caused by their different excitation energy : while electrons are generated near the fermi energy the holes appear well below the fermi energy . \n this leads to a strong difference between the relaxation times . in high - mobility samples at low temperature the momentum relaxation time near \n the fermi energy is much greater than far from the fermi energy . at the same time , quick relaxation of excited electrons ( holes ) to the fermi energy due to electron - electron interaction ( described by e - e relaxation time @xmath82 ) conserves their momenta up to the moment when excitations reaches the temperature layer . \n this results in equality of holes and electrons contributions to the current . and vice versa \n , electron -

{"ContextTokens": 3779, "GeneratedTokens": 82, "SynthesizedBody": "future linear colliders will be very useful for the detailed exploration of the new physics we expect to be discovered at the lhc . supersymmetry is certainly one of the leading candidates for such new physics . however , even its simplest manifestation , the mssm , is impossible to study in all its generality due to the @xmath1 free parameters associated with soft susy breaking . for this reason \n the mssm has usually been studied within certain specific susy breaking frameworks , such as msugra , since there are then only a few independent parameters to explore . while these susy breaking mechanisms are all theoretically well - motivated they are also necessarily highly constraining and so one can wonder how representative they are of the more general mssm and whether or not the conclusions we draw from studying them can always be trusted in all situations . \n for example , it well known within msugra that searches for squarks and gluinos at the tevatron place rather strong lower bounds on their masses in the range of @xmath2 gev@xcite . \n these results are predicated on the assumption that in msugra scenarios the production of squarks and gluinos and their subsequent decay lead to multiple high @xmath3 jets as well as significant met due to the rather large mass splitting between the squarks / gluinos and the lsp ( which is typically the lightest neutralino ) . these and similar results have motivated several sets of benchmark points@xcite for collider studies all of which having squarks and gluinos with masses in excess of @xmath4 gev and thus beyond the range accessible to even a 1 tev @xmath0 collider . \n however , one can easily imagine other susy breaking scenarios wherein these mass splittings are much smaller . \n in such cases the resulting jets from decays are too soft to pass the analyses cuts causing the squarks and gluinos to be missed at the tevatron@xcite . \n this and others scenarios leading to the possibility of light 1st and 2nd generation squarks and gluinos can been realized in more general models as discussed in ref.@xcite with the results being shown in fig . \n [ fig0 ] for the case of a flat prior scan . \n ( similar results are obtained in the case of a log prior scan . ) by obvious extension one can imagine constructing scenarios wherein the conventional inclusive met analyses at the lhc end up missing susy in some cases as has been shown in ref.@xcite . as these analyses demonstrate , the possibility of light squarks and gluinos remains a viable one that should be examined in detail at @xmath0 colliders . here \n , we make a few comments on these possibilities , pointing out that much work remains to be done if such scenarios are actually realized at future @xmath0 colliders .          at @xmath0 colliders for masses of 200 and 500 \n gev . from top \n to bottom the curves correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively in the lh panel . \n same in the rh panel but now as a function of the squark mass with @xmath7 tev held fixed.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   at @xmath0 colliders for masses of 200 and 500 gev . from top \n to bottom the curves correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively in the lh panel . \n same in the rh panel but now as a function of the squark mass with @xmath7 tev held fixed.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] \n the simplest signals for squark / gluino production at @xmath0 colliders are jets plus met with the number of jets possibly indicative of the mass ordering of the squarks and gluinos at lo in sqcd . for example \n , if @xmath8 we may have the decays such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 whereas if @xmath11 then instead we may have the decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n of course , the gluinos may lie in the middle of the squark mass spectrum as well since some squarks may be significantly heavier than others . in principle , all of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 final states may be accessible at @xmath0 colliders at some level depending on the machine energy , integrated luminosity and the details of the sparticle spectrum . \n the actual signatures for squark and gluino production critically depend upon how the gaugino state(s ) @xmath16 themselves decay subsequent to their production in the squark / gluino decay chain . in the absence of yukawa couplings for the first 2 generations , the states \n @xmath16 can only have bino ( and/or wino ) components for decays arising from rh(lh)-squarks and can in the simplest case lead to , , me _ provided _ \n @xmath16 is identified with the lsp . of course , in general , @xmath16 need not be the lsp or even neutral and so the resulting decay chain can be much more complex . \n for example , @xmath16 could be a long - lived chargino so that susy events no longer have any me in their final states or @xmath16 could be a heavier neutralino that lives sufficiently long to decay to a non - pointing photon inside the detector volume . \n furthermore , @xmath16 may decay to other susy particles that can have unusual decay patterns themselves depending upon the identity of the nlsp . \n in fact , in the more general mssm , the nlsp can be any of the 13 possible states including the squarks and gluinos themselves@xcite which allow them to possibly be long - lived . \n clearly , outside of the presence of multijet activity , the final states in squark and gluino decays may be quite complex and highly model dependent . \n ( left ) and 2(right tev for various assumed lsp masses assuming the 2-body decay to the lsp . here , top to bottom in the top of each panel , the curves correspond to lsp masses of 60 to 210 gev in 30 gev steps.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] ( left ) and 2(right tev for various assumed lsp masses assuming the 2-body decay to the lsp . here , top to bottom in the top of each panel , the curves correspond to lsp masses of 60 to 210 gev in 30 gev steps.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    squark pair production is the simplest process to study and has a standard spin-0 , @xmath17-channel cross - section behavior , , @xmath18 with typical rates shown in fig . \n in particular note the rather slow @xmath19 turn - on of this production process . \n @xmath20 beam polarization can used to help distinguish lh from rh squarks via their electroweak couplings to the @xmath21 . \n the squark masses may be determined via the usual threshold measurement techniques or by reconstructing specific final states . \n for example , as is well - known , if the squark and anti - squark each decay directly to j+lsp , then measurements of the endpoints and edges of the jet energy spectra@xcite can be used to extract the squark and lsp masses as can be seen in figs . \n [ fig2b ] and  [ fig2 ] . \n sm backgrounds to this process from @xmath22 initial states and from @xmath23 can be mostly removed by employing jet acoplanarity , dijet mass and large me cuts . \n one should be reminded , however , that the susy spectrum can be rather complex with many sparticle states being produced simultaneously . \n this can lead to many additional simultaneous sources of high energy jet spectrum edges so this simple analysis may be rather more complex than is usually advertised . \n furthermore , since the squarks in the first two generations of a given handedness and charge are likely to be degenerate to a very high degree ( with splittings at most at the level of @xmath24mev ) flavor tagging will be useful for , , separating out jets from scharm decay from those arising from @xmath25 . \n thus even this simplest final state may require a detailed study to completely understand . \n of course if the @xmath16 is not the lsp then reconstructing the entire final state from squark decays will prove to be even more difficult .     for sps1a(dashed ) and for the case of 250(300 ) squarks(gluinos ) in the lh panel and for 500(200)squarks(gluinos ) in the rh panel . \n the squark flavor labels are as in fig.1.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   for sps1a(dashed ) and for the case of 250(300 ) squarks(gluinos ) in the lh panel and for 500(200)squarks(gluinos ) in the rh panel . \n the squark flavor labels are as in fig.1.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    if squarks are sufficiently long - lived due to spectrum degeneracies the threshold region may be more complex than discussed above due to the formation of squarkonium bounds states . \n these have been studied in @xmath0 collisions to some extent in the case of stops@xcite but not for the squarks of the first two generations which can have somewhat different phenomenology . . \n perhaps the most direct way to access gluinos in @xmath0 collisions , provided they are heavier than the squarks , is production in association with squarks , , via the process @xmath26@xcite . \n typical cross sections for this process are shown in fig . \n note these cross section values , somewhat below @xmath27 fb , are substantially smaller than in the typical case of squark pair production , , @xmath28 fb . \n this is not completely unexpected since associated production is a 3-body process with an additional qcd coupling being present . clearly , to access gluino properties using this mechanism will require substantial integrated luminosity . note the rapid rise in the cross section in the rh panel which arises when the intermediate squark goes on - shell . \n annihilation from ref@xcite.,width=566 ]    of course , it is also possible to produce a pair of gluinos directly via their couplings to virtual photons and @xmath21 s through loop diagrams involving both squarks and quarks as shown in fig . \n [ fig4 ] . in general \n , the cross section for gluino pair production in @xmath0 collisions can be written in the form @xmath29~\\beta^3~(1+\\cos^2 \\theta)$ ] whose basic structure follows directly from the fact that the gluinos are spin-1/2 majorana fermions@xcite produced by @xmath30channel exchanges . here , the @xmath31 label the polarizations of the incoming @xmath20 and @xmath32 result from summing over a large number of 1-loop amplitudes . in general , the calculation of the coefficients @xmath32 can involve the entire strongly interacting sector of the mssm so that the resulting cross sections can be very sensitive to the bulk of the mssm parameter space . \n this being the case , understandably , up to now the @xmath33 process has mostly been studied within the constraints of the msugra scenario with its limited free parameter set . \n studies of this process in a more general context would be very beneficial .     and as a function of @xmath34 for different mssm parameters as given in ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]   and as a function of @xmath34 for different mssm parameters as given in ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , significant rates for this process are more favorable if squark mass degeneracies , which are common in msugra , can be removed from the spectrum . \n the main reason for this is that the contributions of lh- and rh - squarks tend to cancel as do those arising from within a given lh - squark doublet due to their opposite value of @xmath35 . \n furthermore , larger rates are favored if the squark masses take on somewhat smaller values . within the msugra scenario \n the dominant contribution clearly arises from stop loops since mixing can reduce their mass and split the lh and rh mass states . this stop dominance need not be the case in the more general mssm where the various squark masses and mixings can be uncorrelated but this situation has not yet been fully examined . \n [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] from ref.@xciteshow typical gluino pair production cross sections in the case of msugra for a range of model parameters . \n note , however , that the typical values one obtains lie in the range @xmath36 fb , comparable to that obtained from the associated squark - gluino production process discussed above \n . however , it is not obvious that somewhat large gluino pair production cross sections could not be obtained for suitable chosen ranges of the general mssm parameters .     as given in ref.@xcite.,width=245 ]    as is well - known@xcite the lhc determination of squark masses will likely not be much better than at the level of @xmath37 gev although relative mass differences will be much better determined . even with the data made available from a @xmath34=500 gev linear collider , given the assumption msugra and making use of the corresponding mass relationships , this only reduces these mass uncertainties to the @xmath38 gev level@xcite . \n the reason for this poor showing is the assumption that the squarks will be too massive to be pair produced at such a low value of @xmath34 ; if squarks are in fact accessible these numbers might improve by up to an order of magnitude . \n one of the things we d like to determine well is the relative mass splitting between the @xmath6 and @xmath39 as soft - susy breaking implies that this should be completely determined by electroweak symmetry breaking effects at tree - level . in fact , one finds @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being the ratio of the two higgs doublet vevs ; an identical tree - level result exists for the splitting for the lh selectron and the sneutrino . \n a probe of our understanding of susy would be to test this relationship as well as possible . \n of course , once loop corrections are included this mass splitting becomes somewhat more complex , as is shown in fig . \n [ fig7 ] as a function of the tev scale soft breaking squark mass parameter , but the generally expected behavior pattern is maintained . \n here we see that ( @xmath42 ) over most of parameter space @xmath6 is less massive than @xmath39 , ( @xmath43 ) this splitting decreases rapidly as the soft squark mass parameter grows and that ( @xmath44 ) , for a given value of this parameter there is a reasonably narrow range of possible mass splitting values . from the tree - level expression we know that this predicted mass splitting primarily reflects the @xmath41 dependence displayed above but also show many other , but weaker , mssm parameter dependencies through the one - loop mass corrections . \n one might imagine that @xmath0 measurements may be able to determine this splitting at the @xmath27 gev level .     and @xmath39 including loop corrections as a function of the weak scale squark mass parameter.,width=415 ] \n squarks and gluinos may be light enough to be produced at an @xmath0 collider operating in the 0.5 - 1 tev energy range in non - msugra susy breaking scenarios . \n the decays of such particles , though always leading to jets , may or may not produce me depending on the nature of the susy spectrum . \n the electroweak properties of the squarks can be determined using polarized beams and production cross section measurements . \n the simultaneous production of essentially degenerate 1st and 2nd generation squarks can be problematic although efficient charm tagging would be helpful . if ( some ) squarks are heavier than gluinos then gluinos may be best studied as squark decay products . if gluinos are heavier than squarks , associated production can lead to an unambiguous , although small , production cross section somewhat below @xmath27 fb . \n gluino pair production is perhaps more interesting as the cross section for this process involves the entire strongly interacting sector of the mssm . \n the rate is expected to be rather small for this process in the case of msugra but has not been well - studied in the more general mssm . \n hopefully the lhc will soon tell us if susy is realized in nature . \n work supported in part by the department of energy , contract de - ac02 - 76sf00515 . \n 99              j.  alwall , m.  p.  le , m.  lisanti and j.  g.  wacker , phys . \n d * 79 * , 015005 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0809.3264 [ hep -

that is , we impose the boundary condition tracer density @xmath6 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath9 . \n both tracer and crowder species diffuse via nearest neighbor hops implemented via the metropolis algorithm . \n the particle hopping rule implemented in this model is analogous to a model of diffusive percolation for `` blind ants '' where particles hop by choosing a site from all neighboring sites@xcite . \n particles may only move into a neighboring site if it is vacant . \n thus if there are no vacancies present , the system arrests and no further diffusion can occur . as tracers emerge from the source and are absorbed in the sink , the number of tracers changes with time while the number of crowders remain constant \n simulations were run for system size @xmath10 for at least @xmath11 monte carlo steps , where each monte carlo step represents one attempted move per lattice site . \n such long simulations are necessary to allow the system to reach steady state , even for such relatively small system sizes . \n we examine the interaction of diffusive transport and microstructural evolution in this model system . \n tracer flux ( @xmath12 ) is calculated by counting the number of particles annihilating at the sink and normalizing per unit length and per unit time . \n tracer diffusivity ( @xmath13 ) is calculated via @xmath14 . in the absence of any crowder particles in the system , \n the net tracer diffusivity is denoted by @xmath15 . \n crowder particles represent a lattice gas and at low temperature they phase separate into clusters which gradually coarsen . \n the presence of tracer diffusion alters this microstructural evolution : crowders drift toward the sink and form clusters which may be compact , elongated in the direction of tracer flow , or flattened against the sink . \n likewise , diffusive transport of tracers is strongly affected by clustering of crowders which represent sticky mobile obstacles .    in the high temperature limit where crowder attractive interactions can be neglected , \n tracer diffusivity as a function of crowder density can be calculated analytically as described below . \n the introduction of attractive interactions for the crowder species completely changes system behavior . even in this highly idealized model \n , the resulting tracer diffusivity can not be described by a simple function of temperature and crowder density but shows several characteristic regimes . \n several previous studies have focused on models of diffusion in which diffusivity is typically reported as a function of crowder density . in our system \n , we apply a gradient in tracer diffusivity which in turn induces a gradient in crowder density . \n the resulting pattern formation process governs the transport of the two species . \n this highly simplified model thus demonstrates a complex mechanism governing gradient - driven transport in multicomponent mixtures . \n temporal evolution of the system is shown in fig .

lived metastable state which is reminiscent of diffusion through fixed obstables@xcite . at low temperature and high crowder density , crowders quickly aggregate to form a maze - like metastable microstructure via spinodal decomposition@xcite , through which tracer particles diffuse . at high enough crowder density , \n the crowder aggregates percolate and block tracer transport entirely . \n diffusivity near the threshold density for crowder percolation shows scaling behavior as discussed below .    at low - intermediate temperature @xmath26 \n we observe an intriguing transient behavior . \n crowder aggregates form , coarsen , drift toward the sink , and flatten there . observed morphologies also include formation of elongated structures parallel to the direction of tracer flow . at high - intermediate temperatures , \n @xmath27 , all crowders drift immediately to the sink and aggregate there , and tracer diffusion is blocked entirely .    at high temperature , @xmath28 , for low crowder density , crowders aggregate to form a layer covering the sink but remain sufficiently disordered to allow non - zero tracer diffusion . at high crowder density , \n tracer diffusion is fully - blocked . \n tracer diffusivity as a function of crowder density and temperature is shown in fig . \n [ fig : diffusivity_vs_crowder_density_and_temperature ] . for crowder density below 0.3 , \n we observe re -

diffusion of either species . to find the steady - state solution , we assume analytic functions of the form @xmath37    applying the boundary condition for crowders , @xmath38 \n , we find @xmath39 . applying the boundary condition , @xmath40 for tracers , we find @xmath41 . \n the steady - state solution for the high temperature limit is thus @xmath42    we confirmed this result by running monte carlo simulations for the case @xmath43 and find good agreement as shown in fig . \n [ fig : density_vs_length ] . \n crowders are depleted in the region near the source and concentrated near the sink . in the high temperature limit , tracer flux , and thus net diffusivity , varies as @xmath44 . \n hence , diffusivity vanishes for @xmath45 , as shown in fig . \n note that this is a different threshold than would be expected for immobile crowders where diffusivity drops to zero when crowder density exceeds the percolation threshold . \n the good agreement of analytic solution and simulation data in the limit of @xmath46 case is somewhat intriguing in the light of simple exclusion processes in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite . \n macroscopic transport principles concerning eq . \n [ eq : diffusion ] , provides an approximate description of two species competing for space@xcite . \n nevertheless , it is reasonable to describe the system evolution in terms of macroscopic transport equation when two species are chemically equivalent in the limit of high temperature .          at low temperature \n , crowders quickly aggregate into clusters that are essentially immobile and do not drift toward the sink on the time scale observed in our simulations . at low crowder density , \n these clusters act as fixed obstacles and allow continuous tracer diffusion . at higher density , crowders aggregate into an extended network that entirely blocks tracer diffusion . near the threshold density \n , we observe scaling behavior . fig . \n [ fig : flux_vs_density_fit ] shows the dependence of tracer flux as a function of ( ( @xmath47 ) on a log - log plot , for @xmath48 . scaling behavior \n is observed for @xmath49 . \n the diffusive flux scales as @xmath50 with @xmath51 . \n interestingly , this value of the exponent is in good agreement with that of the random resistor network model@xcite \n . steady - state diffusion of tracers through a network of immobile obstacles is thus closely related to electric conductivity through a depleted bond network . \n this connection has been previously noted and explained in the literature@xcite .    ) at a temperature corresponding to @xmath48 . \n squares represent simulation data and the solid line is a linear fit to the simulated data with scaling exponent @xmath52.,width=283 ] \n although the model described here is remarkably simple , the interaction of phase separation with gradient - driven diffusion is nevertheless complex . \n the dependence of diffusive tracer flux can be summarized by a single function of crowder density and temperature only in the high temperature limit @xmath30 where no phase separation occurs . \n the resulting diffusivity in the high temperature limit is @xmath53 where @xmath29 is the diffusivity in the absence of any crowders in the system .    in the limit of low temperature near the percolation transition \n , the system shows scaling behavior . \n we find the following dependence of diffusivity on crowder density : @xmath54 where @xmath49 is the critical crowder density above which tracer diffusivity drops to zero . \n when a multi - component solution phase separates in the presence of gradient - driven diffusion , the resulting tracer flux depends on the evolving microstructure and in turn influences microstructural evolution . although the multi - species lattice gas model presented in this work is highly idealized , it demonstrates this key mechanism . \n intracellular transport in complex biological media involves more complex interactions than a lattice gas model can represent . \n microscopic origins of anomalous regimes of diffusive motion may include a variety of transport mechanisms@xcite and resulting complex pattern formation and re - entrant dependence of diffusivity on temperature and crowder density may nevertheless be observed . in a recent study involving diffusive motion of particles in an environment of spherical crowders , \n a non - monotonic dependence of the diffusion rate on the strength of crowder - diffuser attraction was observed@xcite . \n relevant experimental studies also include diffusion in a lipid mixture monolayer at the air - water interface@xcite , such as in a langmuir trough@xcite , where lipid raft formation , may for instance , inhibit gradient - driven diffusion of other molecular species . \n 54ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ) @noop _ _ ,  vol . \n ( ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 3363776944209, "RequestID": "f589625546562c7570844059b5ce4b8d2fc5b313", "TotalTokens": 4104}
{"ContextTokens": 2966, "GeneratedTokens": 103, "SynthesizedBody": "in the recent years physicists have shown increasing interest in examining the statistical properties of real market financial data @xcite and they have contributed to the extraction of the most important characteristics which are referred to as `` stylized facts '' @xcite . \n such stylized facts include fat tailed distribution and short time correlations for the logarithmic returns , volatility clustering , gain - loss asymmetry , etc .    to deepen our understanding of financial markets building models is essential . \n one approach is constructing purely mathematical models ( e.g. , arch and garch processes which are well known to and widely used by economists @xcite ) . \n another way which is more appealing for statistical physicists is that of the so - called multi - agent models . \n these are based on interacting agents using different strategies corresponding to real market behavior . \n the simplest of these models are probably the so - called `` minority games '' ( e.g. , the `` el farol bar '' model @xcite ) . \n such rather abstract models are appropriate to capture main mechanisms but a detailed correspondence to economics is hard to find . \n an example for more complicated models based on both economical and physical approaches is that introduced by lux and marchesi @xcite . in this model \n a relatively large number of parameters enables to incorporate several aspects of real financial processes . \n it is well known that prices on financial markets ( particularly on stock markets ) tend to fluctuate in a broad range . \n it has for long been a major goal of economists to understand the cause of these fluctuations , rises , and drops @xcite . \n experts seem to be puzzled by the fact that sometimes price changes can be easily traced back to well defined external effects like news about political events , announcements of dramatic economic data etc . , while in many cases there is no apparent reason for the major fluctuations .    in statistical physics \n we distinguish between statistical fluctuations and changes due to external perturbations . \n if time reversal symmetry ( or detailed balance ) holds for the system like at thermal equilibrium , the famous fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that spontaneous fluctuations and the response to small perturbations decay in the same way . \n of course , the condition of detailed balance does not hold for financial markets . \n even statitionarity can be questioned and the time reversal symmetry is broken , e.g. , agents want to maximize profit and tend to switch to winning strategies . \n the goal of our study is to compare fluctuations and response to external effects on financial markets . in order to have a clear cut situation we investigate the the lux - marchesi model . \n the ability of the model to reproduce important stylized facts together with the relative robustness of this property when changing the parameters induced us to compare the fluctuations and response ( to fundamental price changes ) within this framework . \n we sincerely hope that our major results hold for real market data as well . \n let us start with summarizing the basic features of the lux - marchesi single asset  multi agent model . \n one of the main assumptions is that there exists a fundamental price @xmath0 of stocks ( the value of the company and its prospective future growth ) around which the real price fluctuates . in this model \n the agents are let to choose among the three following strategies : optimists ( who buy whatever happens ) , pessimists ( who sell ) , and fundamentalist ( who sell if the market price is above the fundamental price and vice versa ) . \n optimists and pessimists together are called chartists according to the usual terminology . \n the number of all agents is @xmath1 , of which the number of fundamentalists is @xmath2 , that of optimists @xmath3 , @xmath4 for pessimists , and @xmath5 for chartists . \n the opinion index : @xmath6 measures to what extent optimistic strategy dominates among the chartists . the aggregate excess demand of the agents for the stocks is computed as following :    @xmath7    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.5 cm    tab . \n 2 : values of the parameters in the four different parameter sets @xcite    during our work we found that in the lux - marchesi model the autocorrelation of volatility shows exponential decay instead of a power - law time dependence in contradiction to the general view on real market data @xcite . \n the power - law decay is usually attributed to some kind of scale - invariance ( regarding time ) in financial markets ( fig . \n [ acf ] ) implying that real markets are in a critical state , which we could not find in the lux - marchesi model even though we tried varying the parameters in a broad range . \n nevertheless , the phenomenon of volatility clustering is described by the model resulting in large characteristic times of the autocorrelation function which show that the model captures important aspects of the market . \n some other problems regarding the thermodynamic limit ( tdl ) of the model were pointed out earlier @xcite . \n we think that these are irrelevant from our point of view since real markets ( and our simulations ) are far from the tdl and the time scale of the mentioned effect is bigger then that of studied fluctuations and response . \n the dynamics of the model implies that there are continuous fluctuations around the fundamental price . \n we examined the decay of these fluctuations using the following simple method : when the price rose to @xmath8 we defined this as a fluctuation and observed the average decay for many runs . \n hence we did not try to determine whether the price really sank after reaching @xmath9 assuming that ( at least at bigger fluctuations ) the probability of further rise is much smaller than that of further decline . \n we observed exponential decay for the price fluctuations using all parameter sets in accordance with the well known fast decay of the correlation function . \n detailed simulations were undertaken for parameter set iv ( fig . \n [ flukt1]a ) . \n furthermore , in case of relatively large fluctuations we observed that the opinion index and the fraction of chartists significantly differed from their average values and exponential decay was observed for both quantities . \n the characteristic time of the decay of the price decreased with the size of fluctuation and was in the order of magnitude of 1 time unit ( up to fluctuations of 4 ) ( fig . \n [ flukt1]b ) . \n the opinion index decayed with approximately the same characteristic time . \n on the other hand the fraction of chartists ( which is closely related to volatility ) decayed much slower with characteristic times in the order of magnitude of 100 time units . \n to @xmath10 price units as a function of time , ( b ) average characteristic time of decay as a function of the size of decay ( data points computed as an average of 7625 to 120529 fluctuations ) ]    an interesting question is what causes fluctuations . in our simulations we tried to find an answer by computing the average opinion index and the average fraction of chartists that caused a fluctuation as the function of the size of the fluctuation . \n we found that small fluctuations are caused merely by the lack of balance inside the chartist community ( fig . \n [ flukt2]a ) while larger fluctuations are likely to occur only if the fraction of chartists to all agents rises as well ( fig . \n [ flukt2]b ) resulting in a higher market volatility @xcite ) . in other words \n the fluctuation in the agents behaviors results in high volatility , i.e. in a nervous market which occasionally leads to major deviations from the fundamental price . \n however , in such cases the attractive force of the fundamental price does not show up abruptly , since the re - stabilization of the equilibrium price has to be accompanied by a gradual restoration of the balance between chartists and fundamentalists . \n it is well known that financial markets are exposed to many external effects from the outside world . \n this means that the changes in prices are only partly due to the inherent market mechanisms ( fluctuations around `` equilibrium '' ) , changes can also be caused by news from the outside world ( e.g. financial reports ; bankruptcy ; death of important personalities ; outbreak of war ; terror attacks , etc . ) . \n the analysis of real market data from the point of view of external news is a highly non - trivial task . on the one hand , it is difficult to set an independent level of `` importance '' of news in our age of information explosion ; furthermore , the effects of different news may overlap . on the other hand , \n the reaction of the market to the news is also hard to tell . \n the situation is much simpler in an artificial market like the lux - marchesi model where we can immediately change the fundamental value of a company or asset ( which would be in reality a consequence of the external event ) . \n in our simulation we changed the fundamental price from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and examined the average of many runs as a function of time that has passed since the event . in the computer program we solved the averaging by raising the fundamental price by @xmath13 for 100 time steps and then decreasing it to the original value , after another 100 time units we raised it again etc . \n this means we used a rectangular function ( @xmath14-like function ) to perturb the system and recorded the average response ( fig . \n [ eses2]a ) . \n what we saw in case of @xmath15 is an abrupt drop in market price ( the speed of which was only limited by the minimum time step of the model ) followed by an overshoot . \n economists and traders have long known that a correction exists after a very fast price change(fig . \n [ eses1 ] ) . \n a sad example for this was the reaction of the european stock markets to the terror attack on new york on the 11th september . \n the prices dropped fast that day ( generally losses over 10 % were recorded ) but the next day there was already an upward moving trend ( a correction after the overreaction of the events ) . \n we used two different parameter sets ( ii and iv ) to check whether the occurrence overshoot or its shape depend on the parameters and saw that it is a rather robust effect . \n a detailed survey of the phenomenon was undertaken using parameter set iv . \n we saw that the speed of the drop in price was only limited by the model ( this means a maximum of 0.05 price drop in 0.01 time steps ) . \n another interesting result is that ( in case of a price drop ) the location of the price minimum in time is independent of the price drop @xmath16 for a wide range of @xmath16 ( for parameter set iv the price minimum is located at approximately @xmath17 time units up to price drops of 10% ) . \n this means that on average one can predict when the minimum of the price occurs ( if one knows the parameters of the market ) irrespective of how big the fundamental price change @xmath16 is . \n let us define the magnitude @xmath18 of the overshoot as the difference of the price minimum and the new equilibrium price ( which equals the fundamental price after the event ) . \n @xmath18 shows linear dependence on the fundamental price change @xmath16 in a wide range of @xmath16-s ( up to a 10% abrupt fundamental price change , which is already huge on market scales ) ( fig . [ \n eses2]b ) . \n when examining the cause of overshoots within the model , the explanation is at hand : during the sudden drop of the price the proportion of pessimists rises sharply within the chartists . on the other hand , \n the fraction of chartists among all dealers does not change . \n this means that the overshoot is caused only by the movements inside the chartist `` community '' . \n when the price first reaches the new equilibrium state , the fraction of pessimists is still very high which implies the further drop of price , resulting in the overshoot . \n furthermore the opinion index decays to zero ( after a sharp drop immediately after the event ) exponentially . \n the main result of the presented simulations is that in the lux - marchesi model of financial markets fluctuations and response to external perturbations ( events ) decay in a significantly different manner . \n spontaneous fluctuations decay with a relatively long characteristic time while the response to external events is practically immediate and followed by an overshoot . \n the absence of the validity of the onsager hypothesis for this model ( and for financial markets in general ) is not at all surprising since the continuous competition for profit ( better payoffs ) works so as to undermine the detailed balance and time reversal symmetry . \n the violation of the time reversal symmetry has further consequences as well , like the assymetry of the time dependant cross correlations between different stocks @xcite . \n the investigation of the opinion index and the fraction of chartists in case of fluctuations and responses showed that the decay mechanisms are indeed different : large spontaneous deviations from the equilibrium price occur in highly volatile markets which are accompanied by an increase of the ratio of chartists ( pessimists and optimists ) as compared to fundamentalists . \n the reaction of the market to an external change of the fundamental price is mainly governed by the shift in the ratio of the optimists and pessimists inside the group of chartists . \n the consequence of the latter is a well defined and rather robust overshoot in the price . \n the characteristic time is short and the size of the overshoot is small indicating that the market tries to adjust to the new situation effectively , however , at the same time , the phenomenon itself shows the limitations of this efficiency . \n we have demonstrated that it is worth and possible to investigate the effect of external perturbations and spontaneous fluctuations separately in a model market . \n it would be most interesting to try to identify the origins of deviations from average behavior on real market data . \n clearly , several difficulties have to be faced when trying to distinguish between the two mentioned mechanisms : the motivation of the agents is hidden , changes are not necessarily such abrupt as in the model , insider information may influence the pattern @xcite , effects of different news overlap , large fluctuations cover the overall behavior , etc . nevertheless , we believe that our study gives a hint how to approach this problem . \n thanks are due to thomas lux for correspondence . \n furthermore we kindly thank lszl kullmann for his advice and jnos trk for his help concerning the computer simulations and other computer related problems . \n support of otka t029985 is also acknowledged .", "StartTimeOffset": 3379488830091, "RequestID": "68d11aa0f3df047896f8ca5cb015f7e8dd12c7a8", "TotalTokens": 3069}

f ) . \n the other indices ( sunspot number , radio flux and the strength of sunspots ) have major contribution from the strong component . \n the weakest correlation is found for the field strength of sunspots which is only influenced by strong fields . \n these findings are in agreement with an earlier study of local modes where inclusion of the weak component of the magnetic field was found to be necessary to explain the frequency shifts during the minimal - activity phase of the solar cycle @xcite . \n although frequency shifts are known to vary in phase with the solar activity , we find an unusual trend during the current minimum . \n solar activity shows an upward trend in the last quarter of 2008 while the shifts continue to decrease for the period considered in this analysis ( for example figure  1d ) this anti - correlation was not seen in the minimum between cycles 22 and 23 . \n @xcite have interpreted the anti - correlation between low - degree frequency shifts from golf , and 10.7 cm radio flux as a signature of the onset of the new solar cycle . \n however , their analysis suggests the onset of cycle 24 at the end of 2007 which is not supported by our analysis of intermediate - degree modes .    since the magnetic activity related to a new solar cycle emerges first at mid - latitudes , it is possible to follow the changes in oscillation modes as a function of the latitude using different values of @xmath8 . for @xmath8=1 , \n the modes are sensitive to the regions near equator while @xmath8=0 represents modes at higher - latitudes . \n figure  2 shows the mean variation in frequency shifts , @xmath9 , at selected values of @xmath8 representing the changes at mid / active - latitudes . as seen earlier , the frequencies are lower during current minimum and continue to decrease with time . \n the lowest value in the left panels coincides with the minimum between cycles 22 and 23 providing a reasonable estimate of the solar minimum . although we do not see an increase in frequencies yet , the shifts for last two data points in figures  2b and 2d are comparable . \n it might be an indication that the activity minimum has been reached in late 2008 , however , the addition of more data sets is crucial to unveil the clear picture of the onset of solar cycle 24 . \n it is worth mentioning that the minimum seen in intermediate - degree mode frequencies will be much later than the late 2007 as reported by @xcite . \n the oscillation frequencies can be further used to infer characteristics of the solar interior . the migrating zonal flow pattern , known as the torsional oscillation , is obtained by inverting the global mode frequencies @xcite . \n the analysis shows that the flow band associated with the new cycle has been found moving more slowly toward the equator than that observed during the previous minimum and suggests the length of solar cycle 23 to be approximately 12 years .    by using local helioseismology techniques \n , we can also study the meridional circulation in the solar interior . \n this extended solar minimum has given us the unprecedented opportunity to study the evolution of subsurface meridional flows without contamination from surface magnetic activity . \n a preliminary analysis of continuous gong data using the ring - diagram technique suggests the formation of meridional flow  bumps \" under the solar surface at high latitudes before the surface activity appears . \n detailed results will be presented in an upcoming paper @xcite . \n the analysis based on the technique of time - distance shows that the travel time of acoustic waves varies during the solar cycle and it decreases due to the presence of active regions . \n it is seen that there are no significant changes at high latitudes , while travel times at low latitudes are decreased by about 2 seconds during the maximum activity phase . \n the travel times during 2006 - 2008 are estimated to be 1 - 2 seconds higher than the previous cycle . \n these estimates also confirms that solar activity is relatively weak during the current minimum . \n this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) project , managed by the national solar observatory , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation . \n the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar observatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrofsico de canarias , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory . \n this study also includes data from the synoptic program at the 150-foot solar tower of the mt . \n wilson observatory , operated by ucla , with funding from nasa , onr and nsf , under agreement with the mt . \n wilson institute . \n this work was supported by nasa grant nng08ei54i . \n tripathy , s. c. , jain , k. , & hill , f. 2009a , in astrophysics and space science series : magnetic coupling between the interior and the atmosphere of the sun , ed . \n hasan and r.j . \n rutten ( springer -

{"ContextTokens": 2918, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "the minority game ( mg ) , introduced by challet and zhang  @xcite as a generalisation of arthur s ` el farol ' problem  @xcite , has gained much popularity as a simple yet realistic model of the workings of financial markets . \n a great variety of work has since been done on the mg  @xcite , leading eventually to an analytic solution  @xcite ; these insights have proven particularly useful in justifying the mg as a realistic model of real market situations  @xcite .    the interactive minority game ( img ) proposes to further this use of the mg in modelling real markets by using the mg to try to gain insight into the behaviour of humans in a simplified market situation . \n individual humans compete against the traditional computer - controlled agents , whose characteristics can be fine - tuned through our understanding of the traditional mg : the human player can be presented with a very inefficient and easy - to - predict market , or with one that is much more complex and difficult .    in creating an interface for the game , our emphasis was on simplicity and ease of use \n : the game should be playable by anyone , from a seasoned mg researcher to someone who comes across the website at random . \n a number of aspects of the interface may therefore seem a little strange to those who have experience of the mg , and so in this paper we explain the mechanical workings - behind - the - scenes that go into the img : firstly , the interface , and secondly , the setup and parameters behind the different choices of game . \n fundamentally , the interactive minority game is a minority game like any other . \n a group of @xmath0 agents must choose between two actions , @xmath1 ( ` buy ' ) or @xmath2 ( ` sell ' ) , with the intention to make the opposite choice to the majority of agents ; agents decisions are based on the knowledge of which was the minority or majority action of the last @xmath3 turns . \n however , in order to make the game a little easier to play , we have had to change the presentation ( though not the underlying game ! ) a little for the sake of the human player . \n the human player not only has the advantage of a greater memory ( denoted by @xmath4 ) than the computer players , but is also given a choice between two different methods of presentation for the information about the game history ; in addition , rather than asking the human player for an action ( ` buy ' or ` sell ' ) , we ask them for a prediction on the direction the market is going to take , which corresponds to an action in the underlying game . in this section we explain ( and , we hope , justify ) in detail all these aspects of the interface . \n imagine being confronted by the string of 1 s and 0 s that is given to the regular agents ! \n it is not a particularly pleasant thought , and the human player will clearly demand more . \n we have provided two different solutions to the problem . before we continue , let us recall a few aspects of the mg . at each time \n step @xmath5 , each agent @xmath6 takes an an action @xmath7 , which allows us to define the @xmath8 action @xmath9 :    @xmath10    this allows us to define the first , simpler view of the game history : the _ binary viewpoint _ , a set of spins corresponding to @xmath11 in the the last @xmath4 turns of the game . \n this is of course identical in information content to the aforementioned string of 1 s and 0 s , but looks nicer ! \n the more interesting viewpoint follows from an idea suggested by johnson _ et . \n @xcite of a price level , @xmath12 , in the mg , defined by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the market liquidity . \n we have used this in our _ chart viewpoint _ , literally a price - chart recording the past values of @xmath12 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .    the price - chart view of the game . \n the price changes proportionally to the global action @xmath9 of agents ( eq .  [ eq:2 ] ) ; the player must predict whether the market will rise or fall . \n note that the last action is highlighted for the player . ]    clearly , the binary viewpoint is more suited to games where the player s gain is also binary , i.e.  where @xmath15 , and the price - chart view is more suited to games with a linear payoff , @xmath16 . \n this is the practise we have followed in our ready - made games . \n however , the option to create a custom game allows the user to ignore our advice if s / he feels like it ! \n the reader may have noticed that , rather than being asked to make a choice ( ` buy ' or ` sell ' , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ,  ) , the human player is asked to ` _ _ predict which way you think the market is going to go _ _ ' . \n that is , the user is asked to _ predict the majority action _ , and their own action ( the opposite ) is inferred from this  we ask the human player for a prediction @xmath17 and an amount bet on this prediction , @xmath18 ( their _ weight _ or _ market impact _ ) , and their action is then taken to be @xmath19 . \n we apologise if this is perhaps a little confusing for those familiar with the mg ! our concern , as we noted in the introduction , was to make the game simpler for those who have never encountered the mg before . ` what way do you think the market will go ? ' seemed to us a simpler question than , say , ` would you like to buy or sell ( do the opposite of what you think everyone else will do ) ? ' in addition , those unused to the mg might reasonably ask , like andersen and sornette in a recent paper  @xcite , questions such as , ` why does buying hurt me if the market keeps rising ? ' we would rather avoid such problems !    in summary : although it is a little hidden from view , the player still has to try and perform the minority action . \n ;-)      the game interface consists of a series of php files that interact with an underlying c program ; the latter calculates the actions of all the computer - controlled agents , and calculates all the relevant and interesting quantities ( such as predictability ) . \n we hope that the reader will forgive us if we are coy about revealing any more ( in particular , about revealing source code ) ; we are willing to reveal the workings - behind - the - scenes but there are a few rabbits - up - our - sleeve that we would like to keep from players for now , so as to make the game more interesting ! \n the interactive minority game offers a number of possibilities for the human player to pick from . as well as a variety of ` standard ' , ready - made games \n , there is the option to create a custom game by choosing from various parameters . for those well - versed in mg lore \n , this could no doubt do with some extra explanation . \n parameters particular to the human player are denoted by a subscript asterisk ( @xmath20 ) .      to begin with , \n let us summarise the basic parameters of the mg : we have a homogeneous population of @xmath0 agents with memory @xmath3 , each with @xmath21 strategies . \n this gives us @xmath22 as the size of the space of histories given to agents , and we can then define the control parameter @xmath23 . it is this parameter @xmath24 which determines the type of market : a low value creates an extremely inefficient market , easily predictable by the smart human , while a high value of @xmath24 creates a market whose behaviour is close to randomness . \n the most efficient market ( and therefore most difficult to play ) , i.e.  the market with the minimal value of standard deviation @xmath25 , lies somewhere in the middle at the critical point @xmath26  @xcite . for the purposes of our games ( custom or standard ) , \n we have chosen to make @xmath3 and @xmath24 variables , with other parameters being calculated from these two . \n as we have already noted , the human player enjoys the benefit of a larger memory , @xmath27 , than the computer - controlled agents ; we have chosen to set @xmath28 for the binary view and @xmath29 for the price - chart view . \n we have also added a parameter particular to the img for the human player : the player s _ weight _ or _ \n market impact_. recall from \n [ sec : predict ] that at each time @xmath5 the player is asked for a prediction @xmath30 on the direction the market will take , and the amount they bet on this , @xmath31 . \n their action is then taken to be , @xmath32    put simply , this amounts to the human player taking an action @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 ; i.e. , the player chooses to have a market impact equivalent to that of @xmath35 normal agents . \n the player s gain per turn is then also proportional to @xmath35 . \n depending on the market phase , this can be an advantage or a disadvantage : it brings the potential of a greater reward if the player can correctly predict the market , but with the potential of a far greater loss if s / he can not . \n we have also used the concept of _ minimum weight _ , @xmath36 , where we require that @xmath37 . \n we can force the human player to act on a larger scale than the typical agent \n equivalent , perhaps , to the actions of a large investment bank rather than an individual trader . \n the other new parameter introduced , for custom games , is the length of the _ introductory period _ , @xmath38 . \n this is the length of time that the computer - controlled agents play by themselves before the human player joins the game . \n a long value allows the agents to adapt to the statistically stationary state of the game , while if @xmath38 is low , the players start off `` stupid '' , not knowing which of their strategies is better . in the more difficult games ( efficient markets ) , a such a low value is essential as a high value of @xmath38 makes it completely impossible for a human to compete ! \n the img allows the player both to pick from a variety of ` standard ' , ready - made games and to create their own custom game . \n the total choices available to the player are as follows : their _ minimum weight _ \n , @xmath36 ; the _ market phase _ , determined by @xmath24 ; the _ agent memory _ , @xmath3 ; the display mode ( see  [ sec:2 - 1 ] ) ; the payoff ( binary or linear ) ; and , in the custom game , the length of the introductory period , @xmath38 . \n the * custom game * allows the choice of a full range of parameters , including some that are not used in our standard games . \n minimum weight can be small ( @xmath39 ) , medium ( @xmath40 ) or large ( @xmath41 ) absolute values ; the market phase varies from extremely crowded ( @xmath42 ) to crowded ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , the critical point ( @xmath45 ) and anticrowded ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) . \n @xmath3 can be 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 or 8 ; the introductory period can be the full period ( @xmath48 ) , or it can be short ( 200 ) or very short ( 5 ) . \n the * standard games * were set up to create a variety of different market experiences for the human player . \n _ beginners _ is exactly that : a nice and easy game , with @xmath49 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 . \n this is designed simply as a friendly introduction to the img and should not be taken too seriously !    the _ newbie traders _ game is a little trickier , with with @xmath39 and @xmath50 as before , but now with @xmath51 . \n _ day traders _ is again trickier , with @xmath52 , @xmath42 and @xmath39 , while _ chartists _ ups the ante still further with @xmath51 . \n _ wall street gurus _ throws the player into a difficult market at the critical point , with @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath39 . \n _ mission impossible _ is literally that  the player must struggle with a large @xmath40 and an anticrowded market ( @xmath55 ) full of very intelligent agents ( @xmath56 ) . \n all standard games use the price - chart view with a linear payoff . \n while clearly the fundamental aim of the img ( apart from being a fun distraction for the econophysics community ! )  is to investigate the behaviour of humans in market situations , we should perhaps specify a bit more precisely what we are looking for . here \n are a few of the questions we have in mind :    * what sort of performance do we see from humans in different types of market ( crowded , anticrowded , critical  ) ? * how do humans make their decisions ? \n do they stick to one strategy or vary their behaviour often ? * how much information do human players give to the market ? * \n do they take into account their market impact ?    in conclusion \n , we hope that the img , while a very simple and easy game , might provide a fascinating window into what is actually going on inside the heads of real , human , economic agents  surely one of the ultimate econophysical goals !

{"ContextTokens": 3245, "GeneratedTokens": 109, "SynthesizedBody": "the electron crystal has created considerable interest since its possible existence was first pointed out by wigner  @xcite . \n the three - dimensional wigner crystal and its two - dimensional counterpart have been extensively studied , and there exist beautiful experimental realizations of the latter using electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium  @xcite . \n more recently , wigner crystallization in one dimension has received renewed interest  @xcite ; for recent reviews see refs .   and . \n the realization of a one - dimensional system requires the dominance of the confining potential over internal energies , in particular , the inter - particle interactions . upon increasing density ( and , thus , \n the interaction energy ) , or weakening the confining potential , the crystal deviates from its strictly one - dimensional structure . \n it has been shown that at a critical density , a transition to a zigzag crystal takes place  @xcite . though not for electrons , this zigzag transition has indeed been observed using @xmath0mg@xmath1 ions in a quadrupole storage ring  @xcite .    here \n we investigate the structural properties of the classical quasi - one - dimensional wigner crystal beyond the zigzag regime . while previous investigations  @xcite concentrated on regular structures , we are interested in the formation of defects . from symmetry considerations \n the assumption of regular crystals is plausible at low densities when the number of rows is small , however , its validity is not at all obvious once the lateral extent of the crystal increases at higher densities . \n in fact , one expects a nonuniform charge density in the direction transverse to the wire axis . \n in particular , considering the electrostatics problem of charges confined by a parabolic potential , @xmath2 , the density profile should obey @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the width of the system  @xcite . \n therefore , the assumption of perfect rows with equal linear densities should eventually break down . \n the formation of defects is of particular interest because they will have a direct impact on the transport properties of the system : while regular rows are locked , defects are expected to be mobile . \n we consider classical particles in two dimensions interacting via long - range coulomb interaction . \n the system is assumed to be infinite in the @xmath5-direction and confined in the transverse @xmath6-direction by a parabolic confining potential @xmath7 . \n the energy of the system then reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the material and @xmath10 is the frequency of harmonic oscillations in the confining potential .    at low densities , \n the system is one - dimensional , and the particles minimize their mutual coulomb repulsion by occupying equidistant positions along the wire , forming a structure with short - range crystalline order  the so - called one - dimensional wigner crystal  @xcite . upon increasing the density , the inter - electron distance diminishes , and the resulting stronger electron repulsion eventually overcomes the confining potential @xmath7 , transforming the classical one - dimensional wigner crystal into a staggered ( zigzag ) chain . from the comparison of the coulomb interaction energy @xmath11 with the confining potential an important characteristic length scale emerges . \n indeed , the transition from the one - dimensional wigner crystal to the zigzag chain is expected to take place when distances between electrons are of the order of the scale @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . within our model , _ \n i.e. _ , for a parabolic confining potential and coulomb interactions , the characteristic length scale @xmath12 is given as @xmath14 it is convenient for the following discussion to measure lengths in units of @xmath12 . to that purpose \n we introduce a dimensionless density @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the linear density of the system . \n rescaling lengths , the energy can be written as @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 . \n as a first step , we minimize the energy assuming regular rows , aiming to find approximate values for the density range in which a configuration with a given number of rows is stable . assuming staggering in the @xmath5-direction between neighboring rows and inversion symmetry of the @xmath6-positions of the rows with respect to the wire axis , the number of minimization parameters is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for even ( odd ) number of rows @xmath21 , and the minimization is straightforward . within these constraints , \n the minimization of the energy with respect to the electron configuration reveals  @xcite that a one - dimensional crystal is stable for densities @xmath22 , whereas a zigzag chain forms at intermediate densities @xmath23 . \n more rows appear as the density further increases . \n the number of rows as a function of @xmath24 is shown in table [ table_1 ] . \n .[table_1]number of rows in the crystal as a function of the dimensionless density @xmath24 , assuming regular structures . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n eventually , one expects that more complicated structures will appear . \n the simple configuration we studied is in competition with structures where defects appear away from the edges , such as structures of the type @xmath25 $ ] , for example . \n detailed calculations within these simplified models reveal that such structures are indeed competitors for the ground state , but up to 13 rows such a minimum is not realized . \n to approach the transition between regular and defected rows , we use a different trick . an unbiased search for the global minimum \n is numerically costly because a simple minimization may get stuck in a metastable minimum . \n however , if the initial guess of the electron configuration is sufficiently close to the global minimum , a simple minimization will converge . \n having identified the structure of defects in region i , one may feed such structures into a simple minimization at lower densities . \n the results of such a procedure have been included in figs . \n [ fig - nu_def ] and [ fig - y ] . \n there , structures with defect densities down to @xmath26 were obtained with the full minimization , whereas structures close to the phase boundary with lower defect structures were obtained with the method described here . \n the results suggest that the defect density indeed vanishes at the transition which points to a second order phase transition . \n we study quasi - one - dimensional systems of classical particles interacting via long - range coulomb interactions and confined by a parabolic potential in the transverse direction . \n the ground state configurations are multi - row wigner crystals where the number of rows is controlled by the density ( or the strength of the confining potential ) . \n we find that defects that accommodate the density variation in the transverse direction appear once the number of rows exceeds four .    defected structures have less particles in the outer than in the inner rows . \n the full numerical minimization for five rows reveals that two distinct types of defected phases exist . upon increasing density , \n the regular structure at low - densities is replaced by a structure with symmetric defects , _ \n i.e. _ , where the center of the defect on the two outer rows is located at the same @xmath5-position . as the number of particles that can be simulated sets a lower limit on the defect density that can obtained , the full minimization allows one only to provide an upper limit for the density at the transition from regular to defected structures . \n we extend our calculations to lower densities by using structures with the type of defect described above as the input for a simple minimization . \n the results indicate that the defect density vanishes at @xmath27 and that the transition is of second order . to obtain symmetric defects , \n the longitudinal distortion of the inner rows , namely an increased density at the center of the defect , is crucial . any analytical description of the transition would have to take into account this distortion .    upon further increasing density \n , the defect density rapidly increases . at a critical density , @xmath28 , structures with a different type of defect corresponding to a sinusoidal distortion of the rows with a phase shift of half a period between the two outer rows \n become become the ground state . \n this second regime is characterized by a defect density that barely varies with density and extends up to the transition to six rows . \n the transition between the two defected phases with different symmetries is first order . \n simplified models neglecting the corrugation of the rows only capture this second defected phase . \n thus , these models do not allow one to further investigate the nature of the phase transition from regular to defected structures . \n however , as this second phase occupies most of the density interval , they may be used to study the stability of regular structures upon increasing the number of rows . \n we find that beyond nine rows , no stable regular structures exist . \n taking into account that the simplified model overestimates the energy of defected structures , we expect that stable regular structures may disappear even earlier . \n we would like to acknowledge stimulating discussions with k.  a. matveev , yu . \n v.  nazarov , and a.  melikyan . \n part of the calculations were performed at the ohio supercomputer center thanks to a grant of computing time . \n this work was supported by the u.s . \n department of energy , office of science , under contract no . \n de -

probes of stellar populations in galaxies , and have been detected in all types of galaxies as well as in the intracluster space . \n stars in this mass range constitute a major component ( by mass ) of the stellar material in the universe , thus a correct understanding of their evolution in different environments has the potential to advance many astrophysical fields . \n furthermore , these stars play a fundamental role in cosmic recycling , being major contributors to the carbon and nitrogen abundances for the next generation of stars . \n stars in this mass range go through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , and through their evolution they enrich the interstellar medium with helium , carbon , nitrogen , and other elements . typically the abundances of oxygen , argon , and neon are unaffected during agb evolution in most stars , thus these elements can be used to probe the environment at the time of progenitor formation . \n the agb phase is characterized by the periodicity of nuclear burning phases and dredge - up phases , and , as a result , the products of stellar evolution are carried to the stellar outer layers . \n planetary nebulae ( pn ) are the stellar envelopes of agb stars , ejected at the tip of the agb , carrying the products of stellar evolution to the interstellar medium . \n thus by analyzing pn abundances one can constraint the agb evolutionary models , and the environment at the time of the formation of the agb progenitors . since the models of stellar evolution predict that the chemical yields form agb stars depend on initial stellar mass and metallicity , large samples of pn and in different metallicity environments should be compared with evolutionary models to obtain the best constraints . \n since pn are ubiquitous and bright , and easily recognizable due to their unique spectra , they are ideally suited to probe agb evolution and populations in nearby galaxies . in this paper \n we present the state of the art of planetary nebulae abundance analysis in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , in particular the impact of model constraining through carbon abundance , as derived from ultraviolet spectroscopy . \n we review large and homogeneous data sets that we used for our analysis , both for the galaxy ( @xmath32 ) and the magellanic clouds ( @xmath33 ) . \n we also present the comparison with the corresponding stellar evolution models . \n a look at the galactic disk population and the gradients of elements in the galactic disk is shown in @xmath34 . \n in @xmath35 we give a summary of the results , and describe the future challenges of this field .     for z=0.0126 , 0.0159 , 0.02 , 0.0252 , and 0.00317 respectively from right to left . ] \n abundances of planetary nebulae in the milky way disk and bulge have been derived by many authors . \n here we focus on large , homogeneous data sets that have been published recently ( [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . and [ 4 ] ) . \n individual abundances calculated by these authors may be different by as much as 20 @xmath4 , but the differences can be ascribed , for the most part , to different ionization correction factors ( icf ) . \n averages of elemental abundances are also very different across these papers , for the reason that some authors include bulge pn in the galactic averages , while others [ 4 ] distinguish the bulge contaminants from the disk pn analyzed . \n for example , the average oxygen abundance for the whole samples presented in papers [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , and [ 4 ] are respectively 5.6@xmath510@xmath6 , 4.3@xmath510@xmath6 , and 3.5@xmath510@xmath6 ( in terms of o / h , by number ) . if we chose to compare only the common pn the averages converge respectively to 3.7@xmath510@xmath6 , 3.9@xmath510@xmath6 , and 3.5@xmath510@xmath6 , with ranges of the order of @xmath7 . \n the bulge pn have been statistically analyzed by exter and collaborators [ 5 ] . in the following analysis we privilege the sample of papers [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] , respectively for the galactic disk and bulge , using the data of paper [ 4 ] for the disk since it excludes explicitly the bulge population , and it is homogeneously chosen from the iac morphological catalog of pn [ 6 ] . for carbon abundances in galactic pn \n we use selected data from [ 2 ] , and references therein .    ) . \n open circles : non type i pn ; filled circles : type i pn ; stars indicate models [ 8 ] with m@xmath8m@xmath1 ; large stars with m@xmath9m@xmath1 . ]    in table 1 , columns 3 and 4 , we give the average abundances of key elements , in terms of the hydrogen abundance , for the galactic bulge and the disk pn . \n in parenthesis we give the range of the selected diagnostic . \n we define as type i pn those nebulae whose n / o has been enriched with respect to the orion nebula . \n determination of carbon abundances for bulge pn are sparse , thus we do not report their average . \n the data show that the oxygen abundance is higher in bulge than in disk pne , with an offset of about 0.1 dex , while the difference in helium abundance is much lower . \n nitrogen is also more abundant on average in the bulge , making the n / o ratio almost identical in the two environments .    in figure 1 \n we show the n / o versus o / h relation for all the galactic disk pn analyzed in [ 4 ] . \n this plot is a good diagnostics to check weather the nitrogen in agb stars is produced by on cycle . in this case \n , oxygen would be destroyed to produce nitrogen , and a strong anti - correlation should be detected between these two ratios . \n the plot shows a large spread of oxygen abundances , as expected in the galactic disk , and the models by [ 7 ] for m@xmath10 m@xmath1 lead the eye to show that oxygen depletion occurs as nitrogen is produced , especially in type i pn .    in figure 2 \n we show the diagnostic evolutionary plot of n / o versus he / h again for galactic disk pn , showing very clearly that the type i pn correspond to the locus of the high mass models ( m@xmath11 m@xmath1 in marigo s [ 8 ] models ) . \n the c / o versus n / o diagram for galactic disk pn would be sparsely populated . \n carbon abundances derive from uv lines of iue spectra , and more recent carbon determination for disk pn are unavailable . \n abundances of the most common elements except carbon have been acquired over the past by several authors ( [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] ) . on the other hand , \n only a handful of carbon abundance determinations were available [ 13 ] until recently . \n together with my collaborators we started a series of _ hst _ observations aimed at expand the dataset of carbon abundances in lmc and smc pn . \n for the lmc , among about 350 pn known [ 14 ] only 20 iue spectra are available , with only 10 sound carbon abundance determinations [ 13 ] . \n we increased this sample by observing 24 lmc pn with stis [ 15 ] . \n the smc is also poorly sampled , with only 12 iue spectra for 60 smc pn known [ 16 ] . \n we have obtained 12 acs prism spectra and were able to determine the carbon lines . \n our work on smc pn carbon determination is in preparation . \n the stis uv spectra of lmc pn show that the volume where the carbon emission originates is the same that the volume where the hydrogen recombination lines and the oxygen forbidden lines originate as well [ 15 ] , and the morphology of the nebulae is the same through the uv and the optical lines . \n the references above were used to obtain the averages of the elemental abundances of magellanic cloud pn in table 1 , columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . \n the carbon abundances for the lmc includes the samples published in [ 13 ] and [ 15 ] , while the smc carbon average only includes the smc pn in [ 13 ] . \n llllll & & bulge & disk & lmc & smc + he / h & whole sample & 0.11 ( 0.03 ) & 0.12 ( 0.04 ) & 0.10 ( 0.03 ) & 0.09 ( 0.02 ) + & type i & 0.12 & 0.15 & 0.11 & 0.09 + & non type i & 0.11 & 0.11 &

abundance is , on average , decreasing from the galaxy to the lmc and the smc , as expected . \n we continue seeing the oxygen to be depleted in type i pn , as possible consequence of the on cycle activity . \n we also notice low helium abundances in lmc and , to a larger extent , smc pn . finally , carbon production is less efficient , on average , in the magellanic cloud pn with respect to the galaxy . \n we should note that preliminary analysis of our acs prism spectra seem to indicate that carbon production in smc pn is similar , and not larger , than that of lmc pn .    in the two upper panels of figure 3 we show the n / o versus o / h plot for magellanic cloud pn . \n it is remarkable how the oxygen gets depleted in nitrogen rich type i smc pn , while the effect is much milder in the lmc pn . \n it looks like whatever the mechanism at work , possibly the on cycle , it is much more efficient at low metallicities than predicted by marigo s models [ 8 ] .    by examining the carbon and nitrogen production in lmc and smc pn ( \n lower panels of figure 3 ) we note that in both galaxies the effect of carbon depletion in favor of nitrogen enrichment is noticeable . \n the models by [ 8 ] for the lmc and the smc pn are also shown in the figure . \n we note that the low mass models well encompass the non type i pn locus , while for higher masses the models are not adequate . \n some other mechanisms must be at work that deplete the nitrogen ( or better the n / o ratio ) in type i pn . \n ( lmc ) or 3.0 m@xmath1(smc ) models from [ 8 ] ; large stars represents models with @xmath14 ( lmc ) or 3.0 m@xmath1(smc ) . ] \n another very important aspect of abundance analysis in planetary nebulae is the study of the elements that are not affected ( or mildly affected ) by stellar evolution . \n recent models ( e.g. , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] ) predict that at galactic metallicities oxygen , neon , and argon should not vary considerably during the evolution of these stars through the agb , at least in the lower mass range . \n these elements are thus probes of the galactic chemical evolution , and of the environment at the epoch of progenitor formation . \n we use here the sample of abundances derived in [ 4 ] to explore the relations between these elements , and to determine galactic gradients and their evolution though time . \n we used the oxygen and the neon abundances of pn to determine the metalicity gradients in the galactic disk . for this study \n it is essential to exclude bulge pn from the samples , since bulge pn may tip the gradients given their average higher metallicity , as seen in table 1 . \n the gradients from the sample of [ 4 ] are shown in figure 4 . \n we derived gradients of the order of -0.01 dex kpc@xmath15 for oxygen and neon . \n these gradients agree with other recent independent determinations of galactic gradients from pn [ 17 ] , as long as the pn sample adopted did not include bulge contaminants . \n given that the pn gradients are rather flat , and that pn represent the progeny of evolved stars , this picture does not reconcile with flattening of galactic metallicity gradients with time .    since \n models of agb evolution show that nitrogen is enriched especially in high mass agb stars via on cycle , we can use the nitrogen abundance to select a more massive sample of pn , and to show the differences in gradients trough the galactic disk . \n we found no noticeable differences between gradients of type i and non type i pn , indicating an overall invariance of gradients with time . \n stellar evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars is well probed by studying agb stars and their remnants . in this paper \n we have shown how diagnostic abundance plots of pn can be used to constraint stellar evolution through the agb . \n carbon abundances offer a further challenge , since the carbon emission lines correspond to the uv part of the spectra . the magellanic cloud pn allow the comparison with stellar evolution models at lower metallicities . \n we have shown that the bulge oxygen and nitrogen abundances are higher , on average , than those of the galactic disk , suggesting the existence of two distinct stellar populations . \n we have also shown that the galactic disk population presents a very large spread in environment metallicity ( or metallicity at the formation of the progenitors ) , and that galactic disk pn have an effective on cycle , especially at low metallicity . this result \n is somehow strengthened by the analysis of lmc and smc pn , where the destruction of oxygen in favor of nitrogen appears clear for smc pn of type i. the n / o versus c / o ( and versus he / h ) diagnostic plots indicate that the type i pn are the remnant of the evolution of more massive agb stars . for the magellanic cloud pn \n the diagrams are sparsely populated , and new data of carbon abundances are essential for model constraining at low metallicity . \n galactic gradients of oxygen and neon have been found to be shallow , in agreement with other recent and independent pn gradient studies . \n the major future challenge in the field of agb and post - agb evolution is twofold : on the theoretical side , models should take into account the fraction of agb stars that are within a binary system , and account for yields of binary evolution ; on the observational side , the acquisition of larger , homogeneous sets of uv spectra to determine carbon and neon abundances in galactic and local group pn would be essential for progress in this field . \n the study of gradients could be extended also to other local group galaxies . finally , \n pn have been observed also outside galaxies , in the intracluster medium . a better characterization of these extragalactic sources would be essential to constraint the mass of dark halos in galaxies [ 18 ] , and to determine whether the evolution of these peculiar pn is different [ 19 ] from that of

gluon scattering at the level of 80 % once @xmath45 . the results in fig . \n [ fig:4 ] also prove that subprocesses other than those initiated by the @xmath38 and @xmath46 initial channels are of negligible import . \n we will now turn to a previously unpublished study of the sensitivity of collider and fixed target experiments to the gluon density in the proton . \n the full uncertainty in the gluon density is not known . here \n we estimate this uncertainty from the variation of different recent parametrizations . \n we choose the latest global fit by the cteq collaboration ( 5 m ) as our point of reference @xcite and compare it to their preceding analysis ( 4 m @xcite ) and to a fit with a higher gluon density ( 5hj ) intended to describe the cdf ( and d0 ) jet data at large transverse momentum . \n we also compare to global fits by mrst @xcite , who provide three different sets with a central , higher , and lower gluon density , and to grv98 @xcite . for this study \n we update the tevatron center - of - mass energy to run ii conditions ( @xmath47 tev ) which increases the invariant cross section for the production of lepton pairs with mass 5 gev @xmath48 6 gev by 5 % at low @xmath49 gev and 20 % at high @xmath50 gev .    in fig . \n [ fig:5 ] we plot the cross section for lepton pairs between the    ( 7.6,10.5 )    @xmath28 and @xmath29 resonances at run ii of the tevatron which should be measurable up to at least @xmath33 gev ( @xmath51 ) . for the cteq parametrizations \n we find that the cross section increases from 4 m to 5 m by 2.5 % ( @xmath52 gev ) to 5 % ( @xmath53 gev ) and from 5 m to 5hj by 1 % in the whole @xmath1-range . \n the largest differences to cteq5 m are obtained with grv98 at low @xmath1 ( minus 10 % ) and with mrst(g@xmath54 ) at large @xmath1 ( minus 7% ) .    a similar analysis for conditions as in fermilab s e772 experiment is shown in fig . \n [ fig:6 ] . \n ( 7.6,10.5 )    in fixed target experiments one probes substantially larger regions of @xmath55 than in collider experiments . \n therefore one expects a much larger sensitivity to the gluon distribution in the proton . \n indeed we find that cteq5hj increases the cross section by 7 % ( 26 % ) w.r.t . \n cteq5 m at @xmath56 gev ( @xmath57 gev ) and even by 134 % at @xmath53 gev . for mrst(g@xmath58 ) \n the cteq5 m cross section drops by 17 % , 40 % , and 59 % at these three values of @xmath1 . \n in summary , we have demonstrated that the production of drell - yan pairs with low mass and large transverse momentum is dominated by gluon initiated subprocesses . in contrast to prompt photon production , uncertainties coming from fragmentation , isolation , and intrinsic transverse momentum are absent . \n the hadroproduction of low mass lepton pairs is therefore an advantageous source of information on the gluon density in the proton at large @xmath5 in collider experiments and even more in fixed target experiments . \n massive lepton pair production data could provide new insights into the parametrization and size of the gluon density . \n it is a pleasure to thank l.e . \n gordon for his collaboration . \n mcgaughey _ et al . _ \n [ e772 collaboration ] , phys . rev . * \n d50 * ( 1994 ) 3038 . \n the normalization of the published data seems incorrect . \n we have multiplied the published cross sections by a factor 3.7 , consistent with information provided to us by j.  moss ( private communication ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3425165759014, "RequestID": "02b4e28767313a3b4f11f09724a2b838e5b5b6dd", "TotalTokens": 2862}

of - the - art spam filtering techniques are based on content analysis ( e.g. spamassassin  @xcite ) , host reputation ( spamcop  @xcite , spamhaus  @xcite ) or authentication services ( spf  @xcite , dkim  @xcite ) . yet , with the increased use of attachment spam , success rate of content filtering decreases while its cost increases . at the same time , despite the initial reported success of blacklists , it has been shown recently that their effectiveness is challenged by a new generation of low profile , short - lived , and highly dynamic botnets used to send spam  @xcite .    consequently , new methods are needed to keep up with the spam arms race . \n one promising new approach to counteract this development is to focus on network - level characteristics of spammers . \n first , the network footprint of spamming activity can not be adapted as easily as the content of an email . \n second , the rapid increase of spam traffic poses significant processing , storage , and scalability challenges for end - host systems , creating a need to at least perform some fast `` pre - filtering '' on the network level . \n although the email content is not available in flow data , it can be used to profile potential spammers according to activities on other protocols and services offered . \n the network behavior of a legitimate email server is likely to be very different from a user pc acting as a botnet drone and sending spam .    to this end \n , a number of efforts have turned their attention towards network - level characteristics of spammers . \n for example , in an interesting recent study ramachandran et al . \n @xcite have studied spam with respect to ip address and as space and have demonstrated that clustering techniques can be applied to detect target domain patterns that are similar to those of spammers  @xcite . link analysis in mta graphs has been applied by  @xcite to identify potentially malicious nodes . \n gomes et al . \n @xcite showed that analysis of both static and evolving graph models allows to discriminate between socially unrelated spammer - receiver connections and socially related legitimate email traffic . \n finally , an extensive characterization of spam traffic was given by gomes et al . \n the authors highlighted differences between spam and legitimate emails with respect to a variety of aspects ( not necessarily network - related ) , such as workload , temporal patterns , or sender and receiver distributions . \n the majority of these works base their findings on mail server logs ( e.g.  @xcite ) while a smaller minority on network flow data  @xcite . \n log analysis provides detailed information about the local smtp traffic _ and the local spam filtering knowledge _ \n ( i.e. which connections got accepted or rejected , along with the reasons thereupon ) that goes far beyond simple reputation mechanisms , but is missing network - wide traffic statistics . \n collecting server logs from many email servers can somewhat improve the situation . yet , gathering logs from a large number of administration domains is a tedious process also involving privacy issues . on the other hand , \n flow data contains information for a much larger number of hosts , collected passively in the core of the network . \n furthermore , flow traces are not limited to smtp traffic and could allow one to correlate the behavior between different protocols or services . yet , flow traces do not contain details about the content of smtp sessions as they are restricted to packet header information . \n most importantly , they do not right - away reveal the `` identity '' of a given connection with respect to the endpoints intentions ( legitimate , spam , scanning , etc . ) . \n we find that an `` either / or '' approach fails to combine the advantages of both methods , and suggest a different direction . \n our proposal is to try to exploit and combine the valuable ( and _ non - overlapping _ ) knowledge of local mail servers , on a network - wide scale , _ without actually collecting or looking at the individual server logs_.    as a first step towards this goal , this paper presents two main contributions . \n _ first _ , we show that email server s pre - filtering decisions can be accurately inferred directly from flow traces and therefore collected at the network core as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : ispview ] . in particular , the distributions of smtp flow properties , such as byte or packet count , reliably indicate which smtp sessions were closed by the server before accepting contents . based on this , mta hosts can be classified as good or bad ( sending spam ) relying solely on packet header information . \n our approach is validated using server logs and public black- and white - lists . in other words , _ spammer identities and the countermeasures deployed by mail servers become visible in flow traces_.    to demonstrate the utility of these preliminary results , our _ second _ contribution in this paper is to discuss a number of potential applications that could benefit from our approach , including anti - spam technique validation , global spam monitoring , server monitoring , and novel network - level spam countermeasures . in short , we believe that the rich information offered by flow traces will be crucial in the fight against current and next - generation spammers . \n the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in the next section , \n we describe our methodology and datasets used in this study . section  [ sec : results ] we present our results with respect to the flow characteristics of accepted and rejected connections on single - server , and network - wide scales . \n section  [ sec : discussion ] describes a number of potential applications , as well as some limitations of our approach . \n finally , we conclude this work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n in this section , we briefly describe our methodology and the datasets used for our study . \n as stated earlier , our goal is to combine the local knowledge available at individual email servers , on a network - wide level . to this end , we need first a model of the network - level behavior of an email server .    consider the email reception process depicted in fig . \n [ fig : filteringphases ] . \n the first phase is the tcp three - way handshake initialized by the client . in the second phase , \n the email envelope is sent , according to the smtp protocol  @xcite . at this stage \n , the server may apply certain pre - filtering rules to early close smtp sessions from suspected spammers and in turn save valuable network , cpu and storage resources . \n if the server decides to go on , the email content is then transmitted in the third and last phase .    here \n , we are interested in the pre - filtering phase . during this phase , \n the server combines local and global knowledge to decide whether a new connection is a spam attempt . \n local knowledge , for example , helps to decide whether the receiver address actually belongs to the server s domain ( open relay attempt ) or targets an existing user . \n furthermore , greylisting could be used as a local reputation - based service . \n global knowledge refers to the various open and commercial services , known as `` blacklists '' , listing whether a sender has been known to send unsolicited content in the past . only if the client does not `` clear '' \n the pre - filtering phase the smtp session is closed by the server .    we analyzed the logs of a university email server and show the top reject reasons in table  [ tab : reject ] . as much as 78.3% of the smtp sessions were rejected in the pre - filtering phase . \n rejects based on local information ( including many reasons subsumed in _ others _ ) make up for roughly 45% of the reject reasons . \n _ these results nicely illustrate the importance of local mail server knowledge for spam detection . _    .reject reasons in pre - filtering . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the above classification was derived from the logs of a single server . \n the question arises whether the results can be extended to other servers in the network . to address this question we now look at the total smtp traffic of the 50 most active email servers of the network .    because we could not get the server logs of all the servers we classify flows according to the membership of the sender in either a black- or whitelist . \n we are interested whether flows originating from blacklisted hosts exhibit characteristics similar to the rejected flows of the previous section . \n similarly , whitelisted hosts should mainly send accepted traffic and thus exhibit according flow characteristics . \n exemplified for flow sizes , figure  [ fig : sizeslist ] shows that , indeed , the shape of rejected and accepted flows is nicely reflected by the black-/whitelisted curves . \n the cdf of blacklisted traffic rises in the region of 300 bytes and achieves a ratio of 92% at 1500 bytes . in contrast , the cdf ot the whitelisted traffic stays on a low level of 10% up to 1500 bytes and starts to increase above 1500 bytes . \n yet , the fraction of whitelisted flows below 1500 bytes is not so small as for accepted traffic in fig . \n [ fig : sizeslog ] . \n we assume this is due to applied greylisting in servers , which leads to a number of rejected flows even for whitelisted hosts . \n in addition , whereas the fraction of rejected flows smaller than 1500 bytes was 99% in fig .  [ \n fig : sizeslog ] , we now have a slightly smaller ratio of about 92% for blacklisted flows . \n this means that the ensemble of the top 50 servers has a less aggressive pre - filtering configuration than the single email server studied before . \n also , if other servers use a blacklist that performs worse than spamhaus , the blacklist used by our server , this effect would be expected . \n that also implies that less knowledgeable servers could benefit from the knowledge of servers that are better configured , that is , servers that exhibit a sharper reject curve . \n again , the curve of all traffic is dominated by blacklisted flows .    summing up \n , these results imply that the discriminating power of the three metrics ( bytes per flow , packets per flow , and bytes per packet ) with regard to spamming activity is also valid in a network - wide setting . \n [ [ impact ] ] impact + + + + + +    in this paper , we established a passive measurement method for detecting the mail server s acceptance of email sending attempts . \n the method requires no additional communication or configuration changes on the mail server . to our best knowledge , this is the first method that scales to _ large networks _ and _ passively _ transfers knowledge about spam from the edge of the network ( servers ) to the core ( as shown in fig . \n [ fig : ispview ] ) . \n although the proposed method is quite simple and based on few basic flow characteristics , we believe it paves the way towards more sophisticated algorithms for network - level spam detection that could successfully complement existing methods .    servers at the edge of the network have local knowledge , such as the user database or the email envelope , that is not accessible at the core of the network . \n further on , servers correlate this knowledge with services ( dbl , spf ) to improve the accuracy of their decision . with the presented method it is possible to concentrate the local decisions of several email servers in the core of the network . \n this approach can be interpreted as a distributed computer cluster where the email servers perform a detection algorithm on part of the global smtp traffic and we are then collecting the results .    mail servers only see their own traffic . in the core of the network \n we have the `` bird s eye view '' over the activity of all nodes . \n this allows to correlate the gained information from one email server with the information of many others . \n further on , our approach is not restricted to smtp traffic and , therefore , one can try to find suspicious behavior in other protocols , too ( a subject of future work ) . \n although being only a first step , we believe the proposed method has important potential applications in production networks and also paves the way for future research in the area of network - level and network - wide characteristics of spam traffic . in the rest , we try to illustrate some of these applications . \n [ [ isp - use - case ] ] isp use case + + + + + + + + + + + +    _ network - wide spam monitoring : _ by looking at the flow characteristics of incoming email traffic , an isp is now able to _ estimate the total spam traffic _ collected by its network . \n furthermore , it is possible to focus on the statistics of a specific server and to _ detect potential performance problems_. for example , figure  [ fig : overtime ] shows the three categories of flows that arrive at an email server inside the network in 15 min \n . intervals . on 18 . \n feb at 6:00 , the server rejects up to 80,000 flows . \n we think that this event corresponds to a spam campaign arriving at the server . during this time , the server is probably overloaded and starts rejecting connection attempts . \n three similar events are visible at the end of the week . these events are visible on other severs as well and are therefore of a distributed nature . \n we believe that an isp could monitor its network thus , and re - act in near real - time to such suspicious events .    as a second observation , \n note how the diurnal pattern of rejected / failed flows has an offset of approximately 6h compared to accepted flows . \n since the local time zone of the server is gmt+1h , this indicates that most spam to that server is sent from time zone gmt-5h ( including eastern usa ) .    _ \n internal server monitoring : _ in addition , the isp could _ rate servers _ by calculating the ratio of accepted vs. rejected flows for each server . \n this ratio could be used to to detect open relay servers or servers with a suboptimal pre - filtering process , triggered by an unusually high number of accepted flows . \n these misconfigured servers produce unnecessary and costly traffic . \n the isp can now take counteractive measures . \n for example , fig . \n [ fig : perserver ] shows the flow size curves for different mail servers in our network . \n some of the servers perform a very aggressive pre - filtering ( server a ) while others do not seem to care too much about it ( server c ) .    by monitoring the three categories of outgoing smtp traffic , \n the isp could infer the reputation of internal sources . \n for example , the reputation could be calculated as the ratio of accepted versus total flows . \n based on this value , the isp would be able to _ detected blacklisted internal servers _ or servers abused for a spam campaign . with the same method , _ spamming botnet members _ inside the network \n could possibly be detected by the isp . \n _ rating external email sources : _ further the internal servers could be used as agents of a collaborative filtering system . \n the external mail senders could be rated based on the three categories of their incoming and outgoing smtp traffic . \n this system could be used to possibly even filter out spam on the edge of the network . \n the rating of the external email sources could be published as a service for other email servers . \n given that an operator is already collecting flow data , e.g. for accounting , the data required by the outlined applications is already available . \n there is _ no need to correlate the traffic again _ with different blacklists or other sources . \n the email servers have already done this work . to implement a similar service without flow data , \n the isp would have to contact each mail server administrator to get access to their local server log . \n this process is bound to be cumbersome or even impossible due to privacy issues . with our approach \n only one sensor must be maintained . \n [ [ limitations ] ] limitations + + + + + + + + + + +    tracing the footprints of pre - filtering methods in network traffic has the inherent limitation that it only detects patterns if pre - filtering is applied by servers in the first place . \n however , in production environments it is the email administrator s intention to block spam as early as possible to save network , cpu and storage resources . \n pre - filtering is the preferred choice to achieve this . \n moreover , pre - filtering allows to reduce the amount of non - delivery messages to be sent  @xcite . \n therefore , we believe it is reasonable to rely on the presence of pre - filtering in production networks .    in principle , spammers could adapt to our method by prolonging the envelope phase , e.g. by sending multiple rcpt or helo commands or providing very long sender email addresses . \n however , any deviation from normal smtp behavior could again be detected and mail servers could enforce the shortness of the envelope as there is no need to be overly long . \n mail server administrators are engaged in an arms race against spammers . \n they urgently need new approaches to fight state - of - the - art attachment spam increasingly originating from low - profile botnet spammers .    in this paper \n , we demonstrated that simple flow metrics , such as byte count , packet count , and bytes per packet , successfully discriminate between spam and ham flows when pre - filtering is deployed in mail servers . \n thus , one could infer individual mail server s decisions with respect to the legitimacy and acceptance of a given connection . \n this allows an operator i ) to concentrate dispersed mail server knowledge at the network core and ii ) to passively accumulate network - wide spam statistics , profile filtering performance of servers , and rate clients . \n thus , the advantages of flow and server log analysis finally meet at the network core . \n we believe this is an important step towards successfully fighting spammers at the network -

{"ContextTokens": 2308, "GeneratedTokens": 66, "SynthesizedBody": "an embedding is a map from input data to points in euclidean space . \n machine learning researchers and developers often need to explore the properties of a specific embedding to understand the behavior of their model . an engineer who creates an embedding of songs for a recommendation system might want to verify that the nearest neighbors of `` stairway to heaven '' include `` whole lotta love '' and not `` let it go '' from frozen . \n meanwhile , a researcher may be interested in global geometric properties , such as linear relationships between meaningful subsets of embedded points . for both sets of users , gaining \n an understanding of embedding geometry is a key step in interpreting a machine learning model . \n an appealing approach to analyzing embeddings is to visualize them . \n since embeddings often exist in a space of hundreds of dimensions , an essential step is `` dimensionality reduction '' which projects points to a more approachable two or three dimensions . \n many tools exist to perform various types of dimensionality reduction , but they are largely non - interactive ( e.g. , matplotlib [ 3 ] , or the code released in [ 5 ] ) . \n unfortunately , these static views are generally inadequate for exploring high - dimensional data  although an important first step in the process , users then typically want to switch quickly between many views , zooming and filtering , and then closely inspecting details . \n indeed , there have been many toolkits created with the express purpose of exploring high - dimensional data ( e.g. , [ 2 ] , [ 8 ] ) , and a key lesson has been that rich interactivity coupled with multiple linked views is extremely helpful .    at the same time , the embeddings that arise in machine learning differ from the kind of data sets seen in conventional `` high - dimensional '' visualization . \n most notably , traditional systems often assume the underlying dimensions have a particular meaning ( the expression level of a given gene , or the age of a person ) . on the other hand , \n the basis vectors in a typical embedding are typically not meaningful  in fact , discovering semantically significant directions can be a goal in itself .    in this paper , we present the embedding projector , a system for interactive visualization and analysis of high - dimensional data . although designed to be a general - purpose tool , it is optimized for the use cases that arise in machine learning and includes special features to explore meaningful directions in a data set . \n we held informal interviews with engineers and researchers within our organization to learn how they worked ( or wanted to work ) with embeddings . \n we also looked at usage of existing internal tools . \n three themes arose consistently . \n [ [ task-1.-exploring - local - neighborhoods ] ] task 1 . exploring local neighborhoods + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    many users wanted to inspect the nearest neighbors of a given point . \n confirming that nearby points are semantically related represented an important step in establishing trust in an algorithm . \n [ [ task-2.-viewing - global - geometry - and - finding - clusters ] ] task 2 . \n viewing global geometry and finding clusters + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    several users were interested in finding large clusters of related points , as well as seeing the global geometry of the embeddings .

adding fog to fade out more distant points ; and initializing the view with an animated `` lazy susan '' motion . \n both modes exploit webgl to provide smooth , fluid interaction , which encourages exploration of the underlying space , supporting both task 1 and task 2 . \n to support task 1 , clicking on a point causes the right pane to show an explicit textual list of nearest neighbors , along with distances to the current point . \n the nearest - neighbor points themselves are highlighted on the projection . \n users sometimes wish to focus on a subset of points  an interesting cluster , or perhaps the set of nearest neighbors of a given point . \n zooming into the cluster gives some information , but it is sometimes more helpful to restrict the view to a subset of points and perform t - sne or pca only on those points . \n to do so , the user can select points in multiple ways : after clicking on a point , its nearest neighbors are selected ; after a search , the points matching the query are selected ; right - clicking and dragging defines a selection sphere . after selecting a set of points , \n the user can isolate those points for further analysis on their own with the `` isolate points '' button in the inspector pane on the right hand side .    in 3d mode , labels can appear as `` billboards ''  flat images that always face the user . fig . \n [ 3d - labels ] depicts this view . \n when there is an image associated with a data point , we can simply use the actual image as the `` label '' . \n a nice example is an embedding of mnist images shown in fig . \n [ mnist - colorized ] where each image has a background color according to its true label . \n [ [ collaborative - features ] ] collaborative features + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    early in the development process we saw that users of the embedding projector wanted to share specific views of their data . \n indeed , previous work in visualization has shown the benefits of allowing users to share the state of a visualization [ 7 ] .    to allow easy collaboration \n , the embedding projector lets users save the current state ( including computed coordinates of t - sne embeddings ) as a small file . the projector can then be pointed to a set of one or more of these files , producing the panel seen in the bottom right of fig . \n [ fig - main ] . \n other users can then walk through a sequence of bookmarks . \n the embedding projector is a new visualization tool that helps users interpret machine learning models that rely on embeddings . unlike other high - dimensional visualization systems , \n it is customized for the kinds of tasks faced by machine learning developers and researchers : exploring local neighborhoods for individual points , analyzing global geometry , and investigating semantically meaningful vectors in embedding space . \n the projector is part of the tensorflow platform , and seamlessly allows analysis and interpretation of tensorflow models . \n there are a number of directions for future work on the visualization . \n for example , when developing multiple versions of a model , or inspecting how a model changes over time , it could be useful to visually compare two embeddings . \n doing so would require nontrivial additions to the current visualizations . \n a second direction for future research is to make it easier for users to discover meaningful directions in the data . \n while the current interface makes it easy to explore various hypotheses , there may be ways for the computer to generate and test hypotheses automatically . \n thanks to shan carter for invaluable design contributions , and to our colleagues who provided thoughtful feedback . \n [ 1 ] m.  abadi , a.  agarwal , p.  barham , e.  brevdo , z.  chen , c.  citro , g.  s. corrado , a.  davis , j.  dean , m.  devin , et  al . \n tensorflow : large - scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems . , 2016 . \n [ 2 ] c.  ahlberg and b.  shneiderman . \n visual information seeking : tight coupling of dynamic query filters with starfield displays . in _ proceedings of the sigchi conference on human factors in computing systems _ , pages 313317 . \n acm , 1994 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3462110983955, "RequestID": "369de65fac7d6c7473015e63f6c9216c810ecea9", "TotalTokens": 2374}

studied pattern in pulsar dynamic spectra consists of a crisscross of intensity maxima that are variably spaced perpendicular to the ridge lines of the maxima . \n cordes and wolszczan ( 1986 ) drew attention to these `` multiple drift rates '' in dynamic spectra , building on earlier work ( hewish 1980 ; roberts & ables 1982 ; hewish , wolszczan , & graham 1985 ; cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ) . \n numerous examples of the phenomenon are evident in the dynamic spectra presented by gupta , rickett , & lyne ( 1994 ) in their multi - year study of 8 pulsars , but the autocorrelation analysis that they employed is not well suited to its full elucidation \n . the remarkable episode of `` fringing '' in the dynamic spectra of psr  b0834 + 06 that rlg explore is also accompanied at all epochs by this phenomenon . \n the central result of our study is to show that this crisscross pattern has a much clearer representation in transform space , where it is seen to be a high - q phenomenon with a characteristic parabolic curvature . \n we discuss the constraints that the presence of this pattern places on the image geometry and speculate on the physical structures that might give rise to this scattering geometry . \n our observations were made at the arecibo observatory at 430  mhz . \n spectra across a 10  mhz band centered on this frequency were produced by a fourier - transform - based spectrometer ( aoftm ) . \n rcp and lcp signals were summed in hardware , and spectra with 1024 frequency channels ( i.e. 10  khz frequency resolution ) were produced every @xmath2  1.6  ms . during later analysis \n the spectra were synchronously averaged at the pulsar period , calculated using tempo @xcite , and summed over 10  s time intervals , creating a cube with axes of time , frequency , and pulsar rotational phase . \n we used 512 phase bins across the pulsar period . \n dynamic spectra were created by producing an on - pulse spectrum from a window of phase bins centered on the pulse and subtracting an off - pulse spectrum to remove the baseline . \n we observed 19 pulsars during 1999 january and 11 pulsars during 2000 january . \n a typical observation lasted one hour ; we made 46 and 43 separate observations at the two observing epochs , respectively . \n following several previous studies ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ) we produced two - dimensional power spectra from the dynamic spectra . \n these `` secondary spectra '' form the basis for most of the further analysis reported here . \n we normalized each secondary spectrum by its maximum and converted the relative power levels into a decibel scale . \n figure  [ fig : dynsec ] shows dynamic and secondary spectra for psr  b0834 + 06 . \n the crisscross pattern in the dynamic spectrum shows up in the secondary spectrum as two parabolic features , curving away from the conjugate time axis , that we call `` arcs '' . \n these arcs are remarkable for their narrowness and extent . in figure \n [ fig : coadded ] we present secondary spectra , averaged over multiple days to improve dynamic range . \n psr  b0823 + 26 and psr  b0834 + 06 showed a persistent arc pattern over both the 1999 and 2000 observing runs . in 2000 , psr  b0919 + 06 showed arcs that were relatively broad and faint and , hence , showed up only upon averaging of @xmath3 secondary spectra . \n however , we did not see arcs in two high - quality 1999 observations . \n psr  b1133 + 16 showed arcs during most of the 1999 and 2000 observations , but several high - quality 2000 observations failed to show them , even though they were made on days adjacent to those on which they were present . \n psr  b1933 + 16 did not show the arc pattern in either of two high - quality observations in 1999 or 2000 . \n time variability of the arcs will be the subject of a separate study . \n we detected arcs in the secondary spectra of pulsars b0823 + 26 , b0834 + 06 , b0919 + 06 , and b1133 + 16 . by using the relationship between fringe frequencies in the secondary spectrum and scattering parameters ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ; gupta , bhat , & rao 1999 ) \n , we can analyze the arcs more quantitatively . here \n we summarize a more detailed study that will be reported elsewhere ( cordes 2001 ) . to simplify calculations \n , these treatments assume that the scattering takes place in a thin screen a distance @xmath4 from the pulsar , with the pulsar - observer distance @xmath5 . \n they show that the interference between two points @xmath6 on the image plane ( i.e. as seen by an observer ) will lead to two - dimensional fringing in the dynamic spectrum with fringe frequencies f_t & = & ( ) ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) , [ eq : ft ] + f _ & = & ( ) ( d- ) ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) . \n [ eq : fnu ] here @xmath7 is the conjugate time axis , @xmath8 is the conjugate frequency axis , and the effective velocity ( cordes & rickett 1998 ) is a weighted sum of the velocities of the source , screen and observer , = ( 1 - /d)+ ( /d ) - \n . we can introduce the dimensionless variables p & = & ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) = f _ , [ eq : pbar ] + q & = & ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) = f_t , [ eq : qbar ] where @xmath9 is a two - dimensional unit vector for the effective velocity . \n since @xmath10 is quadratic in image angles and @xmath11 is linear in image angles , @xmath10 will generally be quadratic in @xmath11 . \n this is essential to explaining the parabolic curvature of the arcs . \n if we make the reasonable assumption that the pulsar velocity is much greater than either the velocity of the earth or the screen , equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) can be simplified to p & = & f _ , [ eq : pnew ] + q & = & f_t , [ eq : qnew ] where @xmath12 , and we approximate @xmath13 by the measured proper motion speed , @xmath14 . a parabolic arc ( @xmath15 ) in the p - q plane then corresponds to a feature in the secondary spectrum of curvature f _ & = & ( ) f_t^2 . \n [ eq : dyn - arc ] in this model , the curvature of the arcs is determined solely by the screen placement , the pulsar distance , and the pulsar proper motion . \n thus , by measuring the curvature of the arcs in the secondary spectrum , we can determine a value for the screen placement that is consistent with the observations and assumed values of @xmath5 and @xmath16 , as in table  [ tab : screen ] . \n gupta ( 1995 ) used diffractive bandwidth and timescale measurements to determine @xmath17 , the speed of the scintillation pattern past the observer ( cordes and rickett 1998 ) . assuming that the scattering is dominated by a thin screen \n , one can determine the screen placement for which @xmath17 is consistent with @xmath16 . \n this is determined from gupta s @xmath18 parameter by @xmath19 . \n table  [ tab : screen ] shows that the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , calculated with eq . \n although the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , the agreement may be only proportionate because there are significant uncertainties in both the distances and the iss parameters used by gupta ; also , scattering is likely to receive contributions from the distributed ism as well as from a screen . in particular , a recent study of b0919 + 06 ( chatterjee 2001 ) that compares scintillation velocity estimates , which are epoch dependent , and the parallax and proper motion determined from vlba observations , finds that a thin screen must be combined with a distributed medium such as that of the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model to bring agreement between the two velocity estimates . at some epochs \n , the screen evidently causes multiple imaging of the pulsar .    from equation  ( 1 ) \n it can be seen that the vertical ( @xmath7 ) extent of arc features in the secondary spectrum is related to the angular extent of the scattering image along the effective velocity vector . \n table  1 shows the typical angular extent of the filament , @xmath22 , and the corresponding linear size on the screen , @xmath23 , inferred from the value of @xmath7 for a generic model . \n we analyze the distribution of power in the secondary spectrum with a sequence of vertical cuts , as in figure  [ fig : cuts ] . \n the rapid decline of power above the arcs strongly limits the image geometries that are consistent with the data . in order to exclude power above the arc \n , points must satisfy @xmath24 . referring to equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) , \n this constraint can be expressed as _ 2 ^ 2-_1 ^ 2 & & ( _ 2x-_1x)^2 , [ eq : inequality ] where the @xmath25  components are along the effective velocity vector . \n a single extended image has many image pairs that violate this condition and , hence , will produce a large amount of power above the arcs , inconsistent with the behavior seen . hence , a multiple image geometry is required to produce the clearly delineated arcs we observe . \n one configuration that satisfies eq . \n 9 , having no detectable power above the arcs , consists of a bright point - like image at the origin ( direct line of sight to the pulsar ) and a faint secondary image as a filled halo around it . \n the interference between a point at the origin and any other image point can not produce power above the arcs because @xmath26 . \n if the point - like image and halo have flux densities proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , then the point - like source will produce a point - like feature at the origin of the secondary spectrum with power proportional to @xmath29 ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ) . \n the inter - image interference between the point - source and the halo will produce power proportional to @xmath30 . \n the self - interference between regions of the halo ( which _ will _ produce power above the arcs ) will be proportional to @xmath31 . \n since this is smaller by another factor of @xmath32 from the inter - image term , then , for small @xmath32 , the only detectable power will be a point - source at the origin and power below the arcs . \n although the point - source plus halo model is consistent with the observations , the scattering material in the screen would need to be inhomogeneous enough that the direct image of the pulsar would shine through , but rays slightly off - axis would be scattered . in essence , we would need to be seeing the pulsar through a break in the interstellar `` clouds '' , consistent with the time - variability of the arcs . on the other hand , \n there is strong evidence for scattering geometries based on filamentary structures @xcite . \n however , the self - interference between filaments will lead to features which are inconsistent with our data . \n any viable model based on filamentary features in the image plane must somehow hide these self - interference features as well as produce the observed parabolic arcs . \n the formalism used here includes only geometric delays , whereas differential dispersive delays may be important in some cases . \n the fact that the observed arcs conform to the geometric - only formalism implies that at least in some instances the dispersive effects are small . \n we have examples of secondary spectra that show more complex behavior and will analyze them within the more general framework in a later paper . \n an extended medium , as opposed to a single screen , also will be explored . \n while there are many possibilities for source geometries , it is clear that a multicomponent scattered image is necessary . in future papers \n , we will apply this method to better understand the structure of the ism on small spatial scales . \n we thank t.  joseph  lazio for helpful discussions , the operators at arecibo for help with remote observations , and duncan lorimer for the development of an excellent remote observing interface . \n we acknowledge support from the national science foundation : grant ast-9618408 to jmc and grant ast-9619493 to drs . \n b0823 + 26 & 0.38 & 196 & 26 & 0.8 & 0.36 & 0.40 & 5.4 & 1.3 + b0834 + 06 & 0.72 & 174 & 31 & 0.6 & 0.33 & 0.36 & 4.0 & 1.9 + b0919 + 06 & 1.2 & 505 & 15 & 0.55 & 0.59 & 0.63 & 3.6 & 1.8 + b1133 + 16 & 0.27 & 475 & 11 & 1.15 & 0.49 & 0.46 & 5.4 & 0.7 +", "StartTimeOffset": 3471111647695, "RequestID": "1c5ae13d17a3fee5dd8f64d1c6d8a58da5c39ce8", "TotalTokens": 3400}

reaction may also include the removal of singularities ( @xcite-@xcite ) . \n this is the main motivation for the work presented here and the answer would have consequences to many fundamental questions including the information loss problem . \n hiscock et.al @xcite have done an extensive study of these effects on the schwarzschild interior and have found cases where curvature is initially slowed in the interior as well as cases where the curvature is initially strengthened ( such as the case of the massless conformally coupled scalar field ) . \n they have also studied the effects on black hole anisotropy . \n it is interesting to ask whether or not the results are a product of the symmetry chosen or are general . \n it is also interesting to ask whether the presence of a cosmological constant will alter the situation . \n the study here attempts to address both issues by studying a black cosmic string which is asymptotically anti - desitter . \n the field is in the hartle - hawking vacuum state @xcite and the stress - energy tensor is found using the approximation of page @xcite which is particularly useful here since the spacetime is an einstein spacetime ( in an einstein spacetime the relation @xmath3 holds ) . \n black string solutions are of relevance to cosmic strings . \n it has also been shown how such black holes may form by gravitational collapse @xcite @xcite . \n this type of collapse has astrophysical relevance as the collapse of a finite spindle can behave as an infinite cylinder near its central region @xcite . \n it may be thought that , since no external observer can view the interior without falling into the black hole , that a study of the interior is not physically meaningful . \n however , as pointed out in @xcite black hole evaporation reveals more and more of the black hole interior as time progresses and therefore the interior has relevance to exterior observers in this way . \n also , the issue of whether or not spacetime singularities actually exist has been one of intense interest ever since oppenheimer and snyder s @xcite original collapse calculation . \n the black hole studied here is the cylindrical black hole spacetime developed by lemos and zanchin @xcite and also studied by kaloper @xcite . \n if charge and angular momentum are not present the metric has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass per unit length , @xmath6 and the coordinates take on the following ranges : @xmath7 an event horizon exists at @xmath8 and the cosmological constant ( which is negative and necessary for cylindrical black hole solutions ) , @xmath9 , dominates in the limit @xmath10 giving the spacetime its asymptotically anti -

reaction effects may be calculated . \n the approximation used here is the approximation of page for thermal stress - energy tensors in static spacetimes@xcite . \n this approximation is especially good if the spacetime under consideration is an einstein spacetime such as the one considered here and contains no ambiguities in the case of scalar fields . \n the bekenstein -

{"ContextTokens": 3825, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "it is widely thought that the properties of disk galaxies formed hierarchically ( as expected in the prevailing lcdm paradigm ) are largely determined by the properties of the dark matter halos in which they form . in this scenario , \n the scaling laws linking various disk galaxy properties , such as their mass , size , and rotation speed , simply reflect analogous correlations between the mass , spin , and potential depth of their surrounding halos ( see , e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) . since the correlations linking various halo properties have been studied extensively through n - body simulations , the presumed association between disk and halo scaling laws enables a host of predictions for the properties of disk galaxies and their evolution with redshift . \n the general analytical framework has been developed in some detail by mo , mao & white ( 1998 , hereafter mmw98 ) , who showed that a number of properties of the present - day disk population may be reproduced with well - motivated choices for the small number of free parameters in the model . \n one important prediction of this modeling is that , at fixed rotation speed , disk galaxies should become smaller with increasing redshift . \n this prediction has come recently under scrutiny given the results of the sins collaboration , who report the discovery of a population of extended disk galaxies at @xmath0 ( genzel et al . \n 2006 , frster schreiber et al . \n 2006 ) . in some cases \n , these galaxies have rotation speeds comparable to @xmath7 disks today and are as extended as their @xmath8 counterparts . \n this in apparent contradiction with the predictions of the mmw98 modeling , unless these galaxies are embedded in halos with unusually high angular momentum ( bouch et al . 2007 ) . \n the interpretation of this disagreement is unclear , however , because n - body / gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation have shown that a number of the assumptions made in the mmw98 model are not readily verified in the simulations . \n in particular , the mass and angular momentum of galaxies assembled hierarchically are not simple functions of the mass and spin of their surrounding halos ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 , 2000 ) . \n the time of collapse ; the importance of mergers ; the feedback from evolving stars ; all of these effects can alter dramatically the simple correspondence between galaxies and host halos envisioned in semianalytic models ( okamoto et al . 2005 ; robertson et al . \n 2006 ; governato et al 2007 ) . as a result , it is unclear whether the extended disks observed by the sins collaboration present a challenge for the lcdm paradigm or whether they may be accommodated by reasonable tuning of the model free parameters . \n we address these issues here using simulated galaxies selected from the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ) project . \n we use these simulations to examine the relation between mass and angular momentum ( and its dependence on feedback ) in @xmath0 galaxies assembled in the lcdm scenario . \n we use these results to validate the mmw98 model and to compare with the results from the sins collaboration . \n the overwhelmingly large simulation ( owls ) project is a collection of roughly @xmath9 nbody / gasdynamical cosmological simulations of representative volumes in an lcdm universe . the various owls runs explore systematically the effect on the simulated galaxy population of varying numerical resolution , star formation laws , cooling function , sub - grid physics , and feedback recipes . \n we select for this study four different owls runs that differ from each other only in the way supernova ( sn ) feedback is implemented . \n each run follows the evolution of @xmath10 dark mater and @xmath10 gas particles in a @xmath11 box . \n the mass per particle in these runs is @xmath12 for the dark matter and six times lower for the baryons . \n gas is allowed to cool radiatively , and to turn into stars in a manner consistent with an empirically calibrated schmidt - kennicutt law . \n feedback energy from evolving stars is incorporated assuming that a fixed fraction of the available energy ( @xmath13 of the total energy released by sn for a chabrier imf ) is channeled into bulk motions of the gas particles in order to mimic feedback - driven `` winds '' outflowing from regions of active star formation . in all four \n runs the same amount of energy is invested in feedback ; the main differences between runs are the choices made for the wind velocity ( @xmath14 ) and mass loading ( @xmath15 ) factor . the parameter @xmath15 specifies the number of gas particles among which the feedback kinetic energy is split , whereas @xmath14 characterizes the outflow velocity of the wind particles .    for the range of halo masses investigated here the effects of feedback ( in terms of how effectively it regulates star formation and/or removes gas from galaxies ) increase with @xmath14 for fixed @xmath16 . \n we refer to each of the 4 runs , in order of increasing overall feedback efficiency , as : wf4 ( @xmath17 particles and @xmath18 km / s ) , wf2 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 km / s ) , wf1 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 km / s ) and wf2dec . \n the latter is equivalent to wf2 but `` wind '' particles are temporarily decoupled from the hydrodynamical equations ( see dalla vecchia & schaye 2008 for details ) . \n our simulated galaxy sample consists of all galaxies assembled ( at @xmath0 ) at the centers of dark halos in the mass range @xmath23 to @xmath24 . \n these halos contain between @xmath25 and @xmath26 particles within the virial radius ( defined as the radius where the mean inner density is @xmath27 times the critical density of the universe at @xmath0 ) . \n the gravitational softening is never greater than @xmath28 ( physical ) . with these definitions , \n the simulated galaxy sample in each run contains roughly @xmath29 objects . \n the left panel of fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] shows , as a function of halo virial mass , the baryonic mass in various components for galaxies identified in the wf2 run . \n the ( top ) dashed straight line indicates the baryon mass associated with each halo through the universal baryon fraction @xmath30 . \n the bottom four curves show the baryon mass in different regions of the halo . \n the dotted line corresponds to all baryons within @xmath31 . \n this shows that halos at the high - mass end of the considered range are able to retain all baryons but that those at the low mass end have experienced a net loss of about @xmath32 of their baryons . \n this illustrates the decreasing efficiency of feedback - driven winds in the deeper potential wells of more massive halos . \n the effect is even more pronounced when considering the total amount of baryons locked in the central galaxy ( i.e. , those within @xmath33 from the halo centre ) . \n the dots in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] show that the total baryon mass of the central galaxy is not simply proportional to the halo mass . \n the relation has substantial scatter and it varies systematically as a function of @xmath34 . \n ( all curves in this plot trace the median in equal - number bins of virial mass . ) at low @xmath34 central galaxies collect on average only about @xmath35 of the baryon mass associated with the halo through the universal baryon fraction . \n this fraction rises to almost @xmath36 for @xmath37 halos , but appears to decline in more massive halos . \n the decline at the high - mass end is likely a result of the longer cooling times characteristic of massive halos , which hinder the assembly of massive central galaxies . \n the bottom two curves indicate how the baryon mass of central galaxies splits into gas ( dashed ) and stars ( dot - dashed ) . \n gas and stars contribute about equally at low masses , but central galaxies in high - mass halos are predominantly stellar . \n this is presumably a result of the inability of feedback to delay or prevent the efficient conversion of gas into stars in halos with a deep potential well . \n the effect on these trends of different feedback prescriptions may be seen on the right panel of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . clearly , variations in feedback implementation have a large effect on the mass ( and gas fraction ) of central galaxies . in low mass halos ( e.g. , @xmath38 ) \n wf4 and wf2dec galaxies differ by more than a factor of 5 , illustrating the wide range of feedback efficiency surveyed in the owls simulations .    the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] shows the _ specific _ angular momentum as a function of halo mass for various components in the wf2 galaxy sample . \n the dark matter angular momentum scales roughly as @xmath39 ; the expected scaling for systems with similar dimensionless spin parameter @xmath40 . \n this scaling is followed closely by all baryons within the virial radius ( dotted line ) , a result that illustrates the fact that both baryons and dark matter were torqued and spun by the same amount during the early expansion phase of each system ( see , e.g. , navarro et al 2004 ) .    by comparison , \n the baryons in the central galaxies have much lower specific angular momentum ; a factor of @xmath41 lower on average ( solid curve and dots in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] ) . \n it is also clear from this figure that the gas ( dashed curve ) has typically higher angular momentum than the stars ( dot - dashed ) . \n this reflects the higher efficiency of transformation of gas into stars in the central ( denser ) regions of a galaxy and implies that gaseous disks will be , on average , larger than stellar ones . \n as we discuss below , it is important to take this effect into account when comparing theoretical predictions with observations . \n these trends are common to all our feedback implementations , as may be verified by inspecting the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] . \n note , however , that feedback affects the mass and angular momentum of central galaxies in different ways . \n indeed , compare the central galaxy masses ( top - right panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] ) and spins ( top right panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] ) of models wf4 and wf2dec , our most and least efficient feedback runs , respectively . in high - mass halos the baryonic mass of wf4 central galaxies is roughly @xmath42-@xmath43 larger than in wf2dec , but its specific angular momentum remains largely unchanged . \n this non - linear interplay between the mass and spin of the baryons that are assembled into central galaxies is explored in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] , where we show the galaxy s mass ( @xmath44 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath45 ) , each expressed in units of the corresponding halo values . \n semianalytic models of galaxy formation typically assume that the specific angular momentum of the central galaxy is similar to that of its host halo ; i.e. , that @xmath5 . in the mmw98 formalism \n , these parameters enable prediction of the exponential scalelength of a disk galaxy once the virial radius ( @xmath31 ) and spin parameter ( @xmath40 ) of a halo are specified , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are factors that account for the concentration and `` contraction '' of the dark halo .    the @xmath49-@xmath50 relation in our simulations \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] , where each panel corresponds to a different feedback implementation . \n a few things are worth noting in this figure . \n ( i ) simulated galaxies deviate strongly from the @xmath5 line , which assumes that galaxies and halos have the same specific angular momentum ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) . \n ( ii ) the scatter in the relation is large , and in every panel there are cases where @xmath52 \n . these are galaxies where feedback has been able to push out a substantial fraction of low - angular momentum baryons . as a result , \n those that remain attached to the central galaxy have specific angular momentum higher than the system as a whole . \n ( iii ) feedback efficiency largely determines @xmath49 : for example , wf4 galaxy masses are on average 3 to 5 times larger than wf2dec galaxies . \n this may be seen as a horizontal shift of points between the corresponding panels . \n ( iv ) the @xmath49-@xmath50 relation is approximately independent of feedback . \n this is illustrated by the dotted curve , which is repeated in each panel , and which reproduces the median @xmath50 as a function of @xmath49 in the wf2 run . \n this curve approximates reasonably well the @xmath50-@xmath49 relation in _ all _ panels . in other words , for the feedback implementation adopted in our simulations the fraction of baryons that collects into the central galaxy is the primary factor determining the angular momentum content this galaxy retains . \n we may also use our simulations to check the validity of the mmw98 formula for predicting galaxy sizes . \n this is shown in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , where we plot the predicted ( cylindrical ) half - mass radius ( @xmath53 ) versus the projected half - mass radius of stars ( red asterisks ) , star - forming gas ( empty blue squares ) and baryons ( black circles ) , for galaxies identified in the wf2 simulation . \n the agreement is quite good for the stellar component , which is striking given the number of simplifying assumptions that go into the prediction and that are not matched in detail by the simulations . \n for example , the mmw98 prediction assumes that all baryons are in a centrifugally - supported exponential disk ; simulated galaxies , on the other hand , exhibit a very wide range of disk - to - spheroid ratio . \n interestingly , when scaled by a constant factor @xmath54 the mmw98 formula also predicts rather accurately the size of the star - forming _ gaseous _ disks ( see upper dotted curve in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] ) . \n we can combine this result with the @xmath49-@xmath50 relation discussed above to compute the expected size of ( gaseous ) disks at @xmath0 . as shown in the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , the disk size and rotation speed depend sensitively on @xmath50 and @xmath49 . \n the jagged curve in this panel shows how the size of gaseous disks formed in a halo of _ fixed _ virial velocity @xmath55 km / s changes as @xmath50 and @xmath49 are varied . \n the halo is assumed to have average concentration for its mass , and average spin , @xmath56 . \n the jagged curve maps , in the disk size - rotation speed plane , variations in ( @xmath49,@xmath50 ) chosen to lie along the relation shown by the dotted line in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] , from ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) to ( @xmath59,@xmath60 ) . \n the disk radius depends critically on the value of @xmath50 and @xmath49 : _ disk sizes vary by a factor of @xmath61 , even though the halo mass , concentration , and spin are fixed . _    for small values of @xmath50 \n the central disk has very little angular momentum , and therefore a rather small size . \n as @xmath50 ( and @xmath49 ) increases , the disk grows steadily in size . \n disk radii are maximized for @xmath62 and @xmath63 in this example . \n increasing @xmath50 further results in massive disks ( because of the concurrent rise in @xmath49 ) with very high rotation speeds . \n since angular momentum scales as disk size times rotation speed , these massive disks end up being actually smaller , despite their larger @xmath50 . \n clearly , predicting the size of disks is a rather uncertain endeavour unless one is able to constrain the values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath49 to within a very narrow range .    as may be seen in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , disks in @xmath64 km / s halos may reach a size of order @xmath65 kpc , comparable to the size of disks in the sins sample . \n ( sins data are shown by large pentagons in the right - hand panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] . ) larger disks may also exist , for example , in more massive ( intrinsically larger ) halos , or in halos with higher - than - average @xmath40 , or in systems where galaxies have retained an unusually high fraction of its angular momentum ( i.e. , those that scatter _ above _ the mean @xmath49-@xmath50 relation in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] ) . \n taking , as an example , the wf2 run , we find , at @xmath0 , about @xmath66 gaseous disks exceeding @xmath67 kpc ( physical ) in size per cubic @xmath68 mpc ( comoving ) . \n these numbers are in rough agreement with the findings of the sins collaboration ( bouch et al 2007 ) . \n we hasten to add that these are not `` typical '' galaxies at that redshift , but rather some of the largest ones present then . \n the selection of sins galaxies favors large disks in order to enhance the probability of obtaining a resolved velocity map , and therefore they can not be considered `` average '' at that redshift either . \n the presence of a ( reasonable ! ) number of extended disks at @xmath0 might thus not require unusually high halo spins nor present an insurmountable challenge to the lcdm structure formation paradigm .", "StartTimeOffset": 3506090047852, "RequestID": "fa0563d48f9c9b58dfc4e295bf98daade2f6fd9c", "TotalTokens": 4077}
{"ContextTokens": 4071, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "for more than three decades now , black holes have been investigated in great depth and detail . \n however , almost all these studies have focused on isolated black holes possessing two basic properties , namely time - independence characterized by the existence of a timelike killing vector field , and asymptotic flatness . on the other hand , one can not rule out the important and , perhaps , realistic situation in which the black hole is associated with a non - flat background \n . this would be the case if one takes into account the fact that the black hole may actually be embedded in the cosmological spacetime or surrounded by local mass distributions . \n in such situations one or both of the two basic properties may have to be given up . \n if so , the properties of isolated black holes may be modified , completely changed or retained unaltered . \n black holes in non - flat backgrounds form , therefore , an important topic . \n very little has been done in this direction . \n some of the issues involved here have been outlined in a recent article by vishveshwara @xcite . \n as has been mentioned in that article , there may be fundamental questions of concepts and definitions involved here . \n nevertheless , considerable insight may be gained by studying specific examples even if they are not entirely realistic . in this regard \n the family of spacetimes derived by vaidya @xcite , which is a special case of whittaker s solutions @xcite , representing in a way black holes in cosmological backgrounds have been found to be helpful . \n nayak and vishveshwara @xcite have studied these spacetimes concentrating on the geometry of the kerr black hole in the background of the einstein universe , which dispenses with asymptotic flatness while preserving time - symmetry . in the present paper \n , we specialize to the simpler case of the schwarzschild black hole in the background of the einstein universe , which we may call the vaidya - einstein - schwarzschild ( ves ) spacetime . \n this allows us to study this spacetime in considerable detail as well as investigate a typical physical phenomenon , namely the behaviour of scalar waves in this spacetime as the background . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section \n ii , we consider the line element of the ves spacetime and the energy - momentum tensor . in section iii , we match the metric of the ves spacetime to the schwarzschild vacuum metric across the black hole surface . \n similarly we match the ves spacetime to the einstein universe at large distances . in section iv \n , we investigate the behaviour of scalar waves propagating in this spacetime . \n section v comprises the concluding remarks . \n as mentioned earlier , an account of vaidya s black hole spacetimes in cosmological spacetimes may be found in references @xcite and @xcite . by setting the angular momentum to zero in the kerr metric \n we obtain the line element of the schwarzschild spacetime in the background of the einstein universe : @xmath1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the mass and the coordinates range from @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the limits \n @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we recover respectively the einstein universe and the schwarzschild spacetime . \n the parameter @xmath8 is a measure of the cosmological influence on the spacetime . \n as the spacetime is static , the black hole is identified as the surface on which the time - like killing vector becomes null , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath9 above , which is the static limit and the killing event horizon . \n the black hole is therefore given by @xmath10 we shall now work out the energy -

momentum tensor is taken to be that of a perfect fluid , @xmath21 @xmath22 being the static four velocity @xmath23 then density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 are given by @xmath24 the behaviour of @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be easily ascertained from the above equations . \n + @xmath25 : + we find that @xmath26 in some region outside the black hole violating the weak energy condition . \n + @xmath27 : + in this case , @xmath28 but @xmath29 everywhere outside the black hole and tends to zero on it . \n however , @xmath30 thereby satisfying the weak energy condition .    for convenience , we take @xmath31 then @xmath32 this suggests that the spacetime is a special case of the solutions obeying the condition @xmath33 discussed by whittaker @xcite , and it is easy to check that this is so ( it is the case @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with the time coordinate scaled so that @xmath37 , in whittaker s notation ) . \n thus the behaviour of the energy - momentum tensor is reasonable , since in the einstein universe itself we have @xmath38 , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy the weak energy condition . \n in this section we shall match the ves spacetime to the schwarzschild vacuum spacetime on one side and to the einstein universe on the other . \n the possibility of matching to the schwarzschild vacuum at the black hole surface , without a surface layer or shell , is strongly indicated by the fact that the einstein tensor of the ves spacetime goes to zero on the surface . \n we shall show that this is indeed possible . in order to do this , we will first write the line element in kruskal -

r^ * , \\quad   v = t + r^ * , \\\\ \\widehat{u } & = &   -\\exp\\left [ -\\frac{u}{4 m } \\frac { 4 m^2 + r^2}{r^2 } \\right ] , \\\\ \\widehat{v } & = & \\exp\\left [ \\frac{v}{4 m } \\frac { 4 m^2 + r^2}{r^2 }      \\right ] . \\ ] ] then we obtain @xmath40 the kruskal line element for the schwarzschild vacuum spacetime , @xmath41 may be recovered from equation ( [ kurskl ] ) by the limit @xmath42 . as usual the kruskal coordinates for the schwarzschild space cover the whole maximally extended spacetime and not only the region where the coordinates @xmath43 are valid . \n now we proceed to carry out the matching at the horizons . \n the horizon of the ves metric is at @xmath44 where @xmath45 . to match to schwarzschild at the horizon the angular variables part requires @xmath46 . \n let us use @xmath47 as the radial variable in the ves region . \n we can rescale both the @xmath48 and @xmath49 of each of the metrics by constant factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , giving new coordinates u , v , to reduce the metrics to the forms , @xmath52 @xmath53 then we see the metric is continuous if we identify @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the future horizon @xmath56 . to deal with derivatives , \n start with @xmath57 on the ves side , so that there @xmath58 and therefore @xmath59 as @xmath60 the product @xmath61 approaches @xmath62 and we get @xmath63 which is obviously the same as for @xmath64 in the schwarzschild metric . \n now the derivatives of the metric coefficients will match if @xmath65 at the horizon , but @xmath66 and consequently @xmath67 because at the horizon @xmath68 . \n this completes the matching at the future horizon . \n clearly a similar matching with the roles of @xmath69 and @xmath70 reversed applies at the past horizon in a kruskal picture . \n we may note that matching the metric component @xmath71 yields the relation between the schwarzschild vacuum mass @xmath72 and the ves mass @xmath73 , @xmath74^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] this clearly exhibits the influence of the cosmological matter distribution on the bare black hole mass . \n figure 1 shows plots of @xmath73 as a function of @xmath72 for different values of @xmath8 . \n we note that @xmath75 , so the length scale in the exterior puts a bound on the black hole mass , in a way which may be analogous with the bound found in @xcite for the mass of a black hole in an einstein space . \n it is also worth emphasizing that a consequence of this matching is that all the horizon properties , such as the specific gravity , are necessarily the same as those of the usual schwarzschild black hole . whether this is reassuring or disappointing \n is a matter of opinion . \n it does not imply , however , that properties which depend on the behaviour in the exterior region , such as the behaviour of waves , will be the same .    to investigate such behaviours we need a well - behaved non - vacuum exterior . \n unfortunately , the formulae ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ p ] ) show that the energy density and pressure of the ves spacetime blow up as @xmath76 and this is in fact a naked singularity . to remove it we try to match to the einstein universe ( which , remember , is a limit of ( [ ves ] ) ) . \n it is easy to see that the best hope of doing so without a surface layer is at @xmath77 , where we could match both the angular part of the metric and its derivative . \n in fact , at this radius the ves line element reduces to @xmath78 which is the line element of the einstein universe . \n the metric components of the two spacetimes automatically match , without any change of coordinates , and the first derivative of the angular parts on both sides vanishes . \n but the first derivative of the @xmath79-parts is discontinuous thereby giving rise to a surface distribution of matter . \n the components of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor may be computed following mars and senovilla @xcite . \n we find that this leads to a trace free tensor . \n more specifically , the jump in the fundamental form of the @xmath80 surfaces is @xmath81 = -m / r^2\\ ] ] and the non - zero components of the @xmath82-function parts of the curvature and ricci tensor are given by @xmath83 such a layer might be interpreted as a domain wall . \n we now have a composite model consisting of a vacuum schwarzschild black hole matched onto the ves spacetime which is itself matched to the einstein universe . \n in the last section we constructed a model for a black hole in a non - flat background . \n the interior of the black hole consists of the schwarzschild vacuum . \n the exterior is the ves spacetime matched on to the einstein universe . \n one can explore black hole physics in the exterior and compare it with the effects one encounters in the case of the usual isolated black holes . \n as an example of such possible studies , we shall consider some properties of scalar waves propagating in this spacetime . \n other phenomena occurring in this spacetime , such as the classical tests of general relativity and the geodesics , have been investigated by ramachandra and vishveshwara @xcite . \n because of the time and spherical symmetries of the spacetime , the scalar wave function may be decomposed as @xmath84    the limits of the radial coordinate are given by @xmath85 to @xmath86 with the ves spacetime extending from @xmath87 to @xmath88 and the einstein universe from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . \n we set the radial function @xmath91 and define @xmath92 then we obtain the schrdinger equation governing the radial function @xmath93 u   \\ = \\ 0.\\ ] ] the effective potential that controls the propagation of the scalar waves is given by @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we shall now discuss a few aspects of the behaviour of the scalar waves as reflected by the nature of the effective potential . \n we have drawn @xmath95 in fig.2 for @xmath96 . \n the figure shows the corresponding effective potential for the vacuum schwarzschild exterior also which can be obtained by setting @xmath97 . \n both curves start from zero at the black hole and go through a maximum . \n thus both potentials possess potential barriers . as in the case of the schwarzschild vacuum , \n now too waves can be reflected at the barrier while the transmitted part is absorbed by the black hole . \n on the other hand , whereas the vacuum potential goes asymptotically to zero , in the present case the potential becomes negative at @xmath98 and continues as a constant , _ \n i.e _ @xmath99 , in the einstein universe up to @xmath100 . \n the fact that the effective potential is negative as above raises the possibility of @xmath101 being negative as well . \n this would be equivalent to @xmath102 being imaginary thereby giving rise to exponential growth in time of the scalar wave function . \n this would mean instability of the model spacetime against scalar perturbations . \n however , one can see that negative values of @xmath101 are ruled out by the boundary condition at @xmath103 . in the einstein universe sector \n the schrdinger equation reduces to @xmath104 we note that in the einstein universe , we have @xmath105 . furthermore , since @xmath106 , the function @xmath107 $ ] has to go to zero faster than @xmath108 at @xmath100 . \n this boundary condition requires that @xmath109 be an integer greater than 1 , and thence that @xmath101 be positive . \n therefore the spacetime is stable against scalar perturbations . \n this is true in the case of vacuum schwarzschild spacetime as well as the einstein universe . \n however , the stability against gravitational perturbations is a different matter altogether . whereas the schwarzschild vacuum exterior is stable , the einstein universe is not @xcite . whether the combination of the two spacetimes is stable , unstable or conditionally stable \n is an intriguing open question .    for @xmath110 , the equivalent potential has the additional term @xmath111 . \n we sketch @xmath95 for @xmath112 in figure 3 . \n once again the potential goes to zero at the black hole and possesses a barrier region . \n the additional term goes to infinity at @xmath113 thereby behaving like a centrifugal barrier commonly encountered in the scattering phenomenon . \n the radial function is exponential wherever the value of @xmath95 is greater than @xmath114 and is a running wave when @xmath115 . \n details of such solutions can be studied easily . \n the motivation for the present work stems from the need for detailed study of black holes in non - flat backgrounds in comparison and contrast to isolated black holes . \n a comprehensive investigation of this problem would be a formidable task indeed . \n we have confined ourselves in this paper to a specific example that relaxes the condition of asymptotic flatness while preserving time - symmetry . \n the starting point here is the static black hole in the einstein universe which belongs to the family of solutions presented by vaidya . in this spacetime \n the black hole is well defined as the killing horizon . \n however , the nature of the interior of the black hole is not entirely clear . \n furthermore , it is not obvious _ a priori _ whether the exterior can be matched smoothly to the schwarzschild vacuum across the black hole surface . \n we have shown that this is possible by carrying out this matching using kruskal coordinates in the two regions . \n similarly we have matched the spacetime to the einstein universe at the other end . \n this provides a composite model of a black hole in a non - flat background .    in the spacetime \n considered above , different phenomena may be studied and compared to their counterparts in the gravitational field of an isolated schwarzschild black hole . as an example , we have briefly discussed the behaviour of scalar waves . \n the spacetime being considered proves to be stable against scalar perturbations as is the schwarzschild vacuum exterior . \n this is true of the einstein universe as well . \n however , whereas the schwarzschild spacetime is stable against gravitational perturbations , the einstein universe is not . it would be quite interesting to see whether the spacetime we have considered , which involves both of the above ones , is gravitationally stable or not . even if the model presented here \n is unrealistic , it should provide a testing ground for investigating external influences on the otherwise isolated black holes . \n one of us ( c.v.v ) would like to thank prof . \n mac callum and his colleagues for hospitality during his visit to queen mary and westfield college . \n this visit was made possible by a visiting fellowship grant from the uk engineering and physical sciences research council , grant number gr / l 79724 , which partially supported the research reported in this paper . \n 99 c. v. vishveshwara ,  black holes in cosmological backgrounds \" , in _ the universe -

{"ContextTokens": 3955, "GeneratedTokens": 200, "SynthesizedBody": "the goal of the visible - light imager and magnetograph ( vim ; marsch et al . \n 2005 ) , one of the remote sensing instruments onboard solar orbiter , is to obtain high resolution maps of the vector magnetic field and the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity in the solar photosphere . \n this information is essential to understand not only the physical processes occurring there , but also the magnetic coupling of the different atmospheric layers . \n in addition , vim will carry out local and global helioseismic studies of the sun . \n the inference of los velocity and vector magnetic field ( strength , inclination and azimuth ) maps , commonly called dopplergrams and vector magnetograms , requires the observation and subsequent analysis of a spectral line in polarized light . \n the atmospheric parameters ( physical quantities ) are retrieved from the polarimetric measurements by techniques based on either the radiative transfer equation or look - up tables ( bellot rubio 2006 ) . \n vim consists of two telescopes : the high resolution telescope ( vim - hrt ) and the full disk telescope ( vim - fdt ) . \n spectropolarimetry is carried out using a double fabry - prot interferometer , conceptually based on linbo@xmath1 etalons , which performs the wavelength selection within the spectral line , and two polarization modulation packages , based on liquid crystal retarders , to modulate the polarization of the incident light . \n solanki et al . \n ( 2006 ) describe the main properties of the instrument and a possible configuration for vim on solar orbiter . \n the photospheric line to be observed is fe  i  617.3  nm . \n the purpose of the present work is to investigate how well we are able to infer atmospheric parameters from vim - hrt data , providing feedback to optimize its design . in many respects , \n vim - hrt is very similar to the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax ; martnez pillet et al . \n 2004 ) , the vector polarimeter of the sunrise balloon mission ( gandorfer et al . \n we have carried out extensive tests to improve the sunrise / imax performance ( e.g.  orozco surez et al.2006 ) . \n here we use this experience to study the influence of spectral resolution and wavelength sampling on the accuracy of the atmospheric parameters derived from vim - hrt measurements . \n we show that filter widths of 120  m and 4 wavelength samples ( 3 across the line and one in the continuum ) would allow vim to achieve its science goals . \n we simulate the observational process of vim , from the measurement of spectra to the determination of physical quantities , as follows . \n first , we use model atmospheres that describe the sun in the more realistic way possible . \n these atmospheres allow us to simulate _ \n observations _ by synthesizing the stokes profiles ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) of fe  i  617.3  nm . \n the polarization signals are spatially degraded considering telescope diffraction and detector pixel size . \n we also degrade the profiles applying a spectral psf , add noise , and select a few wavelength samples across the line . \n the simulated `` observations '' are then analyzed by means of inversion techniques . comparing the retrieved parameters with the real ones we estimate the uncertainties of the inferences . \n vim - hrt is expected to observe the solar photosphere at resolutions of @xmath6150  km . \n no ground - based telescope has ever provided spectropolarimetric measurements at such a resolution . for this reason , the atmospheres needed to synthesize the stokes profiles are taken from mhd simulations ( vgler et al . \n 2005 ; schssler et al . \n more specifically , we use a simulation run representing a quiet sun area with mixed - polarity magnetic fields and unsigned average flux of @xmath6150  g. the duration of the simulation sequence is roughly 5 minutes with a cadence of 10 seconds . \n the horizontal and vertical extents of the computational box are 6 and 1.4  mm , respectively . \n the synthesis of stokes profiles is carried out using the sir code ( ruiz cobo & del toro iniesta 1992 ) . \n the line considered here , fe  i 617.3  nm , is sampled at 61 wavelength positions in steps of 1  pm . \n the atomic parameters have been taken from the vald database ( piskunov et al . \n these stokes profiles represent the _ real _ sun . to determine the atmospheric parameters from them we use a least - square inversion technique based on milne - eddington ( me ) \n atmospheres . \n the sampling interval in the mhd simulations is 00287 ( grid resolution ) , implying a spatial resolution of 0057 or 41.6  km on the solar surface . \n the spatial resolution provided by the aperture of vim operating at 617.3 nm is @xmath6017 ( i.e. , @xmath6127 km on the sun ) , but the sampling interval ( 011 ) imposed by the ccd limits the spatial resolution to 162  km ( @xmath6022 ) on the sun . \n thus , in order to properly simulate vim observations , the data images derived from the model ( the synthetic stokes profiles ) have to be spatially degraded by telescope diffraction and detector pixel size . \n figure [ fig : continuo ] shows maps of the normalized continuum intensity for the original data ( the theoretical model ) and for the spatially degraded data . \n the main visible effect of the degradation process is the loss of contrast from @xmath614% to @xmath611% in the continuum . \n the ccd grid and the disappearance of small scale structures are also very noticeable . \n figure  [ mtf ] shows the mtfs representing , in the fourier domain , the filtering of spectral components induced by telescope diffraction and pixelation effects in the ccd . \n the most favorable ( ideal ) case is one in which the instrument measures the spatially degraded stokes profiles with no noise , very high spectral resolution , and critical wavelength sampling . \n inversion techniques would be able to infer correct atmospheric parameters from this kind of observations , but one needs complex model atmospheres with vertical gradients to describe the height variation of the physical quantities within the same pixel . \n such models are not feasible because of the limited data processing capabilities onboard solar orbiter . \n thus , me inversions represent the best option to interpret vim - hrt measurements : they do not retrieve stratifications , but are simple and often provide reasonable averages of the physical quantities over the line formation region ( westendorp plaza et al . \n 2001 ; bellot rubio 2006 ) .    in the present work we consider the results of me inversions of the spatially degraded stokes profiles with no noise , no spectral psf , and 61 wavelength samples as _ the reference _ solution . \n by comparing this reference with the outcome of me inversions of the same stokes profiles affected by noise , limited spectral resolution , and wavelength sampling , we quantify the loss of information induced by the measuring process , avoiding errors due to the me assumption . \n vim uses a fabry - prot interferometer to perform the wavelength selection within the line . \n the finite spectral resolution of the instrument reduces the amount of information carried by the line , and therefore is a source of uncertainties in the determination of atmospheric parameters . \n the spectral psf of vim can be described as a gaussian function whose fwhm lies somewhere between 75 and 120  m . \n we estimate the effect of limited spectral resolution as follows . \n the synthetic stokes profiles are convolved with psfs of different widths . specifically , we vary the fwhm from zero to 200  m in steps of 10  m . \n we then add noise at the level of @xmath7 , apply a me inversion to the profiles sampled at 61 wavelength positions , and compare the inferred maps with our _ reference_. the me inversion process determines 9 free parameters . \n the magnetic filling factor is fixed to unity and no stray light is considered . \n we use the same initial guess model for all inversions , allowing a maximum of 300 iterations . \n three simulation snapshots ( 17700 pixels ) have been inverted in this way .    to analyze the test results we calculate the mean and rms values of the errors ( defined as the difference between the inferred and the _ reference _ parameters ) . as an example , fig . \n [ individuales ] shows the field strength errors resulting from the inversion of the stokes profiles convolved with a 120  m fwhm filter . \n each point represents an individual pixel . \n the solid lines give the mean and rms errors . \n figure [ fig : filtro1 ] shows the variation of the mean and rms errors with the fwhm , for the los velocity ( upper panel ) and the magnetic field strength and inclination ( middle and bottom panels ) . in the last two panels we have considered only pixels whose stokes @xmath3 , @xmath4 _ or _ \n @xmath5 amplitudes exceed three times the noise level . \n different conclusions can be drawn from this figure . \n first , we note that the rms errors for filter widths of 0  m are @xmath8  m / s in velocity , @xmath9  g in field strength , and @xmath10 in field inclination . \n these errors are solely due to the photon noise of @xmath7 added to the observables ( which was zero in the reference profiles ) . \n therefore , _ they represent the minimum uncertainties that vim would produce _ even if the spectral line is critically sampled at 61 wavelength positions . \n the mean and rms errors of the velocity increase with filter width , although the variation is weak . \n we estimate rms errors of about 30  m / s and 50  m / s for 60  m and 120  m filter widths , respectively . \n the errors in the magnetic field strength also vary smoothly with the fwhm . for filters narrower than 120 \n m , the rms errors are always smaller than @xmath630  g. interestingly , the mean errors increase with increasing field strength : in the range 150750  g they are roughly constant , which is not the case for fields stronger than 750  g. the fact that the mean errors of field strength and velocity vary with the fwhm is related to the asymmetries of the profiles . \n stokes profiles formed in real atmospheres exhibit asymmetries induced by vertical gradients of the atmospheric parameters . \n the stokes profiles coming from me atmospheres are _ symmetric _ , however . while the spectral psf smears out the asymmetries , it also allows better fits to the observations . \n consequently , the mean errors vary with filter width , and the variation is larger for stronger fields .    from this analysis \n we conclude that instrumental profiles of up to 120  m  fwhm provide accurate results . \n it is important to keep in mind , however , that the spectral psf also affects the stokes profiles in two different ways : first it reduces their amplitudes , and second it smooths the asymmetries out . to quantify the first effect , the upper panel of fig . \n [ fig : filtro2 ] shows , as a function of filter width , the percentage of pixels whose stokes @xmath3 or @xmath4 amplitudes exceed twofold the noise level . \n this percentage decreases rapidly with the fwhm of the psf . \n in other words : _ the ability to detect linear polarization signals strongly depends on the instrumental profile _ , at least in quiet sun regions . for instance , 6% of the pixels are no longer detectable in linear polarization when the filter width is increased from 75 to 120  m . \n this loss of sensitivity can be compensated by lowering the noise level . in the bottom panel of fig . \n [ fig : filtro2 ] , we represent the percentage of pixels with detectable linear polarization signals against the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a fixed filter width of 120  m . \n the variation is almost linear . if we are to recover the previous loss of 6% of the pixels , the snr has to be increased from 1000 to 1300 . \n this translates into a 1.7 factor in exposure time , which may have some unwanted consequences on high spatial resolution observations . \n vim - hrt will achieve a spatial resolution of about 150  km in the solar photosphere . at this resolution \n the smallest dynamical structures accessible evolve on time scales of 1050 seconds ( assuming a scale height of 100 km ) . \n thus , the scanning of the spectral line should not take longer . \n this fact limits vim to sample only a few wavelength positions within the line . \n currently , scans of five wavelength positions plus one in the nearby continuum are being considered . \n the limited wavelength sampling introduces additional uncertainties in the inference process . to determine these errors we carry out me inversions of the stokes profiles sampled with different numbers of wavelength points , from 2 to 8 , plus the continuum . \n first , the profiles have been convolved with a 120  m  fwhm filter and have been added noise at the level of @xmath0 . \n the inversion is carried out in the same conditions as before . \n again , we compare the inferred maps with the _ reference _ solution . \n figure [ fig : landas ] shows the variation of the mean and rms errors with the number of wavelength samples , for the los velocity ( top ) , field strength ( middle ) , and field inclination ( bottom ) . \n only pixels whose stokes @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 amplitudes are larger than three times the noise level have been considered for the magnetic parameters . \n the results are somewhat surprising . \n we find that the mean and rms errors of the velocity do not change much with the number of samples if the line is observed in at least three wavelength positions . in that case , the mean and rms errors are about 10 and 50  m / s , respectively . \n the field strength and field inclination errors do not change either with the number of samples , provided it is larger than 3 . \n the reason for such a behavior is the strong smearing of the stokes profiles after the instrument action . \n no conspicuous details remain that can be detected by five or six samples better than by just three . \n it is important to remark , however , that the sampling will further reduce the number of detectable profiles over those shown in fig .  [ \n fig : filtro2 ] , since in general the observed wavelength positions will not coincide with the maximum stokes @xmath3 or @xmath4 signals . \n figure  [ fig : mapas ] is a graphical illustration of the kind of results we can expect from the analysis of vim measurements . \n the upper panels show a cut of the atmospheres provided by the mhd simulations at optical depth @xmath11 . \n the second row display the _ reference _ solution , i.e. , the results of me inversions of the spatially degraded stokes profiles with no noise , no spectral psf , and 61 wavelength samples . \n the third row shows the atmospheric parameters derived from the me inversion in the specific case of five wavelength samples at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , 0 , 50 , and 100  m from line center plus the continuum , a snr of 1000 , and an instrumental profile width of 120  m . \n the last row shows the same parameters when the inversion is applied to the stokes profiles sampled at only three wavelength positions ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and 60  m ) plus the continuum , for a filter width of 120  m and a snr of 1000 . \n the various physical parameters are qualitatively well determined , although we observe some differences between the _ real _ and the inferred parameters . \n the magnetic field strength , for example , is not particularly well recovered inside the granules . there , the fields are weak and the corresponding polarization signals are strongly affected by the noise . in the inclination and azimuth maps \n we see regions fully dominated by noise . in general , however , the inversion algorithm is able to recover magnetic fields above 100  g with accuracy : _ pixels with weak fields are assigned weak fields , and pixels with strong fields get strong fields_. this is in contrast with the results of inversions of full stokes profiles of internetwork fields in the quiet sun at resolutions of 1(martnez gonzlez et al.2006 ) . \n velocities are less affected by noise . \n we find larger velocity errors in intergranular regions , probably due to the larger asymmetries exhibited by the stokes profiles in those regions , where vertical gradients are more pronounced . \n we have analyzed simulated vim - hrt observations to study the performance of the instrument . \n stokes profiles of the fe  i  617.3  nm line have been calculated using realistic mhd simulations of a quiet sun region at disk center and then spatially degraded by telescope diffraction and detector pixel size to match the vim - hrt resolution . \n additionally , we have convolved the profiles with spectral psfs of different widths ( from 0 to 200 m ) , added noise at the level of @xmath0 , and selected a few wavelength samples across the line . \n the instrumental filter width and the limited wavelength sampling influence the determination of vector magnetic fields and los velocities . \n however , the atmospheric parameters retrieved from vim - hrt measurements are reasonably accurate : me inversions of the stokes profiles broadened by a 120  m filter and sampled at three wavelength positions within the line plus a continuum point indicate rms errors of @xmath16  g , @xmath17  m / s and @xmath18 for snrs of 1000 . \n as expected , the rms errors are much smaller for fields stronger than 750  g.    the results of me inversions seem to be accurate enough even with filters as wide as 120  m fwhm and four wavelength samples . \n this may allow both a significant reduction of the mass of vim and better signal - to - noise ratios through longer exposure times . \n there are some drawbacks in using broad filters and few wavelength samples , however . \n they include the decrease of the number of detectable polarization signals and the reduction of the dynamical range the instrument is able to cope with . \n such effects are important and have to be investigated in detail . \n we also note that the observation of only four wavelength samples may prevent estimates of the magnetic filling factor from being made , although our tests show that unity filling factors produce good results with high spatial resolution data . \n this work has been partially funded by the spanish ministerio de educacin y ciencia through project esp2003 - 07735-c04 - 03 ( including european feder funds ) and _ programa ramn y cajal_.", "StartTimeOffset": 3536886440568, "RequestID": "3795005568d81a6b56aefb5e9cdd64572667c8b8", "TotalTokens": 4155}

percent level even if no additional new particles are to be found at the lhc  @xcite . \n since the branching ratio measurement is used as an input in the extraction of the yukawa coupling , a precise determination of the branching ratio is essential to probe new physics .    in this study , we focus on the branching ratio of the higgs boson decaying into tau lepton pairs . \n the mass of the tau lepton is known to a very good precision unlike quarks , which typically suffer from the theoretical uncertainties arising from qcd . \n also , the deviation in the lepton yukawa coupling could well differ from the quark yukawa coupling , such as in the lepton - specific two - higgs doublet model . \n thus , the tau yukawa coupling is an ideal probe for new physics .    in this study \n , we estimate the measurement accuracy @xmath5 of the @xmath7 branching ratio at the center -

induced @xmath22 interactions are included . \n but at the @xmath11 gev , the numbers of hadrons are estimated to be small  @xcite . \n therefore , we do not apply any special treatment to eliminate these hadrons . \n the event reconstruction is consisted of three steps ; ( 1 ) tau reconstruction , ( 2 ) collinear approximation , and ( 3 ) @xmath9 boson reconstruction .    first , we apply tau finder . \n our tau finder searches for charged track which have highest energy among the remaining particles , and combines the neighboring particles which satisfy @xmath23 , with the combined mass less than 2 gev , where @xmath24 is the cone angle with respect to the highest energy charged track . \n the combined object is regarded as a tau candidate . \n then , we apply the selection cuts to tau candidates as following ; discard the candidates which categorized into 3-prong with neutral particles , @xmath25 gev where @xmath26 is the energy of tau candidate , and satisfy @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cone energy of a tau candidate with the cone angle of @xmath30 , and @xmath30 is the cone angle with respect to a tau candidate , respectively . \n these selections are tuned to minimize the misidentification of fragments of quark jets as tau decays . \n after the selection , we apply the charge recovery process to obtain better efficiency . \n the charged particles in a tau candidate which have the energy less than 2 gev are detached one by one , the one with the smallest energy first , until satisfying the following conditions ; the charge of a tau candidate is exactly equal to @xmath31 , and the number of track(s ) in a tau candidate is exactly equal to 1 or 3 . \n the tau candidate after the detaching is rejected if it does not satisfy the above conditions , and remaining candidate is regarded as a tau jet . \n we repeat the above processes until there are no charged particles which have the energy greater than 2 gev .    after finishing the tau reconstruction , \n we apply the collinear approximation  @xcite to reconstruct the invariant mass of tau pair system . in this approximation \n , we assume that the visible decay products of the tau lepton and the neutrino(s ) from the tau decay is collinear , and the contribution of the missing transverse momentum comes only from the neutrino(s ) from tau decay . \n after the approximation , we apply the durham jet clustering  @xcite with two jets for the remaining objects to reconstruct @xmath9 boson . \n before optimizing the cuts , we apply preselection cuts as following ;    * the number of reconstructed @xmath32 and @xmath33 are exactly equal to one , * the number of reconstructed jet is exactly equal to two , * the number of track in an event is greater or equal to nine , * @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the invariant mass ( energy ) of tau pair with collinear approximation in the unit of gev . \n in addition , we apply the following cuts to suppress the trivial backgrounds ;    * @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the visible energy ( mass ) in the unit of gev , * @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sum of the magnitude of the transverse momentum of each particle in the unit of gev , * the thrust in an event should be less than @xmath42 , * @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two jets in the unit of gev , * @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angle between two jets , * @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two taus without collinear approximation in the unit of gev , * @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angle between two taus , * @xmath53 and @xmath54 , * @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the recoil mass against @xmath9 boson . \n we only use the events passed the preselection and cuts above for the optimization of event selection . \n we perform the cut - based analysis and multivariate analysis both . \n the optimization is performed to maximize the signal statistical significance of @xmath57 , where s(b ) is the number of signal(background ) . \n we apply the following cuts sequentially to extract maximum signal significance ;    * @xmath58 gev , * @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle between missing momentum in an event and beam axis , * @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 gev , * @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 , * @xmath66 gev , @xmath67 gev , * @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the impact parameter @xmath70 ( @xmath71-plane ) divided by the error of @xmath70 for @xmath32 , * @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the impact parameter @xmath74 ( @xmath75-plane ) divided by the error of @xmath74 for @xmath32 , * @xmath76 gev . \n figure  [ mass_colapp ] shows the @xmath77 distribution in the sequential cuts . \n after all cuts above , the signal events of 1002 and the background events of 535.4 are remained . \n the statistical significance is calculated to be @xmath78 . \n this result corresponds to the precision of @xmath79 . \n we use the tmva package in root  @xcite and use the gradient boosted decision tree ( bdtg ) technique for the analysis tool . \n we use the following 17 variables as the inputs ;    * three variables from the overall event : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , where @xmath81 is the magnitude of the transverse momentum calculated from the momentum vector of all visible particles in an event , * three variables from reconstructed jets and @xmath9 boson : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the angle between the momentum of reconstructed @xmath9 boson and beam axis , * seven variables from reconstructed taus : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the acoplanarity angle between two taus , @xmath95 is the angle between the momentum of reconstructed higgs boson without collinear approximation and beam axis , * three variables from collinear approximation : @xmath77 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the angle between reconstructed higgs momentum and beam axis with collinear approximation , * one from recoil mass : @xmath56 . \n figure  [ bdtg_qqh250 ] shows the response of the multivariate classifier . \n the number of events surviving the event selection is 1205 for the signal and 521.4 for the background . \n the signal significance is calculated to be @xmath99 , which implies a precision of @xmath100 . \n the result of the multivariate analysis improved by @xmath101 than the cut - based analysis . \n we previously performed the analysis with fully simulated samples at @xmath11 gev , and the results are written in ref  @xcite . in ref \n @xcite , the analysis had been performed with the condition of higgs mass of 120 gev , and analyzed three signal modes : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . the combined result with the extrapolation to the higgs mass of 125 \n gev was @xmath105 . \n the results described in section 5 are much better than previous study , even the cross section and the branching ratio of @xmath7  @xcite are worse than the case of higgs mass of 120 gev and only using @xmath102 mode \n . these differences mainly come from the mass difference between @xmath9 boson and higgs boson , and the difference of analysis technique . \n now we can apply tighter cuts in the recoil mass against @xmath9 boson than previously , because the peak of recoil mass shifted from 120 gev to 125 gev . \n this difference introduces good separation power between signal and background . besides \n , we only had been performed cut - based analysis in previous . \n the cut - based analysis is very simple and easy to understand , but difficult to get better precision . \n the multivariate analysis gives us much better results than the cut -

[ figsed ] ) . in the case of large opacities , \n the estimated sizes of the dust emission regions vary from 0.2 pc for the hottest component ( 1000 k ) , to @xmath7500 pc for the coldest one ( 20 k ) , and in the case of low opacities , the minimum estimated size is 0.3 pc , and the maximum 20 kpc . the comparison between the temperatures and sizes measured in the two extreme regimes , and the observed values in seyfert galaxies suggests that the cold dust is characterized by low opacity , while the warm / hot dust may be more opaque . as a consequence , the ir reradiation at long wavelengths ( t @xmath8 60 k ) will be isotropic , and orientation - independent . \n conversely , at shorter wavelengths ( t @xmath9 60 k ) the dust may self - absorb its emitted radiation , and the observed emission may depend on orientation . \n the steepness of the power law obtained by fitting all the ir data at wavelengths shorter than 60 @xmath0 m , where the effects of opacity become important , is an indicator of dust extinction . we compared the balmer decrement values ( h@xmath10/h@xmath11 ) , indicators of extinction at optical wavelengths , of the nls1 galaxies studied here with the slope of the power law obtained by fitting the observed data between 3 and 60 @xmath0 m ( see best - fit power laws in fig . \n [ figsed ] ) . \n the measured power law slopes range between 0.99 and 1.77 , which corresponds to a range in the visual extinction of 61 mag , provided that all objects have the same intrinsic ir power law . \n the variation in the h@xmath10/h@xmath11 values corresponds instead to a range in the visual extinction of only 2.8 mag . \n such a difference indicates that all the emitting dust can not be responsible for the reddening observed in the balmer lines . \n however , the two parameters , h@xmath10/h@xmath11 , and @xmath12 , are strongly correlated ( the spearman s correlation rank is 1.0 , with a null associated probability to obtain such a value from uncorrelated values ) . \n the corresponding values and their linear interpolation are shown in fig . \n [ red_ir]a , with filled diamonds and a dashed line , respectively . \n we selected 12 additional nls1 galaxies from a sample of 148 objects for which the balmer decrement and the ir spectrum were measured . \n the observed correlation is still present for the additional 12 nls1 galaxies ( the spearman s correlation rank is 0.61 , and the probability to obtain such a value from uncorrelated values is 1.13% ) , as shown in fig . \n [ red_ir]a ( the solid line represents the best fit line obtained considering all the 16 nls1 galaxies which are marked by empty diamonds ) . a correlation between @xmath12 and the line intensity ratio \n [ oiii]/h@xmath11 was also discovered ( see fig .  [ \n red_ir]b ) . \n the corresponding spearman s coefficient rank is 0.78 , and the probability to obtain such a value from uncorrelated values is 0.04% . \n + the steepening of the ir power law and the enhancement of the balmer decrement and of the line ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath13 can be interpreted in terms of inclination - dependent obscuration . \n the central regions of these objects are probably surrounded by a distribution of dust that becomes gradually less opaque along some directions . \n the blr must be more extended than the inner hot dust , since its emission is less absorbed than the  broad \" lines . towards the direction where dust is less opaque \n , the blr and the hottest dust component will be directly visible , while towards the direction where dust is more opaque , the broad emission lines and the hottest dust radiation will be partially absorbed . since the h@xmath11 emission is produced in both the blr and in the narrow line region , when the blr is obscured the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath11 will be higher than in unobscured objects . \n 999 r. barvainis , _ apj _ * 353 * ( 1990 ) 419 t. boller , j. trmper , s. molendi et  al . , \n _ a&a _ * 279 * ( 1993 ) 53 j. clavel , w. wamsteker and i. glass 1989 , _ apj _ * 337 * ( 1989 ) 236 a. comastri , f. fiore , m. guainazzi et  al . , _ a&a _ * 333 * ( 1998 ) 31 w.k . gear w.k . \n 1988 , _ millimetre and submillimetre astronomy _ ( 1988 ) , r.d . \n wolstencroft and w.b . \n burton ( eds . ) r.w . \n goodrich 1989 , _ apj _ * 342 * ( 1989 ) 224 d. grupe ( 1996 ) ph.d . \n thesis , gttingen university s. komossa and j. greiner 1998 , proc . of high energy processes in accreting black holes ( 1998 ) , j. poutanen and r. svensson ( eds ) p. miller , s. rawlings , r. saunders and s. eales _ mnras _ * 254 * ( 1992 ) 93 m. polletta and t.j .- l . \n courvoisier , _ a&a _ * 350 * ( 1999 ) 765 p.m. rodrguez - pascual , j.m . \n mas - hesse and m. santos - lle , _ \n a&a _ * 37 * ( 1997 ) 72 j.s . \n ulvestad , r.r.j . \n antonucci and r.w . \n goodrich , _ aj _ * 109 * ( 1995 ) 81", "StartTimeOffset": 3598150835793, "RequestID": "cbd10823d22abade3759881029b70d8f513bcb03", "TotalTokens": 1982}

abazajian et  al . \n 2003 ) . \n we begin with the 153,000 galaxy and quasar spectra from the dr1 . \n we use the principal component analysis code of hao ( 2004 ) to model and remove contaminating starlight . \n we then select all broad - line agn with @xmath16 based on the presence of broad h@xmath17  emission ( ho et  al . \n we estimate bh `` virial '' masses using a variant of the empirically determined linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation of kaspi et al . \n ( 2000 ) , which relates @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the agn luminosity at 5100   and @xmath20 is the fwhm of ( typically ) broad h@xmath9 . to determine @xmath21 we use the stronger h@xmath17  as a surrogate . to properly deconvolve the narrow components of the h@xmath17+[nii ]  complex we model the [ s  ii ] @xmath226716 , 6731 doublet with a superposition of gaussian components and \n then scale this model to fit the complex ( ho et al . \n the continuum luminosity is derived from a power - law fit ( see fig . \n [ obj5 ] ) . from the sample of objects with @xmath23@xmath24  @xmath7  we \n remove all objects with a stellar continuum @xmath25 of the total continuum , due to unreliable h@xmath17  fwhm measurements . \n the final sample of 19 objects has a mass distribution shown in fig . \n [ bhmass ] ( for details see greene & ho 2004 ) . \n -0.1 mm    -3 mm \n our objects are analogous to the class of agns known as narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1 ) , which are thought to possess relatively low - mass bhs emitting at a high fraction of their eddington rates ( e.g. , boroson 2002 ) . by the linewidth criterion , \n all of the objects would technically qualify as `` narrow - line '' sources : the broad h@xmath17  component has fwhm ranging from 464 to 1730 km s@xmath12 . in keeping with expectation the derived eddington ratios mostly cluster around @xmath26 ( fig . \n [ bhmass ] ) . \n we caution that these values were derived assuming a single bolometric correction of @xmath27 = 9.8@xmath28  ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) although the spectral energy distributions of agns are known to vary significantly with accretion rate ( pounds et al . \n 1995 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3442, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to investigate dynamic magnetic phenomena . \n its power is significantly increased by numerous extensions which were added to the basic spectroscopic setup over time .    by introducing time - resolution \n , it was possible to investigate the evolution of a parametrically excited magnon gas in a ferrite film and observe the formation of a bose - einstein condensate of magnons at room temperature @xcite . \n the inclusion of space - resolution led to the discovery of important nonlinear wave phenomena such as soliton and bullet formation @xcite , the observation of spin - wave tunneling @xcite as well as spin - wave quantisation in nanoscaled structures @xcite . \n other discussed extensions comprise phase- @xcite and wave - vector resolution @xcite . \n the latter is particularly interesting since the frequency does usually not uniquely identify a wave eigenmode . due to an often complex dispersion relation the additional knowledge of the wave vector is essential .    for the investigation of spin waves in ferrite films by bls , \n wave - vector resolution was already introduced in the late 70 s @xcite . \n subsequently , many studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have copied the originally presented principle : to the bls setup in forward scattering geometry a diaphragm is added in the beam path after the sample stage ( see fig .  [ \n fig : aufbau ] ) . depending on the shape and position of the hole in the diaphragm , \n some components of the scattered laser beam which correspond to certain in - plane wave vectors are blocked while others can pass and are detected . \n the latest success of this technique was the time- and wave - vector resolved observation of a parametrically pumped magnon gas after pumping was switched off @xcite . \n it is of crucial importance for an accurate measurement of the in - plane wave - vector to calibrate the position of the diaphragm hole . \n the zero position when the elastically scattered beam passes through the diaphragm can be adjusted by sight , however this procedure is inevitably inaccurate . \n a second possibility is to calibrate the position based on the measured data : stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum lead to two distinct signals with opposing wave vectors . \n their symmetric position with respect to the center can in special cases be used for calibration . \n however , the intensities of stokes and anti - stokes peaks can differ greatly which makes this procedure difficult . \n moreover , it is unnecessarily time - consuming since the weaker of the two signal peaks determines the accuracy of the calibration and , therefore , the required measurement time though in many cases it does not yield any additional physical information about the system under investigation . \n the approach presented here uses an intrinsic calibration which is achieved by placing an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) in the optical path behind the laser light source . the small amount of modulated , frequency - shifted light plays the role of a reference beam for the wave - vector resolution . since it follows the same path as the unshifted laser light scattered inelastically from the sample but does ( in first approximation ) not undergo any inelastic scattering in the sample itself , it indicates the position where the in - plane wave vector vanishes for the measurement . \n the proposed calibration procedure has two major advantages . \n first of all , it is applicable even when one of the two signals form stokes and anti - stokes scattering is not large enough to be observed . \n this is in particular the case for surface magnetostatic spin waves . \n secondly , it potentially decreases the measurement time since the wave vector scanning does not have to be performed over the whole range of wave vectors but can ( if a symmetry is already known ) be restricted to one of the symmetric parts .    to test the validity of the presented method the in - plane wave vectors of propagating , dipole - dominated spin waves were resolved . \n the obtained results are in good quantitative agreement with theory . \n it should be remarked that electro - optical modulators have already been used to realize phase resolution @xcite and enhance the frequency resolution @xcite . \n this work adds to their increasing role for the improvement of the brillouin light scattering setup . \n the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : aufbau ] . \n the sample under investigation consisted of a @xmath0 thick yttrium - iron - garnet ( yig ) film which was tangentially magnetized by a magnetic field @xmath1 ( indicated by two pole pieces in fig . \n [ fig : aufbau ] ) . to a microstrip transducer on the surface of the yig stripe \n a @xmath2 long microwave pulse with @xmath3 carrier frequency was supplied with a @xmath4 repetition rate . \n the configuration was chosen in such a way that the microwave pulse excites a packet of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves ( bvmsw ) which propagates in the film in the direction of the bias magnetic field @xcite . \n thus , the in - plane wave vector of the excited spin waves has a well defined , unique non - zero component . \n the measurements discussed below focus on determining the wave number of this wave .    to detect the spin - wave packet light from a single mode , \n frequency - stabilized @xmath5 laser was focused on the sample close to the antenna . \n the transmitted light was sent to a ( 3 + 3)-pass tandem fabry - prot interferometer where the frequency of the light inelastically scattered from the spin waves was resolved . \n a good description of the underlying bls setup is found in @xcite . \n the existing bls setup already includes time- and space resolution in the following way : in order to probe different points of the sample , the sample is mounted on a stage which can be moved by a stepper motor . \n time resolution is achieved by measuring the time between the launch of the microwave signal pulse which excites the spin - wave packet and the detection of the scattered photons by the detector . in the current setup \n the time resolution is limited to @xmath6 due to the finesse of the fabry - prot etalons . \n a detailed account is given in @xcite . \n wave - vector resolution was added to the existing setup by placing a diaphragm with a central hole of @xmath7 diameter in the focal plane behind the collection lens . \n the diaphragm was mounted on a stage which was horizontally movable by a pc - controlled stepper motor . \n the stage was moved in steps of size @xmath8 . since the investigated spin waves possessed only one non - vanishing in - plane component of the wave - vector the chosen one - dimensional approach is sufficient for demonstration . to measure both in - plane wave - vector components an additional stage for the vertical displacement of the diaphragm \n will be added . \n the measurement principle remains , however , unchanged .    to calibrate the diaphragm position , \n an eom was placed in the beam path in front of the sample ( see fig . \n [ fig : aufbau ] ) . \n it was driven by a @xmath2 long pulse from the same microwave source that generated the spin - wave pulse . however , the eom - pulse was delayed compared to the spin - wave pulse in order to make eom and spin - wave signal clearly distinguishable in the time - resolved measurements . \n since the same microwave frequency is applied to the eom and the microstrip transducer which excites the spin waves , the resulting signal peaks in the bls spectrum coincide . \n this has two practical advantages . \n first of all , the frequency interval which is effectively scanned by the interferometer can be small . \n this reduces the overall measurement time which is particularly important for wave - vector resolved measurements . \n secondly , the eom - signal can be used as a frequency reference @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : measurement ] shows the intensity of the detected bls signal relative to the elapsed time and the displacement of the diaphragm from its initial ( arbitrary ) position . \n three signals are clearly distinguishable :    in the time interval marked in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] as @xmath9 the signal from the eom - pulse is seen . \n the time interval @xmath10 contains two signals which both stem from the propagating spin - wave packet . \n they correspond to the stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum . \n this was checked by restricting the bls measurement once to the stokes and once to the anti - stokes peak ( see inset in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] ) . \n in particular , the position of the signals corresponding to stokes and anti - stokes bls peaks exchanged their positions when the laser beam was focused on the other side of the exciting microstrip antenna where the spin - wave packet travels in the opposite direction and the spin - wave wave vector , therefore , changes sign .    to increase the signal to noise ratio \n the received counts were integrated over the time intervals @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . \n the resulting intensity distribution , which depends only on the diaphragm displacement , is shown in fig . \n [ fig : shapes ] . \n it is relatively wide because of the comparatively large pin hole in the diaphragm . \n however , this trade - off was accepted to decrease the measurement time . by fitting the experimental data with a single gaussian distribution for the eom - signal and two independent gaussian distributions with the same variance for the spin - wave signal \n , the accuracy of the measurement was enhanced . as can be seen from fig . \n [ fig : shapes ] , the fits agree well with the experimental data . \n the center of the gaussian profile which fits the eom - signal was used to calibrate the diaphragm displacement and obtain the @xmath11position for the diaphragm . \n relative to this position the deflection @xmath12 of the beam which was inelastically scattered on the spin - wave packet was determined . \n measurements were performed for different magnetic fields with the same spin - wave carrier frequency @xmath3 . \n the results are presented in fig . \n [ fig : field ] . figure  [ fig : field](a ) shows extracts corresponding to the interval @xmath10 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] which contains the information on the spin - wave wave vector . in accordance with theory an almost linear field dependence \n is seen @xcite .    in order to unambiguously resolve the signals corresponding to the stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum , \n separate measurements were conducted by limiting the spectral scanning to one of the two spectral positions ( panel ( b ) ) .    from the data , \n the spin - wave wave number @xmath13 is obtained using the bragg - condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave number of the incoming laser light and @xmath16 is the angle between the elastically and inelastically scattered light which is determined by the focal length @xmath17 of the collection length and the measured deflection @xmath12 of the spin - wave signal . \n the experimentally found spin - wave numbers @xmath13 are combined in fig . \n [ fig : field](c ) with theoretical calculations based on the damon - eshbach formula for the lowest order bvmsw mode @xcite . \n the solid line has been calculated based on the measured field value , a film thickness of @xmath0 and a saturation magnetisation @xmath18 . in comparison , \n the dashed line is the result of a fit , where the film thickness and the magnetic field were taken as fit parameters . \n the optimal value found for the thickness was @xmath19 , the magnetic field was adjusted by a shift @xmath20 relative to the experimentally measured field @xmath1 . \n both deviations are within reasonable range . \n the film thickness is not known with sufficient accuracy and is in general assumed as a fit parameter . \n the experimentally measured magnetic field does not take into account any contributions from the crystalline anisotropy . \n overall , the theoretical curves agree well with experiment . \n the measurements indicate that the film thickness at the point of the laser focus was less than the nominal @xmath0 . \n the presented results confirm the validity of the eom - assisted wave - vector resolution measurement procedure . \n the eom allows an easy , intrinsic calibration with the same resolution as the actual measurement . \n the calibration does not rely on any symmetry in the observed peaks and can be performed even when the scanning is restricted to one side of the bls spectrum . \n the widely adjustable intensity of the eom beam guarantees a minimal expenditure of time to obtain a large enough signal for the analysis .    in principle \n , the eom beam can be used to calibrate the diaphragm prior to the experiment . \n instead , in the presented work the eom reference was applied parallel to the actual measurement . \n this is a natural solution whenever the pulse regime is required because of other experimental restrictions . \n the reference eom beam is applied during the dead time of the cycle so that the overall duration of the experiment is not increased and measurement as well as calibration are completed in a single run . \n the experiments confirmed the applicability of the diaphragm - based approach to wave - vector resolution for the measurement of small wave numbers . \n the method is not the only way to go in this regime . \n it is also possible to measure the spin - wave wavelength by using phase resolution @xcite . \n however , this method relies on the scanning of the sample which does , in terms of measurement time not yield any advantages . \n moreover , it is only applicable in the case of a single spin wave propagating under homogeneous external conditions - fast temporal or spatial variations of the wave number can not be resolved . \n the same draw - backs apply to other interference - based methods using , for instance , inductive probes .    for the diaphragm - approach these limitations do not apply : since the method relies on the measurement at a single point on the sample , inhomogeneities in the sample do not play any role . \n as has been seen above , it is even possible to distinguish waves with the same wave - number modulus but travelling in opposite directions .    in combination with the time - resolution it is possible to resolve the wave - number evolution . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fourier ] where the measured wave vector distribution for different time intervals is presented when the front of the spin - wave packet passed the laser spot .    the integrated signal from the interval marked as @xmath21 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] is presented in panel  ( i ) . \n the observed peak with an experimentally measured wave number of @xmath22 corresponds to the thermally excited uniform mode in the sample . \n panels  ( ii)-(iv ) contain the measured wave - vector distributions for three consecutive , @xmath23 long time intervals at the moment when the front of the pulse passed the laser spot and was detected . \n these time slices are taken from the interval denoted by @xmath24 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] . \n panel  ( v ) finally shows the wave - vector distribution for interval @xmath10 when the measured signal intensity and the wave - vector distribution have reached a stable regime . by comparing the panels , the different wave - number contributions at the front of the pulse due to the dispersion of the spin - wave packet can be distinguished . \n it is in qualitative agreement with the phase profile of a linear spin - wave packet , which exhibits characteristic distortions at the front and end of the pulse @xcite . \n in conclusion , we have improved the existing wave - vector resolution used in brillouin light scattering experiments by including an electro - optical modulator as a reference to calibrate the position of the diaphragm hole . \n the eom beam makes it possible to determine the position where the in - plane wave vector vanishes with an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the actual wave - vector measurement itself . for experiments conducted in the pulse regime , the proposed method does not increase the measurement time but even cuts it in half under optimum conditions . \n the applicability of the eom - based calibration was tested by measuring the wave vectors of a propagating packet of dipole - dominated spin - waves for different bias magnetic fields with time resolution . \n comparison with the established theory showed a good agreement . \n this work has been financially supported by the matcor graduate school of excellence , the graduiertenkolleg 792 , and the dfg within the sfb / trr 49 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3658091441410, "RequestID": "5c7ce3367529940ebe78622a0dd7db2921eaebe1", "TotalTokens": 3569}

k)= [ c_ir^i(k),c_is^j(k)^]_+    clearly such a structure for the vacuum eventually reduces to a bogoliubov transformation for the operators . \n one can then calculate the energy density functional given as    _ 0 f(h(k),f(k ) )    the condensate functions @xmath11 and @xmath8 are to be determined such that the energy density @xmath12 is a minimum . since the functions can not be determined analytically through functional minimisation except for a few simple cases @xcite , we choose the alternative approach of parameterising the condensate functions as ( with @xmath13 ) , f(k)=ae^-bk^2/2 this corresponds to taking a gaussian distribution for the perturbative gluons in the nonperturbative vacuum . \n similarly , for the function @xmath8 describing the quark antiquark condensates we take the ansatz , 2h(k)= [ ansatz ] further one could relate the quark condensate function to the wave function of pion as a quark antiquark bound state @xcite and hence to the decay constant of pion .    in ref . \n @xcite the energy density is minimised with respect to the condensate parameters subjected to the constraints that the pion decay constant f@xmath14 and the gluon condensate value @xmath15 of shifman vainshtein and zhakarov @xcite come out as the experimental value of 93 mev and 0.012 @xmath16 respectively . \n the results of such a minimisation showed the instability of the perturbative vacuum to formation of quark antiquark as well as gluon condensates when the coupling became greater than 0.6 . further the charge radius for \n the pion comes out correctly ( @xmath17 fm ) for @xmath18 . \n the corresponding values of a@xmath19 and r of eq . \n ( [ ansatz ] ) are calculated to be @xmath20 and @xmath21 fm .    with the structure of qcd vacuum thus fixed from pionic properties and svz value we consider the meson correlators in the next section . \n consider a generic meson current of the form j(x ) = |_^i(x ) _ _ ^j(x ) [ current ] where @xmath22is a four vector ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are spinor indices ; i and j are flavour indices ; @xmath25 is a @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 or @xmath28    because of the homogeneity of the vacuum we define the conjugate current to the above at the origin as , |j(0 ) = |_^j(0 ) _ ^ _ ^i(0 ) [ currentbar ] with @xmath29    the meson correlation function for the above currents is defined as , r(x ) = < t j(x ) |j(0 ) > _ vac [ cordef ]    from now on we assume that expectation values are always with respect to the nonperturbative vacuum of our model , hence we drop the subscript @xmath30 .    hence with eqs . \n ( [ current ] ) , ( [ currentbar ] ) and ( [ cordef ] ) we have r(x ) = _ _ ^ < t |_^i(x ) _ \n ^j(x ) |_^j(0 ) _ ^i(0 ) > [ cordef1 ] \n this reduces to the identity r(x ) = _ _ ^ \n < t _ ^j(x ) |_^j(0 ) > < t |_^i(x ) _ \n ^i(0 ) > [ cordef2 ]    the above definition of @xmath31 is exact since the four point function does not contribute . \n in fact , in the evaluation of eq . \n ( [ cordef1 ] ) we shall have a sum of two terms . \n the first is equivalent to the product of two point functions which is eq . \n ( [ cordef2 ] ) . \n the second term arises from contraction of operators at the same spatial point , related to disconnected diagrams and thus can be discarded .    in eq . \n ( [ cordef2 ] ) the first term can be identified as the interacting quark propagator @xmath32 it can be shown using the cpt invariance of the vacuum @xcite that the second term is given as    & = & - _ 5 s(x ) _ 5 + & = & - s(-x ) \n hence the correlation function of eq . \n ( [ cordef1 ] ) becomes r(x ) = - tr [ cordef3 ]    similarly the correlator for massless noninteracting quarks can be given as    r_0(x ) = - tr    our task is now to evaluate the expression ( [ cordef3 ] ) with the ansatz for qcd vacuum as given in eq . \n ( [ ansatz ] ) . \n further we shall be interested in evaluating the equal time point to point correlation functions . with this in mind \n we first calculate the equal time interacting feynman propagator in this nonperturbative vacuum given as @xcite    s_(x ) =    remembering that the expectation value is with respect to the @xmath33 as given in eq . \n ( [ vacp ] ) , the above propagator reduces to s(x ) = e^ik .x dk [ corint ]    in evaluating the above we have used the expectation values    = ( 2)^-3^ij ( _ -(k ) ) _ \n e^-ik .(x - y)dk [ jpj ] = ( 2)^-3^ij \n ( _ + ( k ) ) _ e^ik .(x - y)dk [ jjp ]    where , _ ( k)=(1 ^0 2 h(k ) ( k )  2 h(k ) )    we next use the condensate function as given in eq . \n ( [ ansatz ] ) to evaluate eq . \n ( [ corint ] ) . here \n we shall take the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 fm which give the correct pionic properties @xcite . then the equal time interacting quark propagator eq . \n ( [ corint ] ) reduces to , with @xmath36 ,    s(x ) = - + e^-x^2 / ( 2r^2 ) - i(x )    where \n i(x ) = _ 0^ ( k x - ) dk [ integral ]    we may further note that when @xmath37 i.e the condensates vanish , we recover the free massless propagator    s_0(x ) & = & - dk k e^ik .x   + & = & -    having obtained the propagators , we can calculate the correlation function , eq . \n ( [ cordef3 ] ) for a generic current of the form as in eqs . \n ( [ current ] ) and ( [ currentbar ] ) . for convenience \n , we will consider the ratio of the physical correlation function to that of massless noninteracting quarks    = ( 1 + x^2 i(x ) ) ^2 + e^-x^2/r^2 [ gencor ] which is then evaluated in different channels with the corresponding dirac structure for the currents . \n we have studied the above ratio of correlators for four channels . in each channel \n we associate the current with a physical meson having quantum numbers identical to that of the current . \n the results are shown in table  [ table1 ] and in fig  [ exactfigure ] . \n we may notice some general features and relationships among the correlators . \n the pseudoscalar correlator is always greater than the scalar correlator and vector correlator is greater than the axial vector correlator . \n we may emphasize here that these relations are rather general in the sense that they do not depend on the _ explicit _ form of the condensate function and arise due to the different dirac structure of the currents which is reflected in the generic expression for the correlation functions as in eq . \n ( [ gencor ] ) . \n the behaviour of each channel is consistent with that predicted by phenomenology except in the pseudoscalar case where the ratio does not go as high as expected from phenomenology . \n we examine this in the next section . \n the explicit evaluation of the pseudoscalar correlator gives , using eq . \n ( [ gencor ] ) = ^2 + e^-x^2/r^2 which may also be read off from column 4 of table  [ table1 ] . \n this is plotted as a function of @xmath38 in ( fig . \n [ exactfigure ] ) . as may be seen from ( fig . \n [ exactfigure ] ) this ratio has a maximum of @xmath39 1.2 at @xmath40 1.3 fm . \n phenomenologically @xcite the peak is at @xmath39 100 at @xmath40 0.5 . in order to compare our results with other calculations \n we evaluate the same correlator approximately by saturating intermediate states with one pion states . \n using translational invariance the correlator may be written as    r(x ) & = & < t j^p(x ) |j^p(0 ) > + & = & ( < j^p(0 ) |j^p(0 ) > \n x + < |j^p(0 ) j^p(0 ) > e^- i p . \n x )    also using the fact that for the pseudoscalar current @xmath41 and @xmath42 we have    r(x ) = < j^p(0 ) |j^p(0 ) > ( e^i p . \n x + e^- i p . \n x )    we now insert a complete set of intermediate states between the two currents but retain only the one pion state in the sum for the four point function . \n thus ,    r(x ) = < ^a(p ) |j^p(0 ) vac > ( e^i p . \n x + e^- i p . \n x ) dp    we may evaluate the above matrix element using the definition of the pion decay constant given as @xcite = e^i p x [ pdecay ]    where @xmath43 $ ] is the axial current . \n it can be shown @xcite that the divergence of the axial current gives the pseudoscalar current    _ [ |^ ^5 ^a ] = 2 i m_q [ |^5 ^a ] [ dividentity ] where @xmath44 is the current quark mass . thus taking divergence of both sides of eq . \n ( [ pdecay ] ) and using eq.([dividentity ] ) we get , 2 m_q < vac i j^pa(x ) ^a(p ) > = e^i p x [ divdecay ]    where we have used @xmath45 .    in an earlier paper @xcite within our vacuum model and using the fact that pion is an approximate goldstone mode it was demonstrated that saturating with pion states , gives the familiar current algebra result    m^2 _ = - < | >    with this result we eliminate quark mass @xmath44 in eq . \n ( [ divdecay ] ) in favour of the quark condensate to get the relation    = e^i p x    the expression for the pseudoscalar correlator now becomes r(x ) = ( ) ^2 ( e^i p . \n x + e^- i p . \n x ) dp    the above integral can be evaluated using the standard integral @xcite @xmath46 for @xmath47 and in the limit @xmath48 . \n we then finally get for the correlator ( using saturation of pion states )    r(x ) = ( ) ^2 the correlator for free massless quarks as calculated in the earlier section for pseudoscalar is    r_0(x ) =    hence the ratio is = ( ) ^2 x^5 m _ \n k_1(m_x )    we have plotted in fig . \n [ satfigure ] this ratio for our value of @xmath0 and that used by shuryak @xcite . \n note that our value of @xmath49 is an output of the variational calculation consistent with low energy hadronic properties @xcite . \n we thus observe that the approximate calculation of the pseudoscalar correlator due to saturation with one pion states ( fig . \n [ satfigure](a ) ) yields higher values ( @xmath50 15 times more ) as compared to the exact calculations ( fig . \n [ exactfigure ] ) . thus the fermionic condensate model for qcd vacuum @xcite does not give as high values for the pseudoscalar correlator as required by phenomenological results . \n the value we have used for @xmath51 ( 190 mev)@xmath52 is smaller than shuryak s value of ( 307.4 mev)@xmath52 @xcite which appears in the parameterisation of the physical spectral density through the coupling constant @xcite . with his value of @xmath53 \n the ratio @xmath54 is shown in ( fig . \n [ satfigure](b ) ) which agrees with phenomenology . \n we have evaluated the mesonic correlators in this paper using a variational construct for the qcd vacuum . except for the pseudoscalar channel the results \n show qualitative agreement with phenomenological results @xcite . \n following shuryak @xcite , we also see that using current algebra approach the pseudoscalar correlator rises sharply with spatial separation . \n let us recall that the current algebra result also follows from the approximation of saturating by one pion states in the normalisation of the pion state @xcite . \n it might appear that by suitably changing the value of @xmath53 in the exact calculation one might be able to reproduce all the phenomenological results . \n actually we find that it is not so . \n in fact , it adversely affects the correlators in the other channel which can be seen in the exact expressions given in column 4 of table  [ table1 ] .    in view of these findings , it is not clear whether saturation of intermediate states by one pion states only in the evaluation of the correlator , is sufficiently well justified . we therefore think that a unified treatment of correlation functions in all the channels is still not available . \n dddd channel & current & particle & correlator + & & ( @xmath55,mass in mev ) & @xmath56 $ ] + & & & + & & & + pseudoscalar & @xmath41 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 ^ 2     + \\frac{\\pi}{8 } \\frac{x^6}{r^6 } e^{-x^2/r^2}$ ] + & & & + & & & + scalar & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath58 ^ 2     -

but also opinions or other types of information may be traded . the former define a market economy . \n there have been several proposals to model such markets , see , for example the review by farmer @xcite . \n most of the proposed models aim at reproducing the fat tails and volatility clustering in a stock or currency market @xcite . \n earlier we have proposed a market model (  fat cat \" model ) where agents trade products according to individual price estimates . \n these estimates were dynamically adjusted as a function of the trading encounters of each agent @xcite . \n the model mentioned above is one of many similar models that could be considered for such a market , each model being distinguished by a strategy that defines which product a buyer should select from a seller and how he should price it later . in the present paper \n we study the interplay of a few strategies . the relative performance of these strategies is quantified by the wealth of agents employing them . \n we organized the paper by first reviewing the  fat cat \" model in section ii . \n the extension of this model to the case of other strategies is described in section iii . \n then , in section iv we discuss how the model could be extended to cases where agents are able to change their strategies according to their performance and give our concluding remarks . \n we picture our model as a cartoon of the trading situations found in a real market . as shown in fig . \n 1 , this minimalistic model consists of a system where agents trade a set of @xmath0 different products . \n each agent @xmath1 is assigned one of three possible strategies selected to be either based on profit ( i.e.   greed \" , which is the strategy adopted in the original  fat cat \" model ) , on the need for a particular product , or on a random selection without regard to the level of profit or need .    other strategies could be explored ; for example , agents could act as  garbage collectors \" , buying whatever product has the lowest possible price . in this paper \n we limit ourselves to the three , probably most basic , strategies outlined in fig . 1 . \n each of the @xmath2 agents starts with @xmath3 units of goods . \n the goods are randomly selected , for each agent , among the @xmath0 different products . \n thereby we form the stock @xmath4 of each agent that together with some initial amount of money , @xmath5 define the initial state of the economy . \n we describe below the dynamics that arises from the interactions among these agents .    during the time evolution of the system \n , each agent @xmath1 has , at each time step , an amount of money @xmath6 , and a stock of the different products @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . \n the prices of the different items in the stock of agent @xmath1 are denoted @xmath9 which initially are taken to be integers uniformly drawn in the interval @xmath10 $ ] . in all cases \n we have verified that the evolution of the system does not depend on this particular choice . \n agents then meet and exchange products and adjust prices . \n price adjustment is such that large differences in pricing between agents are lowered , but also such that price differences are induced by some noise when they are small , as in real markets .    as in our simulations for the original  fat cat \" model , we assume that at each time step the following procedure takes place :    * * 1 * buyer @xmath11 and seller @xmath12 are selected at random among the @xmath2 agents . if the seller has no products to offer , then another seller is chosen . \n * * 2 * the buyer selects a product @xmath13 in the seller s stock according to his strategy @xmath14 . \n + \\i ) if strategy @xmath14 is  profit \" then he selects the product @xmath13 which maximizes @xmath15 , ( i.e. his profit ) . \n + \\ii ) if strategy @xmath14 is  need \" then he selects the product @xmath13 which he has the least in his stock ( minimizes @xmath16 ) . \n + \\iii ) if strategy @xmath14 is  random \" then he selects a random product @xmath13 in the seller s stock for which @xmath17 . + the selected product @xmath13 \n is called @xmath18 ( best buy ) . * * 3a * if the buyer does not have enough money , ( i.e. if @xmath19 , we return to the first step and choose a new pair of agents . * * 3b * if the buyer has enough money we proceed . \n + if @xmath20 , the transaction is performed at the seller s price . \n this means that we adjust : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . * * 3c * if @xmath25 , the transaction is not performed . in this case \n , the seller lowers his price by one unit , @xmath26 , and the buyer raises his price by one unit , + @xmath27 . \n the prices are always non - negative integers . also note that since , as defined in step 3 above , the price offered by the buyer can not be higher than the amount of money it has \n , we are not allowing for the agents to get into debt . in case \n there are several products that fulfill the selection criterion in 2 , a random one of these is chosen . \n one should emphasize that due to the price adjustments performed in unsuccessful encounters , the prices never reach equilibrium , and different agents typically assign different prices to the same product .    to quantify the system , \n we define the total wealth of an agent @xmath1 as the amount of money plus the value of all goods in the agent s possession : @xmath28 the value of product @xmath13 is defined as the average of what all agents consider its value to be : @xmath29 and the value of all of agent @xmath1 s goods , @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 the  fat cat \" model s  profit \" rule was studied extensively in our earlier paper . \n there it was found to lead to persistency and fat tails in the agents wealth fluctuations with time , hence its name . \n we now study the other strategies and their interactions . \n the three strategies given above lead to different wealth of the respective agents . \n we will now study this in some detail . \n our first step is to illustrate how the wealth of the agents gets distributed in a system where all agents employ the same strategy . for that purpose \n we consider a system composed of 50 agents , 50 different products . \n each agent is given 40 units of products and 20 units of money . \n the result , shown in fig . \n 2 , is that there are appreciable differences in the wealth distribution according to the strategy . for a profit - minded system ( the original  fat cat \" model ) , there is a long tail of wealthy agents , which becomes less pronounced when the strategy is based on the stock needs . in this case \n there are no rich agents , but instead a large concentration of middle - wealth agents . if the strategy adopted is to buy a random product , the long tail disappears and the middle - wealth peak is shifted to lower values than in the previous case . \n the situation can change when the economic conditions , as defined by the number of units of products and money in the economy , are changing . \n we will show that there is no best rule for all situations this is shown in fig . \n 3 , where we have changed the number of units of products , while keeping all other model values the same , in markets composed of equal numbers of agents employing two different strategies . in this case , where @xmath32 , each agent has a few of many possible products , thus representing an antique dealer market where there are many special items and no one can have everything . \n we see , in the upper panel , that for this market the  need \" strategy , is better than  profit \" above 10 units . however , below 10 units , the result is unstable , one strategy leading to better results than the other depending on the initial conditions . in the middle panel \n we see that the  random \" agents have a higher average wealth than the  profit \" motivated ones when the number of units is above 45 , the situation is reversed for a number of units below 35 , and there is unpredictability in between these two values . \n finally , the lower panel shows that  need \" works better than a  random \" strategy for all number of units in the range shown . for other parameter values \n , namely when the number of units of products and money is large , the  random \" strategy outperforms  need \" . \n in this last case , namely for @xmath33 , each agent typically has many copies of all products , which represent a mass production market with many copies of few items ; a supermarket world . in this case \n , a pairwise comparison of the three strategies shows an interesting situation , depicted in fig . 4 :  need \" outperforms  profit \" , which outperforms  random \" , which outperforms  need \" . \n so , in this case no strategy is better than both of the other strategies when studied pairwise .    in fig . \n 5 we explore the triple market further , implementing a market where there is only one agent with  need \" strategy among 25 agents with  profit \" and 25 agents with  noise \" as strategies , so that there are all together 51 agents . without the single  need \" strategy ,  random \n \" would outperform  profit \" with a large margin . \n a single  need \" agent in the system will slowly collect a large fraction of all products in the market . \n this is because it has a large competition advantage over the  profit \" , which overcompensates its disadvantage to the  random \" ones . if the number of  profit \" agents were reduced and that of the  random \" agents increased , the  need \" agent would do worse \n this illustrates the fact that the number of agents employing the different strategies is also determinant in the relative success of the agents adopting them . \n as we have seen , one may have different strategies for different agents . an interesting direction to extend \n this model is to let the agents to select the strategies they adopt in order to improve their performance . \n a further extension development would be to allow the strategies themselves to evolve . in the following \n we show a preliminary example of how the agents could choose strategies . \n a simple mechanism consists in updating , at fixed time intervals , the strategy of the poorest agent in the system . \n this agent just changes his present strategy to any of the other two , at random . the resulting time evolution for a system composed of 45 agents initially equally distributed according to their strategies is shown in fig . 6 . \n we see that , after an initial transient , the number of agents following the  need \" and  random \" strategies becomes approximately equal and constant for a considerable period of time , while the  profit \" strategy is followed by a small fraction of the agents . \n an increase in the  profit \" agents leads to a change in the conditions which lead the  random \" strategy to almost disappear from the system , to a dominance of  need \" , and the persistency of  profit \" at a very low level . from the fig . \n 4 we see that were it not for the existence of  profit \"- thinking agents ,  random \" would dominate over  need \" . \n the results shown in fig . \n 6 also demonstrate that the hierarchy  paper  stone  scissors \" illustrated in fig . \n 4 , for the same system , does not seem to lead , in the time interval considered , to alternations in the number of agents employing each strategy \n . there could be several reasons for this . \n one is that these changes take longer and longer time to alter enough the market conditions to significantly modify the performance of the different strategies . \n another is that while in fig . \n 4 one measures the average wealth of the agents using each of the three strategies , the criterium for changing strategies is based on the performance of poor agents , _ \n i.e. _ on the agents wealth distribution in the region close to the origin . as suggested by fig . \n 2 , a strategy yielding a higher average wealth than another , may also have a larger number of poor agents than the other . \n these issues need to be further explored for an appropriate strategy selection procedure and will be discussed in the future . \n compared to earlier models of market dynamics the model presented here has some new and related key features : there is local optimization of utility ( estimated market value ) and all trades are done locally without the equilibrizing effects of a global information pool . \n this gives arbitrage possibility which drives a dynamic and evolving market . \n earlier market models , such as the minority game , have a global information pool , and lack dynamical signals that could be associated with stock market fluctuations . \n the evolving boolean network for minority games of paczuski , bassler and corral @xcite , on the other hand , works with local information exchange , but the reward function is still global . also the frame of minority games makes it difficult to treat a multi - product market , which we believe is important for understanding real stock markets .    the model we propose is for a market composed of agents , goods and money ( or people , prices and products ) . \n we have demonstrated that such a market easily shows persistent fluctuations of wealth with time , and seen that the persistency is closely related to an interplay of having many products that influence each others trade probability . \n a similar result was obtained in the simpler model in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that persistency could arise even without money . \n the setup proposed here with agents and products with individual local prices allows for individual strategies of the agents . \n this opens for evolution of strategy as a part of the financial market , and we have seen that evolving strategies indeed give a dynamics where wealth is often rapidly redistributed .",

i@xcite and hires - ii@xcite monocular spectra is @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : bestfit ] . \n the quoted uncertainties include the effect of the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath12 . \n this correlation is shown in figure  [ fig : ch2plot ] . \n not included in this fit are any systematic uncertainties . the largest systematic uncertainty is expected to be due to the details of composition used in the aperture calculation for the hires - ii spectrum . \n changes in the composition tend to move the best fit point along the trough of figure  [ fig : ch2plot ] , changing the @xmath12 vs. @xmath4 relationship little . \n upper limit on the flux in two more bins for each measurement are shown above the highest energy actually observed . \n the black fit line is the sum of the galactic ( green ) and extragalactic ( red ) components . \n the parameters of the extragalactic component are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n there are 42 data points , giving 39 degrees of freedom in the fit . ] \n ( @xmath16 ) in @xmath12-@xmath4 space . \n the first four @xmath17 contours are shown . ] \n because the uncertainty in composition is a large part of the uncertainty in the parameters in the fit to the spectrum , we were motivated to try to improve on the existing composition measurements , especially below @xmath18 ev . to go to low energies with hires \n requires using the monocular data sets , and we chose the hires - ii monocular data set for this analysis . \n unfortunately , the limited elevation coverage of the hires - ii aperture biases our @xmath19 acceptance , with the bias increasing at lower energies . \n the bias stems from the requirement that we find @xmath19 within that extent of the shower observed in the detector . \n events that are closer to the detector are more likely to have @xmath19 above the visible range , and thus be cut . \n furthermore , because lower energies can only be observed close to the detector , events at these energies will have a larger acceptance bias than those at higher energies . \n this bias precludes performing an elongation rate analysis at energies below @xmath18 ev .    instead \n , we have chosen to fit the @xmath20  distribution in energy bins to a combination of mc generated @xmath20  distributions from proton primaries and from iron primaries . \n the @xmath20  distribution in each energy bin is stored in a histogram , and the data histogram is then compared to a mixture of the proton and iron mc histograms to find the best fit proportion of each . \n the fit is performed using the binned maximum likelihood technique as implemented in the hbook@xcite routine hmclnl . \n the uncertainty of the fit in each energy bin is taken from the width of @xmath16 as fit to a quadratic in the region about the maximum . \n an example of this procedure for the bin at @xmath18 ev is shown in figure  [ fig : compfit18 ] . \n the result of these fits for the data at all energies is shown in figure  [ fig : rawdata ] .    at an energy of @xmath18 ev . \n the top panel shows @xmath16 as a function of the proton fraction in 1% steps ( black histogram ) , and a polynomial fit to the same ( red line ) . the bottom panel shows the @xmath20   distribution that results from the fit , with the data shown as filled circles with error bars , the proton distribution in blue , the iron distribution in red and the sum in black ]        this fit gives only the proportion of proton and iron in the final , accepted sample ; as such , it is not intrinsically interesting , but must be corrected to find the proton - iron ratio of uhecrs entering the atmosphere . \n however , one can test this procedure on an independent mc sample where one knows _ a priori _ which events are protons and which are iron . \n the result of this analysis on the mc sample used to calculate the aperture used in the spectrum analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : rawmc ] . \n the fits agree very well with what is actually in the sample . \n the raw composition measurements are corrected using the relative acceptances in the proton and iron mc samples . \n these are the same mc samples used to provide the comparison @xmath20  distributions used in the fit . \n the fit proton - iron proportion is interpreted as given numbers of proton events and iron events . \n these numbers then are separately corrected for the relative acceptance appropriate to each . \n finally , the proton - iron ratio is recalculated using the corrected numbers of events of each type .    for a mc sample \n , we can again compare the corrected proton - iron proportion to the input to the mc simulation . \n this is shown in figure  [ fig : cormc ] . in this case , the input is just the hires prototype / mia and hires stereo composition measurements , where the mean @xmath20  of the data is interpreted as representing a proton - iron proportion given by the distance between the corsika / qgsjet proton and iron lines . \n the input is in fact given by linear fits to the mean @xmath20  above and below @xmath21 ev . \n again , the corrected results of the fits agree very well with the inputs to the mc .        finally , we show as a very preliminary result , the corrected proton - iron ratio for the data . see figure  [ fig : cordata ] . \n this result shows a very light composition ( 90% protons ) above @xmath2 ev . below this energy \n we measure a sharply lower composition , but with large uncertainties because of few events and a large acceptance correction . \n the measured composition at high energies is in agreement with the hires stereo measurement , but closer to being all protons . \n the data used in the fits comes from the same data set used in the hires - ii spectrum analysis which was fit above \n . a considerable amount of data , about a factor of three more , was collected after this data set . \n this later data was collected with lower light thresholds , and as such , will have a lower energy threshold . \n in addition , the aperture at each energy will be increased , reducing the size of @xmath20   biases . \n performing this analysis on this expanded data set should give us much tighter constraints on the composition in the middle of the @xmath22 ev energy decade . \n the telescope array ( ta ) , which has already received japanese funding , and the ta low energy extension ( tale ) will be able to push this analysis even further . \n tale will use the hires phototubes with larger mirrors to push the thresholds even lower . \n the mirrors will be arranged in a tower rather than a ring to avoid biases in @xmath20 . \n geometrical resolution at the level of hires stereo will be provided by coincidences with the ta ground array .", "StartTimeOffset": 3704631957429, "RequestID": "7695d6efa0472459f41205e5dbcdbfee516be6bc", "TotalTokens": 2265}
{"ContextTokens": 3140, "GeneratedTokens": 355, "SynthesizedBody": "astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nuclei beyond the iron group in a combination of processes involving neutron captures on long ( _ s _ process ) or short ( _ r _ process ) time scales @xcite . \n however , 32 stable , proton - rich isotopes between @xmath2se and @xmath10hg can not be formed in that way . those _ p _ \n nuclei are 10 to 100 times less abundant than the _ s _ and _ \n r _ nuclei in the same mass region . \n they are thought to be produced in the so - called @xmath0 or _ \n process , where proton - rich nuclei are made by sequences of photodisintegrations and @xmath11 decays @xcite . in this scenario , \n pre - existing seed nuclei from the _ s _ and _ r _ processes are destroyed by photodisintegration in a high - temperature environment , and proton - rich isotopes are produced by ( @xmath0__,n _ _ ) reactions . \n when ( @xmath0__,p _ _ ) and ( @xmath12 ) reactions become comparable or faster than neutron emission within an isotopic chain , the reaction path branches out and feeds nuclei with lower charge number _ \n z_. the decrease in temperature at later stages of the _ p _ process leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath11 decays , resulting in the typical _ \n p_-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath13mo ( _ _ n__=50 ) and @xmath14sm ( _ _ n__=82 ) . \n the currently most favored astrophysical site for the _ p _ process is explosive burning in type ii supernovae . \n the explosive shock front heats the outer o / ne shell of the progenitor star to temperatures of 2 - 3 gk , sufficient for providing the required photodisintegrations . following the nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical models , good agreement with the required _ \n production is found , with exception of the low ( _ _ a__@xmath4100 ) and intermediate ( 150@xmath15__a__@xmath15 165 ) mass range , which are underproduced by factors of 3 - 4 @xcite . \n because of these persisting problems , alternative scenarios ( such as type ia supernovae and x - ray bursters ) have been suggested , each with their own , inherent difficulties @xcite . currently , however , it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are due to a problem with astrophysical models or with the nuclear physics input , i.e. reaction rates . \n thus , a necessary requirement towards a consistent understanding of the _ p _ process is the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data . by far most of the several hundreds of required photodisintegration rates and their inverses \n need to be inferred from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations @xcite , e.g. the codes non - smoker @xcite and most @xcite . \n experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range , or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible .    the role of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) reactions in the _ p _ process was underestimated for a long time , although it is obvious that they have an influence on the final _ p_-process abundances . \n neutron captures compete with ( @xmath0,_n _ ) reactions and thus hinder the photodisintegration flux towards light nuclei , especially at lower-_z _ isotopes and even - even isotopes in the vicinity of branching - points . \n the influence of a variation of reaction rates on the final _ p _ abundances has been studied previously @xcite . \n it turned out that the _ p _ abundances are very sensitive to changes of the neutron - induced rates in the entire mass range , whereas the proton - induced and @xmath16-induced reaction rates are important at low and high mass numbers , respectively . \n rayet et al . \n @xcite have also studied the influence of several components in their _ \n p_-process network calculations . \n their nuclear flow schemes show that branching points occur even at light _ \n nuclei , and are shifted deeper into the proton - rich unstable region with increasing mass and temperature . in contradiction to woosley and howard @xcite , who claimed for their network calculations that ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) can be neglected except for the lightest nuclei ( _ _ a__@xmath1590 ) , rayet et al . also examined the influence of neutron reactions for temperatures between _ _ \n t__@xmath17= 2.2 and 3.2 gk by comparing overabundance factors if ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) reactions on _ _ z__@xmath626 nuclides are considered or completely suppressed . as a result , the overabundances were found to change by up to a factor 100 ( for @xmath3sr ) if the ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) channel was artificially suppressed . \n this rather high sensitivity indicates the need for reliable ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates to be used in _ \n p_-process networks . \n although recent efforts are directed to calculation or measurement of photodisintegration cross sections and rates @xcite , astrophysical photodisintegration rates can easily be inferred from capture rates by detailed balance , even in theoretical work @xcite . \n the stellar reaction rate n@xmath18@xmath4@xmath19@xmath6@xmath20@xmath21 for the reaction is related to its inverse rate by @xmath22 with the avogadro number _ n@xmath18 _ , the nuclear spins _ \n j _ and masses _ a _ , the respective temperature - dependent partition functions _ \n g(t ) _ and the reaction _ q _ value in the exponent . \n measuring or calculating a rate in the direction of positive _ q _ value ensures best numerical accuracy and consistency between forward and backward reaction . \n this is important when implementing those rates in reaction networks for nucleosynthesis models .    moreover , stellar cross sections and rates have to be employed for the computation of reverse rates . in a stellar environment \n , nuclei are fully thermalized with the environment , resulting in a thermal excitation of both the target and the final nucleus . \n only stellar cross sections including the excitation in form of a stellar enhancement factor ( sef ) can be used to properly account for all transitions when applying detailed balance . for reactions with positive _ q _ \n values for captures , a laboratory measurement of the capture cross section will encompass by far more of the relevant transitions than a photodisintegration experiment , even with the target being in the ground state @xcite .    for the past decade \n there has been a continuing effort to measure nuclear data for the _ p _ process , both for charged particle reactions @xcite and for neutron induced reactions @xcite . \n the present work comprises the first measurement of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) cross sections for the _ p_-process isotopes @xmath2se and @xmath3sr at _ _ \n kt__= 25 kev , with the aim to improve the _ \n p_-process database and to help testing theoretical predictions . since it is not possible to measure cross sections directly at _ \n p_-process temperatures of _ \n _ kt__= 170 - 260 kev , we have to perform the measurements at _ s_-process ( and freeze - out ) temperatures of _ _ kt__= 25 kev , and then extrapolate theoretically by means of the respective energy dependent cross sections ( see sec .  [ \n theory ] ) . \n the measurement of stellar ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates requires a `` stellar '' neutron source yielding neutrons with a maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution . \n we achieve this by making use of the @xmath1li(_p , n_)@xmath1be reaction . in combination with the activation or time - of - flight technique , \n this offers a unique tool for comprehensive studies of ( _ n_,@xmath0 ) rates and cross sections for astrophysics .    in sec . \n [ exp ] , the experimental technique and sample characteristics are outlined , followed by the description of the data analysis in sec .

cooled cu backing with protons of 1912 kev , 30 kev above the reaction threshold . \n the resulting quasi - stellar neutron spectrum approximates a maxwellian distribution for _ _ \n kt__= @xcite . \n hence , the proper stellar capture cross section can be directly deduced from our measurement .    for the activations natural samples of selenium metal ( 0.89% @xmath2se ) and various strontium compounds ( 0.56% @xmath3sr ) were used . in order to verify the stoichiometry , \n samples of sr(oh)@xmath24 and srf@xmath24 were dried at 300@xmath25c and 800@xmath25c , respectively . \n the powders were pressed to thin pellets , which were enclosed in a 15 @xmath23 m thick aluminium foil and sandwiched between 10 - 30 @xmath23 m thick gold foils of the same diameter . in this way the neutron flux can be determined relative to the well - known capture cross section of @xmath26au @xcite . \n the activation measurements were carried out with the van de graaff accelerator operated in dc mode with a current of @xmath27100  @xmath23a . \n the mean neutron flux over the period of the activations was @xmath271.5@xmath2810@xmath29 _ \n n_/s at the position of the samples , which were placed in close geometry to the li target . throughout the irradiation \n the neutron flux was recorded in intervals of 1  min using a @xmath30li -

( 1982 ) . \n the best - fit value of the equivalent hydrogen column density , , of @xmath24  is significantly lower than that of mccray et al . \n ( 1982 ) of 1.52.7@xmath25  using the ogs and that of mavromatakis ( 1993 ) obtained during the secondary on - state with the pspc and a power - law and blackbody spectral model of @xmath26  . \n the   obtained with a bremsstrahlung model is consistent with the value of mavromatakis ( 1993 ) . \n the lecs  is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath27  inferred from the absence of a 2200  interstellar absorption feature in the spectrum of the counterpart star ( gursky et al . \n 1980 ) . \n event arrival times were first converted to the solar system barycenter . \n since the light travel time across the  orbit ( @xmath126 s ) is large compared to the pulse period , the event arrival times were additionally corrected to the  center of mass using the ephemeris of deeter et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n these corrected data were divided into 32 phase bins and folded over a number of trial periods and a pulse period of @xmath28  s obtained . \n the uncertainty was determined by performing a linear least - squares fit to the pulse arrival times . \n this value is consistent with the pulse period history as obtained from batse observations . \n the 0.110  kev pulse profile divided into four energy ranges is shown in fig . \n [ fig : profile ] . \n this confirms the phase shift between the hard ( @xmath92 kev ) and the soft ( @xmath290.4 kev ) pulses first seen by mccray et al . \n ( @xcite ) . \n we next investigated the pulse phase dependence of the various features identified in the phase averaged spectrum . \n the corrected event data were folded into 20 phase bins using the pulse period given above . \n the same model as used to describe the phase averaged spectrum was fit to each of the spectra . \n inspection of the results revealed that the , the central energy of the fe  k line , and the widths of the two fe lines did not vary significantly with pulse phase , and so these were held fixed at the best - fit values given in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] . \n figure  [ fig : phase_dep ] shows the variations in the best - fit spectral parameters as a function of pulse phase . \n clear variations in all the parameters , except for the energy of the fe  l line , are visible . \n we note that the pulse phase dependence of the blackbody temperature seems to mirror that of the power - law normalization . \n it is unclear whether the observed change in the blackbody temperature results from an actual change in the underlying blackbody , or from e.g.incorrect modeling of the power - law continuum . \n any such effects are likely to be strongly phase dependent given the large variations in normalizations of the two components ( see fig.[fig : phase_dep ] ) , and we note that the observed change in the blackbody temperature occurs at pulse phases where the blackbody component is faintest . \n there is a strong similarity between the pulse phase dependence of the blackbody and 0.94  kev emission features ( see fig .  [ \n fig : phase_dep ] ) . \n this suggests that these spectral components are physically related . \n we have searched for any _ orbital _ phase dependence of this relation . \n pulse phase resolved spectra were accumulated over orbital phases 0.060.45 and 0.450.72 ( center of eclipse occurs at phase 0.0 ) . \n there is no significant difference in the behavior of the different fit parameters in the two data sets . \n the lecs results are consistent with the illuminated inner part of the accretion disk being the reprocessing site . in a model where the accretion disk intercepts a fraction of the hard x - ray beam ( which is then reprocessed ) a 180@xmath10  phase difference between the hard x - rays and the reprocessed x - rays is expected . if the disk is tilted with respect to the rotation axis of the neutron star the phase difference can be different from 180@xmath10 . since we find a @xmath1250@xmath10  phase difference , this is consistent with a `` tilted '' disk ( for a more detailed discussion see mccray et al . \n @xcite ) . a way to test \n this is to observe  at other @xmath6 . \n if the tilt of the disk varies with @xmath6 , as predicted by the precessing disk models ( _ e.g. _  gerend & boynton 1980 ) , the phase difference should change . \n unfortunately , both the _ bepposax _  observation and that of mccray et al . \n ( 1982 ) were performed at approximately the same @xmath6 . \n we searched for a change in the phase difference using data obtained during the first and last 50  ksec of our observation ( i.e.  a total of @xmath112  ksec exposure time ) . \n we find a decrease of 11@xmath3050@xmath10   which is inconclusive , mainly due to uncertainties in the determination of the peak of the broad soft pulse . \n choi et al . ( 1994 ) find that the intensity of the 6.4  kev fe  k line is modulated in phase with the `` soft '' component reported by mccray et al . \n the lecs data is of insufficient quality to investigate this relation , due to the low count rate and penetration effects in the instrument ( cf . \n parmar et al . \n however , it appears likely that both the fe l and k lines exhibit a similar modulation , and thus have the same origin . \n kallman ( 1995 ) discusses fe l / k emission line ratios and mean line energies in photoionized gases . \n the line ratio depends on the shape of the ionizing continuum , the column density of the emitting material and the ionization parameter @xmath31 ( tarter et al . \n the mean line energies increase with @xmath31 , ranging from 0.750 to 1.29  kev and 6.40 to 6.95  kev for fe l and k , respectively . \n combining the calculations of kallman ( 1995 ) with the line energies and intensities given in table  [ tab : ave_fits ] and assuming a power - law continuum with @xmath2 in the range 0.51.0 allows @xmath31 and  to be constrained to be 10100 and @xmath32  , respectively . \n the blackbody component could be reprocessed emission originating at higher optical depths in the disk . \n if the reprocessing region is located at the magnetospheric radius of 3000  km , then the derived value of @xmath31 and the peak power - law luminosity of @xmath33 gives an  of only @xmath34@xmath35  for a beam opening angle of 0.1 ( @xmath36 ) . \n however , it is likely that the reprocessing region is not a single layer with uniform density , but more complex , such that there are no unique values of  and @xmath31 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3727630751369, "RequestID": "3d9b597c09fb0dd19b9c513830074eea5630b329", "TotalTokens": 3524}

{"ContextTokens": 4092, "GeneratedTokens": 122, "SynthesizedBody": "globular clusters ( gcs ) provide important clues as to how galaxies formed . \n the very old ages of the gcs in our galaxy suggest that they were formed when the galaxy formed . \n this , combined with the fact that gcs are normally found in the halos of big galaxies , where the dark matter dominates the gravitational potential , implies that the formation mechanism of gcs is related intimately to the formation of the galaxies themselves . therefore understanding the formation of gcs has been a major area of study ( e.g. , van den bergh 1996 ; vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1996 ; harris et al . \n 1998 ) . \n globular clusters probably form within giant molecular clouds , in the same way as we see star cluster formation happening today in the galactic disk ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . indeed \n , there is considerable observational support for such an approach , and the specific model of mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1996 ) has the strong attraction of correctly reproducing the gc mass distribution function . \n therefore , the most important question now becomes : _ how were such giant molecular clouds formed earlier on in the history of the galaxies , well away from the galaxy centers which is where most of the stars are being made ? \n _ proposed mechanisms for making molecular clouds include : 1 ) gravitational instability shortly after recombination arising from isothermal perturbations in the early universe ( peebles & dicke 1968 ; rosenblatt , faber , & blumenthal 1988 ) ; 2 ) instabilities during contraction of a protogalactic gas cloud ( e.g. , fall & rees 1985 , who investigate thermal instabilities ) ; and 3 ) high - velocity collisions of giant gas clouds in the halos of young galaxies ( gunn 1980 ; kang et al . \n 1990 ; kumai , basu , & fujimoto 1993 ) . \n recent observations show evidence for candidate forming gcs , which presumably formed out of molecular clouds , in some galaxy mergers , suggesting that the third possibility is the most attractive ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; holtzman et al . \n 1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ; kumai et al . \n 1993 , whitmore et al . \n 1993 , surace et al . \n such a scenario is further supported by the bimodal metallicity distributions of the globular cluster populations in ellipticals ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) and by the fact that mergers are thought to produce elliptical galaxies by violent relaxation ( schweizer 1982 ) in conjunction with the result that elliptical galaxies have a higher specific frequency ( @xmath0 ) of gcs than disk galaxies ( zepf & ashman 1993 ) . \n however , the newly formed clusters are usually observed in the central regions of mergers ( the exception is in vii zw 031 , where star clusters have been seen at ultraviolet wavelengths in a coherent pattern at @xmath1 kpc from the galactic center ; trentham , kormendy , & sanders 1999 ) , so that the mechanism producing these particular objects is presumably not responsible for making most old globular cluster populations located in the outer regions of galaxies . while these observations suggest that halo gcs did not form in the current merger , they do not rule out the possibility that they formed in high - velocity cloud - cloud collisions early in the histories of the progenitor galaxies , and therefore do not address directly the question highlighted in the previous paragraph .    in the context of the models that we characterize 2 ) and 3 ) above , \n it is plausible that any intense star formation that is happening in the galaxy centers can have significant effects on the physical processes responsible for the formation of the molecular clouds . \n recently , harris et al . ( \n 1998 ) argued the importance of a superwind driven by an initial starburst in order to explain the observed higher @xmath0 of gcs in bright cluster member galaxies ; the superwind is necessary to reduce the mass of cold gas in which star formation occurs , leading to the higher @xmath0 ( blakeslee 1997 ) . \n in such a scenario the gcs would form as condensations in material shocked by supernovae . \n this concept is not new ( mestel 1965 ; elmegreen & lada 1977 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1978 ; elmegreen 1989 ; whitworth et al . \n 1994 ; taniguchi , trentham & shioya 1998 ; mori , yoshii & nomoto 1999 ) , and we now consider its application to the gc problem ( see fig .  1 ) . that the gcs end up in the outer parts of the galaxy in this kind of \n model happens because they form as pressure - confined condensations within a shell of shocked material that is moving radially outward at high velocity . \n this model exploits some features of 2 ) and 3 ) , but differs fundamentally from those listed above in that the formation of the halo gcs is related to the formation of the dense stellar core of the galaxy , and that the core forms early in the history of the galaxy , at least in elliptical galaxies . \n a similar approach has been undertaken by brown , burkert , & truran ( 1991 , 1995 ) , in which they consider gc formation in supershells produced by the collective behavior of the supernovae remnants generated by the initial starburst . \n these models have had some success at reproducing the properties of milky way gcs .    in the context of disk galaxies like the milky way , \n this model ties halo globular cluster formation to bulge formation ( note that bulges lie on the same fundamental plane as the ellipticals @xmath2 see kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) . \n the physics is essentially the same if the spheroidal stellar population ( whether an elliptical galaxy or the bulge of a disk galaxy ) forms by isolated dissipative collapse ( blumenthal et al . 1984 ) or by a merger - induced collapse ( e.g. kormendy & sanders 1992 ) . \n first , we investigate if gcs could form in the shocked shell driven by a superwind caused by the initial starburst in a galaxy . we adopt the dissipative collapse picture for formation of elliptical galaxies and bulges ( e.g.  larson 1974 ) and \n follow the galactic wind model proposed by arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) . in this model , \n intense star formation ( i.e. , a starburst ) occurs at the epoch of galaxy formation in the galaxy center , producing a galactic wind which lasts for a characteristic time @xmath3 gyr for an elliptical with a stellar mass of of @xmath4 ) . since infalling gas is accreting onto the galaxy at times @xmath5 , the wind interacts with this gas , and shocked gaseous shells form in the outer regions of the galaxy . if the shells are unstable gravitationally ( e.g.  ostriker & cowie 1981 ; ikeuchi 1981 ; umemura & ikeuchi 1987 ) , clumps may be formed within them . here \n we investigate the possibility that the clumps may end up as present - epoch gcs . \n suppose that the supernovae responsible for shocking the gas occur continuously over a timescale longer than or comparable with the dynamical timescale of the initial gas cloud and the evolution of the shocked material can be described by a superbubble model ( mccray & snow 1979 ; koo & mckee 1992a , 1992b ; heckman et al . \n 1996 ; shull 1995 and references therein ) . the radius and velocity of the shocked shells at time @xmath6 ( in units of 0.5 gyr ) \n are then          where @xmath9 is the mechanical luminosity released collectively from the supernovae in the central starburst in units of @xmath10 ergs s@xmath11 and @xmath12 is the average hydrogen number density of the ism , assumed constant in units of 1 @xmath13 . \n the derivation of @xmath14 requires that the baryonic component dominates the gravitational potential . \n this is always true for the relevant scales in this paper . \n however the presence of a dark matter halo requires that this estimate of @xmath14 is not valid at arbitrarily large radii . \n we can estimate @xmath9 directly from arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) . \n for an elliptical galaxy with a stellar mass @xmath15 , radius @xmath16 10 kpc and @xmath17 @xmath13 ( see saito 1979 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) , we expect @xmath18 stars that explode as supernovae . since most of these massive stars were formed during the first 0.5 gyr (= @xmath19 ) , therefore @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total energy of a single supernova ( @xmath22 erg ) and @xmath23 is the efficiency of the kinetic energy deposited to the ambient gas ( @xmath24 0.1 ; dyson & williams 1980 ) . \n condensations that form within the shells experience a net inward acceleration due to self - gravity and a net outward acceleration due to the internal pressure . \n whitworth et al . \n ( 1994 ) investigate the balance between these two accelerations and show that the timescale for the growth of the fastest - growing condensations is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sound speed in the shell , and @xmath27 is its surface density . \n non - linear fragmentation in the shell then happens first at a time @xmath28 . noting that the surface - density @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant determined by the geometry ( @xmath31 for a sphere ) and @xmath32 is the hydrogen atom mass , we then find from the estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath33 that fragmentation within the shell first happens at a time @xmath34 myr at a radius @xmath35 kpc . \n here @xmath36 is the mach number in units of 10 when these condensations first appear , equal to @xmath37 ( here it is assumed that @xmath38 ; whitworth et al . \n 1994 ) . estimating @xmath39 is difficult because the turbulent pressure in the shell is much greater than the thermal pressure . \n the shell is moving outward at a velocity @xmath40 when the fragments first appear , where @xmath41 km s@xmath11 . \n thus @xmath40 is almost independent of @xmath39 , so that our lack of knowledge of the sound speed is unimportant in determining the velocity of the shell when the condensations form . \n now we consider the evolution of the fragments within the shocked shell . \n since the cooling timescale of neutral gas clouds , @xmath45 myr ( spitzer 1978 ) , once fragmentation has occurred , the fragments will cool and can form stars . \n it is not clear , however , whether such stars really evolve to form a star cluster , or become smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy ( e.g. , fall & rees 1985 ) . \n but one of the most important results of whitworth et al . \n ( 1994 ) was that fragmentation of the shocked layer occurs while the fragments are still confined within the layer by ram pressure . \n subsequent fragmentation within a fragment could occur and result in the formation of sub - gc clouds with jeans ( 1929 ) masses of @xmath46 for @xmath47 pc and @xmath48 \\sim 4 \\times 10^{-23}$ ] g @xmath13 . \n the number of such sub - gc clouds is @xmath49 . \n the lack of strong clustering amongst gcs in the halo suggests that these sub - gc clouds merge within a condensation to form a single gc . \n such merging happens on a dynamical timescale of @xmath50 yr , where @xmath51 is the original size of the fragment in units of 250 pc and @xmath52 is the mass of the fragment in units of @xmath53 . \n since typical masses of gcs in the present - day galaxies are @xmath54 , and these gcs are gas - poor , about 90% of the gas must have been removed from the initial fragments before virialization ( such a large fraction of gas being lost would unbind the system , if it happens after virialization ) . \n supernova - driven winds could be an important mechanism in achieving this over the lifetime of the gc ; note that stars with masses above @xmath55 in gcs have all evolved of the main - sequence by the present day .    finally we estimate the location of gcs . \n the shocked shell is confined on opposite sides by the ram pressure of the inflowing ambient gas and by the hydrostatic pressure of the expanding bubble . \n this results in the fragments being carried out in the shocked layer well beyond @xmath56 . \n pressure confinement ceases when the external pressure becomes less than @xmath57 i.e.  when @xmath58 gyr and the maximum radial distance , @xmath59 kpc . \n therefore the condensation leaves the shell at some radius @xmath60 where      this is much larger than the stellar half - light radii of elliptical galaxies and bulges ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) . \n subsequent dynamical evolution of the gcs will depend on the gravitational potential at these large radii , which progressively becomes more dark - matter dominated as the halo virializes . \n the main result following from the previous section is that the remnant stellar clusters have galactocentric radii between 8 and 16 kpc , for an initial starburst of luminosity 10@xmath62 erg s@xmath11 . \n these numbers are approximately consistent with the galactocentric radii of globular clusters in our galaxy ( 5  10 kpc ; harris 1991 , harris et al . \n the radii in our galaxy could be lower than those inferred from the model for various reasons : for example , dynamical friction might reduce the size of the orbits of the gcs , or the initial starburst in our galaxy might have generated a luminosity lower than 10@xmath62 erg s@xmath11 . \n the following confrontations with observation can also be made . \n the model is highly idealized and it is probably too simplistic to merit some of the more detailed comparisons . \n nevertheless some useful constraints on the model parameters and some important extensions to the model can be inferred . \n \\1 ) since the gcs are formed in the shocked shell which is the interface between the metal - enriched galactic wind and the metal - poor accreting gas , the most obvious scenario would be that metallicity of the gcs would be metal - poor , but slightly more metal - rich than the lowest metallicity stars in the galaxy centers ( the first ones to form in the starburst that generated the superwind ) . \n alternatively , if supernovae from the central starburst inject many metals into the expanding shell ( brown et al .  1991 , 1995 ) \n , then the metallicity of the gcs will be much higher . \n this comparison can only be made in the case of the galaxy . \n the median metallicity for halo gcs is about @xmath63 in logarithmic solar units . \n the metallicities of stars in the bulge range from about @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( geisler , & friel 1992 ; mcwilliam , & rich 1994 ) . \n this would suggest that the enrichment of the shell is not a highly efficient process . \n furthermore , the formation epoch of gcs is shortly after that of galaxy formation so that the ages of the globular cluster stars should be nearly the same as the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxies . \n this also appears to be true for the galaxy . \n \\2 ) if the infalling gas has no angular momentum , the gcs form in this model with highly radial orbits . were this the case , and were these orbits to survive until the present day , this would be inconsistent with observation , at least for the galaxy ( van den bergh 1993 ; cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) . \n however , collisions with other condensations early in the history of the fragments will randomize the orbits . \n this , combined with out lack of knowledge about the distribution of angular momenta of the infalling gas , means that a detailed comparison with observation is not possible . \n \\3 ) one further consequence of our model is that _ if _ in all galaxies the efficiency of globular cluster formation in the shocked shells is the same , then the number of globulars @xmath66 scales as the luminosity @xmath67 of the galaxy as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mass density of the gc clouds . \n most data suggests a scaling law steeper than this ( harris 1991 ) . \n this may be due to that other physical processes may well be at work ; e.g. , mergers and accretion events ( djorgovski & santiago 1992 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; van den bergh 1993 ; zepf , ashman , & geisler 1995 ) , and destruction of gcs as a result of evaporation , disk shocking , or dynamical friction ( fall & rees 1977 ; okazaki & tosa 1995 ) . \n \\4 ) local density variations ( i.e.  different values of @xmath27 in different regions ) within the shell might mean that there may be a radial ( and possibly age ) spread amongst the globulars that form by the mechanism described in the previous section . in regions of high-@xmath27 , \n the condition of @xmath25 is satisfied sooner , so that the condensations begin to form within the shell earlier . \n these systems also leave the shell earlier and so we expect them to exist at systematically smaller galactocentric radii than systems that form in the low-@xmath27 regions of the shell . \n observations seems to indicate ( harris 1991 ) that halo gcs tend to be smaller with increasing distance from the galactic centers . in the context of the current model \n , this would suggest that the efficiency at which gas is converted into stars is higher in the high-@xmath27 regions . \n we would like to thank n. arimoto , t. murayama , y. ohyama , t. okazaki , h. saio , y. shioya , and m. tosa for their useful discussion and comments . \n this work was supported by the ministry of education , science , and culture ( nos . \n 07044054 , 10044052 , and 10304013 ) . nt thanks the pparc for financial support .", "StartTimeOffset": 3770566246406, "RequestID": "f5a0288d4c5f0017e862a56e04c556c6bf87d7eb", "TotalTokens": 4214}
{"ContextTokens": 3891, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , significant amount of digital data on the behavior of individuals has enabled us to quantitatively explore the various patterns of human dynamics . \n one of the robust findings is that human dynamics is not random but correlated , such that the bursts of rapidly occuring events alternate with long inactive periods  @xcite . \n the bursty dynamics is typically characterized by the heavy tailed or power - law distributions of waiting time or inter - event time @xmath0 as @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 for e - mail and mobile phone call ( mpc ) communications  @xcite , respectively . \n the origin of bursts in human dynamics has been debated for the past few years . \n the bursts can emerge from the individual selection of tasks from the task list according to the protocol `` the highest priority task first ''  @xcite . \n the long waiting time of a task with low priority leads to the heavy tail of the waiting time distribution . \n this model assumes that there are at least two tasks to be compared , which is not necessarily the case in reality . on the other hand the circadian and weekly activity patterns of humans can also result in the long periods of inactivity that contribute to the heavy tails  @xcite . in this approach the circadian and weekly patterns \n have been modeled by the non - homogeneous poisson process , implying that human behavior is essentially random . \n while both models are based on intuitive and to some extent realistic assumptions , they are not able to consider other human related factors properly , such as how individual agents reply to the received e - mail or phone call , and what is the benefit or cost of communication .    in order to investigate the role of human factors in bursty human dynamics we devise a model , where an individual agent reacts upon the lack of information , such that an information seeking agent sends an e - mail or makes a phone call to an information provider . with this model \n we describe the time frame of how long people wait for responses from the information providers under uncertain ( risky ) situations and get insight into which human factors in the daily communication are relevant to the bursty dynamics . here \n we start with an assumption that an agent prefers a fixed amount of payoff over a risky lottery of the same expected payoff , which is called _ risk - aversion_. a risk - averse agent can reduce uncertainty by communicating for information , which is a time - consuming process . \n once an agent requests information , we consider the time to wait for responses , i.e. the waiting time , as a cost . \n this reflects a well - known economic perspective that time and information are considered as tradable goods  @xcite . \n based on the trade - off between the information gain and the cost of the waiting time , the agent chooses an optimal waiting time . \n note that we confine our model to risk - averse agents because the optimal waiting time for risk - pursuing agents is always zero and the waiting time does not matter for risk - neutral agents unless the information gain is unequal to the cost of time . by optimizing the waiting time \n , we derive a specific ( positive ) relationship between the risk and the optimal waiting time . \n then , we show that the optimal waiting time distribution follows a power - law , which serves as theoretical support for the observed bursty dynamics in e - mail and mobile phone call communications . \n our model gives insight into the human communication dynamics , i.e. how people are concerned with the communication efficiency and the cost per unit time while deciding the communication channel as well as the time to wait for responses . \n since the efficiency and the cost per unit time are heterogenous in different communication channels , the optimal channel depends on how urgent the situations are and how patient the users are . \n furthermore , the efficiency and the cost per unit time also change the optimal choice of the waiting time . \n we find that if the cost per unit time dominates over the efficiency , people are concerned with both the efficiency and the cost per unit time under the low risk situation , while they consider only the efficiency under the high risk situation . \n this explains the effect of human factors on communication such that in riskier situation people tend to focus more on reducing the risk without concerning the cost , because shortening the waiting time by the efficient communication is preferred to concern the cost itself . \n however , if the cost per unit time is dominated by the efficiency , the result is opposite . \n people are concerned with only the efficiency under the low risk situation and consider both the efficiency and the cost per unit time under the high risk situation , which implies that people do not consider the cost per unit time seriously under the low risk ( short waiting time ) but do under the high risk ( long waiting time ) . in conclusion \n the individual agents attitude towards risk can be one of the explanations for the pattern of the waiting time in communication . \n in section  [ sect : model ] we describe and analyze the model and explain the implications of the results . \n then we make conclusions in section  [ sect : conclusion ] . \n as in  @xcite we consider the risk - averse utility function , @xmath4 of state @xmath5 , whose degree of risk - aversion is measured by @xmath6 . for simplicity , we set @xmath7 and then consider a risk - averse agent with utility function given by @xmath8 corresponding to a time - dependent state @xmath9 . at the beginning @xmath10 \n , the state @xmath11 is uniformly distributed from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . \n then , after waiting time @xmath14 for information about the state @xmath5 , the agent reduces the uncertainty on the state as @xmath15 . \n that is , the state becomes more specified . \n the decreasing speed of uncertainty is controlled by the parameter @xmath16 , which we call _ \n efficiency_.    as an example let us consider a job applicant who got offers from 5 firms , indexed by @xmath17 and let @xmath18 be the set of wages of firms , which is the initial `` state '' if the applicant is uninformed . \n he chooses one of them and his utility depends on the wage of the firm chosen such that @xmath19 . \n then suppose that the applicant can obtain information on the unknown wages . \n if the information he will get at time @xmath20 is the exact amount of @xmath21 , the state becomes @xmath22 . at time @xmath20 , the applicant can make a clearer decision than he could at time @xmath10 because the number of unknown wages at @xmath20 is 4 . as the applicant knows the wages one - by - one , \n his decision gets improved , and eventually at time @xmath23 , he will know the firm of the highest wage so that the best decision without uncertainty can be made . \n the time the agent waits for information to reduce the uncertainty can be considered as a cost . \n let @xmath24 be the cost of time @xmath25 . for simplicity , we assume that the cost per unit time is constant but dependent on the uncertainty level @xmath26 such that @xmath27 with positive @xmath28 and @xmath29 . \n this assumption describes that given the level of the uncertainty @xmath26 , the cost of time is constantly increasing in time @xmath25 at the rate of uncertainty except for the case with @xmath30 . \n the larger value of @xmath29 corresponds to the larger cost of the time unit , indicating that the parameter @xmath29 controls _ the cost per unit time_.    now we define the agent s expected utility at state @xmath9 subtracted by the cost of time as follows : @xmath31-c(t)\\nonumber\\\\      & = & a -\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\sqrt{\\frac{t^\\gamma}{2\\pi\\sigma^2 } } \\exp \\left(-x -\\frac{x^2t^\\gamma}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)-c(t)\\nonumber\\\\      & = & a -

law exponent @xmath47 and the cutoff waiting time @xmath48 . \n it turns out that @xmath49 , which requires the strong cutoff such as the ( stretched ) exponential one as we have assumed .    due to the technical differences among communication channels , the optimal waiting time @xmath0 can be channel - oriented . \n for example , one might wait longer for e - mail responses than for face - to - face responses , and e - mail responses might be faster than post responses . \n thus , it is plausible that when people choose communication channels , they might expect different waiting time to different channels and choose a suitable channel to the level of uncertainty . \n this channel preference can be considered in two ways : the efficiency and the cost per unit time . \n firstly , the parameter @xmath50 can be interpreted as the channel - oriented sensitivity on uncertainty . \n based on the empirical observation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for e - mail and mpc communications , respectively , one can argue that the corresponding values of @xmath50 would be @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n this implies that e - mail communication rarely reduces uncertainty as e - mail users wait time for information . on the other hand \n , mobile phone users can reduce uncertainty more efficiently . in terms of the cost per unit time , \n the e - mail and the mpc can be compared as follows : @xmath53 for @xmath54 . \n since the cost per unit time for e - mails is lower than that for mpcs , the empirical observations can be interpreted such that people are more patient to wait for the e - mail responses than for the mpc responses . \n hence e - mail ( mpc ) is less ( more ) efficient and less ( more ) costly communication channel so that e - mail is more suitable than mpc for non - urgent situations and consequently people would prefer mpc when they need information urgently .    since the eq . \n ( [ eq : tau_exact ] ) can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions , we use the asymptotic expansions of the lambert function : @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . \n let us now consider the case with @xmath59 , where the cost per unit time is dominant over the efficiency . when @xmath60 , we obtain the scaling relation @xmath61 on the other hand , for the range of @xmath62 , the scaling relation with logarithmic correction is obtained as @xmath63^{-1/\\gamma},\\ \\delta_2=\\frac{2}{\\gamma},\\label{eq : log}\\ ] ] where @xmath64}$ ] . \n therefore , we find two scaling regimes as @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , respectively . here \n @xmath69 denotes the crossover uncertainty and also defines the crossover waiting time @xmath70 . \n it indicates that the optimal waiting time distribution shows two scaling regimes with power -

law exponent for the low risk regime , @xmath76 , turns out to depend only on @xmath50 , while the power - law exponent for the high risk regime , @xmath94 , is a function of both @xmath29 and @xmath50 . \n in other words , when the cost per unit time is dominated by the efficiency , people are concerned with only the efficiency under the low risk situation . \n this is because under the low risk , implying short waiting times , the cost of waiting time is still negligible compared to efficiency . on the other hand , \n people under the high risk are concerned with the efficiency as well as on the cost per unit time because the cost of time is not negligible any more due to the long waiting time .    for the full range of @xmath79 \n , we have numerically solved the eq . \n ( [ eq : tau_exact ] ) . in case with @xmath95 , implying @xmath96 , we obtain the numerical solutions for @xmath86 and @xmath87 and for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath89 . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : beta](b ) , for each value of @xmath50 , the curves for different values of @xmath28 collapse to a single curve of eq . \n ( [ eq : universal ] ) with two scaling regimes . \n in order to investigate the role of human factors in the bursty dynamics of individuals , we have studied an agent - based model . \n our model assumed an intrinsic human behavior , such as a trade - off between information gain to avoid uncertainty and the cost of time to wait for information . with the agent s optimal choice for the waiting time , the empirical waiting time distributions in daily communication process have been explained . \n the results we obtained by analytical derivation show two scaling regimes for the waiting time distributions with different power - law exponents , denoted by @xmath99 . \n this indicates that people have different attitudes on valuing the efficiency and the cost per unit time , controlled by @xmath50 and @xmath29 , respectively . \n while @xmath99 is generally expected to be a function of both @xmath29 and @xmath50 , the value of @xmath99 turns out to be independent of @xmath29 in two cases : a ) when @xmath59 and under high risk situation , people are not concerned with the cost per unit time because it is better to obtain information as quickly as possible due to the high cost of waiting time . \n b ) when @xmath91 and under low risk situation , the cost of waiting time becomes negligible so that people do not have to be concerned with the cost of time unless the waiting time is significantly long . \n we showed that the scaling behavior of optimal waiting time distributions reveals which human factors in the daily communication are considered as relevant to scaling . \n we also expect that further studies to identify intrinsic properties of social agents as well as extension of this model to interacting agents on complex networks would be helpful in figuring out the origin of bursts in human dynamics even in more details .    financial support by aalto university postdoctoral program ( hj ) , from eu s fp7 fet -

{"ContextTokens": 2230, "GeneratedTokens": 66, "SynthesizedBody": "a hierarchical universe with a low matter density is the currently favoured model for structure formation . \n however , observational evidence for evolution is scarce - structures appear old and similar over moderate look back times ( peebles 1999 ) . \n galaxy clusters are the most massive virialised objects in the universe and are the latest systems to form , therefore they may reveal evidence for recent evolution . indeed , perhaps the strongest indication for evolution can be found by examining galaxy morphologies in rich clusters over the past 5 gyrs ( _ i.e. _ references within : sandage 1970 butcher & oemler 1978 , dressler 1980 , dressler & gunn 1983 , couch 1987 , binggeli 1988 , ferguson & sandage 1991 , binggeli 1991 , thompson & gregory 1993 , peterson & caldwell 1993 , lavery & henry 1994 , barger 1996 , dressler 1997 , balogh 1998 , couch 1998 , poggianti 1999 , bower 1999 ) . at @xmath0 we see that clusters of galaxies contain predominantly late type disk galaxies that have undergone a transformation into dwarf ellipticals ( dsph ) by the present day . there is also compelling evidence that the fraction of s0 galaxies decreases over the same look back time ( dressler 1997 ) , whilst at even earlier epochs , tentative evidence for the hierarchical growth of the cluster elliptical galaxies may be found ( van dokkum 1999 ) . \n the data suggest that the cluster environment is causing a morphological transformation between galaxy types . \n other indicators of environmental influences in clusters include the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) , signatures of star - bursts followed by a rapid truncation of star - formation in cluster spirals and k+a / a+k galaxies ( poggianti 1999 ) , the absence of low surface brightness disks in clusters ( bothun 1993 ) and the presence of a large component of diffuse star - light ( bernstein 1993 , freeman - this volume ) . in this paper \n we will discuss the role of environment and the proposed mechanisms that are responsible for driving galactic evolution in clusters and creating the `` morphological and spectroscopic butcher - oemler effects '' . \n several mechanisms have been proposed that can induce a morphological transformation between galaxy classes . \n toomre & toomre s ( 1972 ) pioneering n - body simulations of merging spirals gave rise to elliptical remnants . \n this process is most effective when the encounter velocity is comparable to the galaxies internal velocity , therefore mergers should be rare within rich virialised systems , a fact pointed out by many authors ( _ e.g. _ mamon - this volume ) , however see van dokkum ( 1999 ) . \n numerical simulations of clusters that formed naturally in a hierarchical universe show that mergers are indeed rare ( ghigna 1998 ) . \n galactic winds from supernovae are frequently cited as important mechanisms for dwarf galaxy evolution ( dekel & silk 1986 ) yet observational evidence for this process is not compelling ( martin 1998 ) and it is unlikely that feedback can reshape the stellar configuration . \n we therefore focus on the two mechanisms that are most likely to operate extensively in the cluster environment ( _ c.f . _ \n fujita 1999 ) . \n impulsive heating via rapid tidal encounters has been demonstrated to be an efficient mechanism at heating disk galaxies in clusters  termed `` galaxy harassment '' by moore ( 1996 , 1998 ) , tidal forces and internal cluster dynamics have been studied by many authors , including richstone & malmuth 1983 , icke 1985 , merritt 1985 , byrd & valtonen 1990 , valluri & jog 1991 , valluri 1993 , gnedin ( 1999 ) . \n gunn & gott ( 1978 ) suggested that the ram - pressure force of the hot intra - cluster medium could remove the atomic hydrogen from disks infalling into clusters . \n nulsen ( 1982 ) proposed that the viscous and turbulent stripping of gas would be equally as effective . \n morphological transformation by gravitational encounters is a process that requires several strong or frequent tidal collisions and acts over a timescale of several @xmath1 years . \n in contrast , hydrodynamic effects operate on a much shorter timescale , @xmath2 years . \n observational evidence for gas - dynamical interactions in clusters is scarce due to the speed at which the process occurs ( stevens 1999 ) , however the literature does contain some examples ( _ i.e. _ warmels 1988 , cayatte 1990 , gavazzi 1995 , kenny & koopman 1999 , and several recent studies in this volume by vollmer ( 1999 ) , ryder ( 1997 ) & j. solanes ) . \n the first 3-dimensional calculation of ram pressure stripping using realistic disk galaxy models was carried out by abadi ( 1999 ) . \n earlier work had studied the properties of spherical systems in two dimensions ( _ i.e. _ balsara 1994 ) . \n abadi found that the simple analytic argument proposed by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) balancing the ram pressure , @xmath3 , with the disk s gravitational restoring force works very well . \n simulations at @xmath4 and edge on to the motion through the intra - cluster medium suffered slightly less stripping than face on . \n however , even in the best case scenario for stripping , an @xmath5 disk galaxy moving through the center of the coma cluster at 3000 km s@xmath6 , a significant fraction of gas remained ( hi extending to a radius @xmath7 kpc ) that would continue to form stars . \n = 5.0truein     the time evolution of the diffuse hi component within a spiral galaxy falling into the coma cluster ( quilis 1999 ) . \n a more realistic treatment of the stripping process using a eulerian finite difference code revealed that the turbulent and viscous stripping processes help to remove more gas than just the ram pressure alone ( quilis 1999 ) . \n quilis also realised that disks are not smooth homogeneous mediums , but have a complex structure containing many holes and regions that are completely devoid of gas ( brinks & bajaja 1986 ) . once these \n are included , the icm streams through the holes , preventing `` backside infall '' and ablates away the gas from their edges , rapidly removing the entire hi content of disks . \n thus , these authors find that the stripping process alone , is in general 100% efficient at removing the hi component within a timescale @xmath8 years ( see figure 1 ) .    without fresh material to replenish gmc s , star formation will be rapidly truncated ( elmgreen & efremov 1997 ) . continued \n heating by tidal encounters with massive galaxies increases the disk scale height by factors of 23 . \n spiral features will be suppressed and these galaxies will resemble the s0 galaxies observed in nearby clusters . the efficiency of the stripping process increases rapidly towards the cluster center where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are maximum , thus we have a natural way of creating the morphology - density relation . whether or not the transformation of sa / sb galaxies to s0 s can reproduce the same scaling as observed remains to be tested . \n galaxy harassment will transform di / sc / sd disks into dwarf elliptical ( dsph ) galaxies over a timescale of several billion years - _ i.e. _ several cluster orbital periods . simulations of this process appear to produce remnant galaxies that closely match the observed cluster dwarf s ( moore 1996 , 1998 ) , although the sample of kinematical data is small . \n a fundamental prediction of the formation of de ( dsph ) galaxies by tidal heating is that the remnant galaxies are embedded in diffuse streams of stars , tidally removed from the progenitor disks ( see figure 2 ) . \n the surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are expected to be well fitted by an exponential profile over their central regions but a significant excess of stars will be found at 45 scale lengths ( moore 1999 ) . \n the surface brightness of this excess will occur fainter than @xmath11 per arcsec@xmath12 , an observable effect with 4 m or 8 m class telescopes . \n the presence of freely orbiting planetary nebulae in clusters ( freeman , this meeting ) provides strong support for the efficiency of this process . \n not surprisingly , low surface brightness disks are not found within clusters ( bothun 1993 ) . \n the shear extent of their stellar distributions and low central potentials make them unstable to tidal forces . \n once these galaxies enter the cluster environment , most of there stars are tidally removed and a diffuse spheroidal remnant remains ( moore 1999 ) . \n numerical simulations of this process can be used to study the diffuse cluster light component . \n = 3.0truein     an example of tidal tails from the galaxy harassment process from the cluster cl0054 - 27 at z=0.56 courtesy of ian smail . \n the image is roughly 150 kpc on a side . \n features this prominent are rare at this surface brightness ( @xmath13 per arcsec@xmath12 ) but are expected to surround all cluster de ( dsph ) galaxies at lower surface brightness levels . \n two mechanisms are necessary to reproduce the observed morphological evolution of galaxies in clusters . at the faint end of the luminosity function , \n disk galaxies are easily transformed into de ( dsph ) galaxies by galaxy harassment . \n numerical simulations of this process predict that all dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters will be embedded within very diffuse streams of stripped stars . \n low surface brightness disks with slowly rising rotation curves and shallow central potentials will not survive the fluctuating potentials of rich clusters and will be tidally shredded to form the bulk of the diffuse intra - cluster light \n . spirals with bulges are more stable to gravitational encounters \n . they would retain their stars and gas and continue to form stars to the present day . \n most , if not all of the atomic hydrogen of these galaxies must be rapidly removed upon entering the cluster environment in order to explain their star - formation histories . \n fluid dynamic simulations of realistic disks moving through a hot icm demonstrates that a combination of ram - pressure and viscous stripping can remove 100% of the hi from the igm within @xmath14 years \n . continued tidal heating by encounters will complete a transformation to the s0 class .", "StartTimeOffset": 3829493920666, "RequestID": "6e2cec0a1e9dc3ee060a46b14b40a798f8ce8880", "TotalTokens": 2296}

called quantum repeater ( qr ) . \n it should be emphasized that the notion of qr is currently in the center of interest of many researchers @xcite , @xcite . \n apart from the theoretical analysis of this subject there are also physical experiments carried out with use of qrs as the elements of quantum networks . \n these experiments are being accomplished for the transmission of quantum states in an optical fiber @xcite and also in the air @xcite . \n therefore , the progress in the field of quantum computing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is strongly connected with the progress of quantum communication because of the need to send information . \n the notion of qr is currently discussed as a potential solution to the problems of quantum communication and cryptography ( especially for quantum key distribution ) . \n the three generations of qr were presented do far . \n the first type utilizes the phenomenon of entanglement and its purification @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n the second generation @xcite is based on the near - perfectly entangled pairs generation ( however , in this approach still the entanglement purification is used ) . \n the third type @xcite , @xcite of qr utilizes the protocol of teleportation . \n the quantum information is transmitted from one point to another , so the communication is organized as a one - way scheme . \n the solution presented in this chapter belongs to the third generation of qr and it uses so - called one - dit teleportation protocol to correct the errors which may appear during the transfer process . the novelty of described solution consists on using only pauli - z gate for error correction . \n more precisely : the result of measurement performed during the teleportation protocol determines the number of pauli - z operations which have to realized as an error correction . \n the reminder of this chapter is organized as follows . in section ( [ lbl : \n sec : single : dit : teleportation : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) there is a quantum teleportation protocol presented and the error correction is performed with use of pauli - z gate . \n section ( [ lbl : sec : protocol : quantum : repeater : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) describes the realization of qr with use of previously mentioned teleportation protocol . \n the interpretation of repeater protocol as a quantum circuit is shown in section ( [ lbl : sec : qc : for : qr : network : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n the summary and the final conclusions are presented in section ( [ lbl : sec : conclusions : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n the protocols presented in this section are defined with notions of dits and qudits . \n a concept of dit is a generalization of classic bit . \n for classic bit there can be distinguished only two states : zero and one . in the case of dit \n more states are possible . \n the number of these values is symbolized by the letter @xmath0 . \n for example , the classic bit is a dit with @xmath1 . \n a unit of quantum information is so - called qubit . \n a definition of qubit may be presented as : @xmath2 where vectors @xmath3 , @xmath4 stand for the computational base ( in this case the standard base is used ) : @xmath5 , \\enspace \\vert 1 \\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ 1\\\\ \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] these vectors represent the classic states zero and one .    by analogy , \n a generalization of qubit is a qudit . in this case \n more base states are admissible . \n the state of unknown qudit with @xmath0 base states is represented as : @xmath6 the number of base states for a given qudit , expressed as @xmath0 , will be also called a qudit s freedom level . \n standard base for qudits requires more vectors e.g. for so - called qutrits ( qudits with @xmath7 ) standard basis vectors  are : @xmath8,\\enspace { | 1 \\rangle } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right],\\enspace { | 2 \\rangle } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ]    the presented repeater protocol is realized as a single - dit teleportation protocol . \n the described protocol differs from other one - dit protocols @xcite , @xcite in this way that only pauli - z gate is used as a correction gate . \n the pauli - z ( or just @xmath9 ) gate for qudits may be defined as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 stands for the root of unity : @xmath12 more precisely , @xmath13 is a @xmath0-th root number @xmath14 of unity . \n the symbol @xmath15 represents the imaginary unit . \n there are also hadamard gate and cnot gate used . \n definitions of these gates for qudits are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 . in the case of cnot gate \n the @xmath18 gate may be given as well - this gate is obtained as the hermitian conjugate of cnot operation . \n the @xmath18 gate is useful for a quantum teleportation protocol described in this section . \n the exemplary matrix form of cnot gate for qutrits ( @xmath7 ) is : @xmath19 where the zeros were replaced by dots to make the notation more legible . in general , the cnot gate for qudits is constructed in a following way : @xmath20 where the symbol @xmath21 stands for matrix direct sum and @xmath22 means the negation operation for qudit with freedom level @xmath0 . \n the gates , mentioned above , allow to present the teleportation protocol of an unknown quantum state : @xmath23 the 3-qudit state @xmath24 , where @xmath25 belongs to alice and @xmath26 to bob , after performing the hadamard , cnot and @xmath18 operations on it , due to fig . \n [ lbl : fig : circuit : teleporation : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] , may be described as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 . \n the gates cnot and @xmath18 realize the entanglement . \n function @xmath29 is expressed as : @xmath30 a correction gate s form depends on the result of measurement performed on the first qudit by alice ( however , both qudits are measured in the standard base what is a consequence of hadamard gate s use in a quantum cirucit \n see fig . \n [ lbl : fig : one - way - quantum - repeater : ms : jw : cn:2016 ] ) . \n if alice , after the measurement , obtains one of given states @xmath31 then the bob s qudit is characterized by the proper values of probability amplitudes and there is no additional operations needed to correct the obtained state . \n this also stands with the accordance to the values of function @xmath29 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 - they equal zero . \n if alice , also after the operation of measurement , obtains one of following states @xmath34 then the state of bob \n s qudit is @xmath35 the values of @xmath29 function in this case are following : @xmath36 when the @xmath9 gate is used only once , then the correct values of some amplitudes may be recovered . in general \n , the result of measurement determines the number of operations @xmath9 which should be performed . \n it can be expressed as @xmath37 if @xmath38 stands for the result of measurement performed on the first qudit . \n the above description presents the teleportation protocol for an unknown qudit , where @xmath9 gate is needed to correct the final state and only one measurement decides about the way how the correction is done after the teleportation process .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     although the suggested number of qudits needed to carry a correct simulation is @xmath39 , it should be emphasized that the phenomenon of entanglement occurs inside of repeaters . \n it means that the entanglement is present in a teleportation process and it occurs between three qudits which consist the repeater itself . \n there is no entanglement between particular repeaters . \n this assumption makes easier the implementation of mentioned quantum phenomena with use of classic computers . \n it is also important to know that the repeaters are connected physically ( e.g. optical fiber ) with suitable quantum channel . \n if the numeric or symbolic simulation is to be carried out on a classic machine , then only the three - qudit repeater needs to be simulated . \n the features of communication channel , which transmits a quantum state , may be simulated apart from the simulation of qr .    .... \n -- n : numer of nodes -- i : index of node -- $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ : initial state -- h : change history of the transmitted state    h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ , 0 ) [ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ] $ \\leftarrow$ qrepeater ( $ \\mket{\\psi_0}$ ) h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ) $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ $ \\leftarrow$ \n $ z^r \\mket{\\psi_t}$ while i < n do begin      [ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r ] $ \\leftarrow$ qrepeater ( $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r )      ...      other operations \n e.g. noise generation      entanglement level measuring and etc .      ...      h $ \\leftarrow$ append(h , $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ , r )      $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ $ \\leftarrow$ \n $ z^r \\mket{\\psi_t}$          i $ \\leftarrow$ i + 1 end $ \\mket{\\psi_{final}}$ $ \\leftarrow$ $ \\mket{\\psi_t}$ ....    fig . \n [ lbl : fig : classical -

dit teleportation protocol with error correction performed by pauli - z gate allows the realization of qr for transmitting the unknown qudit state . \n two presented strategies for z - type error correction provide the choice to the user who can run the protocol with the error correction at the end of the whole process or the correction may be performed locally on every qr . \n the approach with the correction at the end of transmisssion reduces the use of z gate application . \n we use this gate only at the end of the process to complete the communication protocol by correcting the received information . \n this solution excludes the need of using pauli - x and hadamard gates , which are utilized in other known protocols for qr realization . \n the advantages connected with presented approach are : the influence of possible errors , caused by the imperfect realization of quantum gates , is lower and the construction of qr is easier because only the operation of measurement have to be performed ( the error correction is redundant ) . \n the another interesting problem for further research is using quantum error correcting codes on transmitted state . \n the presented protocol concerns the pure states , so it would be also important to analyze the quality of transmitted information taking into account the quality of utilized quantum gates and the influence of environment . \n we would like to thank for useful discussions with the  _ q -

to - one transformation from one graph to another : each pair of nodes linked ( not linked ) in one graph is linked ( not linked ) in another graph . \n such a quantity is a topological invariant . \n however , actually we can be never sure if the quantity proposed as the invariant has indeed the above discriminating property . \n while its different values certainly mean different graph structures , the same value does not allow to claim that the graphs are indeed topologically identical . \n in many cases , the proposed quantity appears to be degenerate , i.e. its value is the same for different graphs . \n all that remains true for unlabeled trees , which are graphs without cyclic paths and without loops .    in a series of papers , schultz et al . proposed and evaluated some scalar quantities as candidates to be topological invariants for trees @xcite . \n this work was motivated by a chemical application of the constructed quantities , which were found to increase monotonically with the melting temperature of alkanes . \n however , almost all proposed invariants were found to be degenerate . on the other hand , \n the last proposed invariant is a real number and not integer , and the comparison of its value must rely on the numerical accuracy . \n here we propose a new candidate as a topological invariant for unlabeled trees . \n unlike the quantities discussed previously , this is a set of matrices and not a single number . \n the advantage is that the matrices are ordered in a simple way , and the ordering algorithm works in polynomial time . on the other hand , to state that two trees are topologically identical we compare all the matrix elements . \n this modification is expected to enhance the discriminative force of the proposed invariant . \n we use the obtained criterion to calculate the number of topologically non -

{"ContextTokens": 1659, "GeneratedTokens": 97, "SynthesizedBody": "hadron colliders will supply an increasing amount of data with the upcoming high luminosity tevatron run and the lhc project . \n methods for extracting @xmath0 and parton density functions from these data sets can therefore expect a steady improvement in the precision over the coming decades .    often it is claimed that hadron colliders can not do such precision measurements . \n a few comments can be made in answer to this . \n first of all , a hadron collider measures the value of @xmath0 at many different values of the ( partonic ) center of mass energy . \n this is in contrast to @xmath1-colliders where the center of mass energy is fixed . \n in fact , at the tevatron the partonic center of mass energy useful for the @xmath0-extraction can go as high as 1 tev ( and at the lhc this will increase by an order of magnitude ) . secondly , a hadron collider can make accurate measurements by selecting appropriate observables . \n for this purpose we select in this talk the _ \n normalized _ one jet inclusive transverse energy distribution . \n the value of @xmath0 will be determined from the shape of the distribution . \n the major factor determining the shape is the fraction of quarks in the colliding hadrons . due to the evolution of the parton density functions the quark fraction at moderate parton fractions decreases as the jet energy increases . \n this depletion is controlled by the strength of the strong coupling constant .    because we look at a normalized quantity both the theoretical ( renormalization scale dependence ) and experimental uncertainties ( e.g. luminosity uncertainty ) are much smaller than one would expect . \n as mentioned in the introduction , the observable used is the normalized one jet inclusive transverse energy distribution . as an example we use the published run 1a results from the cdf collaboration @xcite . for the theoretical prediction we use the jetrad monte carlo @xcite with the cuts and jet algorithm as close as possible to the experimental setup . \n the mrsa parton density functions @xcite , which allows varying @xmath0 , were used . \n the renormalization / factorization scale , @xmath2 , was chosen to be a constant , @xmath3 , times the maximum jet transverse energy , @xmath4 , in the event . \n both data and theory are divided by the `` reference '' theory prediction which is given by : @xmath5 , @xmath6 . to normalize the distribution we choose the ratio to be equal to unity at @xmath7 gev . \n we show the @xmath0-dependence in fig . 1a and the scale dependence in fig 1b . \n as can be seen the dependence on @xmath0 is quite substantial compared to both the experimental and theoretical uncertainties . \n also note that the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) results are quite close . \n the only difference between the two predictions is the ( expected ) reduced scale dependence at nlo . \n the method to extract @xmath0 is now quite simple : we minimize the @xmath8 to fit the theory to the data in fig \n . 1 between 30 gev @xmath9 200 gev by varying both @xmath0 and @xmath3 . the results and , more importantly , the interpretation are discussed in the next section . \n note that we do not consider the systematic uncertainties at this point . \n they can be easily included in the @xmath8-fit by building up the correlation matrix out of the systematic uncertainties @xcite . \n their inclusion is better left to the experimenters . \n here we want to concentrate on the methodology . \n [ fig2 ]    in fig . \n 2a we show the results of the minimalization procedure to fit to the data . both the minimum and the 1-@xmath10 uncertainty ellipse is shown . \n the figure contains all the information we can extract from the data . while the central value is quite trivial to determine , the interpretation of the uncertainty is not . \n the perfect answer ( that is no renormalization scale uncertainty ) would be a vertical strip . \n the uncertainty would then simply be the width of the strip independent of the choice of @xmath3 . \n however , in fixed order perturbative qcd we have a residual scale sensitivity due to the truncation of the series . \n this is reflected in the slope of the ellipse - axis . \n in fact one could argue that the slope is the correct measure of the theoretical uncertainty . when comparing results from different experiments this slope could be used to weight different experiments on their theoretical uncertainty . \n this all implies that the parameter @xmath3 can not be considered a fitting parameter as @xmath0 is , nor is it in a direct manner related to the theoretical uncertainty . \n note that when the data accuracy increases ( e.g. the cdf / d0 run 1b data ) the fit of the theory to the data will become more strained and the variation of @xmath3 will become more constrained . \n this does not indicate that the theoretical uncertainty is decreasing . on the contrary , this means that the nlo prediction is becoming more and more inadequate to describe the data and even higher order calculations are needed .    for the moment we use a naive procedure to quote the theoretical uncertainty . \n the experimental uncertainty is taken to be the width of the ellipse at the minimum , while the theoretical uncertainty is taken as the variation within 1-@xmath10 for scales between @xmath11 . \n the results are @xmath12 alternatively , one could argue that the difference between the lo and nlo value of @xmath0 should be larger than the difference between the nlo and nnlo value of @xmath0 , giving an alternative , but equal , estimate on the theoretical uncertainty of @xmath13 . \n we have used the normalized one jet inclusive transverse energy distribution to extract @xmath14 . \n the fact that we used the normalized distribution reduces the experimental and theoretical uncertainty significantly . to improve the results we need to fit the parton density functions ( specifically the gluon ) together with the value of @xmath0 \n this should remedy the obvious discrepancies between the data and theory for @xmath15 gev ( see ref . \n @xcite ) . such a measurement would not only give us @xmath0 , but simultaneously a _ true _ nlo determination of the gluon parton density function . in fig . \n 2b we finally show , as a cross check , the comparison between the @xmath0 extracted in this talk and the @xmath0-values determined in each @xmath4-bin , obtained using the methods of ref . \n @xcite ( incorporating parton density functions with varying @xmath0 ) . \n as can be seen the agreement between the two methods is quite good . \n the new run 1b data from the cdf and d0 collaboration will severely test the nlo description of the data and higher order calculations might be needed to describe these results and extract the gluon parton density function and @xmath0 . \n 9 f.  abe et al . , _ phys . \n lett . _ * 77 * 438 ( 1996 ) . \n w.  t.  giele et al . , _ nucl . \n phys . _ * b403 * 633 ( 1993 ) . \n a.  d.  martin et al . , _ phys . \n lett . _ * b387 * 41 ( 1996 ) . \n see e.g. s.  alekhin , _ \n hep -

{"ContextTokens": 1329, "GeneratedTokens": 161, "SynthesizedBody": "the problem of extracting scientific parameters from dirty ( dominated by artifacts ) interferometric radio images has resulted in many deconvolution algorithms being developed . however \n , none of these solve the problem of incorporating instrumental errors as a source of uncertainty when making measurements from radio data . \n deconvolution algorithms can only produce one image , which the scientist must then assume is correct before extracting any science ( for example , a catalogue of source fluxes ) from it . \n algorithms such as clean ( @xcite ) , the most popular algorithm in use , can not reliably produce any uncertainties ( @xcite ) , making it impossible to propagate the uncertainties from instrumental errors to the scientific parameters . \n further , if these parameters are correlated , as they likely are , even correcting the data for instrumental errors may lead to biased scientific results , as the measurement of the instrumental error may be wrong . these instrumental effects will become more important as more sensitive telescopes such as the square kilometre array come online . \n we propose in @xcite , a completely different approach , whereby we model the sky and all known sources of instrumental error simultaneously using the radio interferometry measurement equation ( rime ) ( @xcite ) . \n the rime can be written as ( @xcite ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the visibility matrix ( the radio data ) , @xmath2 is the @xmath3th jones matrix for antenna @xmath4 ( containing instrumental effects ) and @xmath5 is the brightness matrix ( containing the sky model , and hence all scientific parameters ) . \n we use the software package meqtrees ( @xcite ) , which implements the rime , to model our radio field and any known instrumental effects . we can then estimate the parameters of this model , both scientific and instrumental , in a bayesian context using a sampling method such as mcmc ( @xcite ) . \n we assume uncorrelated gaussian noise on the visibilities which leads to a simple gaussian likelihood for @xmath6 . with this approach , \n we are able to determine the full posterior for the problem , obtaining not only the best fits for all parameters , but also their uncertainties and correlations . \n figure [ fig : field ] shows the mock wsrt field which we tested biro on . \n this field , simulated using meqtrees and based on a real field , consists of 17 point sources . \n we also applied pointing errors to each antenna as an example of a source of instrumental error , which wsrt ( and many other radio telescopes ) have had to deal with in the past ( @xcite ) . \n a mispointed antenna will observe a point source through the edge rather than the centre of its beam . \n thus , in general , we would expect pointing errors and fluxes to be correlated and we apply our method to determine these correlations , as well as the parameters themselves . \n the instrumental parameters for this simulated data consist of the pointing errors , the width of the primary beam and the noise on the visibilities , which we assume to be gaussian , as is widely considered a good approximation . \n we allow the pointing errors to vary in time as second ordr polynomial functions , resulting in 84 pointing error parameters , 3 parameters for each direction for each antenna . \n our scientific parameters include the flux for each source , and the shape parameters of the extended gaussian source . \n we compared biro with the standard , commonly used clean algorithm combined with a source extraction algorithm on the cleaned image ( we call this clean+se ) for this dataset . \n figure [ fig : compare ] illustrates this comparison for the estimated fluxes from biro and clean+se . with no knowledge of the pointing errors , it is no surprise that clean+se returns biased fluxes and fails to find several sources . \n the danger is that the error bars , estimated using only the surrounding flux of the point source in this source extraction algorithm , do not and can not take into account the additional source of uncertainty from the instrumental errors . \n in contrast , the biro estimates are unbiased and the error bars are larger , correctly propagating the instrumental errors , and determining the correlations between parameters ( figure [ fig : covmat ] ) .    , due to the strong correlations between pointing error and flux . ] \n -plane , while the pointing errors are correlated simply because every pointing error affects every source . of particular interest is the complex way in which pointing errors correlate with the fluxes , which would be very difficult to determine from first principles.,scaledwidth=55.0% ] \n we have introduced biro , a bayesian approach to the deconvolution problem of radio interferometry observations . \n figure [ fig : covmat ] highlights the importance of fully propagating the uncertainty on

{"ContextTokens": 3943, "GeneratedTokens": 201, "SynthesizedBody": "the determination of the dynamical friction force exerted by a gravitating system of background stars on a test star moving through the system is one of the classical problems of stellar dynamics . in his seminal paper @xcite \n envisaged the scenario of a sequence of consecutive gravitational two \n body encounters of test and field stars in order to calculate the drag force ( cf . \n @xcite for a modern presentation ) . in an alternative approach @xcite and @xcite determined the collective response of the background medium to a moving massive perturber which manifests itself as a polarization cloud decelerating the perturber . \n the dynamical friction force law derived in this way is precisely identical to chandrasekhar s force law , if the mass of an individual field star can be neglected against the mass of the perturber . \n the latter is to be expected whenever the background can be treated as a gravitating continuum . \n the applications of chandrasekhar s formula covered a wide field , ranging from calculations of the dynamical friction and diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation , which is used to describe the internal dynamics of star clusters , to determinations of the sinking rates of satellite galaxies which are accreted by massive galaxies . \n the literature on these subjects has become so extensive over the years that we do not attempt any detailed review here , because this would be beyond the scope of this paper . in the context of the sinking satellite problem most of the efforts concentrated on adapting the original concept of an infinite homogeneous background of field stars on isotropic straight \n line orbits to geometries and kinematics appropriate for the discs and haloes of spiral galaxies . \n moreover , the finite size of the perturbing body was taken into account . \n @xcite followed chandrasekhar s concept of a sequence of two  body encounters of field and test stars and considered a sequence of deflections of field stars by a moving spherical body . \n technically the deflections were calculated using the impulse approximation of small angle scatterrings . \n the principal result was a modification of the coulomb logarithm so that it does not diverge anymore at small scales , because gravitational encounters at impact parameters smaller than the size of the perturbing body become ineffective . \n in this paper we present a rigorous calculation of the dynamical friction force exerted by an infinite homogenous background on a spherical massive body using the wave  mechanical method of @xcite and @xcite . \n this approach is topically closely related to studies of the exchange of angular and linear momentum in stellar systems ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or in plasmas ( @xcite ) . \n it is shown in section 4 below that the shape of the perturber affects only the exact form of the coulomb logarithm . \n as concrete examples we calculate the drag force exerted on a plummer sphere and on a sphere with the density distribution of a @xcite profile , respectively , and compare this with the drag force exerted on a point mass . \n we assume an infinite homogenous distribution of field stars on isotropic straight  line orbits . \n the response of the system of background stars to the perturbation due to a massive perturber is determined by solving the linearized boltzmann equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the gravitational potential of the perturber and @xmath2 is the induced perturbation of the distribution function of the field stars in phase space . \n the unperturbed distribution function is described by @xmath3 . \n the solution of the boltzmann equation is greatly facilitated by considering fourier transforms of the perturbations of the distribution function and the potential , respectively , @xmath4\\ , , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the frequency and wave vector of the fourier components . without loss of generality \n the spatial coordinates @xmath7 and the corresponding velocity components @xmath8 can be oriented with one axis parallel to the direction of the wave vector . \n the boltzmann equation ( [ eq1 ] ) takes then the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 denoting the velocity component parallel to @xmath6 . equation ( [ eq3 ] ) \n has been integrated over the two velocity components perpendicular to @xmath6 . in the following \n we assume for the field stars always a gaussian velocity distribution function , or specifically in eq . \n ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the spatial density of the field stars . \n we find then the solution of the fourier transformed boltzmann equation @xmath14    integrating eq . \n ( [ eq5 ] ) over the @xmath11velocity leads to the density distribution of the induced polarization cloud . \n this has been calculated here without taking into account the self \n gravity of the background medium . \n @xcite has shown that in linear approximation the effects of self  gravity can be described by another linearized boltzmann equation of the form of eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) where @xmath1 denotes then the gravitational potential of the density perturbation of the background medium . in a self  gravitating system \n the density perturbations are the sources of the potential perturbations so that the density - potential pair has to fulfill the poisson equation . \n the solution of the combined boltzmann and poisson equations describes simply the jeans collapse of the background medium on scales larger than the jeans length . in real stellar systems or dark \n haloes their jeans length will be always larger than the size of the system , because otherwise the system would have collapsed to smaller sizes . since the polarization cloud is contained within the system , self  gravity is not important for its dynamics . \n of course real self  gravitating systems are not homogeneous , but their density falls off radially . moreover , their phase space distribution is more complicated than an isothermal gaussian velocity distribution . in such systems \n a moving perturber can incite large scale perturbations which contribute to the dynamical friction of the perturber as well ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n obviously these effects can not be described by the simplified model adopted here . \n however , @xcite among others have shown , that the drag by the localized polarization cloud on the moving perturber , which we treat here , is the principal effect . \n for reference reasons we include in our analysis also the potential of a point mass , which moves with the velocity @xmath15 along the y  axis , @xmath16 its fourier - transform can be calculated using formulae ( 3.754 ) and ( 6.561 ) of @xcite as @xmath17 next , the potential ( [ eq6 ] ) is generalized to @xmath18 which corresponds to an extended body with the mass distribution of a plummer sphere ( @xcite ) , @xmath19    the fourier transform of a moving plummer sphere is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind . as third example \n we consider a perturber which has the mass density distribution of a @xcite profile , @xmath22 its gravitational potential is given by @xmath23 the fourier transform of a moving hernquist sphere can be calculated using eq . \n ( 3.722 ) of @xcite in eq . \n ( 3.722 ) . ] \n leading to @xmath24 \n e^{-i{\\rm k}_{\\rm y}{\\rm v}_0 t}\\ \n , , \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where si and ci denote the sine- and cosine - integrals , respectively . the model of a plummer sphere has often been used in numerical simulations of the accretion and their eventual disruption of satellite galaxies in massive parent galaxies . \n plummer spheres have constant density cores , whereas numerical simulations of the formation of galactic haloes in cold dark matter cosmology show that dark haloes may have a central density cusp ( @xcite ) . \n thus models of a plummer or a hernquist sphere should encompass the range of plausible models for satellite galaxies . \n the density in both models falls off radially steeper than found in the cold dark matter galaxy cosmogony simulations . \n this mimics the tidal truncation of satellite galaxies in the gravitational field of their parent galaxies . \n a more technical point is that a density profile as shallow as @xmath25 as suggested by @xcite lends itself not easily to an analytic treatment , because the total mass would be diverging without an outer cut - off . \n the ensemble of stars is accelerated by the moving perturber as @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the full distribution function @xmath28 . \n the contribution from @xmath3 cancels out , and introducing the fourier transforms ( [ eq2 ] ) we find @xmath29 }   \\int d^3{\\rm k ' } f_{\\bf k ' }   e^{i[\\omega ' t + { \\bf k}'\\cdot{\\bf x } ] } \\ , . \n \\label{eq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from symmetry reasons the acceleration vector @xmath30 is expected to be oriented along the y  axis . in eq . \n ( [ eq12 ] ) the frequency @xmath5 , and similarly @xmath31 , is given according to eqns . \n ( [ eq7]),([eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) by @xmath32 where we have introduced following landau s rule a negative imaginary part , which we will let go to zero in the following . \n moreover , @xmath33 so that the potential is a real quantity . equation ( [ eq12 ] ) simplifies to @xmath34 using expression ( [ eq5 ] ) this can be evaluated as @xmath35 next we observe that @xmath36 so that @xmath37 the fourier transform of any potential with spherical symmetry depends only on @xmath38 . \n thus it follows immediately from eq . \n ( [ eq16 ] ) that indeed the two acceleration components @xmath39 as anticipated from symmetry reasons . only in the direction of motion of the perturber \n there is a net effect . \n according to newton s third law the drag force exerted on the perturber is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of a background particle , so that the drag force is anti \n parallel to the velocity of the perturber . in order to evaluate the integrals over the wave numbers in eq . \n ( [ eq16 ] ) it is advantageous to switch from cartesian form @xmath42 to a mixed representation @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and we obtain for the deceleration the general result @xmath46 \\ ,   \\rmn{ln}\\lambda\\ , , \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where erf denotes the usual error function . the coulomb logarithm is defined as @xmath47 in the case of a point mass formula ( [ eq7 ] ) implies @xmath48 . \n this result was first obtained in this form by @xcite and is identical to chandrasekhar s formula ( @xcite ) , if @xmath49 . \n the coulomb logarithm diverges in the familiar way both on small and large scales , i.e.  at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . \n the coulomb logarithm of the dynamical friction force exerted on a plummer sphere can be calculated by inserting eq . \n ( [ eq9 ] ) into ( [ eq19 ] ) leading to @xmath52 if the plummer radius @xmath53 shrinks to zero , expression ( [ eq20 ] ) changes smoothly into the coulomb logarithm of a point mass , because @xmath54 . \n the integral over the square of the bessel functions in eq . \n ( [ eq20 ] ) can be evaluated using formula ( 5.54 ) of @xcite , @xmath55 \\label{eq21}\\ ] ] which is approximately @xmath56 in the limit of @xmath57 . \n this modified coulomb logarithm converges on small scales precisely as found by @xcite , but still diverges on large scales . a natural cut \n off will be then the size of the stellar system under consideration .    for a perturber with the density distribution of a hernquist profile \n we find a coulomb logarithm of the form @xmath58 \n \\label{eq22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown using the asymptotic expansions of the sine and cosine  integrals given by @xcite that the integrand in expression ( [ eq22 ] ) falls off at large @xmath59 as @xmath60 . \n thus the coulomb logarithm converges at small scales . \n this is expected because , although the density distribution has an inner density cusp , the deflecting mass ` seen ' by a field star with a small impact parameter scales with square of the impact parameter . at small wave numbers \n a taylor expansion shows that the square bracket in expression ( [ eq22 ] ) approaches 1 so that we find a logarithmic divergence of the coulomb logarithm as in the case of the plummer sphere .    in fig . \n 1 we illustrate the coulomb logarithms of the plummer sphere and a sphere with a hernquist density distribution according to eqns . \n ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) as function of @xmath61 . \n 1 shows clearly that at given mass small sized perturbers experience a stronger dynamical friction force than larger ones . \n since the cut - off of the wave number at @xmath62 is determined by the radial extent of the stellar system , which corresponds roughly to one half of the largest subtended wave length @xmath63 , we use actually @xmath64 as abscissa in fig .  1 . for comparison \n we have also drawn @xmath65 in fig .  1 . \n the insert shows the cumulative mass distributions of both mass models . \n the half mass radius of the hernquist model measured in units of @xmath53 is about twice as that of the plummer sphere . \n thus for a proper comparison of the drag forces exerted on a plummer sphere and a sphere with a hernquist density profile the dashed line in fig .  1 should be stretched by a factor of about 2 towards the right . \n but it is clear from fig . \n 1 that the drag force exerted on a plummer is always larger that the drag on a sphere with a hernquist density profile . \n this is to be expected because of its shallower density profile . \n the logarithm @xmath65 , although being the asymptotic expansion of the coulomb logarithms ( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) for @xmath66 , is not a good approximation at larger @xmath61 . \n there is a systematic off \n set relative to the true coulomb logarithms which is given explicitely in eq . \n ( [ eq21a ] ) for the case of the plummer sphere . \n so far we have treated the moving perturbers as rigid bodies . in reality , perturbers can be deformed by tidal fields . \n one source of the tidal field is the induced polarization cloud itself . \n however , its effect is expected to be small . \n the moving perturber induces the polarization cloud in the background medium which reacts back on the perturber . \n thus the dynamical friction force and any tidal fields exerted by the polarization cloud is of the order @xmath67 ( cf . \n eq .  [ eq18 ] ) . \n the deformation of the perturber can be viewed as mass excesses and deficiencies . \n the momentum imparted by these ` extra ' masses to the particles of the background medium will be of the order of @xmath68 and can be safely considered as a higher order effect . \n there is a further effect if the perturbers are gravitationally bound systems themselves like globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies . \n such objects can and do loose mass due to tidal shocking . \n this mass loss is primarily driven by tidal shocking due to the shrinking of the tidal radii at the inner pericenters of the orbits of the perturbing objects or by disc shocking when they pass through the galactic disc ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n many studies , which can not be all enumerated here , have shown that mass loss , which reduces dynamical friction , plays thus an important role for the evolution of the orbits of the satellite galaxies . in order to illustrate the effect of mass loss , on one hand , and the effect of a finite size of the perturber , on the other hand \n , we show in fig . \n 2 the variation of the deceleration by dynamical friction exerted on a plummer sphere as function of the mass @xmath69 and the radial scale length @xmath53 . as can be seen from the contour plot in fig .  2 \n both effects can be of comparable magnitude . if one considers , for example , a perturber with a scale length of 0.01 @xmath70 , a doubling of its size has the same effect as a mass loss of 18 percent of the original mass . \n finally we note that our analysis can be extended in a straightforward way , to anisotropic velocity distributions of the field stars . @xcite \n have shown that , if the velocity ellipsoid is either prolate or oblate , the velocity dispersion in the solution of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is replaced by an effective velocity dispersion which depends on the semi - axes of the velocity ellipsoid and its orientation relative to the wave vector @xmath6 . \n this complicates the evaluation of the integrals with respect to the wave numbers in eq . \n ( [ eq16 ] ) considerably . \n we hope to address this problem in a forthcoming paper ( esquivel & fuchs , in preparation ) . \n we thank andreas just for useful discussions . \n thanks are also due to the anonymous referee for helpful comments . \n o.e .  gratefully acknowledges financial support by the international - max - planck - research - school for astronomy and cosmic physics at the university of heidelberg \n .                        hnon m. , 1973 , in : dynamical structure and evolution of stellar systems , g. contopoulos , m. hnon , d. lynden - bell ( eds . ) , lectures of the 3rd advanced course of the swiss society of astronomy and astrophysics , geneva observatory , sauverny , p.  182", "StartTimeOffset": 3930377406187, "RequestID": "623c53388f276b2dad8ee38292328a553c670cfa", "TotalTokens": 4144}
{"ContextTokens": 3637, "GeneratedTokens": 218, "SynthesizedBody": "elliptic partial differential equations ( pdes ) with discontinuous coefficients and singular source terms , commonly referred to as elliptic interface problems , occur in many applications , including fluid dynamics @xcite , material science @xcite , electromagnetics @xcite , biological systems , @xcite and heat or mass transfer @xcite . since the pioneer work of peskin in 1977 @xcite , \n lots of attention has been paid to this field in the past few decades @xcite . \n an elliptic interface problem is formulated as elliptic pdes defined on piecewise - smooth subdomains , which are coupled together via interface conditions , such as given jumps in solution and flux across the domain interface . without the interface , a large variety of convergent numerical schemes are available for solving the elliptic pdes , such as , finite difference method ( fdm ) , finite element method ( fem ) , finite volume method ( fvm ) , wavelet , radial basis functions , meshless and spectral methods . however , for elliptic interface problems , the direct application of the aforementioned schemes can not yield a convergent solution . \n peskin proposed the immersed boundary method ( ibm ) @xcite in order to simulate flow pattern of blood in the heart , in which he approximated the singular sources on the interface . since his work , many numerical methods have been proposed and studied . in 1984 , mayo introduced a second order integral equation approach for poisson s equation and biharmonic equation on irregular domains @xcite , in which the solution is extended to a rectangular region by using fredholm integral equations . a fast poisson solver is utilized to solve the resulting fredholm integral equations on a rectangular region . \n continuous derivatives have been assumed to evaluate the discrete laplacian . \n this method can deal with jump conditions of @xmath2 \\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath3=0 $ ] when the green s function is available . in 1994 , a level set method in combination with the immersed boundary method @xcite is proposed by osher and his coworkers in order to compute solutions to incompressible two - phase flow . \n this level set method is easy to implement , although it is of low convergent rate . in the same year , \n immersed interface method ( iim ) was proposed by levique and li @xcite , in which the interface conditions are incorporated into the finite difference scheme near the interface to achieve second order accuracy based on a taylor expansion in a local coordinate system . \n it is a second order interface scheme that does not smear the interface jumps and is used to solve elliptic and parabolic interface problems alike . \n the resulting linear system is sparse , but not symmetric or positive definite . \n also , second order derivatives of the interface jumps are needed . \n the iim is widely used in practice and its extensions can be seen in refs . \n @xcite . for instance , in 2001 , li and ito @xcite constructed an iim scheme with resulting linear matrix being diagonally dominate and its symmetric part being negative definite . \n in addition to the iim , a large class of finite difference based numerical methods have also been proposed for solving elliptic interface problem . \n the crucial idea of these methods is to incorporate jump conditions into the difference stencils near the interface to maintain high order local truncation error using taylor expansion . \n numerical schemes based on finite element or finite volume are also developed @xcite . \n finite element schemes are usually constructed by modifying the finite element basis near the interface . a few methods on unfitted mesh have been introduced based on the discontinuous galerkin method using interior penalty technique to handle jump and flux conditions @xcite . the weak galerkin finite element method has also been developed for elliptic interface problem @xcite . \n other interesting methods developed in recent decades include the ghost fluid method ( gfm ) by fedkiw , osher and coworkers @xcite . \n the second order convergence of finite difference formalism of interface methods is proved in 2006 by beale and layton for smooth interface @xcite , whereas convergence analysis of most elliptic interface schemes is yet to be done .    in the past decade , we have dedicated ourselves to designing accurate and robust numerical schemes for solving elliptic interface problems . in 2006 , the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method @xcite was proposed , motivated by many practical needs , such as optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite , vibration analysis of plates @xcite , wave propagation @xcite , geodynamics @xcite and electrostatic potential in proteins @xcite . \n one important feature of the mib method is its extension of computational domains by using the so called fictitious values , an strategy developed in our earlier methods for handling boundaries @xcite and interfaces @xcite . \n as such , standard central finite difference schemes can be employed to discretize differential operators as if there were no interface . \n another unique feature of the mib method is to repeatedly enforce only the lowest order jump conditions to achieve higher order convergence , which is of critical importance for the robustness of the method to deal with arbitrarily complex interface geometries . \n higher - order jump conditions must involve higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives . \n therefore , to approximate higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives , one must utilize larger stencils , which is unstable for constructing high - order interface schemes and cumbersome for complex interface geometries . \n the other distinct feature of the mib method is its dimensional splitting . to enforce a 2d or 3d interface jump condition \n , we divide the problem into multi 1d ones and resolve a 1d problem at a time , if possible . \n this approach enables us to come up with a systematic procedure to resolve high dimensional interface problems . \n finally , based on high order lagrange polynomials , the mib method is of arbitrarily high order in principle . \n for example , mib schemes up to 16th order accurate have been constructed for simple interface geometries 1d and 2d domains @xcite , and sixth - order accurate mib schemes have been developed for complex interfaces in 2d @xcite and 3d domains @xcite . \n recently we have constructed an adaptively deformed mesh based mib @xcite and a galerkin formulation of mib @xcite to improve mib s capability of solving realistic problems . \n a comparison of the gfm , iim and mib methods can be found in in refs . \n @xcite . \n the mib method has been used in our earlier works for solving many scientific and engineering problems , such as poisson - boltzmann equation ( pbe ) @xcite for describing the electrostatic potential in proteins . to our best knowledge \n , the mib method is the only method that has demonstrated the second order accuracy for solving poisson or pb equation with realistic protein surfaces with geometric singularities @xcite and for solving poisson equation with multiple material interfaces @xcite . \n it can also be used to solve the helmholtz equation for wave scattering and propagation in inhomogeneous media . \n a fourth order mib scheme for the helmholtz equation with arbitrarily curved interfaces has been proposed by zhao @xcite . \n another example is the geodynamics where the navier - stokes equations with discontinuous viscosity and density is to be solved . \n et al _ have developed a second order accurate mib method to solve this problem on non - staggered cartesian grids @xcite . \n furthermore , the elastic interface problem in both 2d and 3d domains with arbitrarily complex interface geometry was also addressed by the mib method @xcite . in the past few years \n , the mib method has also been applied to the optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite and vibration analysis of plates @xcite . \n due to the importance and complexity of interface problems , it is still urgent to develop methods that are more accurate , robust and require less computational cost \n . finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for its ability to better conserve mass and flux in conservation law problems . \n this property is fundamental for the simulation of many physical models , e.g. , oil recovery simulation and computational fluid dynamics in general . \n additionally , compared with finite difference method which takes a collocation formulation , fvm is able to deal with solutions with relatively lower regularity . in the present work , \n we propose the finite volume formulation of the mib method ( mib - fvm ) . \n the motivation for the proposed mib - fvm is to inherit the merits of both methods , namely , the capability of the mib method in handling complex interface geometries and the advantage of fvm for conservation laws and low solution regularity .    the rest of this paper is organized as the follows . in section [ theory_and_alg ] , the general theory of the mib based finite volume formulation is briefly discussed . \n the theoretical formulation and the computational algorithms are given as well . in section [ mib ] \n , we present the strategy for treating complex interface geometries . in section [ numericalstudies ] , \n the proposed mib - fvm is validated by benchmark tests , such as 6-petal flower and jigsaw puzzle - like shape in two dimensional ( 2d ) space , and sphere , ellipsoid , cylinder , flower - based cylinder and torus in three dimensional ( 3d ) space . \n solutions of less regularity ( @xmath4 continuous ) are also tested for the spherical and ellipsoidal interface in 3d . \n this paper ends with a conclusion . \n let us consider an open bounded domain @xmath5 with a given interface @xmath6 , which separates the domain into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as illustrated in figure [ interface ] . \n is divided by interface @xmath6 into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the mesh is represented by solid lines . \n the grid points are represented by blue dots.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the boundary @xmath9 and interfaces @xmath6 may be non - smooth . \n the interface can be characterized by a piecewise smooth level - set function @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 . as such \n , two subdomains can be given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n the elliptic interface problem can be formulated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a piecewise continuous function , @xmath16 is the boundary value , and @xmath17 is a variable coefficient that is discontinuous across the interface @xmath6 . as a result \n , two jump conditions are required to make the problem well posed @xmath18         & =   u^+ - u^-      = \\phi,~      \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19     & =    \\beta^+ u_n^+ - \\beta^- u_n^-    =   \\psi,~   \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote their limiting value from the @xmath7 side of the interface @xmath6 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote their limiting value from the @xmath8 side of the interface @xmath6 . \n the derivatives @xmath24 and @xmath25 are evaluated along the outer normal direction on the interface . here \n @xmath26 and @xmath27 is at least @xmath28 continuous . \n equations ( [ theoryeq1])-([jumpcondition2 ] ) define the elliptic interface problem to be solved in the present work .      to avoid the time - consuming mesh generation procedure , like the original mib method \n , we employ the cartesian mesh . \n we also employ the vertex - centered finite volume method , which means that we associates control volumes and unknowns to vertices . \n the control volumes are cubes whose centers are located at the grid points and whose sides intercept at the midpoints between grid points , which is illustrated by the left chart of figure [ cv ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in both cases , the second order derivatives of @xmath29 blow up at the origin , making the solution only @xmath4 continuous in @xmath8 . since the differential form , eq . \n ( [ theoryeq1 ] ) , is of second order for the diffusion term , mathematically , eq . \n ( [ theoryeq1 ] ) is invalid even though the underlying conservation law is still valid . \n however , it is noticed that the equivalent term in the integral form , eq . \n ( [ integralform1 ] ) , involves only the first order derivative . \n this reduction of the derivative order is important in dealing with solution which changes so rapidly in space that the spatial derivative does not exist . for these reasons , \n the finite volume method is preferred over the finite difference method in solving problems whose solution has less regularity and exhibits local discontinuities .    in case 8(a ) , we choose constant diffusive coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath23 , whereas in case 8(b ) , @xmath21 and @xmath23 are both position dependent . the numerical solutions and the @xmath0 errors of case 8(a ) and case 8(b ) are depicted in figure [ h2sphere_pic ] and figure [ h2ellipsoid_pic ] , respectively . from the numerical results collected in table [ h2sphere_tab ] and table [ h2ellipsoid_tab ] \n , it is seen that the second order accuracy in both cases are essentially obtained . \n in this work , we introduce the finite volume formulation of matched interface and boundary method ( mib - fvm ) for solving elliptic interface problems arising from modeling material interface in practice . much effort has been taken to develop advanced numerical schemes for such problems in the past few decades . \n however , challenges still remain in this field . \n one of the challenge concerns the development of methods with higher order accuracy . \n another challenge is to develop methods for dealing with complex interface geometries . \n the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method has been proved to be able to deal with these challenges . however , since the mib method is based on the collocation formulation , it does not work well for solutions with low regularity . \n based on the integral form rather than the differential form , the finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for being able to deal with problems with low regularity solutions and better conserve mass and flux . \n second order finite volume methods have also been formulated in literature for elliptic interface problems \n . motivated by these successes , we propose the present mib - fvm to take the advantages of mib and fvm . \n to reduce the computational cost of mesh generation , we utilize the cartesian mesh , although the proposed mib - fvm can be realized on irregular meshes as well . \n we also employ the vertex -

{"ContextTokens": 3523, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "the most successful p - process models available to - date call for the synthesis of the stable neutron - deficient nuclides heavier than fe in the o / ne layers of type ii supernovae ( snii ) ( rayet et al . \n 1995 , hereafter rahpn ) . in spite of their many virtues in reproducing the solar - system p - nuclide abundance distribution , \n they however suffer from some shortcomings . \n one of them concerns their persistent underproduction of the light mo ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and ru ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) p - isotopes . \n some have tried to remedy this situation with exotic solutions , calling in particular for accreting neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. schatz et al . 1998 ) . \n the level of the contribution of such sites to the solar system content of the nuclides of concern here is quite impossible to assess in any reliable way . \n in contrast , it has been emphasized many times over the last decade that the problem might just be due to some misrepresentation of the production in the he - burning core of massive stars of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process ( e.g. arnould et al . \n 1998 ) . \n the aim of this letter is to scrutinize the latter , ` non - exotic ' , solution in a quantitative way by duly taking into account the uncertainties that still affect the rate of the @xmath1 reaction , as they appear in the nacre compilation of reaction rates ( angulo et al . \n clearly , these uncertainties in the key neutron producer in conditions obtained during central he burning in massive stars have a direct impact on the predicted abundances of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , as already analyzed quantitatively by meynet & arnould ( 1993 ) . another potential embarassment of the p - process predictions identified by rahpn is a snii overproduction of oxygen relative to the p - nuclides . we show that this problem might be cured along with the one of the underproduction of the light mo and ru isotopes if the @xmath1 rate is modified adequately within a range permitted by the nacre compilation . for the sake of illustration \n , we just discuss here the case of a 25 m@xmath6 solar metallicity ( @xmath7 ) star . \n a more complete study dealing in particular with a set of stars with different masses and metallicities , and analyzing the impact of the uncertainties in the rates of a variety of reactions , is currently under way . \n the adopted input physics is briefly described in sect . 2 , and some results are presented in sect . \n conclusions are drawn in sect . \n the calculations reported here are based on a model for a @xmath8 8 m@xmath6 helium star already considered by rahpn . \n it corresponds to a main sequence mass of about 25 m@xmath6 and is evolved from the beginning of core helium burning to the supernova explosion . \n details about this model can be found in hashimoto ( 1995 ) , and are summarized in rahpn . as in rahpn , \n 20 o / ne - rich layers with explosion temperatures peaking in the ( 1.8 - 3.3)@xmath9 k range are selected as the p - process layers ( ppls ) . \n their total mass is approximately 0.58  m@xmath6 . \n the deepest ppl is located at a mass of about 1.94  m@xmath6 , which is far enough from the mass cut for all the nuclides produced in this region to be ejected during the explosion . \n the p - process reaction network and its numerical solver are described by rahpn . \n a series of their selected nuclear reaction rates are updated , however . in particular , the nacre ` adopted ' rates are used for charged particle captures by nuclei up to @xmath10 . for heavier targets , \n the rates predicted by the hauser - feshbach code most ( goriely 1997 ) are used , except for the experimentally - based neutron capture rates provided by beer et al . \n ( 1992 ) .    as already pointed out in sect . 1 \n , we turn our special attention to the impact of the uncertainties remaining in the rate of @xmath1 . for temperatures of about @xmath11 k at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) , \n the nacre upper limit on this rate is 50 - 500 times larger than the ` adopted ' value ( see angulo et al . \n 1999 for details ) . in order to quantify the consequences of this situation for the predicted abundance distribution of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , and ultimately for the p - nuclide yields themselves \n , we perform nucleosynthesis calculations for five different rates ranging from the nacre adopted value to its upper limit . \n these rates , labelled r@xmath12 ( @xmath13=1 to 5 ) in the following , are defined and displayed in fig .  1 . \n cross section ( j.w . \n hammer & m. jaeger , private communication ) . \n rate estimates based on these new data are not available yet . \n it seems , however , that the revised upper limit might range somewhere between r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 they are used in the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star referred to above to calculate the abundances of the s - process nuclides at the end of core he burning . \n the results are shown in fig .  2 for the s - only nuclides . \n use of r@xmath17 leads to the classical ` weak ' s - process component pattern ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) , exhibiting a decrease of the overproduction ( with respect to solar ) of the s - nuclides by a factor ranging from @xmath18100 to about unity when the mass number @xmath19 increases from about 70 to 100 . in the heavier mass range , \n the s - process ` main component ' supposed to originate from low- or intermediate - mass stars takes over . \n this ` canonical ' picture changes gradually with an increase of the @xmath1 rate , more @xmath20 having time to burn , releasing more neutrons , before he exhaustion in the core . \n the direct result of this is a steady increase of the overproduction of heavier and heavier s - nuclides . \n for example , with the extreme r@xmath21 rate , the overproduction factor increases from @xmath22 to @xmath23 for @xmath19 varying from about 70 to 90 , before decreasing to a value around unity for @xmath24 only .    at first sight \n , it might be felt that the s - process abundance distributions obtained with large enough r@xmath12 values exhibit some unwanted or embarrassing features . \n one of these concerns the underproduction of the @xmath25 s - nuclides relative to the @xmath26 ones . \n another one relates to the fact that a more or less substantial production of heavy s - nuclides ( like in the ba region ) would screw up the pattern of the s - process main component ascribed to lower - mass stars . in our opinion \n , none of these predictions can really act as a deterrent to @xmath1 rates substantially in excess of r@xmath17 . on the one hand , \n the absence of ab initio self - consistent calculations of the s - process in low- and intermediate mass stars does not allow at this time to predict the exact shape of the main s - process component which is classically assigned to these stars . as a consequence , a contribution to the main component by massive stars can not be excluded , even if it may disturb some traditional views on the subject . on the other hand , \n the reduction of the light s - process nuclide production by massive stars could well be compensated by their increased synthesis by some low- or intermediate - mass stars when rates larger than r@xmath17 are considered ( goriely & mowlavi 2000 ) . \n the classical @xmath27 overproduction problem found in the massive star s - process ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) could also be eased with increased @xmath1 rates , as demonstrated by fig .  2 . \n for these same rates , note that @xmath27 is not overproduced either in some of the calculations of goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) which predict high yields of the other light s - nuclides . \n figure  2 also suggests that a discrepancy , if any , between the observed ba overabundance in the sn1987a ejecta and the model predictions could be cured in a natural way by increasing the adopted @xmath1 rate . \n the [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratio is observationally still quite uncertain , values between about 5 and 20 having been reported ( e.g. mazzali & chugai 1995 ) . \n prantzos et al . ( 1988 ) have calculated lower values of 2.6 to 4.7 with the @xmath1 rate of fowler et al . \n this rate is on average comparable to r@xmath17 in the temperature range of relevance to the s - process . \n we have not conducted any new s - process calculation in a specific sn1987a progenitor model . instead , some rough estimates based on the procedure of prantzos et al . \n ( 1988 ) in which their adopted s - process ba mass fraction is replaced by the one calculated for the model star adopted here have been made . \n assuming that the lmc metallicity is one third of the solar one , we predict [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratios from 3 to 14 for rates increasing from r@xmath17 to r@xmath30 . \n theory could thus account for quite substantial sn1987a ba productions with high enough @xmath1 rates ( compatible with the nacre data ) . \n as discussed by rahpn , it is a fair approximation to adopt the s - process abundance distributions of fig .  2 as seeds for the p - process . \n for the @xmath31 species , the initial abundances in the ppls are taken from the detailed stellar models . \n although these models have been obtained with rates that may differ from the nacre ones adopted here , this inconsistency is certainly not responsible for any intolerable distorsion in the predicted s - process seeds or p - process yields . \n the various seed abundances of fig .  2 are used to compute the production of the p - nuclides in the ppls of the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star considered here . as in rahpn \n , the abundance of a p - nuclide @xmath13 is characterized by its mean overproduction factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is its solar mass fraction ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass fraction of isotope @xmath13 at the mass coordinate @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the total mass of the ppls , the sum running over all the ppls ( @xmath38 corresponds to the bottom layer ) . \n an overproduction factor averaged over all 35 p - nuclei is calculated as @xmath39 , and is a measure of the global p - nuclide enrichment in the ppls . \n so , if the computed p - nuclei abundance distribution were exactly solar , the normalized mean overproduction factor @xmath40 would be equal to unity for all @xmath13 . \n figure 3 shows the normalised p - nuclide overproduction factors derived from the seed abundance distributions calculated with the @xmath1 rates r@xmath17 , r@xmath41 and r@xmath21 . \n changes in the shape of the p - nuclide abundance distribution are clearly noticeable , at least for @xmath42 . \n the use of r@xmath17 leads to a more or less substantial underproduction of not only @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a ` classical ' result in p - process studies ( see rahpn ) , but also of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which was not predicted in previous calculations . \n this new feature directly relates to the larger abundances around @xmath45 used by rahpn ( dashed curve in fig . \n 2 ) , in contrast to the much flatter seed distribution obtained with r@xmath17 . \n this kr - sr - mo - ru trough is gradually reduced , and in fact essentially disappears , for @xmath1 rates of the order or in excess of r@xmath41 . \n this situation is most clearly illustrated by fig . \n 4 . in these very same conditions , \n @xmath40 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 comes much closer to unity as well . \n it has to be noticed that this situation does not result from a stronger production of these two nuclides by the p - process , but instead from their increased initial abundances associated with a more efficient s - process when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 . \n in contrast , the @xmath40 pattern does not depend on the adopted @xmath1 rate for @xmath48 . \n this is expected from a mere inspection of the s - nuclide seed distributions displayed in fig .  2 . \n in particular , @xmath49 and @xmath50 remain underproduced . \n this can not be considered as an embarassment as these two nuclides can emerge from the s - process in low- or intermediate - mass stars . \n in addition , the overall efficiency of the p - nuclide production substantially increases with increasing @xmath20 burning rates . \n more specifically , @xmath51 is multiplied by a factor of about 15 when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 . \n this could largely ease , and even solve , the problem of the relative underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen identified by rahpn . \n for their considered 25 m@xmath6 model star calculated with the @xmath52 rate from caughlan et al . \n ( 1985 ) , they obtain @xmath53 and report a value of 4.4 for the ratio of the oxygen to p - process yields . \n this value would come close to unity for @xmath1 rates in the vicinity of r@xmath41-r@xmath14 , as the p - nuclides would be about 3 to 6 times more produced than in rahpn . \n this letter makes plausible that the long - standing puzzle of the underproduction with respect to solar of the p - isotopes of mo and ru in snii explosions could be quite naturally solved by just assuming an increase of the @xmath1 rate over its ` nominal ' value . \n more specifically , this could be achieved by multiplying the nacre ` adopted ' rate by factors of about 10 to 50 in the temperature range at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars . \n these factors are well within the uncertainties reported by nacre . as an important bonus , \n this increased rate would also largely avoid ( i ) the underproduction of @xmath43 and of @xmath44 which we predict here for the first time to be concomitant to the light mo and ru one , ( ii ) the too low production of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and ( iii ) the overall underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen noted by rahpn . in direct relation with an increased @xmath1 rate , more s - process ba \n could also be ejected by snii events . \n our predictions confortably overlap the range of ba overabundances reported for sn1987 . \n this array of pleasing features has of course not to be viewed as a proof of the validity of the assumption that the true @xmath1 rate is higher than usually thought . \n it may just be a hint that there might be ways around exotic solutions . \n this conclusion applies at least if one relies on the simplistic ( and the only ones to be available for our purpose ) supernova models used here and in previous p - process calculations ( see rahpn et references therein ) , as well as in a myriad of other explosive nucleosynthesis calculations .", "StartTimeOffset": 3988808991002, "RequestID": "e7b67edbc561f19ebf7ca6e5d11d6609c5bd1366", "TotalTokens": 3656}
{"ContextTokens": 2081, "GeneratedTokens": 112, "SynthesizedBody": "edison s invention of direct current ( dc ) preceeded tesla s invention of alternating current ( ac ) . however , once there were two possible modes of power available , an inevitable debate on the merits and demerits of the two started that led to what is called the `` war of currents '' . \n the inventor s became adversaries with edison promoting direct current ( dc ) for electric power distribution over the alternating current ( ac ) . \n the `` war of currents '' got so bitter that both inventors lost a lot of money and rumors have it , their nobel prize @xcite .    today \n the debate is more or less resolved with ac being accepted as the best method for electric power distribution , especially where the power requirement is large . \n it can be appreciated that since direct current can not be trivially stepped up or stepped down , the same voltage level is transmitted as required by the load . \n this resulted in large transmission losses . \n transmission loss takes place due to heat dissipation along the current carrying wires used for delivering power from generation point to consumer . \n the initial transmission networks laid were of copper , which is one of the best conductors with low resistivity . even with low resitivity , since the length of the transmission wires involved are large , they offered finite and non - negligiable resitance . thus introducing power loss during transmission . \n mathematically power dissipated is gien as @xmath0 where i , @xmath1 , l and a are the rms ( root mean square ) current , wire s resistivity , it s length and cross - sectional area respectively . \n thus , for transmitting a given power with minimum power loss , one would have to reduce the current while increasing the voltage . \n this is exactly what a transformer does for ac . \n thus for dc , transmission loss can only be minimised by using thicker copper wires . in turn \n , only fairly low dc power can be transmitted . since , \n ac power can be stepped - up and down easily using transformers , the issue of transmission loss over thinner wires can be economically addressed .    with industrialization and increasing demands for higher levels of power , \n even a ac distribution is not enough . \n hence , today distribution has moved to polyphase ( m ) distribution . \n polyphase voltages are also ac voltages but made up of multiple sinosudial varying voltages . \n of the possible polyphases , the three - phase supply is the most popular . \n it refers to three voltages that differ in phase by @xmath2 degrees from each other . \n the voltages go through their maxima in a regular order , after every @xmath3 . \n the phase sequence are named ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' .    0.5 cm 0.5 cm \n the three phases are generally distributed using three wires . \n the phases are separated or collected at the load side using special transformers , called `` star '' or `` delta '' transformers ( fig  1a ) . \n each wire has the same current carrying capability as in case of single phase supply . \n however , the power delivered at the load can be far greater depending on how the two potential levels are selected . \n consider , in the star transformer the load is connected between point ` a ' and neutral ( fig  1b ) the output waveform would be that of phase a , with the neutral point acting as ` zero potential ' point . \n the power delivered to the load is @xmath4 . \n however , if the load is connected between point ` a ' and ` b ' , the net potential difference can be found ( first in general ) from    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the peak voltage and @xmath7 the phase difference between the two phases . for a 2-phase supply , \n where the phase difference between the two waveforms is @xmath8 , the potential difference would be @xmath9 this mathematics is graphically represented in fig  2 . \n it can be appreciated that the power delivered to the load now would be @xmath10 . \n this example shows how polyphase transmissions delivers more power .    while these are important issues to be appreciated by a physicist setting up a laboratory with instruments that require high power , schools and colleges do not help develop this concept with hand - on experimentation for fear of possible accidents that could even prove fatal . \n while kits are present in engineering colleges for electrical engineering , not much is found in the literature in way of simple experiemnts for physics and electronics students . in this direction , we have designed and tested a simple circuit , where two phases are generated from a sinusodial wave taken from a function generator . \n the proposed circuit requires three opamps , of which the first opamp is assembled in an inverting configuration @xcite . the sinusodial input from a function generator ( shown in fig  3 as ` 1 ' ) is given as an input to this inverting amplifier . \n this signal also acts as one of the 3 phases , namely phase a. the gain of this amplifier is kept as unity with @xmath11 . \n this circuit acts as a buffer preventing any loading by successive circuits and introduces a phase change of @xmath8 between output and input waveforms ( as indicative of the name `` inverting '' amplifier ) . \n the rc circuit is designed to introduce a phase difference of @xmath3 for the selected frequency . however , \n a single combination of rc can at the most introduce a phase difference equal to or less than @xmath12 . \n hence , two sections are used , with each rc section introducing a phase shift of @xmath13 \n . the values of r and c are selected using the formula @xcite @xmath14    _ in our study , for an 5khz wave provided from the function generator , we selected @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n _ hence points ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' of the circuit would be @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively out of phase with respect to the input . \n the impedence networks act as potential dividers and hence the voltage levels at ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' would be lower than that given as input . since the three phases would have the same amplitude , the signals at ` 3 ' and ` \n 4 ' would have to be amplified . \n we use as inverting amplifier again for point ` 4 ' . \n the voltage gain of this amplifier is give by @xmath19 . \n hence , @xmath20 has to be varied till the voltage signals amplitude is identical to the input signal . \n also , this inverting amplifier introduces a phase change of @xmath8 . the net phase difference \n hence would be @xmath21 which is nothing but a phase difference of @xmath22 . \n the output of this op amp circuit would be phase ` b ' . \n similar amplitude correction is required for the wave collected at point ` 3 ' . however , here we select a non - inverting amplifier circuit whose gain is given as @xmath23 and as the name suggests does not introduce any further phase shifts _ ( @xmath20 and @xmath24 used were @xmath25 pots and typically had values greater than @xmath26)_. hence , the net shift at the output remains the same as that at point ` 3 ' at @xmath27 or @xmath28 . \n this is phase c of the simulated 3-phase supply . \n fig  4 shows the waveforms ( phase a and c ) as captured by picoscope ( model 2202 ) . \n since the model only gives dual trace , only two waves can be shown simultaneously . however , the data captured by picoscope shows all three phases simultaneously . \n curve fitting these data points give the phase difference between the various phases to be 1.95radians or @xmath29 . also , the peak voltage ( @xmath6 ) also works out to be 1.58v .    while the circuits achieves the purpose of mimicing a 3-phase supply , \n experiments can be done to further understand applications of 3-phase supply . \n for example , one can study the rectification and advantage of generating dc from 3-phase supply . \n for this , all one needs is 3 diodes and a load resistance ( see fig  5 ) . \n the output waveform is dc and also notice even without any filtering circuit , the output is continuous with little ripple . \n this is because , as seen by the load , the input frequency is three times that of a single phase supply . \n the ripples in a rectified output is inversely proportional to the frequency @xcite , hence the low ripples here can be understood . \n also , this output gives visual idea and helps in easier understanding that each phase in a 3-phase supply is separated by @xmath3 . in this rectifier circuit , only that diode conducts , for which the phase connected to it has the highest instantaneous potential with respect to the neutral . \n fig  4 shows one phase to have highest potential with repect to the other phases for @xmath3 . \n thus , in one cycle ( @xmath30 ) there would be three peaks of the output dc wave . \n this is visiable in fig  5 . \n a simple circuit has been proposed to demonstrate the behaviour of 3-phase power distribution . \n the simple circuit discussed in this article cost rs ( indian rupee ) 20/- to assemble ( less than a dollar ) and can be a very usual experiment in schools and under - graduate laboratorys to learn more about 3-phase supply and it s application . \n the financial support of u.g.c ( india ) in the form of minor research project no.f.6 - 1(25)/2007(mrp / sc / nrcb ) is gratefully acknowledged . \n the authors would like to express their gratitude to the lab technicians of the department of physics and electronics , s.g.t.b . \n khalsa college , for the help rendered in carrying out the experiment .", "StartTimeOffset": 4007856281041, "RequestID": "2a18fe6162fba934d2343befa3055a4bc978c819", "TotalTokens": 2193}
{"ContextTokens": 3848, "GeneratedTokens": 124, "SynthesizedBody": "numerous astronomical observations have led to the conclusion that the majority of the matter in our universe is invisible , exotic , and nonrelativistic dark matter @xcite . however , it is still unknown what the dark matter is . weakly interacting massive particles  ( wimps ) \n are one of the most attractive dark matter particle candidates @xcite . \n the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a possible wimp candidate theoretically hypothesized beyond the standard model of particle physics . \n there have been a number of experiments that directly search for wimps in our galaxy by looking for wimp  nucleus scattering through nuclear recoil  @xcite .    to date , several experiments ( e.g. , dama @xcite , cogent @xcite , cresst @xcite , and cdms @xcite ) have yielded signals that could be interpreted as being possibly due to wimp interactions . except for the dama experiment , \n the indications of wimp - like signals are not significant at the < 3@xmath0 confidence level , and the same experimental groups or independent groups are planning to confirm these signals . \n however , the result from the dama experiment has attracted attention because the observation of an annual modulation of wimp - like signals with a significance of 9.2@xmath0 has been reported . \n this finding has spurred a continuing debate concerning the observation of wimps over the past 15 years . \n the wimp  nucleon cross sections inferred from the dama modulation are in conflict with limits from other experiments that directly measure the nuclear recoil signals , such as xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , and supercdms  @xcite . \n however , it is possible to explain all these experimental results without conflict because of nontrivial systematic differences in detector responses  @xcite and the commonly used astronomical model for the wimp distribution  @xcite . \n recently jonathan davis of durham university has proposed a new model for the dama annual modulation , which is a sum of two annually modulating components with different phases . \n more specifically , the events are composed of neutrons , which are liberated in the material surrounding the detector by a combination of 8b solar neutrinos and atmospheric muons  @xcite . \n the dama group disagreed with davis s claim because the induced modulation amplitudes from neutrons induced by muons and by neutrinos are less than 9 @xmath1 \n cpd / kg / kev ( 2 @xmath2 \n cpd / kg / kev for neutrons produced in the lead shield ) and less than 2 @xmath3 cpd / kg / kev , respectively from the simulation , and they are less than 0.1% of the modulation amplitude measured by dama / libra @xcite . \n further , barbeau et al criticized davis s claim because a seven order of magnitude discrepancy in the neutron contribution was required @xcite . \n to understand the neutron backgrounds for nai dark matter experiments , we have performed simulations with the geant4 toolkit  @xcite . \n the hadronic models of muon nucleus interaction and muon decay at rest were used in the geant4 simulation , version of 9.6.p02   ( g4muonvdnuclearmodel and g4muonminuscaptureatrest ) . \n we have simulated the cosmic muons and the neutrons induced by simulating muons passing through the rock directly . \n we did not simulate the scintillation and light collection processes inside the crystals because it is not required for the conclusion derived in this study . \n further , we did not simulate the environment neutrons underground because presumably these neutrons will not have annual modulation signals . \n neutrons are produced primarily by the muons in the rock and materials in the detection system . \n these neutrons generate secondary neutrons via hadronic interactions in the materials . \n we simulated all the primary and secondary processes using geant4 simulation program starting with muons passing through the rock . \n we used the muon energy spectrum provided by d.  m.  mei and a.  hime  @xcite , which is given by    @xmath4    where h is the rock slant depth in km.w.e and we used a set of parameters provided by groom _ \n et  al . _ for @xmath5 \n , b , and @xmath6 .        for two different depths at gran sasso and at yangyang laboratory  ( y2l ) we assumed that h=3.1  km.w.e and h=1.8  km.w.e , respectively . \n figure  [ muonsp ] shows muon energy spectra generated at gran sasso  ( black line ) and at y2l  ( red line ) . \n muon average energies are 276  gev and 201  gev for gran sasso and y2l , which are consistent with the measured values  @xcite .      inside the rock of a thickness of @xmath7 \n there is an air - filled cavern whose dimensions are @xmath8 . a hemisphere with a radius of 10 m is assumed and generated muons are incident onto the shielded detector with an angle randomly selected according to an angular distribution proportional to @xmath9 , as shown in figure  [ layout ] . \n the vertex of the muons is generated uniformly inside the square of 20  m@xmath1020  m area at the surface of the hemisphere . \n the size of the square is determined to cover the whole volume of the rock for all the angles of the generated muons . \n figure  [ muonsp ] shows the energy spectrum of generated muons at the hemisphere . \n the muon flux at gran sasso is considered as @xmath11 or @xmath12 and it is @xmath13 or @xmath14 at y2l .          to validate the simulation for the neutron production we compared the neutron \n fluxes entering the cavern , which are produced in the rock . \n we also included neutrons scattered back from the rock wall as well as shielding materials surrounding the detector and reentering the cavern . \n figure  [ neutronsp ] shows the neutron energy spectra at the boundary between the rock and cavern , obtained from the simulation of muon propagation and interaction with materials in the rock . \n there are four different shielding configurations inside the cavern , denoted as 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , defined in section  [ sec3.4 ] , therefore , we can see the effect of the neutrons reflected back from the wall and shielding materials inside the cavern . \n most are dominant below @xmath151  mev and it depends on the outmost shield layer whether it is polyethylene  ( pe ) or not .    according to the simulation results neutron fluxes are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for energies above 1  mev , under shielding configuration 1 at gran sasso and under configuration 4 at y2l , respectively . \n it is in good agreement with geant4 results of version 6.2  @xcite and close to the fluka result  @xcite , @xmath18 , obtained from muon simulation in nacl at boulby . \n we assumed the nai detectors used by dama / libra , and therefore there are 5@xmath105 segmented nai crystals with dimensions of @xmath19 for a single crystal . \n the target nai crystals are inside a 10  cm copper shield and it is additionally surrounded by lead and polyethylene  ( pe ) shields .    to study the shielding effects , we set four different shielding configurations outside the copper shield :    1 . \n lead ( 15  cm ) + pe ( 30  cm ) same as the dama setup 2 . \n pe ( 30  cm ) + lead ( 15  cm ) 3 . \n lead shield only ( 15  cm ) 4 . \n pe ( 5  cm ) + lead ( 15  cm ) + md ( 30  cm ) same as kims - nai setup    shielding configuration 1 represents the dama setup at gran sasso depth , which uses 30  cm thick pe as the outmost shield layer . \n the order of lead and pe shield layers was switched for configuration 2 . \n the shielding effect was also tested with a lead shield only  ( configuration 3 ) . \n figure  [ shield ] shows shielded detector geometries for kims - nai  ( left ) and dama  ( right ) setups . for the kims - nai setup  ( configuration 4 ) , 5  cm thick pe was put inside a lead shield and md outside the lead shield , which is a muon detector filled with mineral oil ( liquid paraffin ) . \n we expect that 30  cm thick md can also shield neutrons as much as the pe shield did in the configuration 1 . \n however , neutrons can also be produced by muon interaction with shielding materials and should be considered in configuring shield layers . \n figure  [ vertexandneutronboundarygeom1 ]  ( left ) shows the primary vertex positions of neutrons in the x - y plane of the shielding configuration 1 , and it is found to be dense in the lead and copper shields . \n the right side of figure  [ vertexandneutronboundarygeom1 ] shows neutron energy spectra at boundaries between different shield layers . \n we defined three different boundaries : rock / cavern  ( thick black line ) , outside copper shield  ( thin red line ) , and between copper and target crystals inside  ( dotted blue line ) . from the neutron spectra we found that the neutrons are built up in the lead and copper shields .        to quantify the effects of neutrons with and without pe inside the lead shield we tested neutron energy spectra at boundaries with configuration 2 , in which we changed the order of shield layers of pe and lead , as explained earlier . \n as shown in figure  [ neutronsatboundariesgeom2 ] neutrons below @xmath1510  mev are reduced dramatically between pe and the copper shield . \n therefore , it is more effective to shield neutrons below @xmath1510  mev by putting the pe shield inside the lead . \n in addition , we tested the shielding effects with respect to shielding configurations by comparing neutron energy spectra from configurations 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 at two different boundaries . \n one boundary is outside the copper shield and another is inside the copper shield . \n results at each boundary are shown in the left and the right of figure  [ shieldingeffect ] . \n there is little difference between configuration 1 and 3 for neutrons below @xmath150.1  mev . \n if we consider the order of magnitude difference in muon fluxes at the depths of gran sasso and y2l , the shielding effect with configuration 2 is very similar to the result with configuration 4 , which used 5  cm thick pe inside the lead shield and 30  cm thick md instead of pe in configuration 1 . as shown in the left of figure  [ shieldingeffect ] , \n even 5  cm thick pe inside the lead is effective to shield neutrons below @xmath151  mev . \n accordingly , 30  cm thick pe inside the lead shield  ( configuration 2 ) is the most effective in shielding intermediate neutrons compared to other configurations .      from the simulation studies described in sections  [ sec3.3 ] and [ sec3.4 ] \n , we obtained the neutron flux at the boundaries of the shield layers and tested the shielding effect in each shielding material . \n we now consider the nuclear recoil event in nai crystals due to neutron backgrounds .        because we have 5@xmath105 segmented nai crystals an event can deposit its energy in two or more crystals . \n therefore , we call an event a single hit event when it deposits the energy in a single nai crystal and a multiple hit event when it exhibits energy deposition in two or more nai crystals . figure  [ singleedep ] shows the spectra of energy deposited in nai crystals , which include not only nuclear recoil but also electromagnetic energy deposition . the thick black line represents all events that deposited energy in the nai crystal and the dotted black line represents single hit events \n . the green color represents energy deposited by all nuclear recoil events , and the blue color represents results for nuclear recoil single events only . \n the nuclear recoil events contribute only at the lowest energies . \n figure  [ singleedep ] is obtained from the simulation with shielding configuration 1 at gran sasso , and for nuclear recoil single hit events it is much lower than the @xmath20 cpd level for energies below 100  kev  ( inset ) . \n the left of figure  [ nuclearrecoil ] shows the spectra of visible energy deposited by all single hit events  ( dotted black line ) , using configuration 1 . \n the thick blue line represents results from nuclear recoil single hit events only . \n a nuclear recoil event yields a lower number of scintillation photons than an electron recoil events for the same energy deposition . \n measurements of the quenching factors for na and i recoils in nai(tl ) crystals have been reported and are @xmath1525 and @xmath1510@xmath21 , respectively  @xcite . therefore , we applied 0.25 and 0.1 as quenching factors for na and i in the simulation . the right graph in figure  [ nuclearrecoil ] \n depicts the relationship between nuclear recoil energy and neutron kinetic energy as a scatter plot , and the na and i recoils are separated . \n table  [ result ] shows the summarized results for single hit event rates for the four shielding configurations . \n single hit events include electromagnetic energy deposition as well as nuclear recoil energy deposition . \n the single hit event rates by the nuclear recoil event only are also obtained . \n the nuclear recoil single hit event rates at y2l and gran sasso are ( 4.59@xmath221.05)@xmath23 and ( 8.69@xmath221.45)@xmath24 dru , respectively , and all single hit events rates are on the order of @xmath20 and @xmath25 dru for configurations 4 and 1 . \n .neutron background events in dru unit ( events / day / kg / kev ) in 5@xmath105 segmented nai crystals with different shielding configurations at two different underground sites [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n as shown in table  [ result ] , it is very unlikely that the neutrons are the main source for the dama annual modulation , which was reported as ( 0.0112@xmath220.0012 ) cpd / kg / kev in the ( 2 - 6 )  kev energy interval of the modulation amplitude @xcite . \n the dama group refuted davis s claim because the induced modulation amplitudes from neutrons induced by muons and by neutrinos are less than 9 @xmath1 \n cpd / kg / kev ( 2 @xmath2 \n cpd / kg / kev for neutrons produced in the lead shield ) and less than 2 @xmath3 \n cpd / kg / kev , respectively from the simulation , and they are less than 0.1% of the modulation amplitude measured by dama / libra  @xcite . \n 00 e.  komatsu _ et al . \n _ ( wmap collaboration ) , astrophys . \n j. suppl . 192 \n ( 2011 ) 18 . \n p.  a.  r.  ade _ et al . \n _ (

frame '' ) . \n the first two modes with the lowest frequencies ( 49 and 52hz ) are likely to shift when gpi is attached to the telescope . \n this is one of the reasons why no tmds have been installed yet . \n the decision was taken to revisit this study once enough on - telescope experience is gained to evaluate if tmds are required . to this point \n no tmds are installed and so far it seems that no tmds are required . \n the main vibration line in our error budget ( 60hz ) is not on a structural mode assuming that the two low frequency structural modes of gpi have not shifted through the mounting at the telescope in an unfortunate way . \n the topic of vibration in general is complex and is a topic prone to misunderstandings between mechanics , opticians , electrical engineers and scientists . \n an awareness of context and language is critical in this interdisciplinary field . coordinating a sensible and successful vibration mitigation effort in an effective way \n is a challenge and requires its resources and roles such as an interconnected project manager and a `` vibration officer '' . \n there is a constant struggle with hard decisions : does it make sense to spend the extra dollar to finish a study that runs out of funding ? and avoiding the `` sunk cost '' effect in a `` prototype '' development environment is never easy . \n gpi has the strongest constraints on its wavefront error budget of all gemini south instruments and certainly has risen the observatory s awareness of vibrations in the telescope environment . \n the mitigation using an lqg controller for both pointing and focus has been implemented successfully . \n this is an intriguing demonstration of how new technologies can be used to mitigate vibration effects from the controller side . in that sense , using the lqg controller , the impact of the cryocooler vibrations on gpi s performance is low if not negligible . \n the only exception is the high - order wavefront front sensor of the cal unit . \n it is a mach - zehnder type interferometer and the loss in fringe contrast due to the vibration prevents its commissioning . \n fortunately , this is not critical , since the basic functionalities of the cal ( keeping the star bore - sight , and low - order wavefront sensing ) are not impacted . \n furthermore , the gpi team has developed further alternatives to treat ncpa such as speckle - nulling . and so far , even though other instruments such as gems _ can _ see the vibration signal on their wavefront sensors , it seems that there is no impact on performance . \n nevertheless , a `` root treatment '' is always preferable and it is in the observatory s natural interest to keep its `` vibration '' spectra as clean as possible . \n recently , sunpower has developed an active cancellation system ( acs ) as add - on for its gt cryocooler series and we are investigating to upgrade our coolers with it . \n there is widespread use of tmds for aircrafts , machinery , in the car industry , for trains and railways , buildings , power lines and in optical systems . and certainly there is still plenty of room to make a better use of these devices in the field of astronomical instrumentation and optical telescopes .    a good infrastructure of acceleration sensors is required to effectively understand and solve unwanted vibrations . \n otherwise measurements are difficult to obtain and to confirm , and resources of the observatory are wasted in large overheads . in the case of the gemini observatory it seems recommendable to have at least 5 sensors around the cell of m1 ( and \n one could dream about having each hydraulic m1 actuator equipped with a sensor ) . \n elts will take this matter ( hopefully ) serious , plan for an integrated design and maybe feature a dedicated `` vibration control room '' . \n as gpi and other ( xao ) instruments can always be seen as pathfinders for future telescopes and instrumentation , sharing our challenges is hopefully helpful to find suitable solutions in other complex environments . \n gpi can serve as a good example for the successful implementation of a mitigation strategy and for how powerful mitigation strategies such as lgq filtering of the wavefront have become . \n the authors thank paul langlois for suggestions and improvements on the figures . \n the gemini observatory is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf on behalf of the gemini partnership : the national science foundation ( united states ) , the national research council ( canada ) , conicyt ( chile ) , the australian research council ( australia ) , ministrio da cincia , tecnologia e inovao ( brazil ) and ministerio de ciencia , tecnologa e innovacin productiva ( argentina ) \n .      , b. , graham , j.  r. , ingraham , p. , konopacky , q. , marois , c. , perrin , m. , poyneer , l. , bauman , b. , barman , t. , burrows , a. , cardwell , a. , chilcote , j. , de rosa , r.  j. , dillon , d. , doyon , r. , dunn , j. , erikson , d. , fitzgerald , m. , gavel , d. , goodsell , s. , hartung , m. , hibon , p. , kalas , p.  g. , larkin , j. , maire , j. , marchis , f. , marley , m. , mcbride , j. , millar -

{"ContextTokens": 3790, "GeneratedTokens": 192, "SynthesizedBody": "the most attractive property of topologically - nontrivial insulating materials is the presence of the electronic chiral states at their surface , forming the so - called dirac cone , which gives rise to the quantized non - dissipative and fully spin - polarized surface current  @xcite . \n this surface property is exploited in band structure calculations , which intend to prove the trivial or nontrivial topology of a given system  @xcite . since the topology is directly related to the bulk band structure , those approaches which can predict the topological class of a given material based on purely bulk information are more practical as being computationally less demanding compared to realistic surface calculations . \n thus , in the search for novel materials such theoretical approaches where the topological phase transition can be straightforwardly investigated in the bulk are very useful tools , that are able to provide supporting data to motivate experimental investigations on unexplored new compounds . \n + indeed , from the point of view of the band structure , the manifestation of the trivial - nontrivial phase transition is always marked by the existence of a dirac point , independently on the nature of the order parameter responsible for the assignment of a given material to a certain topological class . \n in contrast to expensive and tedious experimental methods , in theoretical studies these parameters can be easily tuned . \n for example , the trivial - nontrivial phase transition can be simply induced by changing the amplitude of the spin - orbit coupling , or the crystal - field splitting ( e.g. through the change of the lattice constant )  @xcite . in case of well - defined bloch states one \n can also make use of the parity analysis of the eigenstates  @xcite . \n however , the most problematic cases are those , where the local translational symmetry is broken due to random fluctuations of certain degrees of freedom , which are inevitably always present in real materials \n . these fluctuations can be caused by random chemical disorder , various dynamical fluctuations as e.g. phonons or magnons , or strong local electron correlations which are specific for systems with strong spin - orbit coupling . \n all these mechanisms lead to a localization of the electronic states which can no longer be expressed in the form of bloch waves . \n this makes the straightforward analysis of the parity of the eigenstates inapplicable . \n also , in the ordered class of materials so far only a few stable non - trivial compounds have been found . \n therefore , the search for topological insulators among disordered systems will gain an increased importance . \n this will be especially true for materials with application relevance , since disordered systems are easier to be mass produced , and despite structural disorder their topological edge states are robustly protected against any time - reversal symmetric perturbation . \n hence , by extending our field of interest towards disordered systems many new topologically - nontrivial materials can be found . \n + the practical tools for the first - principles studies on the disordered systems are typically provided by the effective mean - field theories , such as e.g. the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite or via the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite . the former takes into account the local dynamical electronic correlations , and the latter efficiently describes the random chemical disorder . \n each implementation of the mean - field theory incorporates the effect of a certain type of random fluctuations in the form of an energy - dependent complex - valued local potential ( the so - called self - energy ) added to the real - valued lattice - symmetric kohn - sham potential . \n this leads to an energy - dependent shift and to a broadening of the electronic states , seen in the band structures calculated with dmft or cpa . \n + in the following we would like to demonstrate the power of the cpa as a practical adiabatic technique , which allows to determine the topological class of a given compound by its gradual transformation into another system , for which the topological class is already well established . \n in contrast to complicated surface calculations such bulk simulations can be easily performed within the bulk regime , thus being rather simple and reliable . \n in addition , by observing the topological phase transition in the bulk provides a wide range of new information regarding the scenario occurring on the borderline between non - trivial and trivial systems , where the mixing and interdiffusion often takes place in the quantum well structure formed by these two materials  @xcite . \n + in the following example we will consider the sequence of random alloys between the prototypical non - trivial gapless semiconductor hgte and the trivial zns insulator , which are both non - magnetic binaries of the zinc - blende type . \n since zn is isovalent to hg and s to te , the intermediate alloys ( hg@xmath0zn@xmath1)(te@xmath0s@xmath1 ) must be non - magnetic semiconductors , thus keeping the time - reversal symmetry of the total wave function . \n although here we are investigating the aforementioned alloy series , we have to point out that all features of the topological phase transition shown in the current work can be transferred with no restriction to other systems , like for e.g. the rich family of the ternary heusler semiconductors where many topologically non - trivial compounds where already identified  @xcite . \n until now the cpa ( and its extensions ) remains the only widely applicable alloy technique which incorporates the effects of the energy - dependent shift and lifetime broadening . \n both are essential features of the electron localization caused by chemical disorder , which are not accessible via other theories , as e.g. the vca ( virtual crystal approximation )  @xcite or supercell calculations . \n although the cpa method has lots of advantages , it has a typical shortcoming , namely in its original `` single - site '' formulation the effect of the local environment is absent . \n this bottleneck of cpa can be remediated , however , by employing its non - local extensions  @xcite . \n regardless , we would like to emphasize that for the case of isovalent substitution the single - site cpa remains a quite good approximation even in the diluted limit , since the isovalent atoms intermix without additional environmental preference as long as the zinc - blende type crystal structure is preserved . + all electronic structure and spin - hall transport coefficient calculations presented below were carried out using the fully - relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method implemented within the spr - kkr package  @xcite employing the density functional theory framework . \n the exchange and correlation was treated using the vosko - wilk - nusair form of the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite . \n lda is known for its typical underestimation of the band gaps of semiconductors . however , in case of our study this issue is not critical , since the observed trends are qualitatively well described even with lda . \n the lattice constants for the alloys were derived by linear interpolation between the experimental lattice parameters of the pure hgte and zns compounds as a function of the concentration of the constituents . due to the multiple - scattering construction of the green s function  @xcite , \n the method provides a suitable base for mean - field approaches like cpa . since the electronic structure of disordered materials in general \n does not show well defined bloch eigenstates , their electronic structure is described by the bloch - spectral function ( bsf ) defined by the imaginary part of the alloy green s function that is diagonal in momentum space  @xcite . \n in order to study the topological phase transition in bulk 3d materials , we have performed band structure calculations and we have investigated the spin - resolved transport properties of several quaternary alloys in the series of ( hg@xmath0zn@xmath1)(te@xmath0s@xmath1 ) . \n first , we present the analysis of the bsf computed for the most relevant alloy compositions , which are shown in fig.[fig : bns ] .    ) in the alloy series ( hg@xmath0zn@xmath1)(te@xmath0s@xmath1 ) . \n the critical composition @xmath6 corresponds to the topological phase transition marked by a dirac cone . ]    since the band structure of pure hgte ( @xmath7 ) was established long ago  @xcite , here we just briefly mention the most characteristic features in the vicinity of the @xmath8 point : the te @xmath9-band is split due to spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) into a @xmath10 state sitting right at @xmath11 and a @xmath12 state , which is located about 1.2  ev below @xmath10 . \n the hg @xmath13-band corresponding to @xmath14 is placed by the crystal field ( cf ) between the two aforementioned states , at about -0.8  ev from @xmath11 . \n this negative value , often named `` band inversion '' , drives hgte into a non - trivial class , resulting from the combined effect of the strong soc and small cf . for \n @xmath15 the symmetry analysis can not be applied directly , since there are no pure bloch eigenstates , i.e. in the disordered regime the delta - like poles of the bsf turn into overlapping lorentzians spread over the whole @xmath16-space . \n however , it is still interesting to trace the evolution of their maxima in analogy to the dispersion relation @xmath17 of the pure material . by calculations \n we will show that the soc and cf can be tuned as a function of composition  @xcite . upon gradual substitution of hg with zn , and te with s we effectively decrease the soc and increase the cf . \n hence , both @xmath12- and @xmath14-like states rise in energy ( see fig.[fig : bns ] ) . in the zns - poor regime the decrease of soc acts very efficiently on the bsf , and at about @xmath18 the @xmath12-like state touches the @xmath14-like state at roughly -0.5  ev below @xmath11 . \n as far as there is no change of occupancies this does not affect the topological class of the system . by further substitution the @xmath14 state continues to rise towards @xmath11 , being strongly influenced by the cf , whereas the effective decrease of soc does not effect the @xmath12-like state considerably . \n as shown by the snapshot at the intermediate concentration @xmath19 , the band alignment in this regime is equivalent to the original pure hgte case . \n + at the `` critical '' concentration of the random substitution @xmath6 the system undergoes a topological phase transition manifested by the dirac cone formed by a mixture of @xmath10- and @xmath14-like states . \n obviously the edge states with linear dispersion at the surface of a topological insulator and the states forming the dirac cone in the disordered bulk manifest the same transition mechanism . \n the only qualitative difference is that due to the bulk translational symmetry , we observe two replica of dirac cones with opposite spins superimposed , whereas due to the break of space - reversal symmetry at the surface only a single cone remains , which exposes the adiabatic spin - current . \n + in the zns - rich regime ( @xmath4 ) which is topologically trivial due to the emptying of @xmath14-symmetric state , the evolution of the energy levels are basically unaffected by  @xmath5 : @xmath12 is pinned to @xmath10 at @xmath11 due to vanishing soc , and the unoccupied @xmath14 state continues to move up increasing the band gap width . \n it is easy to see that in this way we will arrive to the band structure of pure zns , which is rather well known  @xcite . within this regime \n the electronic structure is close to the topologically `` intermediate '' pure compounds similar to cdte  @xcite or cdse  @xcite , which are close to the borderline of trivial and topological insulators . \n + the energy distribution of the lifetime broadening can be understood by noticing that it scales with the band curvature , i.e. with the effective mass . \n indeed , the corresponding shades represent a weighted superposition of parabolic - like heavy bands exhibited by both pure hgte and zns . \n in contrast to this , the appearance of bloch - like states with linear dispersion , i.e . the massless states are essentially a new ordering feature arising from the quantum interference . \n this situation is very evident for the critical composition @xmath20=0.5 which corresponds to the appearance of the conical dispersion and simultaneously most strongly influenced by disorder . \n + to verify that this is indeed a topological phase transition , in the following we will analyze the tensor of residual conductivity calculated by means of the general kubo and kubo - steda formalism  @xcite . in order to access the spin - resolved components @xmath21 of the transversal conductivity , where the spin polarization @xmath22 refers to the @xmath23-axis \n , we employed a relativistic scheme suggested recently  @xcite . as it follows from fig.[fig : \n sig ]  ( a ) , the diagonal component @xmath24    , black ) and spin - projected off - diagonal ( @xmath25 , red ) components of the conductivity tensor calculated as a function of @xmath5 in the disordered ( hg@xmath0zn@xmath1)(te@xmath0s@xmath1 ) alloy series . \n these results are compared to the quantum of the 3d spin - hall conductivity marked by the blue line . \n ( b ) the spin - hall ratio @xmath25/@xmath24 plotted as a function of composition @xmath5.,title=\"fig : \" ] + , black ) and spin - projected off - diagonal ( @xmath25 , red ) components of the conductivity tensor calculated as a function of @xmath5 in the disordered ( hg@xmath0zn@xmath1)(te@xmath0s@xmath1 ) alloy series . \n these results are compared to the quantum of the 3d spin - hall conductivity marked by the blue line . \n ( b ) the spin - hall ratio @xmath25/@xmath24 plotted as a function of composition @xmath5.,title=\"fig : \" ]    scales almost as @xmath26 from infinity ( in the pure limit hgte is a metal in our calculations ) down to the values , which within a strong disorder regime become already comparable with the spin - hall component @xmath25 . on the zns - rich side ( @xmath4 ) both components quickly drop down almost to zero as a function of @xmath5 , since the band gap starts to open \n due to the delocalization which takes place both in the @xmath27- as well as in the energy space , this drop is not abrupt . \n moreover , we notice that @xmath25 does change its sign before it vanishes , which can be seen from the dependency of spin - hall ratios ( shown in fig.[fig : sig ]  ( b ) ) . the sign change is connected to the reversal of the hall chirality after the cone center crosses the fermi energy @xmath11 . \n + in contrast to the diagonal component , the spin - hall conductivity stays almost independent from the composition until the topological phase transition takes place , which indicates the quantized origin of @xmath25 . \n indeed , since @xmath25 is calculated within the kubo - formalism , together with the intrinsic quantized contribution ( connected with the berry curvature ) , it contains also extrinsic contributions ( attributed to the side - jump and skew scattering  @xcite mechanisms ) . \n however , for the present alloy series which behave almost as gapless semiconductors within the whole topologically non - trivial regime , the extrinsic contributions must be small , since the dos at the fermi energy , which supplies the electrons for the corresponding scattering is very small as well . as it follows from fig.[fig : sig ]  ( a ) , within topologically non - trivial regime the value of reasonably agrees with the quantum of the spin - hall conductivity in 3d  @xcite ( marked by a blue line in fig.[fig : sig ]  ( a ) ) . \n the latter is calculated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the size of the magnetic brillouin zone in @xmath23 direction . \n the factor @xmath30 accounts for the single spin - channel . since the lattice constant @xmath31 decreases as a function of @xmath5 , the quantum of the conductivity slightly increases with rising hg concentration until the topological phase transition \n in this paper we have shown that the topological phase transition induced via disorder can be efficiently studied in bulk 3d materials , without the need to investigate large systems , circumventing computationally quite heavy surface calculations . \n the main conclusion of our study is based on the composition dependence of the spin - hall ratio @xmath32 shown in fig.[fig : sig ]  ( b ) : the ratio nearly scales linearly up with increasing disorder in the system . \n this behavior can be exploited as an efficient tool for adjusting the adiabatic transport characteristics . \n the upper limit of such an adjustment can obviously be achieved in the case of full anderson localization , i.e. when @xmath33 . \n the concept of the anderson type topological insulator ( tai ) joins two very fundamental fields and it is not surprising that it immediately became a subject of intensive theoretical research . \n the possibility of the tai state was indicated by c.  beenakker : _ anderson insulator exists due to disorder , whereas topological insulator exists in spite of disorder . \n _ on a model level , provided that the anderson localization exists , the possibility for the tai state has already been justified  @xcite . however , even though the anderson model of localization is rather simple  @xcite , the question whether the full localization can be adequately described in 3d solids within cpa - like theories remains the subject of vivid debates  @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 4071965703920, "RequestID": "0215bc4f4ced8344b0e754ec567fd4d582c54a4a", "TotalTokens": 3982}

{"ContextTokens": 3432, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum entanglement ( qe ) is the central feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes a quantum system from its classical counterpart . \n it is also the corner stone on which many of the novel applications of quantum mechanics -to quantum computation , quantum information theory , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation - are based . \n indeed , it is this promise that has led to a renewal of interest in qe in recent years . \n the simplest example of qe is afforded by a bipartite system of two spin half ( or pseudo spin half ) particles , where the hilbert space has the minimal dimension four . \n this system is also called a two qubit system ( 2qs ) in the context of quantum computations . for a 2qs , \n there is essentially only one measure of entanglement ; it may be given _ \n e.g. _ , by the von - neumann entropy @xmath0 , or expressed in terms of the sum of bilinears in the eigen values as given by the quantity @xmath1 , or in terms of det@xmath2 . \n @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix obtained by taking a marginal trace over one of the spin degrees of freedom . \n states with a vanishing entanglement are separable ( in the strong sense ) : they admit a factorisation @xmath4 . on the other hand , fully entangled states have the maximum correlation , and are collectively designated as bell states . \n consider now a n - qubit system ( nqs ) , realised as a multipartite system of @xmath5 spin halfs . \n nqs upto @xmath6 have been prepared experimentally with photons , for example @xcite . \n it is easy to check that for an nqs , @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not equivalent . \n further , none of them is exhaustive . \n a natural question that arises is how one may identify a complete set of entanglement measures for any nqs . \n there have been several proposals @xcite that attempt at answering this question . \n one note worthy proposal is from sixia yu _ \n et al _ @xcite who posit a hierachy of @xmath9 classes of entanglement . \n the total number grows exponentially with increasing @xmath5 . \n an alternative approach is to look for physically interesting measures , apart from @xmath0 and @xmath7 , with ( potential ) applicability to quantum computation . \n this simpler approach would also give direction to the experimentalists to prepare nqs in specified states . \n in this context , a useful question to ask is what the entanglement property of a 2qs is , when looked upon as a subsystem of an nqs , when @xmath10 ( there would be no new information when @xmath11 ) . \n there would be @xmath12 such subentanglements , as analogues of two particle correlations . in defining the new measure \n , we seek to determine the proximity of a given 2qs to the classic bell states mentioned above . \n wootters @xcite has developed a closely related concept called concurrence ( hereafter denoted @xmath13 ) for 2qs , which is required to characterise the so called entanglement of formation ( eof ) @xcite . \n indeed , eof is defined to be the minimum entropy carried by a mixed state , under all possible resolutions @xmath14 of a reduced density matrix of a 2qs ; the set \\{@xmath15 } does not _ necessarily _ form a basis - much less an orthonormal set . \n @xmath13 , which measures this eof is then defined as follows :    the concurrence for a mixed 2qs is given by @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the eigenvalues , arranged in decreasing order of magnitude , of the operator + @xmath18    the so called eof is itself given by    the entanglement of formation is given by + @xmath19    the above definitions are attractive , and have been used to estimate bipartite entanglement in spin systems @xcite . \n there are also reports that states with nonvanishing @xmath13 have been prepared experimentally @xcite . \n attempts have been made to generalise the definition to higher spin sectors @xcite . \n there is , thus , quite an interest in @xmath13 . \n the definition of @xmath13 , rather involved in its form , crucially hinges on the concept of eof . \n however , it is well known that there is no way of inferring how a system is prepared @xcite , no matter which property of the density matrix we look at , unless it corresponds to a pure state . \n thus the physical interpretation of eof is rather dubious , and does not seem to have any operational significance . indeed \n , suppose the expansion of @xmath20 in eq.1 is replaced by a more general decomposition @xmath21 p_{\\{\\alpha_i\\ } } \\vert \\psi(\\{\\alpha_i \\})><\\psi(\\{\\alpha_i\\ } ) \\vert$ ] , where the states are now labelled by a set of continuous parameters @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] being an appropriate integration measure . \n the parameters could be taken to be the coordinates of the associated compact phase space , for instance . \n the probabilities @xmath24 have as much physical significance as the discrete variables @xmath25 in eq.1 . \n but the new expansion would change the criterion for eof , leading to a different expression for concurrence .    with this critique of @xmath13 in mind \n , we propose an alternative definition of concurrence ( hereafter called @xmath26 ) , with a two fold aim : to attain conceptual and computational simplicity . \n @xmath26 is required merely to capture the entanglement of a 2qs which is a subsystem of a larger nqs , in a manner that suggests a generalisation to higher spin sectors . \n we take this up in the next section . \n as a warm up , and for motivation , consider a 2qs first . let a 2qs be in the state @xmath27 the key step in defining concurrence is in recognising that @xmath28 is a measure of entanglement , equivalent to the standard measures listed above . \n @xmath29 is much simpler to evaluate , though . \n our notion of concurrence is inspired by , and is very close in its definition to , @xmath29 . \n although @xmath29 does _ not _ carry any new information , it does exhibit a symplectic structure which is not apparent in the other two measures . \n further , as observed by hill and wootters @xcite , it can also be written in the form @xmath30 , the inner product of @xmath31 with its conjugate ( equivalently , time reversed ) state which we define thus : @xmath32 the main thrust of the paper is that this form of entanglement for a 2qs needs _ little _ modification in defining concurrence in nqs , @xmath10 . \n the definition will be given in steps , so as not to have a cluttered notation .        which is obtained by a partial conjugation  on the sector ( 12 ) . \n the definition of concurrences @xmath36 and @xmath37 follow similarly . by definition @xmath38 take values in the range \n @xmath39 $ ] . \n @xmath40 also has an in built symplectic structure ; to see this , consider the quadruplet of vectors @xmath41 the expansion is in the ordered basis @xmath42 . \n the concurrence is now simply written as @xmath43 which naturally generalises the definition of entanglement in a 2qs in a manner appropriate to our purpose @xcite . \n @xmath44 is the transpose of @xmath45 . \n one can straight away construct quadruplets for @xmath46 by inspection . \n it is also straight forward to generalise the definition when the parent state is an nqs in a pure state . \n we write the expression for the @xmath47 sector :      the computational simplicity of @xmath26 is evident , from its very form , if only we demonstrate its viability . \n a convenient method is to use @xmath13 as a benchmark to test the new definition against . \n for , the definition of @xmath13 is also motivated by the entanglement measure @xmath29 . \n figure 1 . gives a comparison of the two definitions , where the states are generated randomly . \n one sees an overall agreement so long as @xmath13 remains positve , without having to impose the minimality condition by hand . in those regions where @xmath13 has to be declared as vanishing ( when @xmath51 ) in _ definition 1 _ , @xmath26 differs from @xmath13 : indeed \n , these states are distinguishable , in the sense that each of them has a preferential proximity to one of the bell states which is more clear in fig.2 . \n the computational advantage is of course evident from the form of @xmath26 . for , \n if we start with a nqs , there are @xmath12 such concurrences . even in regions where @xmath13 has no interpretational problem , _ definition 1 _ requires an evaluation of three reduced density matrices , a determination of their partner states , and an evaluation of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 . \n the necessity of these computations gets obviated in the determination of @xmath26 . \n we proceed to enlarge the definition of concurrence to higher spin sectors . \n note that there is no analogue of @xmath13 here , since the criterion for eof which was evolved in @xcite is specific to a 2qs . \n the generalisation in our case is naturally suggested by the form for @xmath26 written above . \n indeed , let @xmath53 be the state in which an nqs is . \n we define the conjugate state @xmath54      the above definition is unfortunately restrictive ; it works only when the subsystem of the nqs is bosonic ; the fermionic states ( @xmath55 odd ) are always orthogonal to their conjugates . \n apart from this , there is generality with respect to the choice of the @xmath55 qubits since any @xmath55 qubits may be chosen to be in the order given , by a permutation . \n the number of independent concurrence measures is given by @xmath57 . \n figure 3 displays the 4q concurrences for states generated from a 6qs . as an illustration , and as an example of the discerning capability of the higher order concurrences which we have defined here , \n the shor code will be compared with the steane code , both of which are used in quantum error correction @xcite . \n the shor code @xmath58 is a nine qubit state , written as a direct product of three 3q states each of which have the form @xmath59 , in writing which we have employed the qubit notation : @xmath60 . this entangled state has vanishing concurrences in _ all _ orders . \n in contrast , the steane code , constructed with seven qubits has a more involved structure ; it is not seperable the way the shor state is . , and is given by @xmath61 . as a manifestation , although all the 2q concurrences vanish , the 4q concurrences survive in the sectors @xmath62 , and all of them attain the maximum allowed value 1 . \n the 6q concurrences vanish . \n these features highlight quantitatively the manner in which the two codes differ from each other . at this point \n , it is good to remember that a complete separability in the strong sense , where the multiqubit state is a direct product of single qubit states , necessarily implies a vanishing concurrence of all orders . \n the converse is not necessarily true , as exemplified by the state generating the shor code . \n finally , the question of handling mixed states still remain . \n not getting into the general case , only the 2q concurrence will be discussed . \n the general case only involves rewriting the argument with more indices . \n indeed , given a 2qs in a mixed state @xmath20 , the method is to look upon @xmath20 as having descended from a pure parent state of a higher dimension @xmath5 . \n significantly , @xmath63 . \n the determination of parent state is done by simple inspection . \n it also follows that if @xmath20 has only real components , then @xmath64 it is not difficult to check that although the parent state is not unique , the concurrence determined will be so - reflecting the fact that it is a property of the system , and not of the parent - introduced purely as an intermediate step . \n this final remark completes the programme undertaken .    in conclusion , \n we have redefined in this note the concept of concurrence which has a much simpler form , and is computationally trivial - compared to @xmath13 and its generalisations thereof . \n it is not based on the notion of eof . \n while concurrences do not completely characterise a system - which was not our aim - it appears that they do constitute an important subset of entangled states , especially in the two qubit sector . \n the higher order concurrences also have a significance , as illustrated by the concurrence properties of shor and the steane codes . \n the true import of entanglements of this kind would manifest with only a more geometric approach , which will be taken up in a subsequent publication . \n jian - wei pan _ \n et al _ phys . \n lett . * 86 * , 4435 ( 2001 ) . \n e. g. _ , n. meyer and n. r. wallach j. math . \n phys * 43 * , 4273(2002 ) and references therein ;

{"ContextTokens": 4064, "GeneratedTokens": 144, "SynthesizedBody": "the properties of single electron devices @xcite depend strongly on the electromagnetic environment @xcite . \n often it is important to bias the single electron device with a constant current rather than with a constant voltage , over a wide frequency range . \n this can in principle be achieved by isolating the device from the large capacitance of the biasing leads by closely surrounding it with high ohmic , low capacitance resistors @xcite \n . evaporated thin film alloy resistors @xcite have the disadvantage of not allowing a tuning of the resistance in situ . \n we have investigated a process where niobium wires were transformed to thin film resistors by anodisation @xcite . \n the use of anodisation to tune metal film resistors has been mentioned first in 1959 @xcite . \n anodisation is frequently used to pattern prefabricated multilayers of niobium and barrier material for junction applications @xcite . \n it has been used to weaken niobium strips into josephson junctions @xcite , and to make variable thickness weak links in combination with a submicron sized anodisation mask @xcite . recently \n , prefabricated single electron transistors have been miniaturised by anodisation @xcite . \n ultrathin niobium films show transport properties typical for granular films @xcite . in such systems , charging effects are expected to reduce the conductivity in the low bias region at low temperatures @xcite . we have found experimentally that a coulomb blockade occurs in samples that have been thinned sufficiently , and fabricated a device based on anodised niobium weak links that showed a modulation of current - voltage characteristics with an applied gate voltage . \n we refer to these samples as samples with two weak links in single electron transistor ( set)-like geometry . \n figure  [ anodisetupfig ] shows the experimental setup we used for the anodisation of microstructures . \n we spin coated the chip with a 1.8@xmath1 m thick layer of pmma and patterned it into an anodisation mask . using e - beam lithography for this step \n provided precision alignment to the samples . \n windows of about ten micrometre width were opened over the niobium strips that were to be anodised , and over a gold contact lead electrically isolated from the niobium pattern . this lead \n could then be used as cathode for the anodisation . \n having such an integrated cathode near the chip centre reduced the amount of electrolyte needed to a small droplet of about 1 mm diameter , which minimised the risk for current leaks and made the handling of the chip much easier . \n the design of the anodisation mask was chosen such that it could be used as a liftoff mask for the deposition of metal forming an overlapping gate electrode ( for the samples in set - like geometry ) . \n as electrolyte , we used a mixture of 30.5mmol ammonium pentaborate , 0.87mol ethylene glycole and 2.22mol water @xcite , which we found to work well at room temperature although it was originally intended for use at 120@xmath2c .    to monitor the resistance of the sample during anodisation \n , we applied an ac excitation voltage with typical frequency @xmath3khz and amplitude @xmath4mv and measured the resulting current with a lock - in amplifier . \n the voltage had to be kept small , and especially the dc component at zero , to avoid skewing the potential and thus the anodisation profile along the sample . \n the formation of the anodic oxide film , and hence the increase of the sample resistance , is irreversible and could be controlled by regulating the cell voltage . \n zeroing the voltage holds the resistance . \n since our anodised areas were very small , we did not attempt to anodise with a constant current . \n instead , we adjusted the cell voltage and its ramping rate based on the reading of the sample resistance and its time derivative . under such conditions , \n the oxide thickness is known to depend not only on the cell voltage , but also on time @xcite ; an estimation of the oxide film thickness from an ` anodisation constant ' of 2.3nm / v applicable under constant current conditions @xcite is incorrect . \n depending on the voltage ramping rate , our 20 nm thick films were anodised to practically infinite resistance at voltages between ( 15  25)v . \n the nonlinear behaviour of the oxide thickness is evident from figure  [ slowanodifig ] . \n here we quickly ramped the anodisation voltage up to 10v and held it constant for more than sixteen hours . during this time , the resistance increased steadily . \n this behaviour can be exploited to achieve a precision in resistance trimming that is in principle only limited by the accuracy of the resistance measurement . \n we have tried different anodisation strategies and found that a total process time of a few hundred seconds gave the most stable and uniform samples , while providing sufficient trimming precision . \n our geometry for the resistor samples were strips about ( 120  180)nm wide and 10@xmath1 m long , either individual or grouped as 120@xmath1 m long wire equipped with equidistantly spaced leads allowing four probe measurements on each segment . \n the initially 20 nm thick nb films had a sheet resistance of ( 50  120)@xmath5 , which by anodisation could be raised to several tens of kiloohms per square . \n strips anodised simultaneously showed the same ratio between inital and final resistance within ten percent accuracy , up to sheet resistances of 20k@xmath5 . for higher resistivities , the uniformity degraded , and at values of 40k@xmath5 , similar strips could differ in resistance by a factor of 4 or more . \n the patterning of niobium with a lift - off process requires masks that can withstand the heat during the niobium deposition . \n metal stencils supported by a sturdy polymer @xcite have been reported as a suitable replacement for conventional all - polymer masks . \n we employed here a modification of a four layer resist @xcite which had been used for the fabrication of nb based single electron transistors . \n it consists of a pmma top layer ( 50 nm ) , a germanium mask ( 20 nm ) supported by hard baked photoresist ( 250 nm ) , and a pmma bottom layer ( 50 nm ) allowing liftoff . \n the top layer was patterned by electron beam lithography at 50kv acceleration voltage and 20pa beam current , and developed in a mixture of 400mmol isopropanole and 170mmol water . \n the pattern was then transferred to the ge mask by rective ion etching ( rie ) with carbon tetrafluoride cf@xmath6 as process gas . \n subsequent rie with oxygen through the photoresist and bottom pmma layers gave the undercut profile and suspended bridges necessary for the angular evaporation technique . \n etching times were estimated with some margin since we had no etch end detection . \n the niobium was deposited in a multipurpose high vacuum system with an electron gun at a rate of ( 0.6  0.8)nm / s . \n the sample was neither cooled nor heated during evaporation , except by the evaporation itself . due to the poor background pressure of @xmath7pa , \n the niobium had a residual resistance ratio of only 1.12 between room temperature and 4.2k , and a superconducting transition temperature of the order of 1.5k . \n with the same evaporation system and using a similar resist , nb based single electron transistors had been fabricated earlier @xcite . \n after the anodisation was completed , the samples were rinsed with deionised water . \n for the samples with two weak links in a set - like geometry , a gate electrode of 50 nm gold was evaporated , and the mask removed prior to the low temperature measurements . \n the shadow evaporation technique we used for the fabrication of samples with two weak links in set geometry is shown schematically in figure  [ evapfig ] . \n we evaporated two times 20 nm of nb , tilting the sample @xmath8 to the substrate normal . \n figure  [ semfig ] is a scanning electron micrograph of a structure produced by this method , before anodisation . \n typical dimensions for these samples were line widths of ( 90  120)nm , length of the weak links @xmath9 nm and a length of the island separating these weak links @xmath10 nm . \n this method is capable of producing smaller islands than could be defined lithographically with similar processing . \n on the other hand , the symmetry of the two weak links depends on the equality in thickness @xmath11 of the two metal layers deposited in sequential evaporations . \n the film thicknesses were monitored with a water cooled crystal monitor . \n a reproducibility in thickness of about 10% was estimated from control evaporations under similar conditions and stylus - method profilometry of the control samples . \n transport measurements were carried out in a dilution refrigerator at base temperature well below 50mk . \n details about the cryostat regarding the filtering of leads have been published elsewhere @xcite . \n the bias voltage was applied symmetrically with respect to ground and fed to the sample via high ohmic bias resistors on top of the cryostat . \n the voltages over these resistors and over the sample were picked up by low noise amplifiers @xcite and registered with digital voltmeters . \n figure  [ ivcfig ] summarises the kinds of current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) we observed in our resistor wire samples . \n low resistive strips showed a remnant of a supercurrent ( trace a ) . \n for higher ( sheet ) resistance , we observed a coulomb blockade ( trace b ) . \n very high resistive samples showed not only a sharp threshold voltage , but a backbending ivc ( trace c ) . \n such a backbending is a characteristic of the coulomb blockade of cooper pair tunnelling @xcite in arrays of josephson junction arrays @xcite . \n the backbending alone could be attributed to heating effects , but we also regularly observed a vivid switching of the ivc along the bias load line ( figure  [ magfig ] , traces labelled ` 0 t ' ) that is typical in arrays of josephson junctions @xcite \n . this switching is random , but occurs between reproducible envelopes in subsequent sweeps . \n further evidence for an influence of superconductivity on the ivc near the coulomb blockade threshold threshold is the fact that a magnetic field suppressing superconductivity also suppresses the switching , as we see in figure  [ magfig ] .    to quantify the coulomb blockade , we considered the offset voltage . \n since the current - voltage characteristics were nonlinear over many decades in voltage , it was not enough to simply extrapolate the tangent to the ivc at the edges of the sweep range . \n instead , we computed the local offset voltage @xmath12 @xcite as the voltage value at the intersection of the tangent to the ivc in @xmath13 with the voltage axis , @xmath14 around zero bias , @xmath12 was approximately a linear function of @xmath13 . \n the extrapolation of @xmath12 to zero bias , @xmath15 , is a measure for the strength of the coulomb blockade . for single ultrasmall junctions \n , this gives the coulomb blockade in the global rule , where the whole electromagnetic environment influences the blockade .    for 187 strips with lengths \n between ten and 120@xmath1 m , we have measured the ivc without applied external magnetic field . \n the relation between @xmath15 and the sample resistance is shown in figure  [ onsetfig ] , where both quantities are normalised to the number of squares in the film and plotted against each other . the coulomb blockade set in around a sheet resistance per square compatible with the quantum resistance @xmath16 \n this supports the notion that there should be a universal sheet resistance @xmath17 for the superconductor - insulator transition in thin metallic films @xcite . \n although our resistor wire samples showed a coulomb blockade , we did not observe a modulation of the conductance with an applied gate voltage , as reported e.g. for high resistance in@xmath18o@xmath19 wires @xcite . \n we assume that the analogy between our wire samples and an array of junctions holds , and that the number of islands involved was so large that such effects averaged out below the measurement noise level .    therefore , we fabricated the samples with two weak links and an overlapping gate described above , whose geometry resembles that of a single electron transistor ( set ) , where the oxide barriers have been replaced by short strips of niobium thinned by anodisation . \n samples that had a complicated current - voltage characteristic were susceptible to a modulation of this characteristic by a gate voltage . \n figure  [ dipsfig ] is a plot of the differential conductivity of such a sample as a function of bias voltage . \n the off - zero bias conductance peaks and dips moved towards zero bias with an increasing magnetic field and converged into a single conductance dip at an external field of 1.4 t . \n the latter zero bias conductivity dip is obviously indicating the coulomb blockade of single electron tunnelling , while the off - zero bias structures are presumably caused by the superconducting gap . \n the reduction of the differential conductivity at zero bias in the field free case ( top panel in figure  [ dipsfig ] ) may be attributed to the coulomb blockade of cooper pairs @xcite .    on the other hand , samples that showed a coulomb blockade with a very sharp threshold had current - voltage characteristics that could not be modulated with a gate voltage . \n samples that had a very weak coulomb blockade , resulting in a simple dip in the differential conductivity versus bias voltage characteristic around zero bias without further structure , were insensitive to a gate voltage as well . \n scanning microscope inspection of these samples often suggested that the asymmetry between the two weak links was non - negligible . \n to measure the response of the sample from figure  [ dipsfig ] to the gate voltage , we quenched superconductivity by applying a field of 2 t , and biased the sample via high ohmic resistors at a series of practically constant drain - source currents . \n we then measured the drain - source voltage drop @xmath20 while sweeping the gate voltage @xmath21 up and down . \n figure  [ sawfig ] gives the resulting control curves ( @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 at constant @xmath22 ) . \n the influence of the gate voltage is obvious for low drain - source currents ( bottom panel ) . at other points along the @xmath22-@xmath23 characteristic , namely for oppositely directed current , or higher current ( top panel ) , the correlation between the control curves resulting from upward and downward sweep in gate voltage was less pronounced . \n the large period of the observed sawtooth oscillations would correspond to a total island capacitance of only 3af , if one assumed that the sample acted as a single electron transistor . \n this capacitance estimate is unrealistically low . \n control curves with such a large periodicity in gate voltage are , however , typical for systems of multiple tunnel junctions , e.g. those produced by the step - edge cutoff technique @xcite , or nanofabricated silicon wires @xcite .    in another sample \n , we managed to modulate the drain - source current - voltage characteristic by applying a gate voltage . \n for the measurement shown in figure  [ modufig ] , we ramped the bias current up and down over one period with a frequency of 8mhz . \n simultaneously , a sine shaped gate voltage with an amplitude of 120mv and a frequency of 322mhz was applied . at this amplitude , the whole modulation range of the ivc was covered . \n the left panel of figure  [ modufig ] shows the modulated and the unmodulated ivc for comparison , and the difference in drain - source voltage between unmodulated and modulated ivc is plotted in the right panel . \n unfortunately , this sample was destroyed before we could map out the modulation range to higher drain - source voltages . at 50mk and a gate voltage amplitude of 200mv \n , the measured modulation of the ivc translates into an average transistor gain of about 1/700 at the edges of the measured bias region . \n the voltage swing @xmath24 dropped to about one fourth when the temperature was raised from 50mk to 1.1k . \n the insulation resistance between drain - source and gate was at least 30g@xmath0 , our measurement limit , for gate voltages up to @xmath25v . \n there , a measurable current flow through the gate set in , reaching about 5na at @xmath26v . \n we have demonstrated that anodic oxidation of nanofabricated niobium thin film wires can be used to produce resistors of several hundred kiloohms on a length of ten micrometres . \n this technique is intrinsically limited by the onset of a coulomb blockade when the sheet resistance per square exceeds the quantum resistance 6k@xmath5 . \n the anodised wires show transport properties typical of an array of ultrasmall josephson junctions , where superconducting effects coexist with charging effects . \n the low temperature current - voltage characteristics of these samples show a superconductor - insulator transition where the degree of anodisation is the tuning parameter .    placing short anodised areas with the aid of lithographic techniques \n , one can fabricate transistor - like samples whose current - voltage characteristics can be modulated by a gate voltage . \n more efforts are needed to further characterise the complex niobium - niobium oxides system created by anodisation and comprising the resistors and single electron transistor -

{"ContextTokens": 4034, "GeneratedTokens": 218, "SynthesizedBody": "using the lasco c2 and c3 coronagraphs on the soho spacecraft ( brueckner et al . \n 1995 ) , sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) discovered blobs of material moving outward in coronal helmet streamers . \n helmet streamers consist of a bubble - like or arch - like wide body ( the helmet ) , consisting of closed magnetic field . above the cusp , \n the pointed top of the helmet , lies a current sheet which extends radially outward , separating the two directions of open magnetic field around the helmet ( see fig .  1 , top panel ) . \n we adopt the view that this streamer structure is formed by reconnection of open field lines in the current sheet that is left behind by a cme , as suggested by , e.g. , kopp ( 1992 ) and kahler & hundhausen ( 1992 ) . \n sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) observed that the blobs originate in the streamer current sheet , right above the cusp . \n they have an initial size of about @xmath0 in the radial and @xmath1 in the transverse direction . \n the blobs move radially outward along the streamer , with increasing velocities from about @xmath2 near @xmath3 to @xmath4 near @xmath5 . because of their relatively small initial sizes , low intensities ( @xmath6 ) , radial motions , slow but increasing velocities , and location in the streamer belt , sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) conclude that these features passively trace the solar wind . \n wang et al .  ( 1998 ) carried out some more detailed observations of the spatial distribution , relative intensities , and shapes of the blobs , and observed a rather steady occurrence rate of about four blobs per day . \n we believe that the creation of these blobs is connected to a longstanding problem in solar physics : maintaining a roughly constant amount of flux in the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) . \n coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) generally originate in regions of closed magnetic field . \n these field lines are torn away from the sun and stretched out into distended loops that extend well into interplanetary space ( hundhausen 1997 ) . in principle \n , each consecutive cme thus introduces new flux into the heliosphere . \n this would result in an indefinite growth of the imf , which is not observed ( e.g.   gold 1962 ; gosling 1975 ; macqueen 1980 ; mccomas , gosling , & phillips 1992 ) . \n apparently , some kind of reconnection takes place on the field lines that are torn away from the sun , disconnecting the tops of the loops and returning new closed field lines to the sun . \n the reconnection must start shortly after the cme s departure , but it can not be restricted to that first period . in situ measurements near and beyond 1 au ( e.g.  gosling , birn , & hesse 1995 ; gosling 1996 ) show that most field lines within cmes are still connected to the sun at both ends . \n however , a few field lines are connected on only one end , while others are completely disconnected . \n additionally , about one third of the cmes exhibit a flux - rope topology , characterized by a series of helical field lines wrapped around a central axis . \n both this helicity and the disconnected field lines can only be explained by magnetic reconnection behind the cme during the days before it reaches 1 au ( e.g.  gosling et al . \n 1995 ) . on the other hand , to prevent an indefinite buildup of the imf by field lines that are still connected to the sun , reconnection must also keep taking place after the cme has passed 1 au , several days after it has left the sun . \n three types of events show evidence for reconnection directly behind a departing cme . \n first , about one third of all cmes are accompanied by long - duration ( many hours ) x - ray emission from expanding loops or arcades of loops ( see gosling 1993 ) . \n non - thermal emission at x - ray and radio wavelengths is often observed in conjunction with these events ( webb & cliver 1995 ) . \n a beautiful example of a reforming helmet streamer is presented by hiei , hundhausen , & sime ( 1993 ) . \n all these observations confirm the model of kopp & pneuman ( 1976 ) which explains hot loop formation by magnetic reconnection behind the cme . \n second , there are some observations of moving metric type iv radio events which are interpreted as emission from electrons that have become trapped in disconnected plasmoids within cmes ( e.g.  kundu et al . \n third , there are many coronagraph observations of large circular , ovoidal or outward u- or v - shaped structures that are usually interpreted as disconnected cmes ( e.g.  illing and hundhausen 1983 ) . \n webb & cliver ( 1995 ) , analyzing all space - borne coronagraph and eclipse data up to then , concluded that possibly over 10 % of all cmes fall in this category . \n unfortunately , due to their infrequency compared to cmes , even these three mechanisms combined can not explain the necessary amount of flux - disconnection . \n an even bigger problem is posed by reconnection long after the cme . \n there have been suggestions that such reconnection would occur in interplanetary space itself ( e.g.  wilcox 1971 ) , but the new closed loops that would have to return to the sun have not been observed ( gosling 1975 ; mccomas et al . \n mccomas et al . \n ( 1989 , 1991 ) suggested that the large u - shaped disconnections described above are not related to a departing cme , but occur all by themselves across the heliospheric current sheet . \n however , triggering these large reconnections by emerging flux elsewhere in the corona seems rather ad - hoc ( webb & cliver 1995 ) . \n additionally , these events are still quite infrequent compared to cmes . \n evidently , the mechanism , or combination of mechanisms , that can disconnect enough flux to offset the constant flow of cmes has not yet been identified .    in this letter , we suggest that the creation of blobs in coronal streamers is a mechanism for ongoing , small - scale reconnection that can disconnect open field lines and reform closed magnetic loops on the sun . especially since the blobs occur not just shortly after cmes , but also rather steadily under quiet coronal conditions , they may play an important role in maintaining the roughly constant imf . \n we suggest that the blobs are the result of reconnection between two open field lines from both sides of a streamer current sheet . \n naturally , we speak about field lines only to visualize what is going on ; in reality , a finite amount of magnetic field will be involved in such a reconnection event . \n the field line topologies before and after the reconnection are outlined in fig .  1 . \n reconnection between the two innermost open field lines in the top panel creates two new field lines . \n the first , with both ends connected to the sun , is a new closed loop which becomes part of the helmet ( as in e.g.   kahler & hundhausen 1992 ) . \n the other one , with its ends extending into interplanetary space , will move outward . \n the blobs are formed by plasma from the streamer that is swept up in the trough of this outward moving field line ( middle and bottom panels ) . \n considering the exponential decay of the density in the streamer with radial distance , almost all of the material in the blob is collected right away , just above the cusp . \n the loop that is moving outward will at first attempt to do so at the alfvn speed . \n however , it is immediately slowed down when it sweeps up the plasma on its way . \n nevertheless , the blob of material in the field line will accelerate faster than the surrounding wind , at least until the lorentz force is balanced by the pressure differential that is built up when the plasma is swept up into a blob or , alternatively , until @xmath7 and the surrounding gas pressure starts to dominate the magnetic field . from then on , the field lines , and therefore the blobs , more or less flow along with their surroundings , tracing , as sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggested , the slow solar wind . \n fig .  1 . \n the formation of a blob . \n the top panel shows the initial situation : a coronal streamer consisting of a helmet of closed loops surrounded by open field lines separated by a current sheet . in the lower two panels \n , reconnection has taken place between the two innermost field lines from the top panel . \n one new field line is a closed loop which becomes part of the helmet . \n the other one is now disconnected and moves outward , as shown in the bottom panels . on its way \n , it sweeps up plasma from the current sheet , which forms a blob . \n einaudi et al . \n ( 1998 ) and dahlburg , boncinelli , & einaudi ( 1998 ) performed numerical simulations of a current sheet , suggesting that the fast solar wind flowing along a current sheet can trigger , amongst others , a resistive instability , resulting in plasmoid formation . \n the initial situation in these simulations was a one - dimensional equilibrium , a plane current sheet , which is then destabilized by two - dimensional disturbances . \n the model does not incorporate the helmet and the beginning of the current sheet , i.e.  the cusp . \n we believe , however , that reconnection will occur preferentially just there . \n first , by virtue of the magnetic topology , the cusp is the most natural location for reconnection . \n second , we notice that when plasma flows outward along the open field lines on the side of the helmet , an inward `` inertial pressure '' will arise at the cusp , where the plasma has to change direction to follow the field lines , which bend to become aligned with the streamer stalk . \n this pressure pushes the open field lines a little closer together right above the cusp . \n the reconnection that follows produces the new loops , as described above . \n further study of both the location of reconnection and the subsequent movement of the blobs is needed . \n numerical simulations would have to include , amongst others , the complete magnetic topology , the radially decreasing background density , and the acceleration of the surrounding solar wind . \n several features of the blobs support the proposed mechanism . \n the first observation is the acceleration pattern of the blobs . \n sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) observed that , in general , the blobs exhibit a fairly constant acceleration . \n however , in a speed - height plot representing measurements of about 65 independent blobs , they observed a peculiar `` corner '' at about @xmath8 or @xmath9 . \n although this corner could be an artifact , sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) remark that it might be a valid indication of a somewhat steeper initial acceleration . \n we suggest that the outward magnetic forces of the newly formed field line which sweeps up the plasma could account for this extra acceleration . \n as soon as @xmath10 and the magnetic field no longer dominates the gas pressure , the field line just moves along with the slow solar wind , as sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggested . \n second , the blobs often exhibit a concave - outward v - shape when the plasma sheet in which they move outward is slightly inclined to the line of sight ( wang et al . \n this supports the idea that a field line , with a v-(or u-)shaped trough at its bottom , is sweeping up plasma . \n however , the fact that the v - shape only becomes visible when the sheet is seen at an angle calls for a further explanation , which is illustrated in fig . \n 2 . this figure represents the blob creation , but now seen both from our viewpoint , in the plane of the sky ( bottom row ) and from the solar pole , in the plane of the current sheet ( top row ) . \n the two field lines shown in the top left panel correspond to the innermost open field lines in the bottom left panel . \n the outgoing magnetic flux rope has little room to expand in the direction perpendicular to the current sheet , which , by its very nature , is very thin and bounded by magnetic fields . \n thus , when the current sheet is seen side - on , the swept - up plasma looks like a narrow blob , as shown in the bottom right panel . however , there probably is a substantial azimuthal component to the magnetic field of the streamer ( top left panel ) , e.g.  due to differential rotation . \n this leads to a v - shape of the newly reconnected field line when seen from above . \n consequently , from this point of view , the plasma that is swept up will be v - shaped as well ( top right panel ) . \n as long as the current sheet is perpendicular to the plane of the sky , this does not affect our image of the blob ; we simply see a projection that is still shaped like an elongated blob ( as in the bottom right panel ) . \n however , when the sheet is inclined to the line of sight , the v - shape will become visible . \n we notice that an esa polar orbiter at about 0.5 au , a candidate mission for around 2007 ( priest et al . \n 1998 ) , could observe the structures drawn in the top panels of fig .  2 . \n fig .  2 . \n the formation of a blob , seen from two directions . \n the bottom panels show the streamer in the plane of the sky , as we see it . \n the top panels show the same picture , but now seen from above . \n the two field lines in the top left panel correspond to the innermost open field lines in the bottom left panel . \n the two left panels show the situation before , the two right panels after the reconnection . \n third , it should be noted that the blobs remain coherent all through the lasco - coronagraph s field of view , out to @xmath11 . according to sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) , they maintain constant angular spans and increase their lengths in rough accord with their speeds . \n this appearance is consistent with our model of a density enhancement that is bound on both sides by magnetic field lines , which maintain a roughly constant angular span when they extend more or less radially from the sun ( in the plane of the sky ) , and from below by the magnetic trough which initially sweeps up the material in the blob . \n fourth , the blobs are not very bright , but do contain quite some material right from the moment they appear above the helmet . sweeping up the material in a field line that is moving outward in an exponentially decreasing density is a very effective way to accomplish that . \n another way would be to collect the material in a closed field line in the helmet . \n considering that there is no observational evidence for the complete eruption of such a closed field line , wang et al . \n ( 1998 ) have suggested that the material is released along an open field line after a reconnection between a closed field line and a nearby open one . \n however , such a mechanism makes it much harder to explain the three observations mentioned above . \n recent measurements of abundances in streamers by raymond et al . \n ( 1997 ) with the uvcs provide a definite test for whether the blob material comes out of the closed helmet or , as we propose , from the current sheet . \n these measurements show that elements with a high first ionization potential , like oxygen , are underabundant by an order of magnitude in the closed helmet , but only by a factor three on the sides of the helmet , where the field lines are open . \n measurements of the abundances in blobs would thus allow us to determine whether their plasma originates in the closed helmet or in the open field lines adjoining the current sheet . \n in situ measurements of the slow solar wind provide another test : if the blobs are formed in the helmet instead of above it , the slow solar wind should contain a component exhibiting the specific characteristics of that material ( wang et al . \n 1998 ) . \n fifth , wang et al . \n ( 1998 ) observed that the creation of the blobs is sometimes accompanied by a downflow of material . \n they compare this with downflows in the aftermath of cmes , accompanying the closing down of fields blown open during the event . \n clearly , this fits our model very well . while the outward moving loop will usually be most visible \n , the new closed loop will also collect some material while it is moving downward to become part of the helmet .    finally , we suggest that additional observational evidence for this mechanism can be collected by looking at the development of a helmet after the departure of a blob . \n the reconnection between open field lines not only releases a field line , which then forms a blob , but also adds a new closed field line to the helmet , which should grow in size ( with a little delay to allow it to be filled up with material from below ) . \n we notice that a measurement of this growth , combined with an estimate of the field strength at the bottom of the helmet , immediately yields the flux involved in the reconnection . \n unfortunately , the solar rotation complicates this otherwise straightforward observational test . \n the additional field lines would presumably add at most a few percent to the size of the streamer . \n in coronagraph observations , such changes may just as well be the result of projection effects of structures that rotate into ( or out of ) view , aggravated by the contribution function for the visibility of material out of the plane of the sky ( hundhausen 1993 ) . \n however , this problem can be overcome with a thorough statistical study of the relation between the expulsion of the blobs and the size and intensity of the helmet in a large number of streamers . \n we have not yet performed such a study , but preliminary observations of a smaller number of streamers yielded promising results . as an alternative to statistical studies , some of the problems of the solar rotation could also be overcome with the proposed nasa stereo mission , to be flown from mid-2003 ( rust 1997 ) , which would observe the sun from two different angles . \n we have suggested that the origin of the blobs in coronal streamers that were observed by sheeley et al . \n ( 1997 ) is related to the longstanding problem of maintaining a roughly constant flux in the interplanetary magnetic field . \n two open field lines , from both sides of the current sheet , reconnect to form two new loops . \n one is a closed field line and becomes part of the helmet . \n the other is now disconnected from the sun and moves outward , sweeping up the material that forms the blob . \n we have reviewed the observational evidence that support this idea : the acceleration pattern of the

{"ContextTokens": 3570, "GeneratedTokens": 174, "SynthesizedBody": "in 1975 , stephen hawking ( one of the world s most famous physicists ) made a shocking claim that when quantum mechanics is allied with the general relativity , black holes ( bhs ) become to glow with hawking radiation ( hr ) @xcite . \n this emission consists of all sorts of massless / massive particles with different spins : spin@xmath0 .... hawking s prodigious calculations are based on a scenario that ubiquitous virtual particle pairs are continually being created near the event horizon of the bh due to the vacuum fluctuations . \n principally , these particles are created as a particle - antiparticle pair and immediately after they quickly annihilate each other . however , it is always possible that the one with negative energy ( in order to conserve the total energy ) falls into the bh while the other possessing the positive energy escapes to spatial energy as hr . today , hr is also called the bekenstein - hawking radiation in virtue of bekenstein s remarkable contributions @xcite to this phenomenon .    since 1975 , \n the studies concerning hr have been carrying on . up to the present times , \n many different methods for the hr are proposed ( the reader may refer to @xcite and references therein ) . among them , the most fascinating quantum tunneling methods are parikh and wilczek s null - geodesic method @xcite and the semiclassical methods of hamilton - jacobi @xcite and damour - ruffini @xcite . on the other hand , the hr of photons , scalar particles , massive vector bosons , and fermions from various bhs have been gained much attention in recent years ( see for example @xcite ) . \n furthermore , the information loss paradox @xcite in the hr is one of the great puzzles for the physics community . \n some theorists bring forward an idea to retrieve the information from the bh encoded in the hr @xcite . \n however , this mystery have not been solved literally .    in the 1970s \n ,  particle physicists realized that there are very close ties between two of the four fundamental forces @xcite  the weak force and the electromagnetic force which is single underlying force known as the electroweak force . \n the basic equations of the unified theory correctly describe the relationship between the electroweak force and its associated force - carrying particles [ photons and the massive vector bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) ] , except for a major glitch : all of these particles emerge without a mass ! although this is true for the photon , we know that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons must have mass , nearly hundred times that of a proton . \n the problem of spontaneously broken gauge theories in curved spacetime is well known in literature @xcite . so far , the higgs mechanism @xcite is the experimentally confirmed mechanism to solve the generation of mass problem in particle physics , which satisfies both the unitarity and the renormalization of the theory .    in this paper , we make a brief review for the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating ( massive and charged ) scalar particles . applying the resulting equation obtained to the general 4-dimensional static and spherically symmetric metric , we obtain the general radial integral solution for the action of hamilton - jacobi method . as a test bed we consider the dyonic reissner - nordstrm bh ( drnbh ) @xcite and compute its quantum tunneling rate by using the latter radial integral solution of the action . \n finally , we show in detail how one recovers the original hr of the drnbh from the quantum tunneling of the mass generating particles . \n the paper is organized as follows . in sec . \n ii , we introduce the wave equation of a massive and charged mass generating scalar particle in a curved spacetime . \n section iii is devoted to the computations of the quantum tunneling of the mass generating scalar particles from the drnbh . while doing this , we are attentive to make our calculations with generic as much as possible . \n we draw our conclusions in sec . \n in this section , we represent an expression for the wave equation of the mass generating particles . \n their associated scalar fields are non - minimally coupled to the gravity . the main idea underlying this mass generation mechanism \n is resplendently introduced in many textbooks ( see for instance @xcite ) .    for brevity , we initially use units @xmath3 . \n one may write down the action of the interaction of the scalar fields with gravity @xcite as follows @xmath4   , \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 stands for the scalar curvature and @xmath6 is the maxwell field strength with the spin-1 gauge field @xmath7 ( electromagnetic vector potential ) . \n @xmath8 denotes the dimensionless coupling constant which governs the non - minimal interaction of the scalar field @xmath9 @xcite with gravity . in other words , \n the minimally coupled scalar fields correspond to @xmath10 . \n it is worth noting that this coupling constant @xmath8 can also be used to stabilize the vacuum expectation value @xmath11 near the event horizon of a bh @xcite . \n the gauge - covariant derivative is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant ( i.e. the planck charge ) of the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath14 . \n the variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath15 leads to the einstein equations of motion as follows @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor . \n its overlong expression can be seen in the study of moniz et al @xcite . \n significantly , when one applies the variation to the action ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath18 , the following wave equation is obtained @xmath19   + \\xi \\re\\phi+\\partial_{\\phi^{\\dag}}v=0 . \\label{4}\\ ] ]    the mass generating potential was also defined in @xcite as follows @xmath20    where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant and the coupling constant @xmath22 is dimensionless in 4-dimensional spacetime . without loss of generality , it is assumed that @xmath22 has a positive definite value . \n as clearly stated in @xcite , the vacuum expectation value must satisfy the condition of @xmath23 , which requires that @xmath24 must have a minimum at @xmath25 . to obtain the bounded solution for the hamiltonian \n , @xmath26 must be negative since @xmath22 is positive . \n due to this reason , we shift @xmath27 . \n hence , using eq . \n ( 5 ) , we have @xmath28   \\phi . \\label{6}\\ ] ]    after assigning the reduced planck constant back to its original value @xmath29 , eq . \n ( 4 ) can be rewritten as @xmath30   + \\frac{1}{\\hslash^{2}}\\left [   \\xi\\re - m^{2}+2\\lambda(\\phi^{\\dag}\\phi)\\right ]   \\phi=0 . \\label{7}\\ ] ]    which is the wave equation of the mass generating particles with mass @xmath31 and charge @xmath13 in a curved spacetime . \n it is also important to know that whenever the scalar field @xmath9 is used for a nambu \n goldstone boson in the gauge theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath8 is zero @xcite . on the other hand , if the scalar field @xmath9 represents a composite particle , then the value of @xmath8 is fixed by the dynamics of its components . in particular , @xmath32 in the large @xmath33 approximation to the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite . \n moreover , in the standard model , the higgs fields possess the values of @xmath8 within the range of @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite . \n the line - element for the 4-dimensional generic static ( spherically symmetric ) bh metric is given by@xmath36 where the metric functions @xmath37 are only the function of @xmath38 . \n any horizon @xmath39 should satisfy the condition of @xmath40 and @xmath39 is , in general , a function of the mass and charge of the bh . \n the hawking temperature of a bh described by the metric ( 8) is given by @xcite @xmath41    where @xmath42 and the prime over a quantity denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath38 . \n furthermore , the ricci scalar @xcite for the metric ( 8) can be found as @xmath43    in order to study the quantum tunneling of the mass generating particles from the generic bh ( 8) , we use the wkb approximation and assume an ansatz for the scalar field @xmath9 as follows @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the amplitude of the wave and @xmath46 stands for the classically forbidden action of the trajectory . \n metric ( 8) admits two killing vectors @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , which show the existence of the symmetries . \n therefore , one can assume a solution for the action as @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes energy , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are radial and angular functions , respectively . \n ( 12 ) @xmath55  is a complex constant . \n since @xmath7 represents the electromagnetic vector potential , for a dyonic bh with electric and magnetic components one should have @xmath56   $ ] . under the guidance of the hamilton - jacobi method @xcite , we first insert eqs . \n [ 11 - 13 ] in eq . \n ( 7 ) and then consider the terms with the leading order of @xmath57 . \n thus , we obtain the following lenghty expression @xmath58   r^{2}-2\\left [   \\left (   g^{\\prime}r^{\\prime } -2 + 2gr^{\\prime\\prime}\\right )   f+gf^{\\prime}r^{\\prime}\\right ]   fr+r^{\\prime } f^{2}g\\}\\xi\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath59   \\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta-(ea_{1}-{j_{\\varphi}})^{2})f+r\\mathrm{\\sin}^{\\mathrm{2}}\\theta e_{net}^{2}\\right\\ }   = 0 , \\label{13}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . from eq . \n ( 13 ) , we derive an integral solution for @xmath53 as follows @xmath63   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}dr , \\label{14}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    since @xmath67 , the near horizon form of eq . \n ( 14 ) becomes @xmath68    which is essential expression for computing the quantum tunneling rate . \n now , we test the above result obtained via the drnbh geometry @xcite whose the metric functions and electromagnetic vector potential components are given by @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    where the physical quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the drnbh s characteristic parameters : @xmath72 is the electric charge and @xmath73 is the magnetic charge . \n the outer or event ( @xmath74 ) and inner ( @xmath75 ) horizons of the drnbh are given by @xmath76    where @xmath77 . \n ( 22 ) the parameter @xmath78 represents the mass of the drnbh . \n since @xmath79 consequently @xmath80 around the event horizon . here , one can immediately criticize why the @xmath81 parameter including the particle s mass @xmath31  quickly drops out of the considerations . \n however , one can experience from the previous studies @xcite that the non - differential terms coupled to the wave function @xmath9  ( for example , in eq . ( 7 ) , it corresponds to @xmath82   \\phi$ ] ) apart from the operator term acting on @xmath9 ( like the laplacian operator : @xmath83 ) always looses its effiency near the horizon . \n that is why , for instance , the hr is independent from the particle s mass @xcite . \n thus , eq . ( 18 ) reduces to @xmath84    meanwhile , we now have @xmath85 . \n it is obvious that the above integrand possesses a simple pole at the event horizon . to evaluate integral ( 23 ) \n , we first expand the metric function @xmath86 as follows @xmath87    substituting the above expression into eq . \n ( 23 ) and choosing the contour as a half loop going around this pole from left to right , one obtains @xmath88    thus , the imaginary part of the action ( 12 ) becomes @xmath89    thence , we compute the probabilities of ingoing and outgoing particles tunneling the drnbh horizon as @xmath90 @xmath91    classically , having a bh is conditional on the no - reflection for the ingoing waves , which meants full absorption : @xmath92 . \n this is possible simply by setting @xmath93 ( for similar and recent works , the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein ) which results in @xmath94    consequently , we read the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh as @xmath95    employing the boltzmann formula @xmath96 @xcite , the surface temperature of the drnbh can be computed as @xmath97    which is exactly equal to the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh @xcite . \n temperature versus mass plotting is depicted in fig . \n ( 1 ) for @xmath98 . as it can be seen from fig . \n ( 1 ) , the locations of the peaks on the @xmath78-axis ( which are very close to their associated starting mass value @xmath99 : the extreme bh case , @xmath100 ) shift towards right with increasing @xmath78-value , however the peak values decrease when @xmath101 gets bigger numbers . \n moreover , while @xmath102 all the curves of the temperatures rapidly reach to the curve of the schwarzschild ( @xmath103 ) bh s hawking temperature , which goes to zero with increasing @xmath78-value .     versus drnbh mass @xmath78 . \n the plots are governed by eq . \n the starting masses are governed by @xmath99 . ] \n in this paper , we firstly reviewed the derivation of the wave equation for the mass generating scalar particles in the concept of the spontaneous symmetry breaking theory . to this end \n , we introduced an action involving a non - minimal scalar field coupled to the gravity . by using the hamilton - jacobi method with a suitable wkb ansatz \n , the quantum tunneling of the mass generating bosons from a generic static bh is thoroughly studied . \n we then obtained the general integral solution for the radial function ( 14 ) for the hamilton - jacobi action @xmath46 . \n drnbh geometry whose the metric functions satisfy the equality @xmath104 is considered as a test background for our computations . \n it is seen that scalar particle mass @xmath31 , the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath8 , and the potential constant @xmath22 are not decisive for the quantum tunneling rate , however the charge @xmath13 is . in the semiclassical framework , we computed the probabilities of the ingoing and outgoing particles to get the quantum tunneling rate for the drnbh . \n finally , we managed to read the standard hawking temperature of the drnbh via the boltzmann formula of the tunneling rate .    in future work \n , we plan to extend our analysis to a bh ( might be a spherically non - symmetric ) having @xmath86 , which does not vanish at the event horizon : @xmath105 . because in such a case eq . \n ( 18 ) may yield such @xmath106 values ( having now the potential constant term @xmath22 ) that the quantum tunneling rate can deviate from its pure thermal character @xcite and give contribution to the information loss problem @xcite . \n we also aim to extend our analysis to the dynamic , rotating and higher / lower dimensional bhs . in this way \n , we will analyze the hr of the mass generating particles from various bhs . \n the authors are grateful to the editor and anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the paper .", "StartTimeOffset": 4168477727125, "RequestID": "fd4de14342647f531c2f65f9656a29c1cc39946c", "TotalTokens": 3744}
{"ContextTokens": 3269, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "in our previous paper devoted to the mean - field analysis of the phase structure of the higgs - yukawa systems @xcite we have concluded that intersection of the critical line separating the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and paramagnetic ( pm ) phases with the line separating the antiferromagnetic ( am ) and pm phases always leads to appearing the ferrimagnetic ( fi ) phase , and that the slopes of the critical lines in the point of their intersection ( denote it @xmath0 has been employed in @xcite for another point . ] ) are continuous . \n these statements have been criticized recently in @xcite where it was argued that the slopes are in general discontinuous and that the fi phase may not appear at all in the point @xmath0 .    in this paper \n we demonstrate that in reference to the systems considered in @xcite this criticism is justified only in part . \n namely , considering within the mean - field approximation the weak coupling regime for the u(1 ) systems we show that in all the cases when the intersection of the fm - pm and am - pm critical lines occurs , the fi phase does appear , and that the slope of the am - pm  fi - fm line is always continuous . \n the reason for the latter fact is that the critical exponents of the magnetization ( v.e.v . of the higgs field ) in this approximation is grater than @xmath1 . \n the slope of the fm -

fm and am - pm lines ( fig . \n 1 ) .    we shall demonstrate now that all the three variants : @xmath63 , @xmath68 , and @xmath66 are realised for the systems considered in @xcite . \n the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in three of those systems : in the systems with the slac , weyl , and the mirror fermion actions . in these cases we have : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the slac action ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 for the weyl action ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 for the mirror fermion action ( the values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given in @xcite ) . \n although @xmath80 depends on the number of flavours @xmath81 , in all these cases @xmath82 for any @xmath81 and therefore the fi phase appears in all of these systems . \n the sign and the value of @xmath53 however depends strongly on @xmath81 : this is due to the fact that the @xmath83 and @xmath84 terms in @xmath53 are independent of @xmath81 , while the @xmath85 terms are @xmath86 . moreover , for given system there exists such number @xmath2 , that @xmath63 if @xmath3 , @xmath87 if @xmath88 , and @xmath66 if @xmath89 . for our systems \n we find : @xmath90 the corresponding phase diagrams are shown qualitatively in fig \n thus , we have demonstrated that in the u(1 ) higgs - yukawa systems with the slac , weyl , or mirror fermion actions the fi phase does appear in the weak coupling regime in the point @xmath0 . in the fi phase , \n at least quite near this point , the magnetization @xmath32 and the staggered magnetization @xmath33 align orthogonally to each other in the group space . \n due to the fact that the free energy involves the logarithmic term , that , in turn , leads to the critical exponents of the magnetization @xmath32 grater than @xmath1 , the @xmath23 critical line ( the am - pm  fi - fm line ) is continuous together with its first derivative in the point @xmath0 . \n the derivative of the @xmath54 critical line ( fm - pm  fi - am line ) is generally discontinuous in the point @xmath0 . \n however the discontinuity depends strongly on the number of the fermion flavours @xmath81 , so that in each system there exist such number @xmath2 , that for @xmath3 the line is smooth , too .    to conclude , \n note that for the systems in which one has @xmath91 ( as it is , for example , for the naive fermions ) , the logarithmic terms in the free energy appear also for the staggered magnetization . \n this means that the critical exponents for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are grater than @xmath1 . \n therefore , in the cases when the fm - pm and am - pm lines intersect in such systems , the slopes of both critical lines are continuous in the point @xmath0 . \n this may occur , for example , in the case of the su(2 ) system with the naive fermions . \n we admit , however , that to make definite conclusion on the existence of the fi phase in the su(2 ) systems a special investigation is necessary . \n i am grateful to s.  tominaga for the numerical calculations of the integrals @xmath92 to @xmath93 and to j.  l.  alonso for a correspondence . \n the work was partly supported by the russian basic research fund under grant 95 -

{"ContextTokens": 3807, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "when a strong field is applied to a macroscopically heterogeneous or composite medium , the induced change of the medium can lead to quite interesting behavior , both in electrical transport and in optical response @xcite . \n these phenomena are most pronounced in the case of periodic composites . in the case of a cubic lattice of dipoles , elementary ( dipole lattice ) \n arguments show that the correction to the lorentz cavity field ( due to all the dipoles inside the cavity ) strictly vanishes @xcite . \n however , when the lattice symmetry is lowered by an external means , e.g. , under the influence of an external force / torque , the lattice is deformed , either lengthened in one direction and/or contracted in the other direction , the correction to the cavity field will not vanish . \n we call this phenomenon the geometric anisotropy @xcite \n . the lattice deformation can easily be realized by the electrorheological effect on a suspension of polarized particles , in which the particles aggregate into anisotropic structures . in this work \n , we will apply the ewald - kornfeld formulation @xcite to a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles , in an attempt to obtain a convergence of the infinite lattice sum and hence examine the effects of geometric anisotropy on the local field distribution . \n the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section \n , we will consider a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles and apply the ewald - kornfeld formulation to calculate the local field . in section iii , \n we perform numerical calculation and the various problems encountered in the computation of the conditionally convergent summation of the near field will be addressed . in section iv \n , we discuss the relation between the present formulation with the established local field concepts . \n we will show that the change in the local field can lead to a generalized clausius - mossotti equation valid for the anisotropic case . \n discussion on related problems will be given . \n consider a tetragonal lattice with lattice constant @xmath0 along the z - axis and lattice constant @xmath1 along the x and y axes . in this way \n , the degree of anisotropy is measured by how @xmath2 is deviated from unity and the uniaxial anisotropic axis is along the z - axis . \n the lattice constants have been chosen so that the volume of the unit cell @xmath3 remains unchanged as @xmath2 varies . \n the lattice vector is given by @xmath4where @xmath5 are integers . \n there are @xmath6 point dipoles @xmath7 located at @xmath8 in a unit cell . the local electric field @xmath9 at a particular point dipole at @xmath8 can be expressed as a sum of the electric field of all dipoles at @xmath10 : @xmath11where `` prime '' denotes a restricted summation which excludes @xmath12 when @xmath13 and @xmath14is the dipole interaction tensor . \n eq.([dipole - sum ] ) can be recast in the ewald - kornfeld form @xcite : @xmath15      \\nonumber \\\\   & - & { 4\\pi \\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g } \\neq 0 }     { 1\\over g^2 } \\exp \\left(-{g^2\\over 4\\eta^2 } \\right )     [ ( { \\bf p}_i \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_i )     \\sum_j ( { \\bf p}_j \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(-i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_j ) ]     \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { 4\\eta^3 p_i^2 \\over 3\\sqrt{\\pi } } , \\label{e - k}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is an adjustable parameter and * g * is a reciprocal lattice vector : @xmath18the @xmath19 and @xmath20 coefficients are given by : @xmath21where @xmath22 is the complementary error function . \n thus the dipole lattice sum of eq.([dipole - sum ] ) becomes a summation over the real lattice vector * r * as well as the reciprocal lattice vector * g*. here we have considered an infinite lattice . for finite lattices , one must be careful about the effects of different boundary conditions @xcite . \n we should remark that although a tetragonal lattice is considered , eq.([e - k ] ) is applicable to arbitrary bravais lattices . \n the adjustable parameter @xmath17 is chosen so that both the summations in the real and reciprocal lattices converge most rapidly . in what follows , \n we will limit ourselves to one dipole per unit cell , and the ewald - kornfeld summation [ eq.([e - k ] ) ] can be carried out . \n we will consider two cases depending on whether the dipole moment is parallel or perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis . in both cases \n , we will compute the local field as a function of the degree of anisotropy @xmath2 . \n consider the longitudinal field case : @xmath23 , i.e. , the dipole moments being along the uniaxial anisotropic axis . \n the local field * e * at the the lattice point * r * = 0 reduces to @xmath24    - { 4\\pi p\\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g}\\neq 0}{g_z^2\\over g^2 }    \\exp\\left({-g^2\\over 4\\eta^2}\\right ) + { 4p\\eta^3\\over { 3\\sqrt\\pi}},\\end{aligned}\\]]and @xmath25 . the local field will be computed by summing over all integer indices , @xmath26 for the summation in the real lattice and @xmath27 for that in the reciprocal lattice . \n because of the exponential factors , we may impose an upper limit to the indices , i.e. , all indices ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is a positive integer . for @xmath30 \n , the regions of summation will be rectangular rather than cubic in both the real and reciprocal lattices . \n the computation has been repeated for various degree of anisotropy with @xmath2 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 . \n a plateau value for @xmath31 is found for each @xmath2 within a certain range of @xmath17 values , indicating that convergence of the local field has indeed been achieved with the upper limit @xmath32 .    for a larger anisotropy , \n however , there have been two problems associated with the computation of the conditionally convergent summation : ( 1 ) the range of @xmath17 that gives the plateau value shrinks as @xmath2 increases . \n even no plateau value could be observed , say , for @xmath33 . in this case , the summation may still converge but possibly for a much larger @xmath29 and the computation time may be prohibitive . \n ( 2 ) the local field can be used to evaluate the depolarization factor @xmath34 , defined by : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total dipole moment per unit volume . \n the near field is the @xmath37 limiting value of the short - range part of the summation . \n we find that if a direct summation over the near field is performed , @xmath34 fluctuates seriously with the increase of @xmath29 , which is unacceptable .    in order to overcome these problems , \n the region of summation has been taken to be inside a sphere of radius @xmath38 in the real lattice , and that of radius @xmath39 in the reciprocal lattice , where @xmath40 is a positive integer . \n all the contribution from the dipoles outside the sphere will be discarded . in this way \n , those dipoles that contribute significantly to the local field but were not considered in the rectangular box are included in the summation . as a result \n , the computation time can be shortened as a much smaller value of @xmath40 can be used for convergence . \n the summation is repeated with increasing @xmath40 for convergence . \n we find that the summation indeed converges to a plateau value within a wide range of @xmath17 even for large anisotropy .    the second problem is also overcome by the summation over a sphere . \n although there are still some fluctuations of the @xmath34 value , the amplitude of fluctuation is greatly reduced . \n we find that @xmath34 converges to 0.33 at @xmath41 . \n physically , it reminds us that @xmath34 is exactly equal to @xmath42 , independent of the degree of anisotropy . \n this implies that the far field is always equal to @xmath43 , as from far away , the lattice structure is irrelevant . \n what concerned us is just the total dipole moment per unit volume . \n the fluctuation around @xmath44 is attributed to the slow convergence and rapid fluctuation of the near field , rather than the local field which converges more rapidly . \n this analysis thus provides us an accurate means of finding the near field by subtracting the far field , i.e. , @xmath43 , from the local field .    for the transverse field case in which the dipole moments are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , eq.(8 ) can still be applied to evaluate the local field by modifying @xmath45 to @xmath46 while taking the gradient along the direction of the dipole , say the x - axis , and obtain the expression of the local field . \n the results of the local field strength ( normalized to @xmath47 ) against @xmath48 for the longitudinal and transverse field cases are plotted in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) respectively . for comparison , the near field \n is also plotted on the same figure . \n the near field vanishes at @xmath49 , in accord with the previous result . \n as @xmath2 decreases , the local field for the longitudinal field case increases rapidly while that for the transverse field case decreases rapidly . in both cases , \n when @xmath2 deviates from unity , the effect of geometric anisotropy has a pronounced effect on the local field strengths . \n our present theory is of microscopic origin , in the sense that we have computed the lattice summation by the ewald - kornfeld formulation . \n we have not invoked any macroscopic concepts like the lorentz cavity field @xcite in the calculations . however , to corroborate with these established concepts can lead to a modification of the clausius - mossotti equation valid for the anisotropic case . \n more precisely , we use the result of the local field to evaluate the effective polarizability @xmath50 of the dipole lattice , which is given by : @xmath51where @xmath52 is the polarizability of an isolated dipole , and @xmath53 is the local field factor . note that @xmath54 when @xmath49 . to see this , the total field acting on a dipole is the sum of the applied field @xmath55 and the local field due to all other dipoles , hence @xmath56 where @xmath55 is the applied electric field . \n let @xmath57 , the above equation becomes a self - consistent equation . solving yields @xmath58 \n the effective dielectric constant @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 . \n for a cubic lattice , @xmath54 , @xmath59 satisfies the well - known clausius - mossotti equation : @xmath61thus eq.(9 ) represents a generalization of the clausius - mossotti equation to the anisotropic lattice . \n the result of the effective polarizability is plotted against @xmath62 in fig.1(c ) for the longitudinal field case while in fig.1(d ) for the transverse field case with @xmath63 and @xmath64 . \n for a small @xmath65 , the effective polarizability is almost independent of @xmath2 . \n however , for a larger @xmath66 , the effective polarizability exhibits similar behavior as the local field . as @xmath2 decreases , @xmath50 for the longitudinal field case increases rapidly while that for the transverse field case decreases rapidly . \n again , when @xmath2 deviates from unity , the effect of geometric anisotropy has a strong impact on the effective polarizability . \n a problem with the lorentz theory is in regard to its generalization to polar media with permanent dipole moments @xmath67 . \n a simple replacement of the polarizability @xmath52 by @xmath52 + @xmath68 in the clausius - mossotti relation leads to a divergent dielectric constant , a phenomenon known as the polarization catastrophy . in 1936 \n , onsager @xcite resolved this problem by introducing a reaction field : while the lorentz local field at the origin is due to all dipole moments of the lattice in the absence of the dipole moment at the origin , the reaction field at the origin arises from the additional polarization of the surrounding dipole moments due to the dipole moment @xmath69 at the origin .    in the present case , \n the onsager reaction field at the origin is given by : @xmath70where @xmath52 is the bare polarizability and t is the dipole interaction tensor @xmath71unlike the summation of the local field , the infinite sum [ eq.([reaction ] ) ] for the onsager reaction field is indeed absolutely convergent . \n no ewald - kornfeld formulation is needed because the product t : t is positive definite . for a simple cubic lattice of dipole moments , by summing over nearest neighbors , the result is : @xmath72 which is already close to the infinite lattice limit @xmath73 . \n it is instructive to extend the consideration to anisotropic lattices . \n the reaction field is conveniently expressed as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the reaction field factor . \n again , the summation over sphere has helped the convergence . \n we perform the direct summation in the real lattice to obtain the reaction field factor for various @xmath2 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 . in fig.2(a ) and ( b ) , we plot @xmath75 versus @xmath48 for the longitudinal and transverse field cases respectively . \n there is a minimum @xmath75 around @xmath49 ( but not exactly at @xmath49 ) in both cases and @xmath75 increases rapidly when @xmath2 deviates from unity . as evident from fig.2 , \n the effect of geometry anisotropy has a strong impact on the reaction field strength . \n here a few comments on the results are in order . \n we should remark that the present work employs the electrostatic ( dipole ) approximation . while such an approximation is simpler to implement and suffices in many cases , for optical properties of composites of metallic particles embedded in a dielectric host medium , however \n , one must go beyond the electrostatic approximation @xcite . \n it is possible to extend the present theory to statistical geometric anisotropy @xcite , e.g. , that being induced by the electrorheological effects @xcite . \n we may also extend the formulation to a randomly dilute lattice of dipoles to mimic mixed magnetic and nonmagnetic ions . \n although we have employed a lattice structure in the present work , our formalism can readily be applied to an assembly of randomly placed dipoles by considering a more complex basis in a unit cell . \n such an extension will be useful for the study of dielectric liquids under an intense electric field .    in conclusion , \n we have applied the ewald - kornfeld formulation to a tetragonal lattice of point dipoles to examine the effects of geometric anisotropy on the local field distribution . \n the various problems encountered in the computation of the conditionally convergent summation are addressed and the methods of overcoming them are discussed . \n we suggest that the large value of the derivative of the local field with respect to the degree of anisotropy offers potential applications as artificial piezoelectric materials as one can change the degree of anisotropy easily in a suspension . \n this work was supported by the research grants council of the hong kong sar government under grant cuhk 4284/00p .    for recent work , \n see _ proceedings of the 5th international conference on electrical transport and optical properties of inhomogeneous media _ , physica b * 279 * , ( 2000 ) . \n n. w. ashcroft and n. d. mermin , _ solid state physics _ \n 27 ( holt , rinehart and winston , 1976 ) ; see also j. r. reitz , f. j. milford and r. w. christy , _ foundations of electromagnetic theory _ , chap . \n 5 , third edition , ( addison -

\n similar trend has in fact been reported by previous authors ( cowie et al . \n 1995 , mccraken et al . \n 2000 , gardner 1995 , sarraco et al . \n 2001 , but see sarraco et al . \n we found that at least two phenomena are responsible for the distribution , namely , ( i ) deficit of intrinsically faint ( @xmath26 ) red galaxies at intermediate redshift ( z > 0.5 - 1 ) , and ( ii ) deficit of red galaxies including luminous ones at @xmath27 . \n this can be well recognized by comparing the data with the passive evolutionary models for the color - magnitude relation in the coma cluster ( kodama et al . \n 1998 ) that are also shown if figure 4 . \n three lines represent the tracks of passively - evolving galaxies that are formed at @xmath28 and have @xmath29 at present epoch . \n the cosmology is @xmath30=1 , @xmath31=0.3 , @xmath32=0.7 , and @xmath33=70 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 .    for the galaxies in hdf - n , we have the data of spectroscopic and photometric redshift . \n we can see clear deficit of faint red galaxies for those between @xmath35 and @xmath36 as shown in figure 5 . \n this is quite puzzling and interesting phenomena , since it can not be explained by simple field - to - field variation effects because there are a certain number of luminous red galaxies at the same redshift . \n the number density of low - mass objects are expected to be larger than that of the luminous objects since the local luminosity function have exponential cut - off at the luminous end at any band . \n our result may imply that we rarely see the less massive galaxies that are dominated by old - stellar population at the intermediate redshift where old massive galaxies exist . \n it may be related to the negative faint - end of the local e / s0 luminosity function . \n kajisawa and yamada ( 2001 ) investigated a complete volume - limited sample of galaxies with @xmath37 up to z=2 in the hdf - n . based on their careful morphological classification as well as evaluation of the possible uncertainty in photometric redshift , they concluded that the number density of early - type galaxies in hdf - n have very conspicuous decrease above z=1 . \n so the deficit of red galaxies at @xmath38 seen in figure 4 may not be surprising although we still do not fully understand why such rapid change of the number density is observed at @xmath39 after considering the possible effects of field - to - field variation and dust extinction , etc . \n we are planning to conduct more extended deep nir and optical survey with subaru to fully resolve these questions . \n bruzual a. , g.  & charlot , s.  1993 , apj , 405 , 538 cowie , l.  l. , hu , e.  m. , & songaila , a.  1995 , aj , 110 , 1576 dickinson , m.  2000 , royal society of london philosophical transactions series , 358 , 2001 gardner , j.  p. , cowie , l.  l. , & wainscoat , r.  j.  1993 , apjl , 415 , l9 kajisawa , m.  & yamada , t.  2001 , pasj , 53 , 833 keel , w.  c. , cohen , s.  h. , windhorst , r.  a. , & waddington , i.  1999 , aj , 118 , 2547 kodama , t. , arimoto , n. , barger , a.  j. , & aragon - salamanca , a.  1998 , a$a , 334 , 99 mccracken , h.  j. , metcalfe , n. , shanks , t. , campos , a. , gardner , j.  p. , & fong , r.  2000 , mnras , 311 , 707 motohara , k.  et al . \n 2001 , pasj , 53 , 459 pascarelle , s.  m. , windhorst , r.  a. , keel , w.  c. , scoville , n. , & armus , l.  1996 , american astronomical society meeting , 189 , 8302 papovich , c. , dickinson , m. , & ferguson , h.  c.  2001 , apj , 559 , 620 saracco , p. , giallongo , e. , cristiani , s. , dodorico , s. , fontana , a. , iovino , a. , poli , f. , & vanzella , e.  2001 , a&a , 375 , 1 saracco , p. , dodorico , s. , moorwood , a. , buzzoni , a. , cuby , j .- \n g . , & lidman , c.  1999 , a&a , 349 , 751 shapley , a.  e. , steidel , c.  c. , adelberger , k.  l. , dickinson , m. , giavalisco , m. , & pettini , m.  2001 , apj , 562 , 95 yamada , t. et al . \n 2001 , pasj , 53 , 1119 .", "StartTimeOffset": 4217542465822, "RequestID": "1efc856e75a9a4110f01b822fc873b5cca4c544a", "TotalTokens": 2517}
{"ContextTokens": 2918, "GeneratedTokens": 218, "SynthesizedBody": "strong x - ray pulsations with a 2.49 msec period were discovered from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = in an april 1998 observation with the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite . the pulsar is a member of an accreting binary system with an orbital period of 2.01 hour and a low - mass companion @xcite . though similar to other low - mass x - ray binaries in its timing and spectral properties ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = is unique for its x - ray pulsations . \n no other such binary has shown coherent pulsations in its persistent flux despite of careful searches ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n as such , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = is the fastest rotating accreting neutron star . \n if the pulsations are due to modulated emission from one hot spot on the neutron star surface , the 2.49 msec period corresponds to an equatorial speed of approximately 0.1c . with these high speeds , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + \n = offers an excellent system for studying relativistic effects . \n one such effect may be the observed lag of low - energy photons relative to high - energy photons in the pulse discovered by @xcite . \n @xcite suggest that the lags are due to comptonization in a relatively cool surrounding medium . \n alternatively , the lags may be the result of a relativistic effect : the high - energy photons are preferentially emitted at earlier phases due to doppler boosting along the line of sight . \n this possibility was suggested for the similar lags in the 549  hz oscillations in an x - ray burst of aql  x-1 @xcite , where a simple model showed that the delays roughly match those expected .    in the following , we present new measurements of the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = . \n we show that the energy - dependent phase lags are equivalent to a hardening pulse profile . \n we model this behavior in terms of a hot spot on the neutron star , including relativistic effects . \n we have used publicly available data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board rxte in an ` event ' mode with high time resolution ( 122@xmath2sec ) and high energy resolution ( 64 channels ) . \n the observations occurred from april 10 1998 to may 7 1998 , when the source was in outburst . \n we generate folded lightcurves in each pca channel . \n this is accomplished with the fasebin tool in ftools version 4.2 , which applies all known xte clock corrections and corrects photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de-200 ephemeris , yielding a timing accuracy of several @xmath2sec ( much less than the phase binning used here ) . as a check , \n we have applied this method to crab pulsar data and the results are identical to @xcite . to produce pulse profiles in the neutron star rest frame , we use the sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = orbital ephemeris found by @xcite . \n an example folded lightcurve is shown in figure  [ lc ] ( top ) for the observation of april 18 1998 14:05:40 to april 19 1998 00:51:44 utc . \n to study the energy spectra at each phase bin , we take the rates at pulse minimum and subtract it from the rest of the data at other phases . \n this effectively accomplishes background subtraction and eliminates the unpulsed emission which we do not wish to consider . \n note , however , that the pulsed emission may have some contribution even at the pulse minimum and this subtraction scheme represents only a best approximation to the true pulse emission . \n we generate detector response matrices appropriate to the observation date and data mode using pcarsp v2.38 , and use xspec v.10.0 to fit model spectra . \n we fit the spectrum here with a simple powerlaw function . \n though the function itself is not meant to be a physical description , the powerlaw index provides a good measure of the spectral hardness . \n fits in each phase bin have reduced @xmath3 of 0.7 to 1.6 . including an interstellar absorption does not substantially affect these results . \n the powerlaw index clearly increases through the pulse phase ( figure  [ lc ] , bottom ) , i.e. spectrum evolves from hard to soft . \n we also fit the profiles of the folded lightcurves in each channel using fourier functions at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics . from these fits \n we determine the phase lag in each channel relative to the fits in some baseline channel range . \n results for the 18 april 1998 observation are shown in figure  [ lags ] as solid symbols . \n note that negative numbers indicate that high - energy photons precede low - energy photons . \n we are also able to measure lags in the first harmonic , and find that they are opposite in sign to the fundamental , i.e. low - energy photons precede high - energy photons in the first harmonic . \n no lags are measurable in the other harmonics . \n another way to measure energy - dependent phase lags is by fourier cross - correlation analysis . \n this is the method used for sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = by @xcite and for other timing signals as well , e.g. kilohertz qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n for a description of cross correlation analysis see e.g. @xcite . from the pca event mode data we calculate fourier spectra in various channel ranges with nyquist frequency of 2048 hz and resolution of 0.25 hz . \n we then calculate cross spectra defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the complex fourier coefficients for two energy bands at the pulsar frequency @xmath6 . \n the phase lag between the two energy bands is given by the argument of @xmath7 . \n we measure all phase delays relative to the unbinned channels range 5 to 8 , i.e. 1.83 to 3.27 kev for 5 detector units in pca gain epoch 3 ( april 15 1996 to march 22 1999 ) . \n the results for the 18 april 1998 observation , are shown in figure  [ lags ] by the open symbols . \n the phase lags are consistent with those calculated from the lightcurve fitting . from the cross - correlation spectra \n we are not able to measure lags in the much weaker harmonics . \n we have calculated phase lag spectra also for other rxte observations during the april 1998 outburst . \n these spectra are similar to that in figure  [ lags ] . \n to quantify the trends , we compute an average phase delay , @xmath8 , over all energies for each observation . \n we also fit a broken powerlaw function to each phase delay spectrum : @xmath9 below a break energy , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 above this energy . \n figure  [ lags_v_time ] shows the quantities @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 versus the time of each observation .    there is a clear connection between the results of the two analyses presented here . \n the phase resolved spectroscopy shows that the spectrum softens and correspondingly the peak of the pulse profile appears slightly earlier in phase for higher energies ( figure  [ lc ] ) . \n the method of measuring phase delays shows the same behavior : higher - energy photons preferentially lead lower - energy photons in the fundamental and the magnitude of this phase delay increases with energy ( figure  [ lags ] ) . in the following we discuss a model that can account for the phase delays / spectral softening measured here . \n we calculate the expected luminosity as a function of phase in a manner similar to @xcite but including doppler effects @xcite and time of flight delays @xcite . \n this treatment is based on a schwarzschild metric , where the photon trajectories are completely determined by the compactness , @xmath13 . \n the predicted luminosity as a function of phase from our code matches the results of @xcite and @xcite for the various choices of parameters . \n @xcite recently developed a model for pulse profiles using a slightly different approach . \n the parameters in the model are the speed at the equator of the neutron star , @xmath14 , the mass of the neutron star , @xmath15 , the compactness , @xmath13 , the angular size of the cap , @xmath16 , and the viewing angles , @xmath17 ( the angle between the rotation axis and the cap center ) and @xmath18 ( rotation axis to line of sight ) . \n another ingredient is the emission from the spot , which we take as isotropic and isothermal . \n the spectrum of energy emitted from the spot is another important input . \n note that if the emitted spectrum is power law like , the observed spectrum will not evolve with phase , since doppler transformation preserves the shape ( see * ? ? ? \n the intrinsic spectrum must therefore have some shape that transforms to match the observed hardening and phase lags ; we use a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath19 . \n a fit from the model is shown in figure  [ lags ] . \n this fit uses the following model parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath21\\c\\else\\if'\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\else\\if\\empty\\c\\else\\if\\space\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\fi}}}$ ] , @xmath22 kev , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . to derive count rates , we use table models in xspec and the appropriate response files as discussed above . \n the fit for this single set of parameters is good ; we find @xmath26 from the fourier cross - correlation data or a reduced @xmath3 of 0.8 for all the parameters fixed . \n a full exploration of the parameter space of the model is beyond the scope of this letter . \n we note the following trends , however . \n the magnitude of the phase lags depends sensitively on @xmath14 and @xmath19 . \n larger delays result from higher speeds , because the pulses become increasingly asymmetric due to doppler boosting . \n this asymmetry is also energy dependent , so there is a dependence on @xmath19 as well ( see * ? ? ? \n the lags also depend on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , especially at higher energies where there is the turn - over noted above . \n the phase lags are less sensitive to @xmath13 and @xmath16 . \n we have tested the assumption of isotropic emission and found that the phase lags depend only weakly on the beaming . \n the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = evolves through its phase from a relatively hard to a soft spectrum , as shown by our phase resolved spectroscopy ( figure  [ lc ] ) . \n this evolution can also be thought of , and measured as , an energy - dependent phase lag in the fundamental ( figure  [ lags ] ) , i.e. higher - energy photons emerging earlier in phase than lower - energy photons . \n we have applied a model to the data which consists of a hot spot on the rotating neutron star under a general relativistic treatment . \n the dominant effect accounting for energy - dependent delays is doppler boosting , the larger boosting factors at earlier phases giving harder spectra . \n the model fits the data quite well . \n the model also provides a stable mechanism for generating the phase delays , which meshes with the fact that the characteristic delays remain stable in time to within 25% ( figure  [ lags_v_time ] ) even as there is a factor of two decrease in the x - ray flux , a possible tracer of accretion rate . as noted in @xcite , in addition to explaining the energy - dependent phase lags in sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = , this mechanism may also account for the lags in the burst oscillations of aql x-1 @xcite and kilohertz qpos @xcite . \n phase resolved spectroscopy has not yet been possible in these signals . \n the model offers a new means of measuring the neutron star mass and radius , a notoriously difficult problem in accreting binary systems . the radius is directly related to @xmath14 , the equatorial speed ( @xmath27 ) . \n the fits also depend on the model parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 , though the lag spectra are less sensitive to these quantities . \n the model could be independently constrained by future optical spectroscopy of the companion which could provide information on @xmath15 and the viewing angles , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n we acknowledge stimulating discussions with the participants of the august 1999 aspen workshop on relativity where an early version of this work was presented . \n we thank michiel van der klis , mariano mndez and luigi stella for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported by nwo spinoza grant 08 - 0 to e.p.j.van den heuvel , by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) under contract number 614 - 51 - 002 , and by the netherlands researchschool for astronomy ( nova ) . \n this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .", "StartTimeOffset": 4221339188582, "RequestID": "f44f6b925d20afdb9dfb37589c5be8a3f197439b", "TotalTokens": 3136}

{"ContextTokens": 3224, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "the emission of radio frequency ( rf ) radiation from the extended air showers ( eas ) produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr , i.e. , particles with energy @xmath0ev ) impinging on the earth atmosphere has been investigated since the 60s , after askaryan @xcite proposed a coherent mechanism for the production of cherenkov radiation at mhz frequencies ( the so called askaryan effect ) . the first detection of rf radiation from eas was proved in 1965 by jelley et al . @xcite . \n the idea of askaryan relies on the excess of negative charges in the shower , since positrons tend to disappear through their annihilation into photons , and further electrons are created via compton scattering by photons . \n if the number of electrons and positrons is the same , emission would not occur because the electric field generated by opposite charges is equal ( in module ) and opposite ( in sign ) . upon certain conditions \n , the cherenkov yield is not proportional to the number @xmath1 of charged particles in the shower , but to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fractional excess of charge . \n the quadratic dependence on @xmath1 ( and therefore on @xmath4 ) makes the askaryan effect attractive as mechanism for the detection of uhecrs .    in the following years \n , other mechanisms were proposed , which predict a coherent emission of rf radiation , and invoke the interaction of the shower electrons and positrons with the earth magnetic field . \n negative and positive charges are separated by the magnetic field , creating an electric dipole . during the motion of the dipole , \n rf radiation is emitted in coherent way ( geomagnetic effect ) . \n alternatively , charged particles are bent because of the lorentz force and emit synchrotron radiation ( geosynchrotron effect ) . \n the bunch of particles in the eas arriving to the detector can be schematically depicted as a dish , with thickness @xmath5 of a few meters and diameter depending of the energy of the primary . \n as will see in the followings , the requirement that the wavelength @xmath6 is comparable with the dish thickness puts a frequency cutoff above which coherence is lost ( and , consequently , the emission strongly hampered ) : @xmath7  mhz , where @xmath8 is the speed of light . \n the coherence condition explains why the experimental investigation is mostly concentrated in the frequency range @xmath9  mhz . \n this picture is not complete . \n only very recently , it has been shown , with monte carlo simulations @xcite , that geosynchrotron radiation can be coherent above @xmath10100  mhz under certain conditions : since the emission occurs in air , which has a ( altitude dependent ) refractive index @xmath11 , a time compression of rf wavefront is produced , which causes the coherence to extend to higher frequency , even beyond the ghz . \n the compression takes place only inside a cone with aperture @xmath12 equal to the cherenkov angle , and angular spread @xmath13 . outside this small angular region , \n coherence is lost and the rf output power falls dramatically . \n in this coherence regime , sometimes named \n geomagnetic cherenkov radiation \" , the emitted electric field amplitude @xmath14 depends on the frequency and can be modelled , as shown by refs . \n , as @xmath15 with @xmath16 300  mhz and @xmath17 500  mhz . here we will not deal with such particular mechanism . \n the first experimental proof of the coherent cherenkov emission in laboratory controlled conditions was performed in 2001 by directing picosecond pulses of gev photons against a silica sand target @xcite . successively other tests were conducted using rock salt @xcite or ice @xcite as targets . because of the higher density of those materials , the shower dimensions are different than in air , and askaryan effect can extend beyond ghz frequencies . \n the coherent rf emission by charged particles in the presence of a magnetic field has been measured in controlled conditions and successfully checked versus electrodynamics simulations in ref . . \n beside coherent emission , a rf incoherent emission mechanism exists , that is , bremsstralhung radiation , the emission of photons during the deflection of electrons and positrons under the coulomb field of the nuclei . \n the emission is always present but is weak since it scales linearly with @xmath4 and the cross section is low .    in this paper we do not discuss the various mechanisms of production of rf radiation and their relative importance . \n our purpose is to explicitly show how and when coherent mechanisms appear , and to derive a general formula which involves the coherent and the incoherent regimes . \n we suppose that the eas is composed by @xmath1 charged particles divided into @xmath18 electrons and @xmath19 positrons ( @xmath20 ) , and indicate with @xmath3 the charge excess : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . \n depending of the rf radiation mechanism , the phase of the electromagnetic wave from a single emitter ( electron or positron ) can change randomly with time or can not . for bremsstrahlung , for example , \n the phase changes randomly and therefore the superposition of @xmath1 sources is incoherent and the emitted energy is proportional to @xmath1 . for synchrotron , geomagnetic , and cherenkov emission the phase of a single emitter does not change randomly with time . \n the superposition of @xmath1 emitters can be coherent or incoherent depending on the random relative position of the individual sources .    to simplify the calculations \n , we suppose that the electric field amplitude is unity and the fields are polarized in the same direction .    for the case of cherenkov radiation , the electron and positron electric fields have opposite sign . \n therefore the total electric field @xmath14 ( at the detector ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the phases of the rf wave emitted by the @xmath26-th electron and positron , respectively . for any @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 \n are independent random variables with the same distribution @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 \n . therefore their mean values , for any @xmath26 , are @xmath29 . \n the energy @xmath30 is @xmath31 we are interested to the mean value @xmath32 : @xmath33 since @xmath24 is independent of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 = @xmath37 = @xmath38 = @xmath39 . \n it is reasonable to assume that the probability density @xmath40 is an even function between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so @xmath43 . in conclusion \n , @xmath44 analogously @xmath45 @xmath46 the energy @xmath47 is therefore @xmath48\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ]    the factor which determines the presence of the coherence is precisely @xmath49 . \n it can be easily seen in the case where the phases @xmath50 are uniformly distributed between @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath51 two extreme regimes can be identified :    1 . \n @xmath52 : @xmath53 , which is the condition for complete incoherence . \n the total energy is @xmath54 . \n this is the case , for example , of the optical and uv cherenkov light emission . \n @xmath55 : total coherence . \n @xmath56 , depends on the excess @xmath3 of negative charges in the shower . \n the cherenkov angle . ]    . \n [ fg : systemref ]    we treat now the generic case for the cherenkov radiation where the phase @xmath50 is not uniformely distributed . \n the results can be easily adapted to the geosynchronous and the geomagnetic radiation . with reference to fig.[fg : systemref ] , we introduce a reference system with versors @xmath57 , where the eas axis coincides the @xmath58 axis . \n @xmath59 is a single emitter with cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the cherenkov cone aperture , @xmath62 the angular coordinate along the emission cone . \n the detector d is placed on the axis @xmath58 at the distance @xmath63 : @xmath64 . \n p is the projection of s on the x - y plane . \n then : @xmath65 , @xmath66 . \n the wave vector @xmath67 is @xmath68 and the phase @xmath50 of the electric field in the point d is @xmath69\\ ] ] the phase @xmath50 depends also on @xmath63 ( fixed value ) , but since in the calculation of the energy only the phase differences enter , the term with @xmath63 always eliminates , so we can put @xmath70 to simplify the computation : @xmath71\\ ] ] we schematize the shower as a flat cylinder , with thickness @xmath5 and charge distribution @xmath72 along the shower axis ( @xmath73 ) , and radial charge distribution @xmath74 such as @xmath75 = 1 . \n the angular variables @xmath76 and @xmath62 are distributed uniformily between 0 and @xmath77 \n . then @xmath78\\big]\\ ] ] the computation is straightforward in the case @xmath79 ( uniform distribution ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the bessel function of the first kind . \n calling : @xmath82 and @xmath83 then @xmath84    the same procedure can be applied to the geosynchrotron emission . \n the electric field of the synchrotron radiation is @xcite : @xmath85}{r~(1-\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\hat{n})^3 } \\bigg]_{retarded}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the versor of the direction of observation , @xmath87 is the particle acceleration , and the electron electric charge @xmath88 must be considered with the sign . since positrons and electrons have opposite acceleration under magnetic field , the product @xmath89 is the same for the two particles , so the electric fields sum up . \n therefore , for geosynchrotron radiation , the eq.([eq : efield ] ) becomes @xmath90 and the final result is : @xmath91\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ] in case of total coherence , @xmath92 . \n ( [ eq : wmedio ] ) and ( [ eq : wmedio2 ] ) can be summarized stating that the total power emitted by @xmath1 sources is obtained multiplying the power from a single source by a factor @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the spatial coherence factor , function of the radiation frequency @xmath96 and of the shower shape and dimension , and the sign @xmath97 depends on the emission mechanism (  for cherenkov , + for synchrotron and geomagnetic ) . \n the factor @xmath98 in eq.([eq : m ] ) determines the coherent or incoherent regime . if @xmath99 , the incoherence is total , and @xmath100 , i.e. the total emitted power is the some of the @xmath1 single powers . on the opposite \n , complete coherence occurs as @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for cherenkov emission , @xmath103 for geosynchrotron and geomagnetic emission , i.e. , the power is proportional to the squared number of emitters . \n the factorization ( @xmath104 ) has the physical meaning that the longitudinal and radial developments of the showers are independent of each other , which is a reasonable approximation that can be extended to the general case . \n @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , takes into account the radial emitter distribution @xmath74 , in the plane perpendicular to the shower axis , while @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) takes into account the distribution along the longitudinal axis .    as a check , \n note that when @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( total spatial incoherence ) and when @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( total spatial coherence ) . \n as an example of the above calculations , we apply them to the case of eas produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .    it is well known that a relativistic particle with velocity @xmath115 such that @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the refractive index of air , radiates electromagnetic waves at the angle @xmath118 at the energy rate ( in si units ) : @xmath119 since @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , for an eas with @xmath1 secondary particles the radiated power @xmath123 in the bandwidth @xmath124 centred around the frequency @xmath96 , neglecting coherence effets , is : @xmath125     for the coherent cherenkov effect assuming the nkg radial charge distribution . ]    where @xmath126 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath127 the planck constant . \n when coherence occurs , the emitted power is obtained from the above equation substituting the factor @xmath1 with @xmath2 and taking into consideration the amplitude @xmath98 ( eq.([eq : m ] ) ) . \n then @xmath128 to calculate @xmath129 from eq.([eq : ar ] ) we must know the radial charge distribution @xmath130 . \n some examples can be found in the original work of askaryan @xcite . \n here we treat the case of the nishima , kamata , greisen ( nkg ) distribution , which describes adequately the charge distribution in an eas@xcite . \n the normalized density function @xmath74 is : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the factorial gamma function , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 m. @xmath135 has been evaluated numerically and the result shown in fig.[fg : fignkg ] . \n the frequency cutoff , where the power is reduced by a factor of 2 , is @xmath136 mhz .    regarding the longitudinal coherence , in the simple case of an uniform charge distribution , we get , as shown before in eq.([eq : az ] ) , a @xmath137 function with the first zero occurring at @xmath138 mhz for @xmath139 m. beyond that frequency , the rf emitted power scales as @xmath140 . \n more realistic cases are discussed in ref .  . \n we have derived a general formula for the emission of radio frequency from particle showers , which describes also the transition from the incoherent regime to the coherent one . \n a coherence factor is introduced , which depends on the spatial charge distribution of the radio frequency emitters . \n the formula applies also to dense materials , such as ice , for example , which has been proposed as target medium

time can be curved by matter , one can construct solutions that exhibit closed timelike curves on a global scale . \n there are a surprisingly large number of such solutions @xcite , and here is only a partial list : van stockum spacetime @xcite , gdel s rotating universe @xcite , tipler s cylinders @xcite , kerr geometries @xcite , wheeler wormhole @xcite , morris - thorne traversable wormholes @xcite , gott s infinite cosmic strings @xcite , and alcubierre s  warp drive \" spacetime @xcite . \n thus ctcs can not be easily discarded as unphysical solutions . \n it is not hard to imagine paradoxes created by time travel . \n let us start by reviewing the usual problems of closed causal loops . \n there are only two known classes of time travel paradoxes : the grandfather paradox , and the creation of information from nothing .    in the grandfather paradox \n , a time traveler goes back in time and prevents his grandfather to meet his grandmother , thus preventing his own birth . in the information paradox , \n a person is handed the blue - prints of a time machine by its older self , constructs the machine and use it to hand himself the blue - prints . who invented the blue - prints ? \n the grandfather paradox is usually encountered in classical mechanics . \n a typical philosophical argument against ctcs is  free will \" : when i go back in time it is my free will to kill my younger self . \n the  free - will \" counter - argument is as follows : it is my free will to walk on the ceiling , but the laws of physics prevent it and in the same way when i want to complete an inconsistent ctc the laws of physics would prevent it no matter how hard i try . \n all i can achieve is a consistent ctc @xcite . \n since  free - will \" is a fuzzy philosophical concept , to make the problem mathematically tractable , it is usual to consider the collision of billiard balls at the mouth of a wormhole . \n a well known general relativity solution exhibiting time travel is the wormhole solution . \n a spherically symmetric and static traversable wormhole is represented by the following spacetime metric : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath3 @xcite . \n acceleration of one of the wormhole mouths can introduce a time delay which transforms the wormhole into a time machine . \n in this case we have to address the  polchinski paradox\"@xcite . \n consider that a billiard ball falls through a wormhole , travels back in time , and collides with its younger self , preventing it to fall in the wormhole in the first place . \n similar paradoxes have been obtained by rama and sen@xcite when they considered collisions of objects of different mass . \n there is only one way to avoid those paradoxes : eliminate the initial conditions that can lead to them@xcite . \n a self consistent collision would look like the interaction shown in fig . \n [ figure6 ] .        restricting initial conditions is very disturbing , because no such mechanism is known in the macroscopic world . \n just the mere presence of a ctc region in our causal future would have consequences here and now . \n we may not be visited by time travelers from the future because we are uninteresting , but nobody has yet observed any evidence of restricted initial conditions . \n elementary particles can be accelerated very precisely in any direction one wants . \n originally it was suggested that quantum mechanics may play a role in achieving the selection of the appropriate initial conditions @xcite and cure the classical multiplicity of solutions ( which may also include inconsistent collisions ) . \n for example , by performing a sum - over - consistent - histories in a wkb approximation we may obtain only the correct and unique initial condition corresponding to the consistent self - interaction . \n it is true that a final theory of quantum mechanics in curved space - time does not exist yet , and maybe close to the wormhole mouth new physical laws may be at play . \n the problem is that the world line of the billiard ball originates far away from the wormhole in flat space - time where regular physics is applicable . \n now , however unlikely , assume that such restrictions are somehow in place , due to a future , yet undiscovered , unified theory . \n are ctcs compatible with quantum mechanics ? \n first , the grandfather paradox does not occur in quantum mechanics because in quantum mechanics one encounters qbits . \n the classical contradiction could coexist in a superposition of quantum states@xcite , and the only way to get a real contradiction is if summing over all states the total probability is no longer one . therefore the contradiction would manifest itself as a unitarity problem @xcite . propagating along a ctc , the wavefunction can become causality trapped . \n when the probability to detect the particle outside the ctc region is more than one , this corresponds to the paradox of creating information from nothing . when the probability is smaller than one , then part of the original physical system becomes causally trapped inside the ctc region in a cyclical history that repeats itself forever . \n but the problem is even worse . \n quantum mechanics as it is known is incompatible with ctcs as pointed out by jacobson@xcite : there are ambiguities in computing expectation values . \n this is expected if one has non - unitary evolution since the cauchy problem is ill defined . \n several possible generalizations for quantum mechanics were proposed by hartle@xcite , anderson@xcite , and fewster@xcite . \n one may argue that those generalizations may have objectionable feature like the fact that the presence of a ctc region in our causal future can imply measurable departures from today s predictions of standard quantum mechanics . \n we have already encountered those features in the classical physics in the form of restriction to initial conditions , and the fact the free will may only be an illusion . if the ctc region is well ahead in our causal future , then the measurable effects of those departures from standard quantum mechanics and the usual classical physics may be negligible . to be able to reject those generalizations we need to investigate additional consequences of those theories . \n for example hawking showed that quantum coherence is lost@xcite in a ctc and therefore one can not gain any information from time travelers from the future . \n but while time travel may be of no value to gain the knowledge of the future , this is no argument to reject time travel altogether . \n also we can construct non - contradictory quantum field theories on curved space - time only on global hyperbolic spaces@xcite . \n again , the lack of our current knowledge does not constitute a proof that a future , yet undiscovered , unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics may not be able to provide the correct generalization of quantum mechanics and the justification of the initial condition selection . \n there is yet another reason to believe that time travel is impossible as pointed by hawking in his `` chronology protection conjecture''@xcite . \n the vacuum polarization effects will get amplified by a ctc region resulting in a gravitational back - reaction that will destroy the ctc region . \n since we lack a unified theory , we can not just base the rejection of time travel on semi - classical approximations . \n as a counter example visser showed that a roman ring of wormholes can create a time machine without stability problems @xcite .    a way to solve the paradoxes of time travel \n is to demand a global self consistency condition that will guarantee that all self - interactions are consistent @xcite . \n the laws of physics are usually defined locally and the fundamental reason for this is that on a curved manifold , the tangent space is defined at each point . \n local laws seem to prevent the existence of any global constraints . \n there are two possible counter arguments to the local physical laws argument . \n first , quantum mechanics is non - local . \n second , consider the motion in phase space or that of an incompressible fluid . in this case closed trajectories do form and there are no local contradictions . \n this is actually a very intuitive way to picture what should happen on ctc region that is globally consistent .    for the first counter - argument \n , we will investigate below the consequences of a global self - consistency principle and find that it leads to non - renormalizable theories . \n for the second counter - argument , one can not define a metric on a phase space . \n there is much more local freedom on a metric manifold , than on a symplectic manifold . on a symplectic manifold \n one can define only a skew - symmetric bilinear form and have only global invariants . in phase space \n one can not have arbitrary changes of coordinates , because that would violate hamilton s equations . \n let us consider more and more violent collisions of the billiard ball in the polchinski - type collision . \n at some point , the billiard balls will break and generate a paradox . \n equivalently , one can consider repeating the consistent self - interaction with the same initial conditions , but with more and more brittle billiard balls of the same mass and shape . \n one can even consider manufacturing billiard balls made of @xmath4 pieces , with a small explosive in the middle that will break the ball in its constituent pieces during any collision . \n the key point is that one repeats the experiment with all those balls , preserving the same initial conditions corresponding to a self - consistent interaction .    with those preparations , \n let us assume that the billiard ball is made of two equal halves ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) that are loosely connected ( by a weak material ) and will separate if during the collision the momentum transfer in the center of mass referential system exceeds a particular threshold value . \n now repeat the collision experiment with the same initial condition but with increased brittleness ( reduced threshold for separation ) of the billiard balls of the same shape and mass . from the point of view of a global self - consistency principle , nothing is changed .    in one of the repeated experiments , at some point the momentum transfer is going to exceed the threshold value in a center of mass coordinate system and the billiard ball will break . \n one can enforce the pieces separation after breaking for example by adding a positive electric charge to each piece . \n after the collision , there are three possible outcomes :    1 . \n no piece enters the wormhole , 2 . \n only one piece enters the wormhole and causes the earlier collision , 3 . \n the two pieces @xmath5 and @xmath6 remain together and follow same self - consistent trajectory \n .    if no piece enters the wormhole , then the earlier collision did not take place and we have a paradox . \n if only one piece causes the collision , because it s mass is half of the original billiard ball , the momentum transfer falls below the separation threshold , and no longer causes the breaking , resulting in another paradox . \n only if the billiard ball pieces stay together are all paradoxes avoided . \n this implies that the self - consistency principle requires infinite strength to maintain cohesion for _ all _ billiard balls participating in a self - consistent interaction and this is just not true . \n the global consistency condition imposes an impossible unphysical demand on the local physics of collision which can also happen far away from the wormhole mouths where standard physics is applicable .    when indestructible elementary particles are used instead of billiard balls , the contradictions are not avoided because at high enough energies other particles are going to be generated . as other particles \n are generated , the energy of the original particle is reduced below the generation threshold thus preventing the generation in the first place and again a contradiction ensues .    _ \n if even in classical physics one encounters infinities , wherever the correspondence principle is valid there is no hope to obtain a renormalizable quantum theory in curved space - time containing ctcs . _    the only possible escape of the conclusion is if the correspondence principle may not hold and classical physics can not emerge from the quantum world . \n this may be the case at plank scale where the regular space time manifold may cease to be well defined . in this range \n we do need a unified theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics . \n we can now conclude that closed causal loops are forbidden in general in nature in the range of the validity of the correspondence principle . \n quantum mechanics can only be defined on global hyperbolic manifolds and all general relativity solutions exhibiting time travel are unphysical . as hawking put it , the world is indeed safe for historians . \n 99 m.  visser , _ the quantum physics of chronology protection , _ arxiv : gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3206, "GeneratedTokens": 134, "SynthesizedBody": "the quantum teleportation phenomenon @xcite has become one of the central aspects in the investigations of quantum entanglement . \n its possible applicability for quantum communication and its experimental realization in different physical systems @xcite gave rise to a wide spread interest in several related problems , including possible alternative schemes @xcite , discussion and resolution of experimental and theoretical limitations @xcite and the connection to nonlocality and inseparability @xcite . \n the relation of nonlocality and inseparability of mixed states has already been a challenging problem before the advent of quantum teleportation . \n werner @xcite introduced inseparable mixed states which do not violate bell s inequalities . \n several measures have been defined to quantify the amount of entanglement contained in mixed states @xcite , partly inspired by entanglement distillation protocols @xcite . whether it is possible to employ \n a bipartite mixed state for quantum teleportation has turned out to be an additional nontrivial question in this field @xcite . \n recently , bose and vedral @xcite have investigated the direct relation between the mixedness of a state and its usefulness for teleportation . \n they applied the von neumann entropy @xmath0 as a measure for mixedness , and find that there is a threshold for this quantity above which the bipartite state @xmath1 becomes useless for teleportation . \n in order to separate the quantum and classical aspects of communication , n. and b. gisin @xcite and independently steiner @xcite have presented a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model which , supplied by classical communication , is capable of reproducing quantum correlations of two spin 1/2 particles in singlet state . \n brassard et al . \n @xcite quantify the amount of classical communication required to be supplemented to simulate quantum correlations for given numbers of qubits . \n more recently , cerf et al . \n @xcite have presented a protocol in an lhv model for teleporting a quantum state via classical communication . on the other hand , m. . \n zukowski @xcite has investigated the connection of local realism and the nonclassical part quantum teleportation process , and concluded , that no local hidden variable model can reproduce the quantum prediction . \n the effect of mixedness of a bipartite state applied for teleportation is obviously an important aspect in understanding the classical  quantum limit . \n the classical limit of the original protocol of bennett has not yet been investigated . \n quantum teleportation , the basic primitive of quantum communication networks consists of the transmission of a quantum state via a combination of classical channels and quantum correlations . in lack of either the classical channel or the entangled resource , \n only noise is obtained . \n but what is the classical analogue of bennett s scheme ? to answer this question , we investigate a set of bipartite states interpolating between an ideal entangled state and a possible classical limit . \n this approach provides a transition from the quantum teleportation to its classical counterpart .    in this paper \n we examine , what happens to a teleportation scheme , when the density matrix elements of the entangled state used as a correlated pair , which are off - diagonal on product basis , are reduced . \n this approach , turning the entangled state into a classical correlation , obviously offers a possible way of obtaining a classical limit of the teleportation process . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : telep ] the class of bipartite states in argument is described , and bennett s protocol of quantum teleportation of a qubit is summarized in a consistent density matrix formalism . \n the latter can be regarded as a special case of the treatment of e. g. @xcite or @xcite . by replacing the ideal epr pair with the states investigated , \n we obtain our main result . starting from this , \n two examples are studied in detail : in section [ sec : class ] the purely classical limit is introduced , and in section [ sec : stat ] cases between the ideal quantum teleportation and the classical limit are analyzed by examining a gedankenexperiment . \n section [ sec : concl ] summarizes the results . \n we restrict ourselves to two - level systems , and use the terminology of spin-@xmath2 particles . \n the results can be applied to any representation of qubits , e. g. for the polarization of single photon states , for which quantum teleportation is experimentally feasible @xcite . \n the spin @xmath3-component eigenstates of the particles are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n density matrices of the bipartite systems , if not otherwise stated , are represented on the natural product state basis @xmath6 . \n we will also use the notation @xmath7 for the four bell - states .    let us examine bennett s scheme of quantum teleportation @xcite of a qubit : the sender , alice has particle 1 of @xmath2 spin in the state @xmath8 and wants to teleport it to bob . \n the upper indices of density matrices ( and other operators ) refer to the number assigned to the particles . \n they share particles 2 and 3 in a state @xmath9 as an entangled resource , and there is also a classical communication channel between them . \n alice has an ideal bell - state detector , and bob can carry out unitary transformations on particle 3 given to him . as a starting point of our investigation , let us suppose , that the state of particles 2 and 3 is described by the following density matrix : @xmath10 the lower indices in the kets indicate the number assigned to the particles . \n let @xmath11 be real parameter between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , \n thus in this case alice and bob share an epr pair . \n this is the case of ideal quantum teleportation . otherwise , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are multiplied by @xmath16 . for @xmath17 \n the density matrix is diagonal in the product state basis , describing classical statistics only . \n this state is the mixture of the product states @xmath18 . \n such a state can be generated by a _ classically stochastic _ source emitting particles with opposite spins , with equal probability of sending `` up '' and `` down '' state both for particles 2 and 3 . \n the states in equation ( [ eq : entangled ] ) may be rewritten in the bell - basis , we find @xmath19 that is , the state is a mixture of the two @xmath20 bell - states . \n the class of states examined here is a subclass of werner states ( which were examined from teleportation s point of view in references  @xcite ) where the two @xmath21 states do not occur . \n let us consider now the entire teleportation process . \n initially , the state of the whole system of the three particles is the product of the states in eqs . \n ( [ eq : instate ] ) and ( [ eq : entangled ] ) : @xmath22 alice carries out a bell - state measurement , which is described by one of the operators including projection of subsystems 1 and 2 to a bell - state , @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for one of the four bell - states , and @xmath25 is the identity operator for the hilbert - space of particle 3 . \n the result of the measurement is @xmath26 , corresponding to the @xmath26-th bell - state . \n this information is sent to bob via the classical channel . because the detection of each bell - state occurs with probability @xmath27 \n , the operator is multiplied by @xmath28 in order to preserve the norm of the state obtained . \n the state of the system after the measurement is given by applying the operator in equation  ( [ eq : bellmeas ] ) to the state in equation  ( [ eq : in123 ] ) . from this \n we obtain the state of bob s particle by tracing out in the other two particles : @xmath29 in the last step , bob has to apply a unitary transformation @xmath30 on state @xmath31 , according to alice s measurement result @xmath26 , which is the identity operator in case alice has detected @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for detecting @xmath34,@xmath35 , and @xmath36 respectively . carrying out the calculations described , we obtain our main result : the state teleported to bob reads @xmath37 it can be seen that _ the reduction of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix describing the entangled resource is inherited by the teleported state . \n _ thus teleportation acts as a phase - damping channel . \n as a first example , let us examine the case of `` teleporting '' a classical bit . \n assume , that @xmath17 , that is the density matrix describing the entangled resource is diagonal . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , only the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix of the input state , i.e. the statistics of the measurement of the spin-@xmath3 component is preserved . \n therefore , let us suppose , that the input state in equation  ( [ eq : instate ] ) is already diagonal : @xmath38 . in this section we consider measurement of the @xmath3 components of the spins .    under these circumstances our particles can be exactly identified with classical bits . \n the states of these classical bits , denoted by @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , are identical with the basis quantum states @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the diagonal density matrix of the input quantum state describes a classical probability distribution of bit 1 . \n this is transferred into bit 3 via a classical communication channel and a _ classical _ correlation . \n the process itself can be interpreted in the following way : the source of bits 2 and 3 broadcasts correlated bit - pairs @xmath41 or @xmath42 with equal probability . \n this can be regarded as the classical limit of an epr - pair . \n bit 2 is obtained by alice , who makes a measurement , which tells whether bit 1 and 2 are the same or different . \n one can not speak of superpositions in this classical context , and therefore the two @xmath20 and the two @xmath21 bell - states coincide in this limit : the former two mean simply `` the two bits are different '' ( @xmath20-detection ) , and the latter `` the two bits are the same '' ( @xmath21-detection ) . thus the bell - state measurement degenerates to an `` exclusive or '' operation , resulting in a single bit of information , communicated to bob . \n bob has to carry out the proper transformation to regain the `` teleported '' bit . \n there is no phase of the probability amplitudes for classical probability , thus the transformations in equation  ( [ eq : u ] ) degenerate to a conditional not operation : in case of `` @xmath20 detection '' , bob has obtained bit 3 in the proper state , while in case of `` @xmath21 detection '' he has to invert bit 3 . \n finally bit 3 is left with the original value of bit 1 . \n since the values of bits 1 or 2 are irrelevant from the `` bell - state measurement '' , it is not necessary for alice to be aware of the actual value of bit 1 to be `` teleported '' . \n therefore the method works for `` teleporting '' an unknown classical bit as well , similarly to the quantum protocol .    the classical protocol described here is well known as the one - time - pad in classical cryptography @xcite . \n this is , in some sense , the classical protocol most similar to quantum teleportation . \n it is the `` teleportation '' of the ( optionally unknown ) state of a classical bit via a classical communication channel and a classical correlation . \n the classical correlation provides noise in the lack of the classical communication channel , while the classical channel itself is useless for reconstruction of the result without the correlation . \n note that instead of measuring the state of bit 1 and simply communicating its value , only a comparison with a reference has been made . \n having described the classical analogue , we may now examine @xmath43 , which interpolates between the classical and the quantum case . \n we calculate the consequence of ( [ eq : result ] ) to the result of a teleportation experiment . for simplicity , \n let us suppose , that we want to teleport the state @xmath44 , having @xmath3-component of @xmath45 , rotated by a given angle @xmath46 around the @xmath47 axis of the coordinate system . \n the operator of this rotation ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49 @xmath50 being the first pauli - matrix , and thus we have the state @xmath51 to be teleported . according to ( [ eq : result ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 as result of the teleportation process . in order to verify the teleportation , one may measure the spin along an axis obtained by rotating the @xmath3 axis with the angle @xmath53 around the x axis . \n the probability of finding this component of the spin @xmath45 is in this case is @xmath54 for @xmath14 we obtain the familiar cosine - type result valid for ideal teleportation , @xmath55 which is equal to @xmath13 for @xmath56 , meaning perfect teleportation to any direction . for a given input state @xmath57 , the probability for finding the output in the input state after the teleportation is the fidelity of the teleportation of the input state . \n this fidelity is @xmath58.\\ ] ] in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] we have plotted this function . \n it is equal to 1 in the case of ideal teleportation . \n the basis states @xmath59 and @xmath60 are always properly teleported , as we have seen in the classical case . \n the minimum of the fidelity for any @xmath16 occurs for the equal superposition of the two basis states ( @xmath61 ) . \n the minimum value for @xmath17 is @xmath2 , expressing that the result of the measurement can be either @xmath62 or @xmath63 with equal probability , thus this state is not at all teleported . \n increasing the purity of the mixed state increases the domain of the angles in which teleportation can be regarded as reliable . \n we have studied the role of the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the entangled pair in the teleportation of a qubit . by setting these to zero , \n we have obtained the classical one - time pad cypher , as a classical limit of quantum teleportation . \n we have demonstrated the result on the behavior of statistics and fidelity of a gedankenexperiment . \n we have found , that the fidelity of the teleportation is most sensitive to the loss of the quantum entanglement in the epr pair for a state at a right angle to the quantization direction . \n this work was supported by the research fund of hungary ( otka ) under contracts nos . \n t023777 , t034484 and f032346 . t. k. acknowledges the support of the hungarian academy of sciences ( bolyai jnos kutatsi sztnd ' ij ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 4275948852414, "RequestID": "66ba8268a32da5790685570203fe744d33c6d99c", "TotalTokens": 3340}

broken artificial atoms @xcite in a superconducting flux qubit circuit were investigated . by biasing the external magnetic flux @xmath0 away from @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath3 is the planck constant and @xmath4 the electronic charge ) \n , the symmetries of both the potential and the interaction hamiltonian can be broken . in this case , when only the lowest three levels are considered , the flux qubit circuit is a cyclic - type ( or @xmath5-type ) system , which is different from the usual @xmath6-type ( or ladder - type ) system in which the optical dipole - selection rule does not allow a transition between the lowest and the uppermost of the three levels . by investigating \n the generalized stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap @xcite ) , one can achieve a pulse -

symmetric double - well potential @xcite : left - handed states are in the left well and right - handed ones in the right . strictly speaking , left-/right- handed states in the left / right wells are not the eigenstates of double - well potential due to the tunnelling between the left and right wells . but the tunnelling rates are usually very small , so left-/right handed states can be considered as stable eigenstates of chiral -

spin dependent optically - induced gauge potentials for cold atoms to achieve a spatial separation of pseudo - spin states @xcite . based on this scheme , we recently considered consequences of the induced gauge potential in systems of cold chiral molecules that manifest themselves as a generalized stern - gerlach effect @xcite , where the orbital motion of mixed chiral molecules will be chirality - dependent and pseudo - spin - dependent . \n thus , it can be used to distinguish molecules with different chiralities , suggesting a discrimination method to separate chiral mixtures .    in this paper \n , we will use a dynamical ( rotation ) method to transfer the states of cyclic three -

handed chiral molecules . \n if left- and right - handed three - level cyclic molecules are driven by three optical fields , one or all of the three rabi frequencies @xmath25 for the two kinds of chiral molecules differ by a sign @xcite . \n we will specify our model by choosing the coupling strengths ( that is , rabi frequencies ) of the left-/right- handed molecules as @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28,@xmath29 ( see fig . \n [ a1 ] ) . here , the superscripts @xmath30 [ @xmath31 refer to left - handed [ right - handed ] molecules . \n we now consider an ensemble of left- and right - handed molecules prepared in their ground states @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively . \n we aim to distinguish the two kinds of molecules by transferring them to different -

handed molecules , @xmath38 for the right - handed ones , the rabi frequency is @xmath39 , which leads to a @xmath40 rotation @xmath41 with the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath42    _ step ii _ : now we keep @xmath43 and add two pump pulses of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which satisfy @xmath46 hence , the hamiltonian ( [ hamil -

handed molecule , the corresponding time - evolution of the state is given as @xmath52 where @xmath53 . if @xmath54 is chosen to cause a rotation by @xmath7 corresponding to the transition @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 , the evolved state is @xmath57    the same treatment applies to the right - handed molecules by replacing `` l '' by `` r '' in eqs . \n ( [ hamil - d2]-[eigen - state ] ) . \n since the state @xmath58 @xmath59 is always the dark state for the hamiltonian @xmath60 , it is invariant during the @xmath7 rotation in this step . \n thus , we obtain the following state after step ii : @xmath61 for the right - handed molecules . \n _ step iii _ : \n now we keep @xmath62 and apply the pump pulse @xmath35 leading to a @xmath63 rotation for the left - handed molecules ( the corresponding rabi frequency is @xmath64 with a @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) rotation for the right - handed ones ) . \n the left - handed molecular state @xmath67 remains unchanged : @xmath68 on the other hand , the @xmath65 rotation pulse acting on the right - handed molecules will transfer the state @xmath69 to the final state @xmath70 here , the corresponding hamiltonians for the chiral molecules are again given by eqs . \n ( [ hamil -

handed molecules and @xmath77 for the right - handed ones . \n the fact that differently - handed chiral molecules are transferred to different long - lived states means perfect discrimination of both kinds of chiral molecules in our idealized treatment . \n figure [ a3 ] shows an illustration of this separation procedure . \n initially , all the molecules are assumed to be in the ground state @xmath78 as shown in fig . \n [ a3](a ) . by using simple optical pulses , i.e. , switching on / off the optical fields as shown in fig . \n [ a2 ] , the two kinds of chiral molecules are dynamically transferred from the initial state @xmath78 to the final state @xmath67 and @xmath79 , respectively ( see fig .  [ \n a3](b ) ) . these different states may be separated ( see fig . \n [ a3](c ) ) using a variety of energy - dependent processes , such as ionization , followed by extraction of the ions by an electric field as suggested in ref . \n @xcite .     before the coupling to the optical fields ( here \n the optical fields can be coplanar or not ) . \n the labels of spin - up [ down ] refer to the left- [ right- ] handed molecules . \n ( b ) after driving the optical pulses in the protocol as shown in fig . \n [ a2 ] , the chiral molecules are dynamically transferred to the final state @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . \n the dark [ bright ] spheres indicate the states @xmath82 [ @xmath83 . \n ( c ) the different - handed chiral molecules may now be separated , e.g. , by ionization or choosing different trapping potentials for different energy levels.,width=283,height=151 ]    the scheme proposed here is different from the generalized stern - gerlach effect @xcite in the following respects : ( i ) there is no need to invoke the spatial motion of the molecules in the scheme presented here ; it is enough to consider their internal dynamics . \n ( ii ) the internal degree of freedom of a three - level system is reduced to the lower two ( pseudo - spin ) states in @xcite by assuming a large detuning . here \n , we discuss the molecular dynamics in the space of three levels with all the optical coupling resonant to the corresponding transition . \n ( iii ) different chiral molecules can be separated spatially ; here , we only focus on how to distinguish different chiral molecules according to the different final states as in ref .  @xcite . \n the present protocol is also different from the methods described in refs . \n @xcite , where molecules with different chirality are distinguished by adiabatical processes via controlling three overlapping optical fields . \n the dynamical rotation method proposed here provides another possibility to distinguish mixed chiral molecules by using several simple optical ultrashort pulses . \n in contrast to the scheme described in ref . \n @xcite , we assume the molecules to be pre - oriented ( similar to refs . \n @xcite ) in order to ensure that the rabi frequencies are identical for all the molecules in the mixture ( up to a phase factor ) when coupling to a same optical field .    in the present separation scheme as well as similar ones @xcite , the molecular temperature \n is assumed to be low enough such that the molecules are prepared in the ground state initially . \n we neglect finite - temperature effects and molecular interactions .    in the protocol described above , all three kinds of optical fields couple resonantly to the molecular transitions . \n that means the optical fields satisfy the energy conservation condition @xmath84 . \n this resembles sum - frequency generation in nonlinear media @xcite , which requires energy conservation as well as momentum conservation ( along a certain direction ) . \n sum - frequency generation is one of the techniques used to probe ( but not separate ) molecular chirality @xcite . \n the separation protocol described in our paper is not related to sum - frequency generation and is not constrained by the momentum conservation of optical wave - vectors ( that is why the three optical fields can be coplanar or not ) . \n recently , many studies about preparing , measuring and teleporting superpositions of chiral states @xcite have appeared in the literature . in these works , \n superposition states are obtained by involving a symmetric or antisymmetric higher excited state which can couple to the left - handed or right - handed states by optical fields . in this paper \n , we aim to separate mixtures of left - handed and right - handed chiral molecules . \n so the external excited state is not introduced , and superpositions of chiral states are not considered here . \n decoherence processes are the biggest obstacle for any quantum state transfer operation . due to \n the fact that our protocol only uses dynamic ultrashort - pulse operations and does not require adiabaticity assumptions , our method will work faster and make decoherence effects less important . \n in conclusion , we have presented a protocol to separate left- and right - handed molecules . \n this protocol , which consists of several simple dynamical rotation operations of optical pulses , can be implemented on a short time scale compared with the decoherence time due to spontaneous emission . \n we would like to remark that all three kinds of optical couplings have to be used ( though not at the same time ) during the rotation operations in this separation protocol . \n physically , this is because the two kinds of chiral molecules can be distinguished only by the total phase of the three rabi frequencies ( which differ by @xmath7 ) . \n if only two kinds of optical couplings are used , the molecular system will reduce to the @xmath85- , @xmath86- or ladder - type three - level system , which can not be used to distinguish different chiralities . \n stirap is a well - studied pump - probe control scheme for manipulating the population of quantum states of atoms or molecules , see , e.g. , k. bergmann , h. theuer , and b.  w. shore , rev . \n * 70 * , 1003 ( 1998 ) . \n p. krl , i. thanopulos , and m. shapiro , phys . \n a * 72 * , 020303(r ) ( 2005 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 2984, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "generative adversarial nets were recently introduced as an alternative framework for training generative models in order to sidestep the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations . \n adversarial nets have the advantages that markov chains are never needed , only backpropagation is used to obtain gradients , no inference is required during learning , and a wide variety of factors and interactions can easily be incorporated into the model . \n furthermore , as demonstrated in @xcite , it can produce state of the art log - likelihood estimates and realistic samples .    in an unconditioned generative model \n , there is no control on modes of the data being generated . \n however , by conditioning the model on additional information it is possible to direct the data generation process . \n such conditioning could be based on class labels , on some part of data for inpainting like @xcite , or even on data from different modality .    in this work \n we show how can we construct the conditional adversarial net . and \n for empirical results we demonstrate two set of experiment . \n one on mnist digit data set conditioned on class labels and one on mir flickr 25,000 dataset @xcite for multi - modal learning . \n despite the many recent successes of supervised neural networks ( and convolutional networks in particular ) @xcite , it remains challenging to scale such models to accommodate an extremely large number of predicted output categories . \n a second issue is that much of the work to date has focused on learning one - to - one mappings from input to output . \n however , many interesting problems are more naturally thought of as a probabilistic one - to - many mapping . \n for instance in the case of image labeling there may be many different tags that could appropriately applied to a given image , and different ( human ) annotators may use different ( but typically synonymous or related ) terms to describe the same image .    one way to help address the first issue is to leverage additional information from other modalities : for instance , by using natural language corpora to learn a vector representation for labels in which geometric relations are semantically meaningful . \n when making predictions in such spaces , we benefit from the fact that when prediction errors we are still often ` close ' to the truth ( e.g. predicting table instead of chair ) , and also from the fact that we can naturally make predictive generalizations to labels that were not seen during training time . works such as @xcite \n have shown that even a simple linear mapping from image feature - space to word - representation - space can yield improved classification performance .    one way to address \n the second problem is to use a conditional probabilistic generative model , the input is taken to be the conditioning variable and the one - to - many mapping is instantiated as a conditional predictive distribution . \n @xcite take a similar approach to this problem , and train a multi - modal deep boltzmann machine on the mir flickr 25,000 dataset as we do in this work . \n additionally , in @xcite the authors show how to train a supervised multi - modal neural language model , and they are able to generate descriptive sentence for images . \n generative adversarial nets were recently introduced as a novel way to train a generative model . \n they consists of two ` adversarial ' models : a generative model @xmath1 that captures the data distribution , and a discriminative model @xmath2 that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than @xmath1 . \n both @xmath1 and @xmath2 could be a non - linear mapping function , such as a multi - layer perceptron .    to learn a generator distribution @xmath3 over data data @xmath4 , \n the generator builds a mapping function from a prior noise distribution @xmath5 to data space as @xmath6 . \n and the discriminator , @xmath7 , outputs a single scalar representing the probability that @xmath4 came form training data rather than @xmath3 . \n @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both trained simultaneously : we adjust parameters for @xmath1 to minimize @xmath8 and adjust parameters for @xmath9 to minimize @xmath10 , as if they are following the two -

player minimax game would be as eq [ eq : minimaxgame - definition - conditioned ] @xmath15 + \\mathbb{e}_{\\bm{z } \\sim p_z(\\bm{z})}[\\log ( 1 - d(g(\\bm{z } | \\bm{y})))].\\ ] ]    fig [ fig : diagram ] illustrates the structure of a simple conditional adversarial net . \n we trained a conditional adversarial net on mnist images conditioned on their class labels , encoded as one - hot vectors .    in the generator net , \n a noise prior @xmath16 with dimensionality 100 was drawn from a uniform distribution within the unit hypercube . \n both @xmath16 and @xmath13 are mapped to hidden layers with rectified linear unit ( relu ) activation @xcite , with layer sizes 200 and 1000 respectively , before both being mapped to second , combined hidden relu layer of dimensionality 1200 . \n we then have a final sigmoid unit layer as our output for generating the 784-dimensional mnist samples . \n the discriminator maps @xmath4 to a maxout @xcite layer with 240 units and 5 pieces , and @xmath13 to a maxout layer with 50 units and 5 pieces . both of the hidden layers mapped to a joint maxout layer with 240 units and 4 pieces before being fed to the sigmoid layer . \n ( the precise architecture of the discriminator is not critical as long as it has sufficient power ; we have found that maxout units are typically well suited to the task . ) \n the model was trained using stochastic gradient decent with mini -

likelihood of the test set using the parzen window distribution . \n ( see @xcite for more details of how this estimate is constructed . ) \n the conditional adversarial net results that we present are comparable with some other network based , but are outperformed by several other approaches  including non - conditional adversarial nets . \n we present these results more as a proof - of - concept than as demonstration of efficacy , and believe that with further exploration of hyper - parameter space and architecture that the conditional model should match or exceed the non - conditional results . \n fig [ fig : mnist ] shows some of the generated samples . \n each row is conditioned on one label and each column is a different generated sample .    . \n parzen window - based log - likelihood estimates for mnist . \n we followed the same procedure as @xcite for computing these values .

tags . \n user - generated metadata differ from more ` canonical ' image labelling schems in that they are typically more descriptive , and are semantically much closer to how humans describe images with natural language rather than just identifying the objects present in an image . \n another aspect of ugm is that synoymy is prevalent and different users may use different vocabulary to describe the same concepts  consequently , having an efficient way to normalize these labels becomes important . \n conceptual word embeddings @xcite can be very useful here since related concepts end up being represented by similar vectors .    in this section \n we demonstrate automated tagging of images , with multi - label predictions , using conditional adversarial nets to generate a ( possibly multi - modal ) distribution of tag - vectors conditional on image features .    for image features we pre - train a convolutional model similar to the one from @xcite on the full imagenet dataset with 21,000 labels @xcite . \n we use the output of the last fully connected layer with 4096 units as image representations .    for the world representation \n we first gather a corpus of text from concatenation of user - tags , titles and descriptions from yfcc100 m dataset metadata . \n after pre - processing and cleaning of the text we trained a skip - gram model @xcite with word vector size of 200 . \n and we omitted any word appearing less than 200 times from the vocabulary , thereby ending up with a dictionary of size 247465 . \n we keep the convolutional model and the language model fixed during training of the adversarial net . and leave the experiments when we even backpropagate through these models as future work .    for our experiments we use mir flickr 25,000 dataset @xcite , and extract the image and tags features using the convolutional model and language model we described above . \n images without any tag were omitted from our experiments and annotations were treated as extra tags . \n the first 150,000 examples were used as training set . \n images with multiple tags were repeated inside the training set once for each associated tag .    for evaluation , we generate 100 samples for each image and find top 20 closest words using cosine similarity of vector representation of the words in the vocabulary to each sample . \n then we select the top 10 most common words among all 100 samples . \n table [ table : samples ] shows some samples of the user assigned tags and annotations along with the generated tags . \n the best working model s generator receives gaussian noise of size 100 as noise prior and maps it to 500 dimension relu layer . \n and maps 4096 dimension image feature vector to 2000 dimension relu hidden layer . \n both of these layers are mapped to a joint representation of 200 dimension linear layer which would output the generated word vectors . \n the discriminator is consisted of 500 and 1200 dimension relu hidden layers for word vectors and image features respectively and maxout layer with 1000 units and 3 pieces as the join layer which is finally fed to the one single sigmoid unit . \n the model was trained using stochastic gradient decent with mini -

{"ContextTokens": 3549, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "a fundamental challenge in nuclear physics is trying to understand the structure of hadrons in terms of their quark - gluon constituents , which are governed by the underlying theory of strong interaction called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n measurements of exclusive processes such as pion electroproduction make it possible to extract meson form factors and study the quark - gluon distributions in the nucleon . \n however , in order to develop a description of the atomic nucleus based on qcd , one also needs to understand how the properties and interactions of hadrons change in the nuclear medium . \n measurements of exclusive processes in the nuclear medium sometimes help one to understand the interactions because qcd has definite predictions for exclusive processes in the medium . \n one such prediction is the phenomenon of color transparency ( ct ) .    in the study of ct \n , we can observe the interplay between the creation of quark systems with small transverse size , as we would expect from qcd , and the possible suppression of interactions of such point - like configurations ( plc ) with the nuclear medium . \n a further complication is introduced by the formation time of the final hadron , which limits the lifetime of the plc . to understand this phenomenon , it is thus important to study the dependencies on the four - momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon , @xmath7 ( size of the initial plc , typically scales as @xmath11 ) , hadron momentum ( formation length ) , and target mass @xmath12 ( path length through the medium ) .    due to the higher probability to form a plc , a two - quark rather than a three - quark system \n is preferable , making pion electroproduction a natural choice for an initial study . \n however , pion electroproduction introduces the assumption of a quasi - free interaction of the photon with a virtual pion in the medium . \n the plausibility of this assumption can be addressed by comparing the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections from a nucleus with those obtained using a nucleon target , as differences in the behavior of this ratio would indicate effects of the nuclear medium resulting in the breakdown of the quasi - free assumption . \n nuclear transparency is a natural observable in the quest to identify the onset of color transparency . \n nuclear transparency is defined as the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a process on a bound nucleon inside a nucleus to that from a free nucleon . \n since the nuclear medium is not opaque to hadrons , color transparency will lead to an increase in nuclear transparency as a function of momentum transfer , hadron momentum and target mass . \n this simultaneous increase of nuclear transparency is distinct from those from other conventional processes such as rescattering . \n moreover , it illustrates the need for careful experiment design that simultaneously measures the @xmath7 and @xmath12 dependence of nuclear transparency and at the same time tests alternative reaction mechanisms that can produce potential increases in nuclear transparency .    with the availability of high - intensity , \n continuous electron beams up to 6 gev at jefferson lab it became possible for the first time to determine simultaneously the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependences of the differential pion cross sections for @xmath7 in the 1 - 5 gev@xmath2 range . \n these data were acquired in 2004 for @xmath1h , @xmath2h , @xmath3c , @xmath4al , @xmath5cu and @xmath6au targets . \n the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependence of the extracted transparency were published in  @xcite . \n the purpose of this work is to describe the experiment and analysis and to present and discuss additional results . \n the article is organized as follows : the next sections describe methods for extracting nuclear transparencies and discuss some earlier data . \n section  [ sec : formalism ] introduces the basic cross section formalism of pion electroproduction . in section  [ sec : experiment ] the experiment is described including the experimental setup . \n the data analysis is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] . \n the determination of the cross sections and the extraction of the nuclear transparencies and their associated uncertainties are described in section  [ sec : dettransp ] and section  [ sec : sys ] . \n the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . \n the global features of the cross section ratio and the nuclear transparencies are discussed and a comparison is made with results of recent calculations . \n in a simple picture of pion electroproduction from the nucleus , the electron exchanges a virtual photon with a proton which is moving due to its fermi momentum . \n the struck proton turns into a neutron ejecting a positively charged pion ( quasi - free approximation ) . in the quasi - free picture , \n the ejected pion may interact with the residual nucleons and the fraction of pions which can escape from the nucleus is the nuclear transparency of pions . in reality , the scattering process is more complicated and the deviations from this picture reveal much about the nucleus and their constituents . in the simple quasi - free picture , \n the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross section from a bound proton inside the nucleus is expected to be the same as that from a free proton . \n assuming the dominance of the quasi - free process , one can extract the nuclear transparency of the pions by taking the ratio of the acceptance corrected cross sections from the nuclear target to those from the proton . \n nuclear transparency quantifies the interactions of the outgoing pion with the residual nucleons on its way out of the nuclei , and is thus the key observable in searching for ct effects . \n color transparency was first proposed by brodsky and mueller  @xcite in 1982 , and refers to the vanishing of the hadron - nucleon interaction for hadrons produced in exclusive processes . at sufficiently high momentum transfers , where the hadron is produced with small transverse size , @xmath13  @xcite \n , the fast - moving hadron also has a compact longitudinal size due to lorentz contraction . \n such a reduced size quark - gluon state is called a point - like configuration ( plc ) . \n the formation length , the distance over which the plc travels before the hadron reaches its final size can be written , @xmath14    assuming a linear expansion in time , where @xmath15 is the speed of the hadron in the lab frame and @xmath16 is the life time of the plc in its rest frame . \n qcd predicts that the cross section for the interaction of a small @xmath17 dipole is proportional to @xmath18 in the leading order approximation , where @xmath19 is the transverse separation between the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 . \n if the @xmath17 dipole remains small ( pointlike ) over the range of the nuclear system , the nucleus will be transparent to the produced hadron . \n this can be accomplished at large momentum transfers where the formation length is sufficiently large .    at finite energies , however , the mechanism for the expansion and contraction of the interacting small system is more complex . \n the quantum diffusion model  @xcite assumes that quarks separate in the transverse direction at the speed of light and that their quark separation is proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the longitudinal distance from the production point to the position of the particle . \n the formation length in this model is determined from the average value of the dominant energy denominator . @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momentum and mass of the hadron , respectively , while @xmath27 is the mass of a typical intermediate state of the hadron . \n the precise value for @xmath28 is a matter of great uncertainty  @xcite with estimates between 0.25 and 1.4 gev@xmath2 . \n the onset of color transparency is expected at lower energies for production of mesons , for instance of pions , than for production of baryons , because the quark - antiquark pair is more likely to form a small size object  @xcite .    in pion electroproduction , \n the coherence length , defined as the distance over which the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath17 pair , is smaller than the nucleon radius at jlab energies , and for the present experiment it is essentially constant . \n this removes any coherence length dependence through t - channel @xmath29 exchange , in which the incident electron scatters from a virtual photon bringing it on - shell . such a coherence length dependence can mimic a ct - like energy dependence . \n color transparency has recently been put into the context of a qcd factorization theorem for longitudinally polarized photons in meson electroproduction . \n it predicts that for sufficiently high values of @xmath7 , at fixed @xmath30 and fixed momentum transfer to the nucleon , @xmath31 , the amplitude can be expressed in terms of a short - distance ( hard ) process , a distribution amplitude describing the final state meson , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite . \n the latter describe the long - distance ( soft ) physics . \n the factorization theorem has been proven at asymptotically high @xmath7 , but showing its validity at finite , high @xmath7 requires stringent tests of all necessary conditions . \n the unambiguous observation of the onset of ct is a critical precondition for the validity of the factorization theorem . \n this is because where ct applies the outgoing meson retains a small transverse size ( inter - quark distance ) while soft interactions like multiple gluon exchange between the meson produced from the hard interaction and the baryon are highly suppressed . \n factorization is thus rigorously not possible without ct . \n the first experiments designed to search for color transparency used the @xmath32 reaction and were performed at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the elastic @xmath33 cross section in the nucleus and hydrogen . \n this ratio initially increased as a function of the beam energy and then decreased , with a peak near 9 gev . though this behavior was not predicted by traditional nuclear physics calculations , it is currently not attributed to ct . \n instead it is associated with nuclear filtering  @xcite , which is related to the suppression of the long range components in the wave function , or to the threshold for charm resonance production  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was also measured using the a(@xmath34 ) reaction at stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )  @xcite and at jefferson lab  @xcite . in this case \n , the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the experimental yield and the one obtained from plane wave impulse approximation . \n the ratio was found to be energy independent from @xmath7 @xmath35 2 gev@xmath2 to 8.1 gev@xmath2 for deuterium , carbon , iron , and gold targets , thus indicating no significant ct effect . \n the absence of the ct effect in this channel has been interpreted as an indication that the proton formation length may only have been as large as internucleonic distances , rather than the size of the nucleus in these experiments  @xcite . \n ct measurements using coherent and incoherent @xmath36 production have been performed at fermilab  @xcite and more recently at desy  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was defined as @xmath37 . \n the results from fermilab were parametrized with a function @xmath38 , and at a first glance , the observed positive slope of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath7 appeared to contradict the flat @xmath7 dependence predicted by the glauber multiple scattering mechanism . \n however , the results have since been interpreted as a coherence length effect  @xcite , in which for kinematics with large coherence length , the virtual @xmath17 pair may undergo interactions with the nucleus before the hard interaction that puts it on - shell . \n the kinematics of the fermilab experiment were not at a constant @xmath40 , and thus the variation of @xmath39 with @xmath7 was attributed to a reduction in the initial state interactions rather than to a reduction in final state interactions . \n the more recent measurements from desy , ranging between @xmath7=0.9 - 3 gev@xmath2 and at constant @xmath40 , showed a rise in nuclear transparency with @xmath7 consistent with theoretical calculations of ct  @xcite . \n the most convincing evidence for the existence of color transparency comes from an experiment performed at fermilab  @xcite . \n there , the cross section of diffractive dissociation of 500 gev/@xmath41 pions into dijets was measured and parametrized with @xmath42=@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 cross section in free space . \n the free parameter , @xmath39 , was fit to the data with the result @xmath461.6 . \n this result was in agreement with calculations assuming 100% color transparency and was very different from the normal @xmath45 cross section , which has a dependence @xmath42=@xmath47 .    at low energies , hints of ct effects \n have also been observed from pion photoproduction from helium , @xmath48 , at jefferson lab  @xcite . \n ct can be measured in these reactions where @xmath7=0 by measuring the cross section vs. the four momentum transfer squared , @xmath49 to the hadron system . \n the data showed 2@xmath42 deviations from the traditional glauber calculations and the slope of the data vs. @xmath31 was in better agreement with calculations including ct . \n the kinematics of the pion electroproduction reaction studied here are shown in figure  [ fig : eepi_kinematics ] . \n the incident electron has a three momentum of @xmath50 . \n the scattered electron has a three momentum @xmath51 and travels at a polar angle @xmath52 in the laboratory frame with respect to the direction of the incident beam . \n the three momentum vectors of the incoming and outgoing electron define the scattering plane . \n the corresponding four -

fortea et al . \n @xcite proposed the maximum pentagon separation rule where they argue that the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations among the 12 pentagons . \n these observations lead us to investigate the maximum separation between pentagons that can be achieved for a given number of atoms , or conversely how many atoms are needed to achieve a given separation . \n we will refer to the least face - distance between pentagons of a fullerene as the _ pentagon separation _ of the fullerene . \n in the next section we determine the smallest fullerenes with a given pentagon separation . \n we also show that the minimum fullerenes for each @xmath1 are unique up to mirror image and that for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . \n the latter was already proven for @xmath7 ( i.e. , for all fullerenes ) by grnbaum and motzkin in  @xcite and for @xmath8 ( i.e. , for ipr fullerenes ) by klein and liu in  @xcite . \n finally , we also determine the number of fullerenes of pentagon separation  @xmath1 , for @xmath3 , up to 400 vertices . \n in this section we determine the smallest fullerenes with a given pentagon separation . \n we remind the reader of the icosahedral fullerenes  @xcite . \n these fullerenes are uniquely determined by their coxeter coordinates @xmath9 and are obtained by cutting an equilateral goldberg triangle with coordinates @xmath9 from the hexagon lattice and gluing it to the faces of the icosahedron . as a goldberg triangle with coordinates @xmath9 has @xmath10 vertices , an icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 has @xmath11 vertices . also note that an icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 has pentagon separation  @xmath12 . \n [ theorem : min_face_distance_nv ] for odd @xmath15 , the smallest fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 are the icosahedral fullerenes with coxeter coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n these are mirror images and have @xmath18 vertices . for even @xmath1 , the unique smallest fullerene with pentagon separation \n at least @xmath1 is the the icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath19 , which has @xmath20 vertices . \n * proof in the case that @xmath15 is odd : * + the _ penta - hexagonal net _ is the regular tiling of the plane where a central pentagon is surrounded by an infinite number of hexagons . \n the number of faces at face - distance @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath22 . \n so the number of faces at face - distance at most @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta - hexagonal net is @xmath23 . \n figure  [ fig : d=7patch ] shows this situation for @xmath24 .      in a fullerene with pentagon separation at least  @xmath1 , for odd  @xmath1 \n , the sets of faces at face - distance at most @xmath25 from each pentagon are pairwise disjoint . \n consequently the smallest such fullerenes we can hope to find consist of 12 copies of the above patch for @xmath26 , which comes to @xmath18 vertices . \n since the patch boundary has no more than two consecutive vertices of degree  2 , it is impossible to join any number of them into a larger patch with a boundary having more than two consecutive vertices of degree  2 . \n therefore , considering the complement , no union of these patches which is completable to a fullerene has more than two consecutive vertices of degree  3 . \n now , every way to overlap the boundaries of two patches produces three consecutive vertices of degree  3 , such as indicated in the left side of figure  [ fig : d=7patchjoin ] , except for the way shown in the right side of figure  [ fig : d=7patchjoin ] or its mirror image . for each of these two starting points , there is only one way to attach a third patch to those two patches , and so on , leading to a unique completion in each case . \n it is easy to see that these two fullerenes are the icosahedral fullerenes mentioned in the theorem . \n * proof in the case that @xmath1 is even : * + the proof in this case is similar except that we use a different type of patch . in \n @xcite it was proven that the number of vertices at distance @xmath21 from the pentagon in the penta -

hexagonal net for even @xmath21 is @xmath31 .    in a fullerene with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 , for even @xmath1 , \n the sets of vertices at distance at most @xmath32 from every pentagon are pairwise disjoint . \n the case of @xmath33 is shown in figure  [ fig : d=6patch ] , excluding the ends of the dangling edges . \n therefore , the smallest such fullerene of pentagon separation @xmath1 we can hope to construct consists of 12 of these patches for @xmath34 , joined together by identifying dangling edges . \n this would give us @xmath20 vertices altogether . \n since we are only permitted to create hexagons incident with the dangling edges , dangling edges distance two apart in one patch can only be identified with dangling edges distance two apart in another patch . \n otherwise , a face of the wrong size is created , such as the pentagon indicated in the left side of figure  [ fig : d=6patchjoin ] . \n this allows us to join two adjacent patches in only one way , as shown by the right side of figure  [ fig : d=6patchjoin ] . \n extra patches can then be attached in unique fashion , leading to a single fullerene that is easily seen to be the icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath19 . \n next we will prove that for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . to prove this , we need lemmas  [ lemma : boundarylength_plus1 ] and  [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] .    a _ \n fullerene patch _ is a connected subgraph of a fullerene where all faces except one exterior face are also faces in the fullerene and all boundary vertices have degree 2 or 3 and all non - boundary vertices have degree 3 . \n the _ boundary sequence _ of a patch is the cyclic sequence of the degrees of the vertices in the boundary of a patch in clockwise or counterclockwise order . \n a _ cap _ is a fullerene patch which contains 6 pentagons and has a boundary sequence of the form @xmath35 . \n such a boundary is represented by the parameters @xmath36 . in the literature , the vector @xmath36 \n is also called the _ chiral vector _ ( see  @xcite ) .        in figure \n [ fig : change_cap_bound ] we show how the @xmath37 cap which contains a boundary pentagon ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step1 ] ) can be transformed into a cap with parameters @xmath38 without decreasing the minimum face - distance between the pentagons . \n this is done by changing the boundary pentagon into a hexagon @xmath39 , adding a ring of hexagons ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step2 ] ) and changing a hexagon in the boundary which is adjacent to @xmath39 into a pentagon ( see figure  [ fig : change_cap_bound_step3 ] ) . \n [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] given a cap @xmath40 with parameters @xmath36 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and which consists of @xmath43 faces . a cap @xmath44 with the same parameters @xmath36 which contains @xmath40 as a subgraph and has @xmath45 , respectively @xmath46 faces can be constructed from @xmath40 by adding @xmath47 or @xmath48 hexagons to c , respectively .    given a cap @xmath40 with parameters @xmath36 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in figure \n [ fig : add_hexagons_same_cap_step ] we show how a cap @xmath44 with the same parameters @xmath36 which contains @xmath40 as a subgraph and has @xmath45 faces can be constructed from @xmath40 by adding @xmath47 hexagons to c.        [ theorem : min_face_distance_existence ] for each @xmath1 there is an @xmath2 such that fullerenes with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than or equal to @xmath2 exist . \n brinkmann and schein  @xcite have proven that every icosahedral fullerene with coxeter coordinates @xmath9 contains a fullerene patch with 6 pentagons which is a subgraph of a cap with parameters @xmath53 . \n so @xmath50 contains a fullerene patch with 6 pentagons which is a subgraph of a cap with parameters @xmath54 . \n it follows from  @xcite that such a fullerene patch can be completed to a cap with parameters @xmath54 by adding hexagons . \n it follows from lemma  [ lemma : boundarylength_plus1 ] that this cap can then be transformed to a cap with parameters @xmath55 without decreasing the minimum face - distance between the pentagons of the cap . \n we form a fullerene @xmath56 with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 by gluing together two copies of the @xmath55 cap and adding @xmath55 rings of hexagons if necessary . \n let @xmath57 denote the number of hexagons of @xmath56 . \n now a fullerene with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 and any number of hexagons greater than @xmath57 can be obtained by recursively applying lemma  [ lemma : add_hexagons_same_boundary ] to @xmath56 . \n the counts of the number of fullerenes up to 400 vertices with pentagon separation at least @xmath1 , for @xmath3 , can be found in tables  [ table : fuller_counts_1]-[table : fuller_counts_4 ] . \n ( note that @xmath13 gives the set of all fullerenes and @xmath58 gives the set of all ipr fullerenes ) . \n these counts were obtained by using the program _ buckygen _ \n @xcite ( which can be downloaded from http://caagt.ugent.be/buckygen/ ) to generate all non - isomorphic ipr fullerenes and then applying a separate program to compute their pentagon separation . \n note that fullerenes which are mirror images of each other are considered to be in the same isomorphism class and are thus only counted once . \n some of the fullerenes from tables  [ table : fuller_counts_1]-[table : fuller_counts_4 ] can also be downloaded from the _ house of graphs _ \n @xcite at http://hog.grinvin.org/fullerenes  . \n figures [ fig : smallest_d=3]-[fig : smallest_d=5 ] show the smallest fullerenes with pentagon separation @xmath1 , for @xmath59 .          _ \n acknowledgements : _ jan goedgebeur is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship of the research foundation flanders ( fwo ) . \n brendan mckay is supported by the australian research council . \n most computations for this work were carried out using the stevin supercomputer infrastructure at ghent university . \n we also would like to thank gunnar brinkmann , patrick fowler and jack graver for useful suggestions .", "StartTimeOffset": 4318859047602, "RequestID": "fc99ccff5ae368bc6c01abee0f6705657729d7f6", "TotalTokens": 3234}
{"ContextTokens": 2602, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka )  @xcite is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment . in t2k \n , an intense muon neutrino beam is produced with a proton synchrotron in j - parc facility and sent to the massive super - kamiokande detector 295  km away . \n the main goals of t2k are a sensitive search for the @xmath0 appearance from @xmath1 , which is related to the yet - unmeasured neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 , and precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to achieve the aimed precision , good understanding of the neutrino beam properties and neutrino - nucleus interaction \n are indispensable . \n the near detector ( nd280 ) complex is placed at about 280  m from the proton target to provide this information . \n the t2k - nd280  @xcite consists of several sub - detectors with specific and complimentary functions . \n as the basic elements for the particle detection , most of detectors use the plastic scintillator read out via wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers . \n this is a widely used technique , especially in recent accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite . in those experiments , multi - anode pmts ( mapmts ) \n have been used as the photosensor . for t2k , \n mapmt is not suitable because some of the detectors have to operate under a magnetic field of 0.2  t provided by a dipole magnet originally built for ua1 experiment at cern , and also because the available space is very limited . \n we selected the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) as the photosensor for nd280 and started the development in cooperation with hamamatsu photonics and kek detector technology project  @xcite . \n for nd280 , 64,000 mppcs are used in total . \n after three years of study , we developed an mppc that satisfied our requirements and started the mass production in february 2008 . because it was the first time that the mppcs are used on such a large scale , it was necessary to develop a method to characterize each device for quality assurance purpose . in order to characterize a large number of mppcs \n , we have developed a system that simultaneously measures 64 mppcs at kyoto university . using this test system , \n we have measured 17,686 mppcs used for two sub - detectors of nd280 , called ingrid  @xcite and fgd  @xcite .    in this paper , \n the design of the test system , testing procedure and summary of measured performances of t2k - mppc are presented . \n the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is a new photodetector manufactured by hamamatsu photonics , japan  @xcite . \n an mppc consists of many ( 100 to @xmath51000 ) small avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) , each with an area of either 25@xmath625 , 50@xmath650 or 100@xmath6100  @xmath7m@xmath8 , in an area of 19  mm@xmath8 . \n each apd micropixel independently works in limited geiger mode with an applied voltage a few volts above the breakdown voltage ( @xmath9 ) . \n when a photoelectron is produced , it induces a geiger avalanche . \n the avalanche is passively quenched by a resistor untegrated to each pixel . \n the output charge @xmath10 from a single pixel is independent of the number of produced photoelectrons within the pixel , and can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the applied voltage and @xmath13 is the capacitance of the pixel . \n the overvoltage , @xmath14 is the parameter that controls the performance of mppc as we will see later . \n it is known that @xmath15 is dependent on the temperature with a coefficient of @xmath16  mv / k  @xcite . combining the output from all the pixels , the total charge from an mppc \n is quantized to multiples of @xmath10 and proportional to the number of pixels that underwent geiger discharge ( `` _ _ fired _ _ '' ) . \n the number of fired pixels is proportional to the number of injected photons if the number of photons is small compared to the total number of pixels . \n thus , the mppc has an excellent photon counting capability as long as the number of photo - electron does not approach the total number of pixels in the device .    for an mppc , the operating voltage \n @xmath12 is a few volts above the breakdown voltage and well below 100  v. the pixel capacitance @xmath13 is on the order of 10100  ff , giving a gain of 10@xmath1710@xmath18 . \n these features enable us to read out the signal from the mppc with simple electronics . \n in addition , because the thickness of the amplification region is a few @xmath7 m , an mppc is insensitive to the magnetic field and has a fast response . \n the photon detection efficiency ( pde ) of an mppc is expressed as a product of three effects : @xmath19 the geometrical efficiency @xmath20 represents the fraction of active area in a micropixel . \n based on a measurement  @xcite , @xmath20 is about 0.6 for an mppc with 50@xmath650  @xmath7 m pixel size . \n the quantum efficiency of the apd , qe , depends on the wavelength of photon and is typically 0.70.8 for the wavelength of 400500  nm , the range of current interest . \n the probability of inducing a geiger discharge when a photoelectron is generated , @xmath21 , depends on @xmath22 . \n the last factor introduces the @xmath22 dependence of pde . \n the dark noise of mppc at the room temperature is dominated by the geiger discharge induced by thermally generated electron - hole pairs . \n because it is amplified with the identical process , a dark noise pulse can not be distinguished from the signal induced by the external photon irradiation , although the dark noise is mainly at the single photoelectron level in absence of the cross - talk effect described below . \n the dark noise rate of mppc is proportional to the area . for 50  @xmath7 m pixel type mppc , \n the dark noise rate per active area is about 300500  khz / mm@xmath8 at 25  with a gain of 7.5@xmath23 . \n there are two known processes which give an additional charge to the original signal ; the cross - talk between neighboring micropixels and afterpulse . \n the origin of the cross - talk is presumed to be optical photons emitted during avalanche  @xcite which enter neighboring micropixels and trigger another geiger discharge . \n it gives an additional charge output at the same time as the original geiger discharge . \n the afterpulse of mppc is considered to be due to delayed release of carriers trapped at lattice defects , giving a time - correlated but delayed charge output to the original signal  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the mppc performance , \n it is important to measure key parameters such as @xmath15 , pde , dark noise rate , cross - talk and afterpulse probabilities together with their dependence on the temperature and applied voltage .      a picture of the mppc for the t2k - nd280 ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) is shown in fig . \n [ fig : mppc ] and the major specifications is summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] . \n we use the 1.0  mm diameter kuraray y11(200)ms wls fiber for the nd280 detector . \n the sensitive area of the mppc is enlarged from 1@xmath61  mm@xmath8 of those on catalogue ( s10362 - 11 - 050c ) to 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 , so that we can minimize the light loss at the optical contact with a simple coupler . \n the size of apd pixel is 50@xmath650  @xmath7m@xmath8 and the number of apd pixels  . \n the large pde of mppc results in a light yield sufficiently large to safely reject the dark noise , which is mainly at a single photoelectron level . \n in addition , thanks to the pulsed neutrino beam timing , the random dark noise has only little effect for the neutrino event reconstruction . \n .specifications of t2k - mppc(s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n for the t2k near neutrino detectors , we have developed the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) with 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 active area and with 667 50  @xmath7 m pitch pixels ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . in total , \n about 64,500 mppcs were produced for t2k from february 2008 to february 2009 .    at kyoto university , we have successfully developed the system and technique to characterize a large number of mppcs , and tested 17,686 mppcs . \n the performance of mppcs has been confirmed to satisfy our requirements . \n the failure rate is found to be about 0.5% . \n the authors are grateful to the solid state division of hamamatsu photonics for providing us test samples during the development . \n we appreciate useful suggestions from the members of t2k nd280 photosensor group . \n we thank f.  retiere for careful reading and helpful comments on this manuscript . \n this work was supported by mext and jsps with the grant - in - aid for scientific research a 19204026 , young scientists s 20674004 , scientific research on priority areas `` new developments of flavor physics '' , and the global coe program `` the next generation of physics , spun from universality and emergence '' . \n the development of mppc and the test system is also supported by the kek detector technology project . \n y.  kudenko [ t2k collaboration ] , nucl . \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 598 * , 289 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0805.0411 [ physics.ins-det ] ] . \n a.  pla - dalmau , frascati phys . \n * 21 * , 513 ( 2001 ) ; k.  nitta et al . , \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 535 * , 147 ( 2004 ) ; d.  drakoulakos et al . \n , fermilab - proposal-0938 , arxiv : hep - ex/0405002 ; a.  a.  aguilar - arevalo et al . , fermilab - proposal-0954 , arxiv : hep - ex/0601022 ; t.  adam et al . \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 577 * , 523 ( 2007 ) . \n m.  yokoyama et al . \n , arxiv : physics/0605241 ; s.  gomi et al . \n , pos * pd07 * , 015 ( 2007 ) . \n h.  oide , t.  murase , h.  otono and s.  yamashita , nucl .  instrum \n .  meth . \n a * 613 * , 23 ( 2010 ) . \n f.  moreau , j .- c . \n vanel , o.  drapier , m.  gonin , a.  bonnemaison , a.  cauchois , y.  geerebaert , s.  couturier - le quellec , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 613 * , 46 ( 2010 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 4327127641561, "RequestID": "4cb739d4a7fec28b020c72ed1c22486c4f71c85e", "TotalTokens": 2751}

{"ContextTokens": 1615, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery that the _ cos - b _ gamma - ray source was a pulsar ( psr b1706 - 44 ) was made by johnston et al ( 1992 ) . \n mcadam , osborne , & parkinson ( 1993 ) published a map made by the most telescope at 843  mhz of the area around the gamma - ray source . \n it showed a semicircular arc of emission , which has subsequently been denoted as the supernova remnant ( snr ) g343.1 - 2.3 , with the pulsar seemingly embedded in a small feature at its south eastern extremity . \n it was argued that the approximate distance of 3  kpc for the remnant , derived from the surface brightness - diameter relationship ( @xmath0-d ) was not incompatible with the pulsar s dispersion measure , although the distance indicated by the widely used interstellar electron density model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) would be only 1.8  kpc . \n the @xmath0-d relationship was based on the flux values from single dish observations , as both the vla and the most integrated flux fell short of what would be expected from these ( mcadam et al 1993 ) .    if the association of the pulsar and the supernova remnant were real a transverse velocity of @xmath1  kms@xmath2 \n would be required for the pulsar to have moved from the approximate geometric centre of the snr arc in the characteristic spin down time of 17  kyr . \n this is a high value but not the highest measured value for a pulsar nor as high as that implied for some seemingly well - established pulsar - snr associations . \n frail , goss , & whiteoak ( 1994 ) mapped the area around the pulsar at 20  cm and 90  cm with the vla and cast some doubt on it s association with g343.1 - 2.3 based on the morphology , and the argument that the dispersion measure and @xmath0-d distance were discrepant . \n the latter was subsequently countered by a 21  cm hydrogen line absorption measurement of the pulsar by koribalski et  al . \n ( 1995 ) which gives a distance range of 2.4 to 3.2  kpc . \n nicastro , johnston , & koribalski ( 1996 ) also argue against the association . \n they report a maximum value only 27  kms@xmath2 for the magnitude of the transverse velocity of the pulsar calculated from the interstellar scintillation . \n however in both dodson ( 1997 ) and then their later paper ( johnston , nicastro , & koribalski 1998 ) this estimate is revised up to 100  kms@xmath2 . \n the possibility of a direct determination of the proper motion of psr b1706 - 44 has been investigated , but no phase reference sufficiently strong for the current australian vlbi network ( the lba ) could be found . \n we have made a number of radio images of the remnant to determine its full extent . \n these are with mrt at 150  mhz , with the atca at 1400  mhz and at 6.6  ghz with the 26 m dish at mt pleasant observatory , hobart . \n the object as seen at 150  mhz , and at 6.6  ghz are shown in figure [ fig : mrt+mtp ] . \n the 150-mhz map is a preliminary result from the mrt all sky survey . \n the 6.6-ghz image was produced as part of the honours thesis of m. howlett ( howlett 1998 ) , a survey along the galactic plane using the 26 m antenna run by the university of tasmania . \n both contain all spatial frequencies up to their resolution . \n they both show broad extended structure to the south of the bright arc seen by most . \n the australia telescope compact array has been use to re - observe g343.1 - 2.3 , with a nineteen pointing mosaic . \n mosaicing was required to cover the extent of the source , but also to assist in the recovery of the flux on the shortest _ uv _ spacings , which were missed in the most and the vla observations . \n the images in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) , look very much like those of most and indeed have very similar resolution ( @xmath3 ) ( the longer baselines , to the 6 km antenna , were not used due to their poor support ) . \n we have included as a constraint in the deconvolution the observed total flux for the snr , 30 jy , as seen with the 26 m single dish in hobart . \n figure [ fig : at_i ] b ) shows the polarisation angle overlaid on the polarised intensity . \n the polarised fraction is typically about 20 per cent and the polarisation angle is randomly orientated and changes rapidly around the bright ring . \n wisps of polarised emission can be seen to extend beyond the ring as originally defined , and throughout the region with broadscale emission . \n this confirms that the broadscale emission is associated with the synchrotron emission from the snr . \n it is instructive to compare the vla maps of figure 4 in frail et al ( 1994 ) with the map in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) . \n the spur of emission on which the pulsar lies is clearly a continuous feature covering more than @xmath4 . \n this makes it extremely unlikely to be a cometary tail from the pulsar . \n furthermore the width of the spur , @xmath5 , is unlikely to be that due to ram pressure of a moving pulsar . \n it is intriguing this approximately the size that would be expected from a static pulsar wind , i.e. the sedov equations with a continuous input of energy , with the @xmath6 of psr1706 - 44 ( rees & gunn 1974 ) . \n the arguments against the association were based around kaspi s critia ( kaspi 1996 ) . \n these were that the pulsar dm distance and the snr @xmath0-d distance did not match , and the pulsar was at the edge of the snr and had too low a velocity to have travelled from the geometric centre of the snr . \n also there was no morphological evidence to imply a velocity direction . \n it has turned out that it is the dm distance is incorrect , and the extent of the snr has been underestimated . \n it is clear from both the low total flux values found by the most and vla maps that there is a smooth broad component to this snr . \n the atca observations confirm the extent of the broad emission , and that this is syncrotron in character . taking this smooth component as the true limits of the snr enlarges the extent and moves it southwards . \n this places the pulsar psr1706 - 44 within the snr shell , rather than on the rim . \n we expect a snr to be associated with psr1706 - 44 because of its youth . \n the association was rejected in the past , and we have shown that the grounds for the rejection are not compelling as previously believed . the question of the pulsar velocity could be resolved by finding a phase reference for vlbi observation , with either the ska or an upgrade to the current lba . \n we will be able to rule out the upper velocity limits with the atca within the next few years but will not be able to measure to the lower limits for a few decades .", "StartTimeOffset": 4375212689309, "RequestID": "2bb7e11108e175e323002fd1b9d705e316086cc8", "TotalTokens": 1763}

{"ContextTokens": 2104, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "halo shapes are defined by diagonalizing the moments of inertia from which we derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the best ellipsoidal halo fit . \n the principal axes @xmath12 are related to the square root of the eigenvalues such that @xmath13 . our results , in agreement with other studies , indicate that although halos are triaxial they are significantly more prolate than oblate . \n this is quantified by using the so called triaxiality index @xcite defined as @xmath14 , which has limiting values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the case of a pure prolate and oblate spheroid , respectively . \n our results show that the fraction of halos with pronounced prolatness ( ie . , large @xmath17s ) is significantly higher than that of oblate - like halos . \n overall we obtain from our simulated halos that @xmath18 . \n an interesting question , especially for observational studies , is whether the 3d halo shape distribution can be inferred from the projected ( 2d ) shapes . \n this is an inversion problem for which , under the assumption of random halo orientation with respect to the line of sight and purely oblate or prolate spheroidal halos , there is a unique relation between the projected and intrinsic axial ratio distributions . \n this is described by a set of integral equations , first investigated by @xcite and given by @xcite : @xmath19 with @xmath20 representing the intrinsic axial ratio while @xmath21 and @xmath22 the intrinsic prolate and oblate axial ratio distributions , respectively . \n the continuous function @xmath23 is derived from the discrete axial ratios frequency distribution using the so - called kernel estimators ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) . \n inverting then the above equations gives us the distribution of true axial ratios as a function of @xmath23 ( eg . \n @xcite ) . nevertheless , if halos are a mixture of the two spheroidal populations or they have triaxial configurations there is no unique inversion @xcite . \n however , all may not be lost and although the exact shape distribution may not be recovered accurately one could possibly infer whether the 3d halo shapes are predominantly more prolate or oblate - like . \n let us see this in more detail using our simulated intrinsically triaxial ellipsoidal halos which are however dominated by prolate - like shapes ( @xmath24 ) . \n the important point here is that in order for the inverted distribution to be physically meaningful it should be positive for all @xmath20 s . \n negative values indicate that the assumed model for the intrinsic halo shape is unacceptable . \n in fig.1 ( left panel ) we present the discrete and continuous - @xmath23 - distributions of the projected in 2d axial ratios for halos of two mass ranges ( indicated in the plot ) . in the middle and right panels we present the inverted 3d axial ratio distributions ( continuous lines ) for the prolate and oblate models , respectively . \n it is evident that the inverted oblate - model distribution has many negative values which is an important indication that this model is unacceptable , while the opposite is true for the prolate - model distribution . \n furthermore , we plot as histograms the intrinsic axial ratio distribution of the `` average '' prolate or oblate spheroidal fit to the 3d halo . \n these fits are realized by estimating the corresponding axial ratios by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n it is evident that the purely oblate model fails miserably to even come close to the inverted distribution while the prolate model fits relatively well the corresponding inverted 3d prolate - model distribution . \n this agrees with the higher prolatness of the 3d halo shapes . \n we therefore conclude that applying the previously discussed inversion method to observational data ( eg . \n @xcite , @xcite ) we can infer , even in the event of triaxial ellipsoidal halo shapes , the dominance of prolate or oblate - like 3d shapes . \n another interesting fact , shown in recent high - resolution simulations of the concordance model , is the correlation between halo mass and halo flattening , with more massive halos being flatter ( eg . @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n this is counter - intuitive in the sense that the massive halos should collapse faster than lower mass halos of roughly the same formation age and thus they should have more time to dynamically evolve and virialize , a process that should reduce their initial ellipsoidal configuration . \n however , halo formation ages vary and secondary infall , which if important it could affect the halo outskirts , can produce such elongated halo geometry . however , even in such a case the inner parts of the most massive halos should be virialized and thus nearly spherical , which however does not seem to be the case ( eg . \n @xcite their figure 7 ) . \n note that these results are based on dissipationless simulations while baryonic dissipation has been shown to affect halo shapes , producing significantly rounder halos ( eg . \n @xcite ) . also one may expect that halos in low - density regions , where tidal effects , accretion and merging are minimal to be less elongated , as indeed has been found ( eg . \n in order to define the dynamical state of a halo we use the @xmath27-deviation substructure statistic @xcite , which looks for deviations of the local velocity mean and dispersion around their overall halo values . for each halo particle \n we find its @xmath28 nearest neighbors from which we calculate their local velocity mean and dispersion which we then compare with their overall halo values . \n the local deviations are defined by : @xmath29 $ ] while the individual halo @xmath27-statistic is given by the sum @xmath30 . \n it has been found that a robust measure of the substructure index is given when using @xmath31 @xcite , which is the value that we use . in figure 2 \n we show the velocity dispersion ( right panel ) and @xmath32 axial ratio ( left panel ) distributions for halos in the mass range @xmath33 . \n those that have a substructure index @xmath34 are shown as hatched histograms while the overall halo distributions as dashed - line histograms . \n _ it is evident that dynamically young halos ( ie . \n , those with significant substructure ) are more elongated and have a higher velocity dispersion than the overall halo population . _ \n furthermore , we investigate the correlation between halo velocity dispersion and halo mass . from our halo identification procedure \n we expect that most halos should be nearly virialized and thus their velocity dispersion should be strongly correlated with their mass via the virial theorem . indeed , there is a strong correlation between the velocity dispersion and the halo mass , measured by summing the member dm particles masses , with a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath35 . \n we find however , that this strong correlation breaks down in the vicinity of large halo hosts . in figure 3 \n we show with open points the correlation coefficient between halo @xmath36 and mass as a function of distance to their nearest massive ( @xmath37 ) host neighbor . \n the monotonic drop of the correlation coefficient with decreasing halo - host separation is evident . \n we also find that there is a significant although weaker correlation between @xmath36 and the substructure index ( @xmath27 ) , which increases as the halo - host distance decreases . \n this probably implies that halos near large hosts are either disrupted due to the presence of strong tidal fields or more probably that the excess density of sub - halos near hosts induce strong inter - halo gravitational interactions and merging . \n these results have important consequences for observational studies and put important limits on the validity of using the virial theorem to estimate group or cluster masses in the vicinity of massive clusters . \n allgood et al . , \n apj , _ in press _ , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3007, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the intention of this talk is to summarize the application of linearized gravity , in the specific form of the theory of black hole perturbations , to the study of the collision of black holes . \n most of the results are already present in the literature , and the rest of the work is still in progress so i present here only a brief survey . \n the motivation for studying black hole collisions is quite clear . in the next few decades \n gravitational wave detectors will come online that will require `` templates '' of possible waveforms from different sources . \n the collision of black holes is one of the main candidates for observable sources of gravitational radiation . \n although the initial and advanced ligo detectors will not quite have the frequency range to detect the waves produced in the final moments of the most common collisions , it is expected that future detectors will , and knowing the waveform for the final moments can also lead to insights into the waveforms emitted earlier on . \n the presence of this strong motivation from the experimental side has led to the formation of an alliance of numerical relativity groups ( the `` binary black hole grand challenge collaboration '' ) with the goal of numerically simulating the collision of two black holes using supercomputers . \n the degree of difficulty of this project is reflected in the fact that several established numerical relativity groups have decided to team efforts in order to tackle it .    here \n we will like to offer a much more modest approach , which is based on a simple idea : when a collision of two black holes starts with the holes so close to each other that they are surrounded by a common horizon , the problem looks from the point of view of an external observer as a single distorted black hole . \n it can therefore be treated with perturbation theory . \n although one expects this approach to only yield results in a small range of initial separation , it provides at least for that range a benchmark against which one can calibrate numerical codes of the fully numerical approach . in reference \n @xcite an explicit calculation was carried out using this idea . \n we took the initial data for the head - on collision of two black holes given by the misner @xcite solution and re - wrote it in such a way that in the case that the two black holes are close to each other it explicitly looks like  schwarzschild plus something small \" . \n we took the  something small \" and evolved it using the equations of linearized gravity ( the zerilli equation ) and computed the radiated energy . \n the results are shown in figure 1 , where we plot the energy radiated in the collision as a function of the initial separation and compare with the results of the ncsa group @xcite using a numerical integration of the full einstein equations . \n we see that the close approximation works very well until the holes are no longer surrounded by a common apparent horizon ( @xmath0 ) and works within the correct order of magnitude up to when the holes are no longer surrounded by an event horizon ( @xmath1 ) . \n also shown is a `` far approximation '' based on a particle - membrane paradigm @xcite . \n comparisons of waveforms have also been performed @xcite and they also show very good agreement between the linearized theory and the full numerical simulations . \n all this shows that the use of linearized gravity in the close limit can be a valuable aid to full numerical evolutions of the two black hole problem . \n it is therefore quite tempting to apply the linearized treatment to more interesting situations , specifically the in - spiraling collision of two black holes with angular momentum . \n there are two main obstacles to doing this computation and we will detail them in the next two sections . \n assuming initial data for a black hole collision is given , we can rather easily evolve and compute energies in linearized theory . \n why therefore not do it for the in - spiraling collision ? \n the main reason is that for that case there are no numerical results with which to compare and the linearized formalism does not have a measure of error in it : it therefore has little predictive power . \n there is no consistent way to say when the close approximation breaks down . \n in fact , this example teaches us a valuable lesson about perturbation theory : when is linearized perturbation valid ? \n the obvious answer `` when perturbations are small '' is clearly naive . to begin with , `` \n small '' should be characterized in a coordinate invariant way . moreover , as this example shows , perturbations can be `` large '' and perturbation theory can still be valid : it just needs to happen that the perturbations be large in regions of spacetime that do not contribute in a significant way to the physics of interest . in the two black hole example , such a region is the interior of the horizon and regions close to it , in which perturbations mostly fall into the black hole .    how is one to characterize when to trust the approximation ? the answer is simple : work out the second order perturbations , compute the physical quantities of interest and use how much the first and second order calculation differ as a measure of the accuracy of the first order results . \n the advantage of this answer is that it is phrased in terms of what one is exactly interested in : the physical quantities . in the case of the collision of two black holes \n these are the radiated waveforms and energies . \n the formalism for second order perturbations of black holes has not been worked out in the past . \n it can be studied in detail as we do in reference @xcite . here \n i just sketch some of the outstanding points . \n it turns out that all the information can be coded into a single variable , exactly as in the first order perturbation case and that that variable satisfies a `` zerilli equation '' , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the zerilli function @xmath4 is a coordinate invariant combination of the perturbed metric coefficients . \n this equation is exactly the same as the one satisfied by the first order perturbations ( including the `` potential '' v(r ) , which can be seen in reference @xcite ) . \n however , there is an important difference : the right - hand side is not zero but a `` source '' term s , which is listed explicitly in reference @xcite and which is a complicated function quadratic in the first order perturbations and their derivatives . \n the way in which we derived this equation is to compute a particular combination of the einstein equations , writing the perturbed metric in a particular coordinate system , the so called `` regge - wheeler '' gauge . \n this , in turn is a way of deriving the original zerilli equation . \n the expression we get for @xmath4 is therefore a representation in that gauge of a gauge invariant quantity . \n the explicitly gauge invariant form of @xmath4 can also be computed . \n we therefore are in a position to evolve to second order the problem of black hole collisions and therefore to endow the first order predictions with `` error bars '' \n . this will be crucial for the inspiralling case , where numerical results are not expected for some time . \n in the head - on collision case we were lucky to have an exact solution to the initial value problem that we could evolve . \n for the more realistic cases there are no exact solutions available at present and it is unlikely that they will be easily found in the future . there is an immediate alternative at hand . there exist already well tested numerical codes @xcite for solving the initial value problem in general relativity in the context of black hole collisions . \n one could simply take these initial data evaluated for the case in which the black holes are close and `` read off '' from them the departures from schwarzschild to be evolved using the linearized theory . \n this is certainly possible and has already been illustrated for brill - lindquist - type initial data by abrahams and price @xcite . \n apart from the possibility of using numerical initial data for realistic collisions it is interesting to notice that one can , up to a certain extent , solve the initial value problem analytically if one is only interested in initial data for the close approximation . \n the idea is simple : in the close approximation the initial data for a black hole collision departs a small amount from the initial data for a schwarzschild spacetime for a single black hole with mass equal to the sum of the masses of the colliding holes . therefore one can develop an approximation technique for the initial data starting from the initial data of schwarzschild and adding small corrections proportional to the separation of the holes . \n we illustrate here only the zeroth order results , details will be given in a forthcoming paper in collaboration with john baker . \n the initial value problem of general relativity can be conveniently cast in the conformal formalism @xcite . \n one is interested in solving the momentum and hamiltonian constraints @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spatial metric , @xmath7 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath8 is the scalar curvature of the three metric . \n one proposes a three metric that is conformally flat @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the conformal factor and a decomposition of the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 . \n the constraints become , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a derivative with respect to the flat spacetime . since the momentum constraint is linear \n , one can propose as a solution for it for the case of two black holes the sum of the solutions for the case of individual holes with momentum @xmath14 , @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a unit normal in the direction of @xmath17 and all vector fields are defined in the flat background spacetime . \n one now can put this solution in the hamiltonian constraint and one is left with an elliptic , highly non - linear equation for @xmath18 . \n this is the equation that is usually solved numerically . \n there exist situations , however , where one can make some progress analytically . \n consider the case in which the momenta of the holes is small @xcite . in that case \n one can neglect the right - hand side of the hamiltonian constraint and one only needs to solve a vacuum laplace equation for @xmath18 . \n the solution can therefore be very simply found , the difficulty depending on the boundary conditions one chooses for the problem ( typically a `` symmetrized '' boundary condition is imposed , which complicates calculation quite a bit in certain cases , see @xcite for details ) . \n another situation in which one can obtain an approximate solution is in the `` close approximation '' . in that case one \n has two black holes of momenta equal and opposite @xmath19 , and since the black holes are close , the unit normals appearing in the form for the extrinsic curvature for each hole are approximately equal . \n that implies that the extrinsic curvature for the problem is approximately zero ( as it should , since in the close limit the problem looks like a schwarzschild black hole at rest . ) \n therefore one can again neglect the right - hand side of the hamiltonian constraint and one is again left with a laplace equation . \n let us compare this approximation with the full numerical results . \n in order to do this we will compare the adm energy of initial data for a collision of two holes of momentum @xmath20 . \n the adm energy in the conformal formalism is given by    @xmath21    and we notice that it does not depend explicitly on the extrinsic curvature ( it does implicitly via the constraints ) . \n therefore at the approximation we are working , in which the constraints do not couple the conformal factor and the extrinsic curvature , the energy is independent of the extrinsic curvature and therefore independent of the momenta of the holes . \n we compare this prediction with the full numerical results of cook in figure [ cook ] . \n an interesting aspect is that one can advance this approximation one step further . \n one can input the extrinsic curvature and the conformal factor found as a fixed `` source '' in the equation determining the conformal factor and one can obtain a correction through the integration of a poisson equation . \n comparison of this approximation with the numerical data is currently in progress . \n details are complicated by the particular boundary conditions that are usually chosen in the numerical computations . \n it is evident that the `` close approximation '' can work in many other cases , apart from the head - on , equal momenta holes we considered here . \n the only changes will be that the solution one obtains in the `` close limit '' rather than being a slice of schwarzschild will be a slice of kerr or boosted schwarzschild if the net result of the collision has angular momentum or linear momentum . \n we have seen that the use of the `` close approximation '' can be a valuable aid to full numerical computations of the collision of two black holes . with the introduction of a second order scheme we are now in a position of offering reliable estimates of energies and waveforms that we expect people working on the full numerical simulations will find of use to calibrate codes and design strategies for better integrating the einstein equations in this problem of great current physical interest . \n the work described here is in collaboration with richard price , john baker , reinaldo gleiser and oscar nicasio . \n i acknowledge support of nsf through grants phy94 -

indexer @xmath10 with respect to the ground set @xmath0 . \n then , we have @xmath62 this completes the proof .    in a similar way , we can also determine the conjunctive set - indexing number of a graph as follows . \n the conjunctive set - indexing number of a graph @xmath2 on @xmath49 vertices is @xmath63 . \n the proof follows exactly as in the previous theorem . \n in this paper , the notions of two types of set - labeling of graphs have been introduced and certain properties and characteristics of graphs which admit these types of set - labels have been discussed . \n more problems in this area are still open . \n some of the open problems we have identified in this area are the following .    a disjunctive ( or conjunctive ) set - indexer @xmath10 of a graph @xmath2 \n is called _ sequential _ if @xmath64 and a conjunctive set - indexer @xmath10 of a graph @xmath2 is called _ sequential _ if @xmath65 . \n characterise the graphs which admit sequential disjunctive set - indexer ( or sequential conjunctive set - indexer ) . \n a disjunctive set - indexer @xmath10 of a graph @xmath2 is called _ topogenic _ \n if @xmath66 is a topology on the ground set @xmath0 and a conjunctive set - indexer @xmath10 of a graph @xmath2 is called _ topogenic _ if @xmath67 is a topology on the ground set @xmath0    characterise the graphs which admit topogenic disjunctive set - indexer ( or topogenic conjunctive set - indexer ) . \n a set - labeling of a graph @xmath2 is called a _ set - magic labeling _ ( @xcite,@xcite ) if the set - label of a vertex is the union of the set - labels of its end vertices . \n then ,     determine the conditions required for a conjunctive set - labeling of a graph to be a magic set - labeling of @xmath2 . \n determining the disjunctive and conjunctive set - indexing numbers of various graph classes , graph operations , graph products and graph powers seems to be much promising for further investigation . \n more properties and characteristics of various set - labeled graphs are yet to be investigated . the problems of establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for various graphs and graph classes to have certain other types of set valuations are also open . \n all these facts highlight a wide scope for future studies in this area . \n the author of this article dedicates this paper to the memory prof . \n d. balakrishnan , founder academic director , vidya academy of science and technology , thrissur , india . , who had been the mentor , the philosopher and the real role model for many teachers , including the author , in both teaching and research .", "StartTimeOffset": 4432152947594, "RequestID": "bd5f2e0793bf48de0088bf951b84a000e253893b", "TotalTokens": 3918}
{"ContextTokens": 2908, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "* side - channel attacks * ( sca ) have been put forward mainly by paul kocher _ \n et al . _ in 1996 in @xcite . \n this first description of a sca explained how the mere observation of the duration of computations could allow an attacker to retrieve the secret key . \n the attack was then improved and extended to other cryptosystems  @xcite .    in 1999 \n kocher  _ et al . \n _ described what they called `` '' @xcite . \n this new attack used the power consumption instead to the duration but yielded the same result : the retrieval of the secret key . \n the process of this latter attack is relatively simple : a large number of cryptographic operations are monitored and the cipher text stored together with the electric consumption \n . then guesses were made of some parts of the secret key , which were confirmed or or not by a statistical processing the data . \n other attacks against various cryptosystems were based on this method @xcite . \n countermeasures soon appeared to protect systems based on a strong algebraic structure@xcite . at he \n protection of opposite symmetric cryptosystems often consisted in introducing some randomization either in the computing process or power consumption to prevent the statistical processing of the acquired data . \n however `` counter - countermeasures '' also appeared @xcite . \n some other protection schemes were designed @xcite . \n an interesting and apparently efficient countermeasure is the wddl  @xcite which duplicates each signal in the circuit so that whatever the value is , one of the lines will toggle . \n this countermeasure was enhanced by an improved routing of related signals @xcite , which reduces the differences between the power consumptions of a 1 and a 0.    * asynchronous circuits * , the history of which dates back to 1950 , are nowadays increasingly considered as a viable alternative to classical synchronous designs . \n indeed they feature some very useful properties such as flexibility , robustness , high speed and low power . \n this article brings another good reason to consider asynchronous designs : a greater resistance against _ side - channel attacks_.    some industrial applications of asynchronous asic and fpga begin to appear both in the academic world  @xcite and in the industry  @xcite .    at the same time \n synchronous circuits are suffering from problems arising from the distribution of the clock signal through the ic and the excessive power consumption ( and thus dissipation ! ) . \n as an asynchronous circuit has no centralized clock , the problems associated with the clock distribution , clock skew and power consumption do not exist . \n in addition this circuits offers advantages like :    * average - time performance , * lower electromagnetic radiation , * better robustness towards variations of the power voltage , * better robustness towards fabrication process variations  @xcite , * better composability and modularity because of the simple handshake interfaces and the local timing  @xcite and * better scrambling of the _ side - channel _ information  @xcite . \n asynchronous circuits thus seem to be a viable alternative which would remove these limiting factors  @xcite . \n due to these advantages , there has been a resurgence of interest in asynchronous design , especially in the reprogrammable field . \n there have been several recent successful design projects such as aspro-216  @xcite , aes crypto - processor  @xcite , many of philips designs targeting low power  @xcite , projects focused on designing an asynchronous fpga from a synchronous one , like montage  @xcite and pga - stc  @xcite or targeting asynchronous application - specific fpgas , locally synchronous , like galsa  @xcite and stacc  @xcite or completely asynchronous like papa  @xcite , and other recent works  @xcite . \n pga - stc was developed to implement two - phase bundled - data systems such as micro pipelines , galsa for massively parallel computing architecture , stacc for reconfigurable computation and papa was mainly created and optimized for pipe - lined processes . \n * this article * describe the design of the plb of a new asynchronous fpga with security as the main requirement , even at the expense of performance . indeed in the particular case of cryptography performance is second to security even if it can not be ignored . \n the fpga must be able to implement various styles of asynchronous protocols and different representations of data so as to enable comparisons between these representations and protocols as for their ability to thwart the side - channel attacks . \n section [ asynchronous - representation ] describes the representation of data and the different asynchronous protocols used in the fpga . \n we also discuss their suitablity for trusted computing . \n section [ 4-phase - protocol ] shows the construction of the plb to implement the 4-phase protocol using both binary and ternary representations of data . \n section [ 2-phase - protocol ] shows the necessary additions to the plb to accommodate the 2-phase protocols . \n section [ programming - the - fpga ] shows how the fpga is programmed . \n finally section [ conclusion ] concludes the article . \n as opposed to synchronous data , whose validity is guaranteed by the timing of some global `` clock '' signal , the asynchronous computations are synchronized by the availability of data and , when necessary , by a request / acknowledge handshake signalling .    a formal description of delay insensitive representation of data can be found in  @xcite . in the * * q**uasi-**d**elay * * i**nsensitive ( qdi ) protocols the request is carried by the data itself . \n this allows to obtain a reliable design , independent of the routing . \n the data are transmitted together with the availability information and thus a logic signal or , shorter a `` * * signal * * '' , must be represented by more than a single electrical signal or , shorter , a `` * * wire * * '' representation on a single wire per signal would be acceptable in some cases but we shall restrict ourselves in the following pages to standard cmos levels : @xmath0and @xmath1 . ] . in this article , \n a wire is able to take one of two values , which we denote * 0 * and * 1 * regardless of their actual electric implementation .    in order to avoid glitches \n , a sufficient condition is that _ given a signal @xmath2 represented by @xmath3 wires , the transmission of a new value of @xmath2 must consist in * exactly one * of the @xmath3 wires changing its electrical state_. this means that the number of wires is greater than or equal to the number of the states of @xmath2 . as silicon and routing is a precious resource , the number of wires representing a given signal will thus be equal to the number of possible values of this signal . \n the most frequently used kind of signal is the binary signal , which carries a \\{*`1'*,*`0 ' * } information . \n such a signal is encoded with 2 wires . \n this representation is called `` * * dual - rail * * '' or `` 2 '' \n . however ternary signals , which carry a \\{*`0'*,*`1'*,*`2 ' * } information , can also be thought of . \n such a signal is represented by 3 wires and one speaks of `` 3 '' representation . \n this representation is more compact than the _ 1-out - of-2 _ as for arithmetic : 6 wires in 2 represent 3 2 signals which can take 8 valid values , compared to two _ 1-out - of-3 _ signals , which can take 9 valid values . \n however due to the greater complexity of gates in 3 representation , the binary signals are most of the time preferred . \n an asynchronous design may need additional signals , which are specialized to synchronisation . \n these signal carry no _ data _ information and can thus be coded on a single wire . \n they will be referred to as _ acknowledge_signals . \n the inputs of the gates which receive such a signal will be denoted @xmath4and those driving these signals will be called @xmath5 . \n there are two main families of qdi asynchronous communication protocols , which differ by the nature of the signalling information : the  protocols and the  protocols .      under a  protocol , \n valid values of a signal are separated by a special value , denoted @xmath6 . \n the transmission of a value @xmath7 from an emitter to a receiver proceeds as follows :    [ cols=\">,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ [ synchronization ] ] synchronization + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the synchronization is performed by a device called `` @xmath8-decision -

train gap of about 200ms . \n the data are taken by the detectors on the detection slabs and digitised by the very front - end on - detector electronics or slabs . \n then all output data are delivered to electronics boards at the end of the detector . \n data is then sent to a concentrator card which collects data from many detector units before being sent off the detector on gigabit optical fibres to a detector receiver in the counting room . \n figure[fig_daqoverview ] gives an overview of the generic daq scheme . \n the calorimeter is designed such that vfe chips are embedded in the detector slabs . \n the slabs are served from the ends with a detector interface ( dif ) . \n the difs transmit the data to the link - data aggregator ( lda ) which is fitted on - detector and serves many difs via standard hdmi links . \n the data from the ldas are fed to the off - detector receiver ( odr ) via the gigabit optical cables . \n the odr is a dedicated pci - express card which is hosted in a daq pc , being capable of saving the data to central storage . \n the detector signals are buffered and digitised by the vfe asics situated on the detector slabs . \n the vfe asics depend on the detector used in the prototypes accommodating the different features of each detectors . \n the interface between the vfe and the daq system is provided by the dif board which is located at the end of the calorimeter slabs . \n the dif board consists of a customised part which translates the signals of the asics into more generic signals which are independent of the detector used for the calorimeter . \n the interface has been defined together with three detector groups working on prototypes for the ecal , ahcal and dhcal within the eudet@xcite project and is common to the three different detector types . a generic part of the dif passes the data on and sends configuration on to the vfe electronics . \n hdmi@xcite is a home entertainment system standard with small cabling and connectors which are commercially available at low cost . \n they are rated at more than 300mb / sec for data . to provide redundancy against link failures , \n a provision is made on the dif to connect to its neighbour . by connecting even and odd difs to different ldas \n , the system is protected for the loss of a dif - lda link , or even the failure of an entire lda .      in order to accumulate the data sent from the dif , \n an lda collects the data from several difs and sends it further to the odr . \n the number of difs aggregated in the lda depends on the detector type chosen in the detection layer \n . the optimal number of difs / lda should take into account the number of available pins on the fpga , the bandwidth per dif and the effective performance - price ratio to maximise bandwidth of the optical link . \n the current lda prototype can host up to eight links to the difs with a small upgrade up to ten dif connections . \n the lda has banks of hdmi connectors for connections to the difs and a small form - factor pluggable ( sfp ) connector for the optical link off - detector . \n the prototype version of the lda is built on a commercial development board with a xilinx spartan3 - 200 fpga . \n the two sets of connectors are physically add - on boards : one providing the sfp and serialiser chipset for the optical link , the other hosting eight working hdmi connectors with clock fan - out hardware . \n a first prototype of the lda has been produced by the company enterpoint @xcite and has been thoroughly tested . \n the lda is situated at the edge of the detector , the odr however is located in the counting room connected to the on - detector daq system by an optical fibre . as well as receiving data from the detector , it sends control and configuration data to the lda for distribution to the difs and finally sends the data off the detector to the event building . \n it is realised as a pci - express card and can serve up to four ldas per card , with one pc hosting up to two odrs . \n for the proposed daq system currently a xilinxvirtex4 fpga is used , thereby using a commercial fpga board designed by plda@xcite . at present , the data stream which will come from the detector in the eudet test beam is simulated by an internal data generator in the firmware or via an on - board ethernet interface ; this allows for a thorough debugging and optimisation of the system before integration with the detectors . \n the user interface to the odr card contains two parts : a customised driver and a client program . \n the former is mainly tasked with mapping card memory to the user space and providing direct memory access ( dma ) support . \n the latter client retrieves data from the odr card memory and stores it on the local disk . \n the performance of the prototype odr has been investigated using an ethernet interface to provide an input data stream which is copied to host memory and is currently higher than 150 mb / s writing to an array of disks \n . a higher data rate of up to 700mb / s can be achieved when writing into the host memory . \n the number of dmas has been optimised for the performance . \n the odr prototype is ready and can be optimised further in the next months . \n for the event building a good clock is essential because the events will be built using time stamps . \n it is understood that a machine clock will be fed into the odrs and fanned out to the ldas and difs . \n the requirements on the clock are a low jitter and a fixed latency between the machine clock and the clock in the difs . \n commercial networking hardware is not suited for this task as it is most efficient when it can buffer data and provides no guarantees on delivery times . similarly networking hardware built into modern fpgas suffers from varying latency . \n therefore a clock and control ( c&c ) board has been designed with links to eight odrs . \n the c&c logic is implemented on a board with 6u format , translating into a board size of 100mm@xmath1160 mm . \n the clock and control module must interface with the machine and provide stand - alone signal and clock generation . \n the machine clock is expected to run between 50 and 100mhz . \n the bunch clock will be derived as a multiple of the machine clock . \n it is able to deliver fast asynchronous triggers . \n it will also receive a busy signal from the vfe . \n the hdmi cables used for the dif to lda link will be reused here for sending control data . \n the c&c board has been delivered and has been successfully tested . in parallel the firmware for the c&c board is being developed . \n the most important requirement on the daq software for the calorimeters is its scalability . in order to minimise risks and to shorten development time \n a well - established software framework will be used . \n doocs@xcite was found to be suitable for our daq needs .    to adapt doocs to the requirements of our daq software \n the equipment name server ( ens ) has been used to integrate all daq components into one system . \n ens provides services for naming resolution and rpc communication . in the naming structure of ens \n all the functionalities and properties for each device have to be classified and defined . as seen in fig.[fig_daqoverview ] , the odr is the first hardware layer which can communicate with doocs . \n therefore the software for the odr has been the starting point of the daq software development . \n the doocs client provides a list of commands and configurable parameter with which the odr devices can be managed . \n configuration data and files are used when the system starts and runs . \n a prototype for the odr doocs client has already been shown . to steer the whole system with the doocs control software several further developments are in progress . \n the daq system for the eudet detector will be a hierarchical daq system which minimises the space needed on the detector and uses commercial components to minimise the cost of the daq system . in order to make the development for \n the test system independent of the detector type tested a dif board will make the readout generic . \n an lda card will concentrate the data from the dif and send it off to the odr which is located off the detector in a control room . \n the task of the odr is to store the data . \n all components have in addition the task to send configuration data and control messages to the detector and all other daq components upstream . \n at the time of writing each hardware component of the daq system exists and has been tested ; the individual components now need to be integrated into a complete system . \n current tests have shown that the daq software is able to integrate the odr into the daq system based on the existing software framework doocs and manage successful communication and control tests . \n the goal is to have the whole daq system ready for a test beam in 2009 . \n we would like to acknowledge the support of the commission of the european communities under the 6th framework programme `` structuring the european research area '' , contract number rii3 -

{"ContextTokens": 3965, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "ever since the seminal work of novikov and thorne @xcite and shakura and sunyaev @xcite , our understanding of the physics of accretion disks around black holes has been built on two fundamental beliefs : the energy available for radiation is equal to the binding energy of the innermost stable orbit , and is therefore determined solely by the spin of the black hole ; and the ( vertically - integrated ) stress responsible for transporting angular momentum outwards through the disk is proportional to the local pressure . \n recent work involving magnetic forces in the innermost regions of relativistic accretion disks has undercut both of these claims . in this review \n i will summarize the reasons for this change of heart and explain the consequences that are likely to follow if the new point of view proves correct . \n the basic framework for understanding the inner regions of relativistic accretion disks was laid out more than twenty - five years ago . in the simplest possible picture ( i.e. \n , one assuming that disks are time - steady , axi - symmetric , and geometrically thin ) , their radial structure may be defined in terms of conservation equations that appear almost newtonian , as the general relativistic effects can be collapsed into multiplicative correction factors . \n conservation of angular momentum , for example , may be expressed through a single first - order differential equation in radius . \n thus , to specify the entire solution , all that is necessary is to choose a boundary condition for this differential equation . \n this boundary condition may be physically interpreted as determining the conserved outward angular momentum flux through the disk , or , equivalently , as specifying @xmath1 , the @xmath2@xmath3 component of the stress exerted on the disk , at its inner edge . \n this inner edge is conventionally taken to lie at the radius of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath4 . \n selecting this boundary condition is the only part of the procedure in which there is any guesswork . until very recently , \n it was almost universally assumed that the stress must be zero at @xmath4 . \n two reasons were commonly cited for this choice . \n the first , due to thorne and collaborators @xcite , was that the radial speed inside @xmath4 is so much larger than the radial speed outside @xmath4 that , assuming a constant mass accretion rate , the inertia of mass inside @xmath4 must be much smaller than the inertia of the disk proper in the region of stable orbits . given that , it appears difficult to see how the small amount of matter in the plunging region could exert any significant force on the much heavier disk . \n the second argument @xcite begins with the assumption that the stress carrying angular momentum outward should always be proportional to the local pressure ; i.e. , @xmath5@xcite . \n if this is so , as material accelerates inward and expands , its pressure falls rapidly , so the stress must do likewise . \n if there is no stress inside @xmath4 , then no forces change the energy or angular momentum of material inside that point . \n matter therefore arrives at the event horizon with the energy and angular momentum it had at @xmath4 . \n the maximum energy per unit mass available to be radiated in the disk ( the maximum radiative efficiency ) is then defined simply by the binding energy of the marginally stable orbit , and the spin - up rate of the black hole is the mass accretion rate times the specific angular momentum of that orbit . \n both the specific binding energy and the specific angular momentum at @xmath4 depend only on the black hole s normalized angular momentum @xmath6 ; thus , it has long been thought that both the radiative efficiency and the spin - up rate per unit accreted mass are functions only of @xmath6 . \n interestingly , the very first work on this subject @xcite acknowledged that strong magnetic fields could upset the arguments that the stress must go to zero at @xmath4 , but chose ( reasonably , given the state of knowledge at the time ) to ignore this possibility . \n however , work of the past decade ( summarized in @xcite ) has shown that magnetic fields are essential to angular momentum transfer in accretion disks . \n we must therefore re - open the question of the appropriate boundary condition on @xmath1 at @xmath4 . \n this recent work has shown that , in the main body of the disk , mhd turbulence creates a stress that , when vertically - averaged , is roughly proportional to the pressure , with an @xmath7  0.1 @xcite . \n the magnetic stress accounts for the bulk of the angular momentum flux so long as two conditions are met : there must be some seed magnetic field in the accreting gas , but in the disk midplane the energy density of any imposed magnetic field must be smaller than the total pressure ; and the matter must have high enough conductivity that the mhd approximation is valid . in the conditions surrounding black holes , these are all almost certain to apply . \n weak magnetic fields are virtually ubiquitous in astrophysical environments ; and near a black hole the gas temperature will very nearly always be high enough to maintain the gas in an ionized , and therefore highly conducting , state . \n this turbulence is generated by an mhd instability driven by the orbital shear @xcite . \n its growth rate is always comparable to the orbital frequency , so it grows roughly as rapidly ( relative to an orbital period ) in the relativistic part of the disk as in the newtonian part . \n the nonlinear amplitude of the turbulence in the newtonian part of the disk is determined by a cascade of energy toward shorter wavelengths , where it can ultimately be dissipated . \n this process , too , should operate more or less in the same fashion ( as viewed in the fluid frame ) in the relativistic part of the disk as in the non - relativistic part , provided the local inflow time is long enough for equilibrium to be established . \n we may therefore reasonably conclude that the ratio @xmath8 does nt change dramatically at radii a few times @xmath4 . \n because orbital shear automatically stretches field lines in the sense that produces outward angular momentum flow ( @xmath9 ) , the effective @xmath0-parameter ( @xmath10 ) is also unlikely to change much . \n but if this is so , _ why should the stress diminish as the marginally stable orbit is approached ? _    the only aspect of this process that changes in any qualitative way as @xmath4 is approached from the outside is the ordering of four timescales : the inflow time @xmath11 , the thermal time @xmath12 , the turbulent dissipation time @xmath13 , and the dynamical time @xmath14 . in the disk body , \n @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ratio of gas ( + radiation ) pressure to magnetic energy density . \n thus , @xmath18 . however , just outside @xmath4 the effective potential flattens ( this is , of course , what it means for @xmath4 to be the location of the innermost _ marginally stable _ orbit ) , so @xmath11 diminishes toward @xmath14 . \n the concomitant decline in surface density likewise reduces @xmath12 . \n however , @xmath13 ( crudely @xmath19 for disk thickness @xmath20 and alfven speed @xmath21 ) declines more slowly than @xmath12 . as a result , in the vicinity of @xmath4 , the interplay of plasma dynamics and flux - freezing should be at least as important to determining the field intensity as the balance between the turbulent dynamo and turbulent dissipation . \n if flux - freezing really does determine the evolution of the field as the matter plunges inside @xmath4 , the magnetic field strength in the fluid frame stays roughly constant or increases somewhat even while the fluid pressure decreases dramatically @xcite . \n it follows that the effective @xmath0 rises sharply as the inflow accelerates near and inside @xmath4 . \n in fact , when the radial component of the velocity becomes relativistic , it is easy to show that these assumptions imply @xmath22 . \n that is , when the inflow is relativistic , magnetic forces become competitive with gravity , and the alfven speed becomes relativistic . \n matter may then retain a causal coupling with the disk it left behind even when it has fallen well inside @xmath4 , allowing significant transfer of energy and angular momentum @xcite . \n looking back at the old argument that the small inertia of mattter in the plunging region can not do much to the main body of the disk , we now see that magnetic fields in effect turn this argument on its head . \n magnetic connections between the disk and plunging matter act as  tethers \" by which the massive disk restrains angular acceleration of the low - inertia streams inside @xmath4 . in so doing \n , stress can be exerted on the disk itself . \n the existence of significant stress at the marginally stable orbit has major consequences for the most fundamental properties of accretion onto black holes . \n energy taken from plunging matter and delivered to the disk is potentially available for radiation ; removal of angular momentum from this matter retards the rate of black hole spin - up @xcite . \n in fact , when the black hole is rapidly rotating , the rotational energy of the black hole itself can be tapped : frame - dragging gives plunging matter a high orbital frequency ; magnetic connections from this region to the disk exert a torque ; the end - result is energy drawn from black hole rotation given to matter in the disk @xcite . in other words , the amount of energy drawn from accreting matter is no longer a quantity fixed by orbital mechanics : it is a dynamical quantity that is the product of complicated mhd dynamics , and may even be time - variable . \n the fate of the work done by magnetic fields at @xmath23 depends critically on the ratio between the dissipation and inflow timescales in the place where the energy is brought . \n if the energy can be converted into heat and radiated before the matter finds its way into the plunging region inside @xmath4 , it adds to the radiative efficiency ; if , on the other hand , dissipation is slow , so that the energy stays in the gas either as organized kinetic energy or as magnetic field energy , it may end up being taken into the black hole . given the arguments of the previous section , it is as yet unclear how this balance works out . \n if additional heat is deposited in the disk , there can be substantial alterations to the disk spectrum @xcite . \n additional flux is radiated at high frequencies , and relativistic effects beam it strongly into the equatorial plane . \n in addition , because so much more radiation is produced in the most relativistic portion of the disk , the returning radiation fraction is greatly enhanced . \n this latter effect has implications for phenomenology as diverse as polarization of the emitted light and the synchronization of fluctuations . \n however , there is an additional implication of stress at the inner edge of the disk that may be important even if the radiative efficiency is hardly altered by these mechanisms : dynamics at the marginally stable orbit can be a powerful  noise \" source to the entire dynamical system . in the long run , these dynamical fluctuations may be reflected in luminosity fluctuations , which are , of course , a hallmark of all known accreting black holes . \n the origin of this  noise \" may be seen from a simple thought experiment : consider a small magnetized fluid element orbiting just outside @xmath4 . \n imagine that half this fluid element receives a negative angular momentum perturbation from the turbulence and begins to fall inward . \n as it does so , its orbital frequency increases simply due to its decreasing orbital radius . \n the resulting shear between the two halves of the fluid element stretches the magnetic flux tube connecting them , and a magnetic tension force creates a torque that transfers angular momentum from the falling half to the half that is still orbiting stably . \n the stably orbiting half must then move outward , launching a compressive wave into the disk . \n thus , the basic mechanics of accretion create disk  noise \" when there are magnetic connections across the marginally stable orbit . \n all the arguments presented so far have been qualitative . whether these effects are quantitatively important can only be ascertained as a result of genuine calculation . \n mhd turbulent dynamics are sufficiently complicated that ( almost ) all credible calculations are numerical simulations . \n although much work remains to be done before simulations can be run with a requisite level of realism , some preliminary results have been achieved @xcite . \n to date , all simulations touching on these issues have been limited in a number of regards , both physical and numerical . \n all have assumed newtonian physics ; general relativistic dynamics is mimicked by the use of the paczyski - wiita potential @xmath24 . \n this potential qualitatively reproduces motion in a schwarzschild metric by creating a marginally stable orbit at @xmath25 . \n in addition , all simulations so far have substituted an assumed equation of state for a real energy equation . \n this assumption has two deleterious consequences : magnetosonic waves do nt propagate at the right speed because the pressure is nt correctly computed ; and , more importantly , it is impossible to use these simulations to estimate the radiative efficiency because energy taken from the plunging region to the disk falls right back in . \n there are also aspects of the numerical methods used in these simulations that are less than optimal . \n both kinetic energy and magnetic energy can disappear if fluid from two adjacent cells with oppositely directed velocity or magnetic field components is combined . \n it also appears likely that no simulation to date has used a grid fine enough to resolve the magnetic field structure .    nonetheless , putting aside these qualms , \n the simulational results may still be used as an indication of what may appear in more realistic simulations . in particular , \n angular momentum transport should be more reliably treated than energy transport because it is not subject to the problems described in the previous paragraph . \n the result shown in figure  [ jhk : avestress ] @xcite is particularly noteworthy . \n two distributions of @xmath1 integrated vertically and averaged over both azimuth and time are shown : the prediction of the novikov - thorne model for the mean mass accretion rate found in the simulation ; and the magnetic contribution to the stress . \n the two curves coincide very closely over the radial range from @xmath26  @xmath27 , demonstrating that magnetic stresses account for very nearly all the angular momentum transport in the main part of the disk . \n they depart in an uninteresting way at large radius \n the deviation here is due to the fact that the disk in the simulation had an outer edge , whereas the novikov - thorne model refers to a disk that extends to very large radius . at small radius \n , however , the contrast is very significant  as expected on the basis of the qualitative arguments presented earlier , magnetic stress remains important across the marginally stable orbit and throughout the region where gas plunges toward the event horizon . \n indeed , as a result of this continuing stress , the mean specific angular momentum of matter crossing the inner edge of the simulation ( at @xmath28 ) is about 5% smaller than the specific angular momentum at @xmath4 . also as expected , the effective @xmath0 parameter increases sharply in the innermost part of the accretion flow : between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it increases by an order of magnitude . \n the results of these first simulations are encouraging , but they are far from the final answer . \n fortunately , significant improvements are feasible . \n improved resolution can be obtained both by cleverer gridding schemes and , of course , by a few years technological development . \n real energy equations can be computed by explicitly incorporating phenemonological viscosity and resistivity and a radiative cooling function ( following time - dependent radiation transfer is also possible @xcite , but will require somewhat greater computer power before it is feasible for this kind of simulation ) . \n likewise , there is no fundamental impediment to writing mhd codes that work in a fixed relativistic metric . \n thus , in a few years , we should be able to attach quantitative values to the effects pointed out qualitatively here . \n novikov , i.d . , and thorne , k.s . , in _ black holes _ , \n c. de witt and b. de witt , eds . , new york : gordon & breach , 1973 , p. 343 shakura , n. and sunyaev , r. , _ astron . \n astrop . _ * 24 * , 337 ( 1973 ) page , d. and thorne , k.s . , _ ap . j. _ * 191 * , 499 ( 1974 ) abramowicz , m.a . and kato , s. , _ ap . \n j. _ * 336 * , 304 ( 1989 ) balbus , s.a . and hawley , j.f . \n * 70 * , 1 ( 1998 ) stone , j.m . , \n hawley , j.f . , \n gammie , c.f . \n , and balbus , s.a . _ ap . j. _ * 463 * , 656 ( 1996 ) brandenburg , a. , stein , r.f . , nordlund , a. , and torkelsson , u. , _ ap . j. letts . _ * 458 * , l45 ( 1996 ) balbus , s.a . and hawley , j.f . , _ ap . j. _ * 376 * , 214 ( 1991 ) krolik , j.h . , _ ap . \n j. letts . _ \n * 515 * , l73 ( 1999 ) gammie , c.f . \n , _ ap . j. letts . \n _ * 522 * , l57 ( 1999 ) agol , e. and krolik , j.h . , _ ap . j. _ * 528 * , 161 ( 2000 ) krolik , j.h . , in _ explosive phenomena in astrophysical compact objects , proceedings of the 1st kias astrophysics workshop _ , \n i. yi and m. rho , eds . , \n new york : aip , in press ( 2001 ) hawley , j.f . , _ ap . j. _ * 528 * , 462 ( 2000 ) hawley , j.f . and krolik , j.h . \n , _ ap . j. _ in press ( 2001 ) armitage , p.j . , reynolds , c.s . and chiang , j. , _ ap . \n j. _ in press ( 2001 ) turner , n.j . and stone , j.m . \n , _ ap . j. suppl . \n _ in press ( 2001 )", "StartTimeOffset": 4478208522464, "RequestID": "aa8d160bd0409b5364981e92f217f6a7a50547a4", "TotalTokens": 4140}

viz . \n , that the accommodation of the solute in the solvent is energetically favorable but sufficiently unfavorable entropically as to result in an increase in free energy . \n this increase is smaller when the hydrophobes are close together than when they are widely separated , resulting in a net solvent - mediated attraction between them . \n the unfavorable entropy of accommodating the solute is achieved in the model by allowing each solvent molecule to have a large number @xmath2 of possible orientations but requiring two neighboring solvent molecules to be both in a special one of those @xmath2 states if they are to accommodate a hydrophobic solute in the interstitial site between them . \n that circumstance in which two neighboring solvent molecules are both in that special orientation is taken to be energetically favorable by an amount previously called  @xcite @xmath3 . \n the condition of hydrophobicity at temperature @xmath4 was that @xmath5 , with @xmath6 boltzmann s constant . to model the hydrophobic effect realistically , \n @xmath7 was taken to be @xmath8k and @xmath2 was taken to be 110,000 . \n it was then a property of the model that forcing the solvent to accommodate a hydrophobic solute greatly restricted ( to one state out of @xmath2 ) the possible orientations of the solvent molecules neighboring the accommodated solute . \n such restriction of solvent orientation by the solute is consistent with experimental measurements of nmr relaxation times , which show that the reorientation times of water molecules that neighbor a solute with alkyl groups are about twice as long as in pure water , and that there is an increased activation energy for the reorientation in the presence of the solute over that in pure water.@xcite    it was a striking feature of the one - dimensional model that the range and strength of the solvent - mediated attraction between solutes were inversely related to each other ; at low temperatures the attraction was weak but long - ranged and at high temperatures it was strong but short - ranged . \n one of the motivations of the present work was to see if that inverse relation , which is of potential importance in the interpretation of experiment , persists in higher dimensions , and it is indeed found to be so .    it was also found earlier in the one - dimensional model that the solubility of the hydrophobe decreases with increasing temperature , which is consistent with the increasing hydrophobicity that manifests itself in the increasing strength of the hydrophobic attraction . \n this temperature dependence of the solubility , too , is found here to persist in the two- and three - dimensional models . \n it is also found , as in the one - dimensional model , that if the energy of interaction of the hydrophobic solute with its solvent neighbors ( earlier called @xmath9 ) is greater than the magnitude @xmath10 of the favorable energy of solvent alignment , then the solubility , after first decreasing with increasing temperature , reaches a minimum and then increases . \n the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model are defined in the following section . \n also in section [ sec : models ] are the basic formulas that relate the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force and the solubility to the quantities that are measured in the simulations . \n the details of the simulations are in section [ sec : simulation ] , where the results are also displayed . \n these are discussed and summarized in the concluding section [ sec : summary ] . \n the two - dimensional model is pictured in fig . \n 1 . at each site of a square lattice \n there is a solvent molecule that may be in any of a large number , @xmath2 , of different states ( orientations ) . \n solute molecules may only be accommodated at the interstitial sites between neighboring pairs of solvent molecules , but only if that site is not already occupied and then only if the two solvent molecules in question are both in a special one of the @xmath2 states , called state 1 in what follows . \n the figure shows three solute molecules so accommodated . \n the three - dimensional model is defined similarly , and also on a lattice of coordination number 4 , as in two dimensions . \n this three - dimensional lattice is pictured in fig . \n it is obtained by systematically removing two bonds from each vertex of a simple cubic lattice , in such a way that from each site @xmath11 there remains a bond to the neighboring sites at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as well as to those at @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 is even but to those at @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead if @xmath16 is odd . \n the lattice is topologically ( not metrically ) equivalent to the tetrahedral diamond lattice , which is also the lattice of oxygen atoms in the metastable phase of ice called ice i@xmath19 .    in \n both the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model only neighboring solvent molecules interact with each other , which they do with energy @xmath20 if both are in the special state 1 and with energy @xmath21 otherwise . \n the only solvent molecules with which a solute molecule interacts are its immediate neighbors ; the sum of its energies of interaction with them is @xmath9 .    solute molecules may interact with each other but that is irrelevant here ; the solute - solute interaction does not enter the expression for the _ solvent - mediated part _ of the potential of mean force between pairs of solutes in the infinitely dilute solution  @xcite , nor is it relevant for the solubility of the solute , which is so slight that solute - solute interactions are negligible . \n the solute - solvent interaction parameter @xmath9 is also absent from the expression for the potential of mean force in the infinitely dilute solution but it is a significant parameter in the solubility.@xcite    because the coordination number of the lattices considered here is 4 , rather than 2 as in one dimension , the values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 required to model the hydrophobic effect conveniently but still realistically over the temperature range 275 - 375k are both much smaller than in one dimension . here , in both the two- and three - dimensional models , \n they are taken to be @xmath22k instead of 3000k and @xmath23 instead of 110,000 . \n it is still the case , as in the one - dimensional model , that @xmath5 over the relevant temperature range , and that the extent to which @xmath24 exceeds @xmath3 increases with increasing temperature  which are the respective conditions required for the hydrophobic effect to manifest itself and to do so with increasing strength as the temperature increases . \n let @xmath25 be the probability that in the pure solvent both molecules of a given neighboring pair will be found in the special state 1 ; and let @xmath26 be the probability that the molecules at two such pairs of sites will all be found to be in the special state 1 when the corresponding two interstitial sites , one associated with each pair , are separated by the metrical distance @xmath27 ( measured in units of the lattice spacing ) . in the two - dimensional lattice of fig . \n 1 the values of @xmath27 that occur are @xmath28 ; etc . in the three - dimensional lattice of fig . \n 2 the values of @xmath27 that occur are those and also @xmath29 , etc . \n let @xmath30 be the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force between two solute molecules a distance @xmath27 apart , in the limit of infinite dilution . \n this is the potential of mean force from which the direct interaction between the two solute molecules themselves has been subtracted , and is the part of the mean - force potential that is of interest here . \n then , as in the one - dimensional model,@xcite @xmath30 is given in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath31 . \n \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 are what are determined in the simulations and @xmath30 is then obtained from ( 1 ) . \n it is a property of the solvent alone , and so depends only on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 but not on @xmath9 . \n the solubility is defined as in the earlier one - dimensional model.@xcite one imagines a hypothetical ideal gas of pure solute , of number density @xmath32 , in osmotic equilibrium with the saturated solution ; _ i.e. _ , having a thermodynamic activity equal to that of the solute in the solution . \n then if @xmath33 is the number density of the solute in the solution , the solubility @xmath34 is here defined as the dimensionless ratio @xmath35 if the solubility is low so that the saturated solution is very dilute , this @xmath34 is the ostwald absorption coefficient and is given by@xcite @xmath36 thus , @xmath34 is obtained once @xmath25 is calculated and a value of the solute - solvent interaction energy @xmath9 is specified . \n properties of the two- and three - dimensional models presented in the previous section are explored by means of monte carlo simulations . in these simulations , \n one solvent molecule is placed on each lattice site . for each molecule , we keep track of whether its state is the special state 1 , or not . \n solute molecules are not present in the monte carlo simulations , since the aim of the simulations is to numerically estimate the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , from which the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force can be computed using ( [ eq : w ] ) \n .    the dynamics of the models are not specified , and we are therefore free to choose any dynamics that yield the correct equilibrium properties . in our monte carlo simulations , \n the dynamics consist of two processes : 1 ) each solvent molecule that is in its special state 1 leaves this special state with a rate of @xmath37 per time unit ; 2 ) each solvent molecule that is in a different state enters its special state with a rate of @xmath38 per time unit , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites that are occupied with a solvent molecule in its special state . \n an efficient implementation of these dynamics is obtained with a bkl - scheme , after bortz , kalos and lebowitz  @xcite . \n the simulations are performed on a @xmath41 lattice for the two - dimensional model , and a @xmath42 lattice for the three - dimensional model , both with periodic boundary conditions in order to reduce finite - size effects . in the initial configuration , \n no molecule is in its special state . \n this configuration is then thermalized for 0.1 time units . \n after thermalization , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are measured every @xmath43 time unit , up to a total time of @xmath44 time units , and averaged . in a simulation of this length and for these system sizes , \n the two - dimensional and three - dimensional model undergo roughly @xmath45 and @xmath46 local changes , respectively . \n this procedure is repeated 10 times for each of the temperatures @xmath4=275 , 300 , 325 , 350 , and 375k , and for the three - dimensional model also at a temperature of 250k at which the system is probably metastable , the stable regime being one where almost all atoms are in their special state . \n the values for the quantity @xmath25 are presented in table [ tab : p11 ] , for the two- and three - dimensional models . \n this quantity is decreasing with increasing temperature . \n the quantity @xmath25 is one of the two factors determining the solubility as defined in equation ( [ eq : solubility ] ) , the other being @xmath47 . \n while this latter factor is monotonically increasing with increasing temperature for @xmath48 , our data show that @xmath25 is monotonically decreasing with increasing temperature . \n for some choices of @xmath9 , the combination of these two factors leads to a solubility that is initially decreasing with increasing temperature ( a signature of the hydrophobic effect ) , but later increasing . \n the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force @xmath30 is plotted as a function of the distance @xmath27 in fig . 3 for the two - dimensional model , and in fig . 4 for the three - dimensional model \n . in the latter figure , \n the curve obtained at a temperature of 250k is dashed , to indicate its likely metastability . in agreement with the one - dimensional model , the strength of the hydrophobic interaction increases with increasing temperature , while its range decreases at the same time : an inverse relation is observed between the strength and range of the hydrophobic interaction , althoug less prominently in three dimensions than in one or two . unlike the one - dimensional model , the two- and three - dimensional models show oscillations in the mean force , reflecting the greater geometrical complexity of the lattice in higher dimensions . in that sense , the curves resemble more closely what is seen in models in which the solvent is modeled more realistically @xcite . \n in addition to the strong attraction at short distances , there is now also a local minimum in the potential of depth about @xmath0 at a distance of three lattice spacings in two dimensions and one of depth about @xmath1 at a distance of two lattice spacings in three dimensions . \n .the function @xmath25 as a function of temperature @xmath4 , for the two - dimensional ( second column ) and three - dimensional model ( third column ) . \n the numbers between brackets are the statistical uncertainties in the last reported digit , obtained from the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of independent simulations . [ \n cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : p11 ] \n a one - dimensional lattice model of hydrophobic attraction that was studied recently  @xcite is extended to two and three dimensions . \n monte carlo simulations have been used to determine the solvent - mediated contribution to the potential of mean force between hydrophobic solute molecules , and the solubility of the solute .    as in the one - dimensional model , an inverse relation \n is observed between the strength and range of the hydrophobic interaction . with increasing temperature , the strength of the hydrophobic interaction increases , while at the same time its range decreases , although the effect is less prominent in three dimensions than in two or one . unlike in the one - dimensional model , \n the force no longer varies monotonically with distance , but shows oscillations , reflecting the greater geometrical complexity of the lattice in the higher dimensions .    at low temperatures , \n the solubility of the solute is found to decrease with increasing temperature . \n this is another signature of the hydrophobic effect , and also agrees with what had been found in the one - dimensional model . \n bw is grateful to the institute of theoretical physics and to the debye institute of the university of utrecht for their hospitality in the fall of 1999 . \n his work at cornell was supported by the u.s . national science foundation and the cornell center for materials research . \n the authors thank m.d . \n zeidler for calling their attention to the work in reference 2 . \n permanent address : department of chemistry , baker laboratory , cornell university , ithaca , new york 14853 - 1301 , usa . \n kolomeisky and b. widom , faraday discuss . \n * 112 * ( 1999 ) 81 . \n hertz and m.d . \n zeidler , ber . \n phys . chem . \n * 68 * ( 1964 ) 821 . \n bortz , m.h . \n kalos and j.l . \n lebowitz , j. comp . \n * 17 * ( 1975 ) 10 . \n pratt and d. chandler , j. chem . \n * 67 * ( 1977 ) 3683 . \n paulaitis , s. garde and h.s . \n ashbaugh , curr . opin . \n colloid interface sci . \n * 1 * ( 1996 ) 376 .", "StartTimeOffset": 4492403022969, "RequestID": "6ab23bee204cea6153b46e616e3259c483a0f84f", "TotalTokens": 3753}

labels @xmath21 and @xmath22 as intermediate angular momenta of a particular binary coupling scheme for the @xmath23 incoming angular momenta .    this unitary representation , that we refer to as _ kaul representation _ \n , allows us to evaluate the wilson loop operator for an arbitrary link @xmath0 presented as the platting of a colored oriented braid @xmath24 . \n the braid is defined as a word written in the generators of the braid group @xmath25 of index @xmath26 . \n the link invariant is given by @xmath27 \\langle \\phi _ { \\left(\\textbf{0};\\textbf{0}\\right ) }   ^{\\bf{c'}}\\ , | w_b \\ , |\\phi _ \n { \\left(\\textbf{0};\\textbf{0}\\right ) } ^{\\textbf{c } } \\rangle \\ ; ,   \\label{expect}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 compactly denote the coloring of the link components . \n the state @xmath30 , in which the expectation value is evaluated , has all the internal quantum numbers equal to 0 . \n formula ( [ expect ] ) is a theorem , proved in @xcite . \n the link invariant defined in this way is the colored jones polynomial . \n in this section we show how to implement with a quantum circuit the kaul unitary representation of the braid group . \n we first describe a procedure to encode the basis states of the representation into a register of @xmath31 qubits , then we show how to realize efficiently in such representation the images of the braid group generators . \n basis states of our quantum system are labelled by the quantum numbers on the strands of the link and by internal quantum numbers corresponding to intermediate quantum angular momenta specifying the conformal block representation . \n each one of these quantum numbers belongs to the finite set @xmath32 ( due to the finite number of allowed primary fields for the relative conformal field theory ) and therefore a register of @xmath33 qubits is necessary for encoding for each one of them . \n the total number of qubits needed to encode for a basis vector is the product of the number of observables that specify a state times the number of qubits needed to specify a quantum number : @xmath34 , where @xmath26 is the index of the braid group . \n this quantity grows linearly in the index of the braid group . \n an ordering on the quantum register must also be chosen , such that it is possible to associate to each block of @xmath35 qubits a precise quantum number of the system . \n the ordering we choose is the one shown in figure [ [ register ] ] . \n [ register ]    the action of a unitary matrix on the encoding space @xmath36 is analogue to the action of the same matrix on the physical space in the following sense . \n if @xmath37 then @xmath38 the encoding space constitutes a new representation space for the quantum system .    using the kaul representation for the braid group , \n even - indexed elements of @xmath25 are mapped to unitary matrices which are diagonal in the representation space , while odd - indexed elements of @xmath25 are mapped to unitary matrices constructed with duality matrices . \n each duality matrix , in turn , can be decomposed in a sequence of elementary duality matrices , that correspond to @xmath39 recoupling transformations , using the following relation @xmath40   = \\\\ \n \\nonumber   & \\ , & = \\sum_{t_1,t_2, ... ,t_{m-2 } } \\prod_{i=1}^{m-2 } \\left ( a_{p_i}^{t_i } \\left [   \\begin{tabular}{cc } $ r_{i-1}$ & $ j_{2i+1}$ \\\\ \n $ j_{2i+2}$ & $ r_i$ \\\\ \n \\end{tabular }   \\right ] a_{t_i}^{s_{i-1 } } \\left [   \\begin{tabular}{cc } $ t_{i-1}$ & $ q_{i}$ \\\\ \n $ s_{i}$ & $ j_{2m}$ \\\\ \n \\end{tabular }   \\right ]   \\right ) \\times \\\\ \\nonumber   & \\ , & \\times \\prod_{l=0}^{m-2 } a_{r_l}^{q_{l+1 } } \\left [   \\begin{tabular}{cc } $ t_{l}$ & $ j_{2l+2}$ \\\\ \n $ j_{2l+3}$ & $ t_{l+1}$ \\\\ \n \\end{tabular }   \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above decomposition allows us to build a quantum circuit that results to be crucial for the algorithm . \n in order to have a relatively simple example of graphical realization of the decomposition one can compare fig.[[6point ] ] and the corresponding quantum circuit in fig.[4 ] . \n [ 6point ]        [ circuit ]    the above decomposition corresponds to a path on the @xmath1-deformed spin network simulator . \n each element of a @xmath39 gate can be efficiently evaluated by a classical machine . since a @xmath39 gate acts always on a @xmath41-qubits register \n , it can be efficiently compiled with a set of universal matrices @xcite . \n increasing the size of the input will result in an increasing number of @xmath39 gates in the decomposition of the @xmath10 gate , but each @xmath39 gate will always be @xmath42-dimensional . \n a careful examination of the graphical realization of the above decomposition allows then us to estimate the increase rate , with respect to the input size , of the number of @xmath39 gates . \n the dependence on @xmath26 , index of the braid group , of @xmath43 , number of @xmath39 gates , is given by @xmath44 . \n the above considerations prove that it is possible to efficiently compile kaul s unitary representation of the colored braid groupoid . in order to prove the efficiency of the quantum algorithm for the approximation of the colored jones polynomial we shall resort now to the standard procedure to access information on a quantum system by a series of measurements .      in this subsection \n we give a polynomial - time quantum algorithm which approximates the value of the colored jones polynomial of a link obtained as the plat closure of a braid . \n the same algorithm admits also a realization which holds for links obtained as standard closure of braids . \n the notion of approximation used in this context was formalized by @xcite . adopting the terminology of @xcite by * additive approximation * \n we mean the following : given a normalized function @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes an instance in the selected coding , we have an additive approximation of its value for each instance @xmath46 if we can associate to it a random variable @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for any @xmath49 . the time needed to achieve the approximation must be polynomial in the size of the problem and in @xmath50 . \n the normalization adopted for the colored jones polynomial of a link is provided by the product , over all the component knots , of the quantum dimension of the knots . by _ coloring _ we mean the set of possibly different irreps of @xmath14 labeling the component knots of a link . \n the problem we are interested in can now be stated as follow . \n * problem : approximate colored jones . \n * given a colored braid @xmath51 of length @xmath52 , a coloring @xmath53 , a positive integer @xmath4 and @xmath54 , we want to sample from a random variable @xmath55 which is an additive approximation of the absolute value of the colored jones polynomial of the plat closure , evaluated at @xmath56 , such that the following condition holds true @xmath57 in the following we hall provide an efficient quantum algorithm to * approximate colored jones * , which solves the problem in @xmath58 steps .    as in @xcite \n we need the following two lemmas in order to prove the efficiency of the algorithm . \n * lemma 1 . * given a quantum circuit @xmath59 of length @xmath60 , acting on @xmath31 qubits , and given a pure state @xmath61 which can be prepared in time @xmath60 , then it is possible to sample in @xmath60 time from two random variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which can assume only the values + 1 or -1 , in such a way that @xmath64 . \n * lemma 2 . \n * given a set of random variables @xmath65 such that @xmath66 then @xmath67    the first lemma can be easily proved with linear algebra arguments @xcite . \n the second lemma is a modified version of the well known chernoff bound . \n we can conclude now that the qubit model for the kaul representation can be used to efficiently compile a unitary representation of the colored braid group , and a sampling procedure can then be used to efficiently access the value of the colored jones polynomial . \n the circuit that realizes all these steps is schematized in fig.[[algo ] ] . \n the sampling lemma tells us that a series of measurements of @xmath68 on the first qubit will provide the value for @xmath69 , while a series of measurements of @xmath70 on the first qubit will provide the value for @xmath71 . \n we have provided a quantum algorithm that efficiently approximates the colored jones polynomial . \n the construction is based on the exact solution of chern - simons tqft and its connection to wzw conformal filed theory . \n we showed elsewhere @xcite that the colored jones polynomial can be seen as the expectation value of the evolution of the @xmath1-deformed spin - network quantum automaton . \n a quantum circuit capable of evaluating this probability amplitude , given as input a braid word , will also approximate the evolution of the automaton . \n since the automaton processes efficiently each braid word , if the quantum circuit efficiently simulates the automaton then it will also provide an efficient approximation of the colored jones polynomial . \n the evaluation of the invariant is equivalent to the evaluation of the expectation value for some unitary operators . \n it has been proved that using the hadamard trick it is possible to efficiently approximate this expectation value , once an efficient decomposition of the operator has been found and if the initial state of the system is efficiently obtainable . \n the present work satisfies all the above requirements . \n a more detailed exposition will be given in forthcoming papers . \n s. garnerone , a. marzuoli , m. rasetti , _ quantum automata , braid group and link polynomials _ \n , arxiv : quant -

{"ContextTokens": 3831, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "jupiter s moon europa likely possesses a global subsurface salty ocean @xcite . \n although we can not currently directly measure the ocean composition , if the ocean is in communication with the surface then evaporites may be present on the surface where their composition is accessible to remote sensing . \n knowledge of the surface composition therefore plays an important role in ascertaining whether , and to what extent , the subsurface ocean communicates with the surface , and , if the ocean is in communication with the surface , then the surface composition should also provide information about composition of the internal ocean . \n the near infrared mapping spectrometer ( nims ) , carried by the galileo spacecraft @xcite , obtained spectra of europa s surface from 0.7 to 5.2 @xmath0 m and found evidence for the spectral signatures of abundant non - water ice material . \n these spectral signatures were initially interpreted as indicative of the presence of hydrated salts , such as hexahydrite ( mgso@xmath16h@xmath2o ) and epsomite ( mgso@xmath17h@xmath2o ) , assumed to originate from a subsurface ocean @xcite , but it was later shown that hydrated sulfuric acid ( h@xmath2so@xmath1n - h@xmath2o ) , an expected product of europa s irradiation , could also account for the spectral signatures @xcite . \n the presence of other sulfur species ( so@xmath2 and sulfur allotropes ) detected on the surface , primarily on the heavily bombarded trailing hemisphere @xcite indicates that chemistry driven by sulfur ions from io affects the chemical composition of the surface . \n however , unambiguous interpretation of the nims spectra is not possible due to their relatively low resolution , which precludes the presence of distinct spectral features that would uniquely identify surface constituents @xcite . the relative contribution , if any , of evaporites from the subsurface ocean and the composition of those evaporites is still unknown .    the atmosphere of europa results primarily from sputtering of the surface by energetic particles from the jovian magnetosphere . \n the composition of the atmosphere strongly reflects the composition of the surface ; examination of europa s atmosphere can be used to investigate its surface . \n since the surface is dominated by water ice , the principal constituents of europa s atmosphere are water and its products ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n the atmosphere also contains traces of other elements ; both sodium and potassium have been detected in europa s atmosphere @xcite . while the detection of sodium and potassium could indicate the presence of salts on europa s surface , it is also possible that they are simply contaminants carried from io @xcite . \n the sodium - to - potassium ratio at europa is higher than that at io contrary to the expectation from simple contamination @xcite . \n however , as @xcite point out that the details of implantation and sputtering are sufficiently uncertain that the ratio difference is not a definitive test .    in more recent spectral models of nims data \n magnesium sulfates dominate much of the non - water ice component of the surface @xcite . \n such an enrichment of magnesium on the surface should result in a corresponding enrichment in the sputtered atmosphere of europa . \n here we use archival spectra from the hubble space telescope telescope faint object spectrograph ( hst - fos ) to search for the signature of the strong 2852  resonant scattering emission line of magnesium in europa s atmosphere . comparison with known abundances of sodium and potassium in the atmosphere allows us to place constraints on the presence of magnesium on the surface of europa . \n the hubble space telescope observed europa on 4 july 1994 and 29 july 1994 using the faint object spectrograph . \n the data include two 35 second spectra centered on europa , five 924 second spectra offset 8.8 europa radii ( r@xmath3 ) south of europa and three 1100 second spectra offset 14.4 r@xmath3 south of europa . \n the spectra were obtained using the blue detector and the a1 aperture , which is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 sr ) . \n fos was operated in the image mode using the g270h grating . \n the spectra cover 2200 to 3200  , which includes the magnesium emission line at 2852  . \n table 1 contains details of the observations .    due to problems with the data headers , \n the archival data are not correctly processed by the space telescope science institute s automated calibration pipeline poa calfos . \n we instead process the data manually using the provided post operational archive calibration files . \n we convert the raw count rate of the spectrograph , in counts s@xmath6 diode@xmath6 , to the standard units of ergs @xmath7 s@xmath6 @xmath6 by first correcting for diode - to - diode sensitivity variations by multiplying by the flatfield response file and then multiplying by the inverse sensitivity curves . \n no attempt is made at background subtraction , as we fit and remove scattered light and background in our subsequent analysis . \n we confirmed our manual reduction routines by performing the same procedures on data that was processed with poa calfos . \n figure 1 shows the spectrum centered on europa and the spectra at the two offset positions . \n the spectra at both offset positions , while orders of magnitude fainter than that of europa , are dominated by scattered light from europa . visual inspection of the raw fos spectra does not reveal any emission features from europa s atmosphere . as can be seen from figure 1 \n , the scattered light fills the aperture more fully than the 0.87 arcsecond diameter europa , and spectral lines are thus broader . depending on the spatial structure of the scattered light \n , there is also a chance that the scattered light would appear shifted in wavelength compared to the europa spectrum . \n finally , the possibility exists of stray light scattered in the spectrograph . to account for these factors , \n we fit each scattered light spectrum with a broadened , shifted , scaled spectrum of europa with a constant background added . \n we perform a @xmath8 minimization to find the best fit which minimizes the residuals between 2600 and 3000   while excluding the region within 20   of the expected 2852   resonant scattering line . \n figure 2 shows the spectra at the offset locations before and after subtraction of scattered light . \n the subtracted spectra are generally excellent in most regions , but do show some uncorrected systematic variations . \n atmospheric emission from europa will fill the fos aperture , causing the monochromatic emission line to spread over the full 12 diode width of the a1 aperture , which corresponds to a line width of @xmath924  . \n to better see such a broad emission line , we bin the data to 12   per pixel . a line filling the aperture will thus have a 2 pixel width in the binned spectrum . \n figure 3 shows the binned spectra at the two offset positions . \n no emission at the 2852   location of the resonant scattering line of magnesium can be seen . \n because of the uncorrected systematic errors in the subtraction , we can not compute a statistically rigorous upper limit to the presence of an emission line , but we instead simply add artificial emission at 2852   until it reaches a point where we would confidently declare a detection . \n this modeled lines that would be detectable are shown in figure 3 . our upper limits to monochromatic emission at 2852   in the offset spectra are @xmath10 erg cm@xmath6 s@xmath6 at 8.8 r@xmath3 and @xmath12 erg cm@xmath6 s@xmath6 at 14.4 r@xmath3 , or an emission strength of 40 r at 8.8 r@xmath3 and 16 r at 14.4 r@xmath3 ( 1 rayleigh ( r ) = 10@xmath13 photons @xmath7 sec@xmath6 sr@xmath6 ) . \n we converted the intensity upper limits to upper limits on the magnesium column density using a photon scattering coefficient ( _ g _ ) of 1.8 @xmath14 10@xmath15 photon s@xmath6 atom@xmath6 . \n the _ _ g-__value was calculated using the method described in @xcite using magnesium oscillator strengths from @xcite and solar flux from @xcite doppler shifted to account for europa s heliocentric velocity at the time of the observations ( see table 1 ) . \n these intensity limits imply upper limits for the magnesium column density of @xmath16 @xmath7 at 8.8 r@xmath3 and @xmath17 @xmath7 at 14.4 r@xmath3 . \n we searched archival hst - fos spectra of europa s atmosphere for the 2852   magnesium emission feature . \n we were unable to detect magnesium and , instead , derive upper limits of @xmath16 @xmath7 at 8.8 r@xmath3 and @xmath17 @xmath7 at 14.4 r@xmath3 on the column abundance of magnesium . \n comparison with the sodium and potassium column abundances measured by @xcite yields upper limits to the magnesium to sodium ratio of @xmath910 at 8.8 r@xmath3 and @xmath97 at 14.4 r@xmath3 and upper limits to the magnesium to potassium ratio of @xmath9280 at 8.8 r@xmath3 and @xmath9224 at 14.4 r@xmath3 ( see table 2 ) . \n the meteoritic ( ci chondrites ) and cosmic mg / na are 19 and 18 respectively @xcite thus it appears that europa s atmospheric mg / na is at least a factor of 2 lower than meteoritic and cosmic abundances . \n the upper limit on mg / k in europa s atmosphere is also less than cosmic .    the lower than cosmic abundance of magnesium in europa s atmosphere has two possible explanations , either magnesium is not present in surface concentrations sufficient to result in a detection in europa s atmosphere or magnesium is abundant on the surface but is being sputtered into europa s atmosphere at a lower rate than sodium and potassium . \n recent models of spectra of europa s surface generally include magnesium and sodium sulfate salts ( such as hexahydrite ( mgso@xmath16h@xmath2o ) , mirabilite na@xmath2so@xmath110h@xmath2o , and bloedite na@xmath2mg(so@xmath18)@xmath194h@xmath2o ) in mg / na ratios that are lower than our calculated upper limits for europa s atmosphere @xcite . models of europa s ocean result in high concentrations of both magnesium and sodium with a mg / na ratio that is approximately half of our calculated upper limit @xcite .    however , it is also possible that a significant amount of magnesium is present on europa s surface but it is not being sputtered into the atmosphere . although magnesium has recently been detected in the atmosphere of mercury @xcite , it has not been detected in the sputtered atmospheres of the moon @xcite and io @xcite . \n the mg / na and mg / k ratios for the exospheres of mercury and the moon are shown in table 2 . \n since the abundance of magnesium in the lunar regolith is known , it is possible to model the magnesium abundance in an atmosphere created by sputtering . \n based on a stoichiometric atmosphere model @xcite , @xcite find that the magnesium in the lunar atmosphere is depleted by at least factor of 10 based on the known lunar surface composition . \n the discrepancy between the known abundances of magnesium on the lunar surface and the inability to detect magnesium in the lunar atmosphere has yet to be explained . \n although magnesium s presence in the atmosphere of mercury is not surprising given that magnesium bearing minerals exist on the surface , the relative abundance and distribution of magnesium compared to sodium and calcium indicate that sputtering processes may be different for different minerals or atoms @xcite . \n the lunar and mercurian examples suggest that magnesium may sputter less efficiently than sodium and potassium , a property that has been demonstrated experimentally for some europa relevant salts ; sodium and potassium sulfates are more easily sputtered than magnesium sulfates @xcite . \n this difference in sputtering efficiency could result in an enhancement of magnesium salts on the surface relative to potassium and sodium salts and a corresponding depletion in magnesium relative to potassium and sodium in europa s atmosphere . \n although the sodium in europa s atmosphere is mostly endogenic @xcite , it is possible that iogenic sodium implanted on europa s surface could also affect the ratio . \n the upper limit we have calculated on the mg / na ratio in europa s atmosphere is lower than ratio in ci chondrites by at least a factor of two , which suggests that the trace elements observed in europa s atmosphere are not meteoritic in origin , assuming similar sputtering efficiencies . \n however , for the upper limit on the magnesium abundance to provide a stronger constraint on the surface composition , and its origin , more stringent upper limits from future observations are required . \n this work was initially supported by a summer undergraduate research fellowship from the california institute of technology funded by a trust

{"ContextTokens": 3855, "GeneratedTokens": 182, "SynthesizedBody": "enormous amount of information produced by everyone in their everyday life is characteristic of our modern society . in recent years , there has been a significant change in the pattern of how information is exchanged . \n previously information was largely produced by few big entities ( e.g. news sites , entertainment organizations , etc . ) and downloaded by individuals . \n more recently , individual users have been transformed into hubs themselves and are now a large source of information ; an always - connected entity . \n this changes the structure of the network and increases traffic demands . \n additionally new services , in particular video streaming , put an increasing load on today s infrastructure , thus taking it to its limits and forcing us to find a solution to expand the throughput capacity and meet the increasing demand . a large fraction of this load is carried by optical fiber networks , which form the backbone of the internet and other communication networks . as technology \n approaches the physical limits of single mode fiber and the capacity reaches its practical limits of the order of @xmath0tbit / s , a capacity crunch is imminent  @xcite . \n a candidate technology to avoid such a scenario and to keep up the trend of roughly ten - fold increase in capacity every four years , is space division multiplexing ( sdm )  @xcite . \n sdm utilizes space as the final remaining degree of freedom , by tightly packing several spatial channels into a single fiber . \n this can be done using multiple cores in multicore fibers ( mcf ) or multiple modes in multimode fibers ( mmf ) . in mmf , \n orthogonal modes are coupled due to fiber imperfections or twisting and bending . \n crosstalk between modes can not be avoided in long - haul transmission . in mcf , \n crosstalk levels can be kept sufficiently low to be negligible only for moderate number of cores . \n however , it may be beneficial to deliberately introduce crosstalk , as it gives rise to supermodes with higher effective mode area . \n this implies a reduced impact of nonlinear impairments and enables higher channel densities .. such fibers also exhibit a sublinear scaling of mode group dispersion with distance  @xcite . \n mode scrambling is also introduced by certain types of nearly lossless multiplexers , so - called photonic lanterns  @xcite . \n figure  [ xtalk ] illustrates crosstalk in optical fiber .    in all these cases \n the original signals have to be disentangled at the receiver . \n due to similarities with the wireless channel , the mimo technique has been considered for this purpose . \n however , the two channels also exhibit fundamental differences . \n for example , the optical channel does not suffer from information loss due to the absence of diffuse scattering . \n backscattering is also negligible . due to the low in - fiber power loss , the channel matrix is still unitary , albeit with complex random elements , and the channel matrix is then a gue ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) with dyson index @xmath1 . \n previously  @xcite , we considered the outage capacity of the fiber optical mimo channel in the limit of full subchannel mixing and in the absence of mode dependent loss ( mdl ) . in this paper , we move towards a more realistic model of the optical mimo channel by establishing its analogy with a model from mesoscopic physics : the chaotic cavity  @xcite . \n this model is amenable to a random matrix theory analysis and can interpolate from zero to strong mixing between subchannels and includes mdl . to showcase its validity \n we compute the channel s mutual information via a saddle point analysis . \n we give the channel description in section  ii . in section  iii and section \n iv we present the mathematical analysis according to random matrix and replica theory and provide our numerical results . finally , in section  v we conclude . \n we use upper case letters in bold font to denote matrices , @xmath2 , with entries given by @xmath3 . \n the superscript @xmath4 denotes the transpose operation , @xmath5 denotes the conjugate transpose and @xmath6 represents the @xmath7-dimensional identity matrix \n .      we deal with integrals over real matrix elements . \n we integrate over the elements of an @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 . the corresponding integral measure is denoted by @xmath10 \n the optical fiber may be viewed as a cavity where optical power may enter and exit from both ends . \n the output power @xmath11 is related to the input power @xmath12 through @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ xtalk ] ) with the @xmath14 scattering matrix @xmath15    @xmath16    the @xmath17 and @xmath18 submatrices correspond to the reflected and transmitted signals , respectively . \n in contrast to a general cavity , backscattering in the fiber is negligible . \n thus we have @xmath19 . \n in addition , @xmath20 because the two fiber ends are not distinguishable , therefore a signal entering from the left and propagating to the right experiences the same phenomena as a signal entering from the right end and propagates to the left . \n the fiber exhibits random distributed crosstalk between modes or cores . \n we assume this mixing to be random over different frequency bands , due to strong delay spread . \n the situation is analogous to that of a chaotic cavity , which randomly mixes the cavity states . \n the analytic expression of the @xmath21 scattering matrix for a chaotic cavity reads  @xcite : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the @xmath24 channel hamiltonian and @xmath25 is a @xmath26 matrix containing the coupling constants of the fiber to the outside world . \n the dimension is @xmath24 as there are @xmath7 incoming states from the left and @xmath7 incoming states from the right , while inside the fiber there are @xmath7 states propagating from left to right and @xmath7 states propagating from right to left . \n so in case of perfect ( lossless ) leads , @xmath27 . \n the channel hamiltonian is @xmath28 the offdiagonal sub -

mean gaussian . \n the maximum of the mutual information over the input distribution yields the capacity of the channel . \n the capacity is the maximum error - free information transmission rate when the channel matrix @xmath45 varies through its whole distribution @xmath51 . \n we assume @xmath45 to be gaussian distributed . \n the @xmath52 matrix @xmath45 is a sub -

of - sight component inside the fiber while the gaussian distributed matrix @xmath61 describes the crosstalk . \n in the previous sections we introduces the channel . \n next , we will showcase the behavior of the mutual information and we will derive our results . \n we start from the mutual information eq .   of an optical mimo channel . by introducing eq .   to eq . \n we obtain @xmath65- \\nonumber\\\\ -\\log\\mbox{det}\\left[(\\mathbf{h}_0+\\gamma\\mathbf{g})^2+\\mathbf{\\gamma}^2\\right]\\bigg\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\      = \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\mathcal{i}_1 -

helpful @xmath118 matrices @xmath119 , @xmath120 matrices @xmath121 and @xmath122 matrices @xmath123 and following the diagonalizing method we end up to matrix @xmath124 which can be seen in appendix  [ amatrix ] .    at the saddle \n point the cross - terms @xmath125 etc are equal to zero . \n so @xmath124 becomes a block - diagonal matrix and the evaluation of the determinant ( identity  [ iden:1 ] ) is just the multiplication of these 2 blocks . \n the rest of the calculations for the computation of the covariance is straightforward and the hessian matrix for the covariance can be seen in appendix  [ hessian_cov_matrix ] . \n so finally the variance is    @xmath126 \n in order to check our analytical results we have numerically computed mutual information and its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) . \n the results are shown in figs . \n [ fig : cdf ] and  [ fig : capacity ] . \n we compare the gaussian distribution @xmath127 evaluated using the analytical calculations in this paper with results obtained by averaging over a large number of random matrix realizations for @xmath128 . \n remarkably , we find that in both cases , the discrepancy between the different curves is small . \n this shows that our analytical results are valid even for the practical relevant case of small number of modes or cores @xmath7 . \n in this paper we have introduced a novel channel model for the optical mimo channel by relating it to a chaotic cavity . \n this new modeling approach captures the fundamental properties of the optical mimo channel . using tools from random matrix theory and a saddle point analysis , \n we have shown that in the limit of large @xmath7 , the distribution of the mutual information approaches a gaussian . \n numerically we find that this method is valid even for low @xmath7 . \n this analytic method gives us the means to analyze the statistics of throughput in the fiber optical mimo channel in the presence of arbitrary level of crosstalk and mdl . \n the introduced channel model is also amenable to extensions , such as dispersion and nonlinear effects in deterministic and random part respectively . \n the proofs for the next identities , can be found in @xcite . \n [ ids ]    [ iden:1 ] let @xmath129 be a hermitian , positive , definite square matrix @xmath130 and @xmath9 a complex @xmath131 matrix , then @xmath132    [ iden:2 ] let , @xmath133 be @xmath131 complex matrices , then @xmath134    [ iden:3 ] let , @xmath135 be arbitrary complex @xmath136 matrices , where @xmath80 here is assumed to be an arbitrary positive integer . \n then , @xmath137 \n @xmath138 where @xmath139 . \n where @xmath141\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left [ ( \\gamma^2 + \\gamma t_2)(\\mathbf{i } + \\gamma r_2)+(\\mathbf{h}_0 -

{"ContextTokens": 3373, "GeneratedTokens": 107, "SynthesizedBody": "unlike its common perception , a vacuum is surprisingly strange and mysterious . \n although the name implies emptiness or nothingness , the reality is quite different . before the twentieth century , in order to come up with an explanation of the mysterious nature of light , a vacuum was often thought to be filled with aether that acted as a medium for the light wave . \n after einstein formulated special relativity without requiring aether , the idea of an aether - filled vacuum faded away . \n however , with the development of quantum theory , it soon became evident that even vacuums contain non - zero energy . \n this quantum effect became problematic again with physics at the cosmological scale . \n while the cosmological constant from observation yielded a value close to zero , the theoretical computation yielded a huge discrepancy @xcite .    in this paper , we wish to argue that this discrepancy may have resulted from the error of looking at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level . for centuries , science has been studied based on causality . \n that is , for a given result , there is a corresponding cause . \n this method of revealing an objective pattern in natural phenomenon began to shatter with the development of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the twentieth century . indeed , rather than the objective description for a given physical system , quantum theory started to describe the subjective relation between the observer and the object being observed .    in @xcite , it was noticed that this subjective description , which was often considered an incomplete aspect of a full description @xcite , may correspond to not only the limit of scientific knowledge but to existence itself . by considering the observable in quantum theory as the reference frame of the observing party \n , it was discussed that the two - picture formulation of quantum theory no longer correctly described self - observing consciousness . \n moreover , it was argued that this contradiction could be solved by changing the way we look at the structure of the universe at the fundamental level . \n that is , the observer and the object being observed ( i.e. , the universe ) , are inseparable . \n number of irreversible computations , fills up the universe @xcite . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    in @xcite , motivated by the black hole information problem @xcite , a more specific description of what it means for the observer and the universe to be inseparable has been provided . in particular , it was argued that the two - system measurement protocol , which places the observing party on the same footing as the object being observed objectively , could be made equivalent to the single - system copenhagen measurement protocol , which treats the observing party with a special status . in @xcite , \n the argument with black hole case was extended to the cosmological model . \n in particular , the nature of negative sea was discussed in more detail by identifying it as the time reversal of the irreversible computation since the big bang . in this paper \n , we wish to discuss the difference between the theory and experiment in the context of the previously proposed universe model with negative sea , or the aether @xcite , filling up the universe . \n when the general theory of relativity was first published in 1915 , the universe was known to not be expanding or shrinking , at least in the cosmological scale . \n indeed , in order to come up with a static model of the universe , einstein originally introduced an additional constant term , @xmath3 , in his field equation . \n based on the assumption that the universe is isotropic , meaning it looks symmetric rotationally , and homogeneous , meaning its density is roughly the same anywhere , the metric can be simplified greatly at a sufficiently large scale . from the metric \n , einstein s field equation yields a solution which was found by friedman . \n this then implies adding a new vacuum energy density to the universe with @xmath4 .     to @xmath5 ( i.e. , in time - forward manner ) \n , the classical vector @xmath6 chooses @xmath7 . in ( ii ) , the quantum vector @xmath8 evolves to equate itself with the classical vector from @xmath5 to @xmath9 . \n this cyclical process is equivalent to the self - observing consciousness discussed in @xcite . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    in 1998 , two research teams @xcite measured the cosmological parameters with the observation of a type ia supernova . \n surprisingly , it was found that the universe is accelerating in its expansion with non -

observation of consciousness . \n in particular , it was argued that one may consider the observable as the reference frame of the observer observing the given quantum system @xcite . \n another mysterious and highly debated subject was in regard to free will ( see @xcite ) . \n this is due to the newtonian deterministic worldview until the development of quantum theory . \n however , with randomness as an essential part of the theory , many suspected quantum theory may open the opportunity of free will . in fact \n , it has two seemingly contradictory aspects : first , the observer can freely choose ; second , the choice should be random and unpredictable .    , which therefore leads to the observation of the energy difference as seen in quantum theory . \n however , in the case of self - observing consciousness , the observer observes his or her own reference frame of @xmath0 as seen in ( ii ) . \n this is the case of vacuum observation . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    the statistical meaning of black hole entropy has been debated over the years @xcite , and the quantum memory model @xcite suggests that it corresponds in a number of ways to the observer s choice in measuring the black hole . \n it is interesting to note that free will associated with black hole entropy indeed has the dual aspect discussed above . \n that is , from the observer s subjective view , he or she is able to freely choose , yet its randomness comes from quantum probability .    in @xcite \n , it was further elaborated how free will may play an important role in building the model of the universe using nondeterministic computation . \n the nondeterministic computation chooses the acceptable path of computational process ( i.e. , the observer s choice ) , which is different from probabilistic computation @xcite . again , considering nondeterministic computation as free will fits the dual aspect discussed above . in computational complexity , \n it is known as the language accepted by the algorithm .    , from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical vector performs an irreversible computation with energy @xmath0 . from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum vector performs the computation with energy @xmath0 as well . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n it was discussed @xcite that , in the subjective model ( fig . \n [ diracsea ] ) , the entropy of the observable universe corresponds to a logarithm of possible choices the observer is able to choose . \n indeed , it was argued that among equally accessible microstates of the universe , existence corresponds to the observer s freely chosen will . \n therefore , the subjective model proposed in @xcite suggests that the observer s freely chosen will is actual existence , subjective reality , and it has the dual aspect of free will discussed earlier .    in order to discuss the difference between the observed and quantum vacuum energies , \n let us review cyclical time @xcite . \n unlike linear time as commonly used in physics , cyclical time evolves from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , @xmath5 to @xmath12 , etc . , and \n at certain @xmath13 , @xmath14 evolves back to @xmath9 . in @xcite , a cyclical model of consciousness with @xmath15 \n was introduced . as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] , two vectors are considered ; one is a quantum reference frame , or an observable , and the other is the corresponding classical vector . \n as discussed in @xcite , quantum vectors are defined in complex vector space , and the observation of these vectors takes place in classical space in terms of eigenvalues . \n therefore , the process of measurement involves the object of quantum vector and the corresponding classical vector , as well as the quantum and classical reference frames . in the case of self - observation , \n the object to be observed is the reference frame itself ; therefore , only quantum and classical reference frames are considered , as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] . \n initially , both vectors are pointing at @xmath16 in the bloch sphere notation . from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the classical reference frame points at @xmath7 ( fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( i ) ) . in the cyclical model , \n @xmath5 evolves back to @xmath9 , which is the case of quantum evolution ( fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) ) . \n the interpretation could be considered as while the physical ( or classical ) choice is made in a time - forward manner , being aware of the choice is done through the quantum process ( i.e. , the dirac - type negative sea of consciousness ) . \n it is noted that the presented cyclical model of consciousness incorporates both the classical and quantum aspects and places them on an equal footing .     in a time - forward manner . \n the cyclical model adopts small and large cycles of time . \n ( ii ) in one large cycle , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time all the way to the big bang with @xmath2 number of computations . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    let us now consider the cyclical process of consciousness in terms of energy . \n the unit of irreversible computation with dissipated energy , which will be called @xmath0 , was considered in @xcite . in @xcite \n , it was discussed that the degrees of freedom for reference frame ought to be the same as that of the state vectors . \n for example , if the outcome of a spin is up or down , the reference frame in measuring the spin is up or down as well . in a similar manner , in regard to the observation of energy states , the observer s reference frame is in one of the states as well . \n therefore , the observer observes only the relative difference ( fig . \n [ va ] ( i ) ) . \n however , in the case of consciousness , the observer is observing his or her own reference frame .    in the case of observing energy \n , the vacuum corresponds with the observer observing his or her own reference frame of the ground state energy ( fig . \n [ va ] ( ii ) ) . the observation of the vacuum energy as consciousness in cyclical time may be considered as follows : from @xmath9 to @xmath5 , the physical or classical irreversible computation is carried out with energy @xmath0 . \n next , the cyclical time evolution takes place , and , from @xmath5 to @xmath9 , the quantum process is carried with the energy of @xmath0 of negative sea ( fig . \n [ circle ] ) .    in @xcite , \n small and large cycles of time were discussed . in particular , it was discussed that time circulates in small and large cycles in such a way that small cycles of time make up a larger cycle . for example , small cycles of seconds make up a larger cycle of a minute , minutes make up an hour , etc . the cyclical model of consciousness , as in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] , may also be considered as a large cycle . as shown in fig . \n [ cyclical2 ] , while the classical vector chooses , i.e. , one unit of classical computation is carried out in the time forward manner , the quantum vector may evolve backward in time not only a single unit of computation as in fig . \n [ cyclical1 ] ( ii ) , but all the way back to big bang as seen in fig . \n [ diracsea ] with @xmath2 number of computations . \n the energy in the process of the classical computation should correspond to classical vacuum energy while the energy corresponding to the negative sea would be @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the number of computations since the big bang , which has been estimated in @xcite as , @xmath18    previously , it was often considered that the vacuum energy predicted from quantum theory may correspond to the observed value of the vacuum energy , which resulted in one of the largest discrepancies between the theory and experimental verification . \n however , as argued above and as a continuation of the specification of the subjective model , the energy calculated from quantum theory should correspond to the energy of the negative sea , or the aether , that fills up the universe as the conscious state of the observer ( fig .

the close multiples migrate inward from initially larger separations ( e.g. , offner et al . \n close multiples may also form by fragmentation of a massive disk via gravitational instability ( e.g. , adams et al . \n 1989 ) ; however , it is unknown if disks of sufficient mass and radius form in young protostellar systems .    thus far , sub / millimeter studies of class 0 protostars have not had the resolution to resolve the scale of disks and close multiples , and most samples have been small and/or biased . to make a substantial leap in our knowledge of both protostellar disks and multiplicity , we have conducted the vla nascent disk and multiplicity ( vandam ) survey toward all known protostars in the perseus molecular cloud . \n the survey was conducted in a and b configurations with the vla at 8 mm , 1 cm , 4 cm , and 6.4 cm , observed only in wide - band continuum and reaching a high spatial resolution of 0065 ( 15 au ) at 8 mm . \n we will focus only on the 8 mm and 1 cm results in this contribution . \n our sample is drawn primarily from the _ spitzer _  survey by enoch et al . \n ( 2009 ) as well as all known candidate first hydrostatic core objects and other deeply embedded sources . \n we have detected resolved structures that are consistent with protostellar disks toward 12/43 class 0 sources and 5/37 class i sources . \n examples of a few class 0 disk candidates are shown in figure 1 . \n some of the other candidates are further analyzed in segura - cox et al . \n ( submitted ) and the apparent circumbinary disk candidates are shown in tobin et al . \n ( submitted ) . of the candidates \n shown , they appear to have radii of 30 au or less . to determine if we are tracing the full extent of the disks at 8 mm , we examined both alma 870  data and vla 7 mm data toward the known class 0 disk around l1527 irs ( tobin et al . \n 2012 ) , shown in figure 2 . \n the 7 mm data from the vla have a resolution of @xmath0025 , but are convolved with the same restoring beam as the alma data ; the 7 mm data recover all the flux observed in the most compact vla configuration ( melis et al . \n the deconvolved sizes are 062 and 026 at 870  and 7 mm , respectively , demonstrating that this disk has a smaller apparent radius at 7 mm . \n we have further verified the more compact 7 mm emission using visibility amplitude profiles . \n thus , 8 mm disk sizes may be lower limits . \n the smaller extents at longer wavelengths have been seen toward more - evolved class ii objects ( prez et al . 2012 ) and this is interpreted as the inward radial drift of the dust grains due to aerodynamic drag ( weidenschilling 1977 ) . \n models of dust growth and migration by birnstiel et al . \n ( 2010 ) show that this effect may happen quickly enough to be apparent while still in the protostellar phase . \n we can not , however , rule - out grain growth alone in the inner disk being responsible for this effect . \n multi - wavelength modeling will be necessary to assess the difference in dust emission from short to long wavelengths . \n with the ability to resolve multiples down to separations of 15 au , the vandam survey represents a significant evolution in our knowledge of protostellar multiplicity . \n we show examples of a few multiples systems from the vandam survey in figure 3 . \n the companion of iras 2a , with a 142 au separation , was first discovered in the vandam survey and is the apparent driving source of the east - west outflow from the system ( tobin et al . \n the svs13a multiple was first detected by anglada et al . \n ( 2000 ) and iras 4a by looney et al . \n note that the brighter source in iras 4a ( 4a1 or se ) is well resolved at 8 mm , possibly tracing a massive inner envelope or disk . from the 8 mm data , we have also detected linear polarization of the dust emission toward iras 4a1 ( cox et al . \n 2015 ) , tracing an apparent toroidal magnetic field in this system . \n the full multiplicity results of the vandam survey are shown in tobin et al . \n ( submitted ) , where we observe a clear bi - modal distribution of companion separations ; one peak is at 75 au and another is at @xmath03000 au . \n the 75 au separation peak had not been previously detected due to limited resolution , and we suggest that the 75 au peak may result from disk fragmentation . \n the 3000 au separation peak may result from turbulent or jeans fragmentation . \n the key to the success of the vandam survey was in its unbiased nature and the superb sensitivity of the upgraded vla , obtaining as complete a characterization of protostellar disks and multiple systems as possible . \n 99 adams , f.  c. , ruden , s.  p. , & shu , f.  h.  1989 , _ apj _ , 347 , 959 allen , a. , li , z .- y . , & shu , f.  h.  2003 , _ apj _ , 599 , 363 anglada , g. , rodrguez , l.  f. , & torrelles , j.  m.  2000 , _ apjl _ , 542 , l123 birnstiel , t. , dullemond , c.  p. , & brauer , f.  2010 , _ a&a _ , 513 , a79 burkert , a. , & bodenheimer , p.  1993 , _ mnras _ , 264 , 798 chen , x. , arce , h.  g. , zhang , q. , et al .  2013 , _ apj _ , 768 , 110 cox , e.  g. , harris , r.  j. , looney , l.  w. , et al .  2015 , arxiv:1511.00685 enoch , m.  l. , evans , n.  j. , ii , sargent , a.  i. , & glenn , j.  2009 , _ apj _ , 692 , 973 offner , s.  s.  r. , kratter , k.  m. , matzner , c.  d. , et al .  2010 , _ \n apj _ , 725 , 1485 padoan , p. , nordlund ,  . , \n kritsuk , a.  g. , et al .  2007 , _ \n apj _ , 661 , 972 prez , l.  m. , carpenter , j.  m. , chandler , c.  j. , et al . \n 2012 , _ apjl _ , 760 , l17 tobin , j.  j. , hartmann , l. , chiang , h .- f . , et al . \n 2012 , _ nature _ , 492 , 83 tobin , j.  j. , dunham , m.  m. , looney , l.  w. , et al .  2015 , _ apj _ , 798 , 61 weidenschilling , s.  j.  1977 , _ mnras _ , 180 , 57", "StartTimeOffset": 4609738162623, "RequestID": "d39dd038d4e4bc7d14961cd507bba1fb8d163b63", "TotalTokens": 2114}

the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . \n on the other hand , the ns - ns binaries show relatively stable statistics ; the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in all of these binaries , the mean masses do not exceed @xmath10 , and one may conclude that most of ns masses lie in the range of @xmath11 , which can be regarded as a canonical range of ns masses . note that nss with larger masses have relatively larger measurement errors except for a few exceptions for the large ns masses , which were measured with high accuracy , e.g. , psr j1614 - 2230 , @xmath12 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 , @xmath13 @xcite .    by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation \n , one can see that the ns with large mass can have a high - density region in the core , providing a room for the existence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom such as hyperons , bose - einstein condensation , free quark phase and etc . \n these exotic states relieve the pressure exerted by the fermionic nature of nucleons , make the equation of state ( eos ) soft , and eventually reduce the mass of ns . among diverse possibilities , \n hyperons have been playing a key role in reducing the maximum mass of ns to the canonical range . \n however , recent observations of nss with @xmath12 and @xmath13 initiate a challenge to the existence of hyperons at the core of ns ( so called  hyperon puzzle \" ) .    in order to solve the hyperon puzzle , \n some studies based upon both relativistic and non - relativistic mean field ( rmf and nrmf , respectively ) models have been conducted so far . \n the modern version of these models shows great accuracy in reproducing the properties of known nuclei . \n however , the maximum mass of ns calculated with these models shows drastic fluctuations , ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 even without including any hyperon yet @xcite . \n main uncertainty comes from the extrapolation of models to the high density where no experimental data available . \n therefore , the measurement of the @xmath16 ns from psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 can rule out some of rmf or nrmf models that predict the maximum mass less than @xmath3 . \n when the effect of hyperons is included in the rmf models , the coupling constants of hyperons are fitted to the depth of hyperon - nucleus optical potentials at the nuclear saturation density in most of the rmf models . \n ( note that the hyperon - nucleus optical potentials are obtained from the single - strangeness hypernuclei . ) with this method , the rmf models show the similar effect of hyperons on ns mass regardless of the differences among various rmf models ; the mass of ns is depending on the background nuclear models @xcite . in order to solve the hyperon puzzle , some recent works introduced repulsive forces caused by the vector - meson exchange in the rmf models @xcite . in ref . \n @xcite , by assuming a hard core of hyperons , one of the authors ( chh ) obtained the maximum mass of ns close to @xmath3 . \n however , the parameterization used in these approaches is not directly compatible with hypernuclear data and relies partly on the theoretical arguments . \n dealing with the interactions between hyperons is in a worse situation because of statistically insufficient data from the double - hypernuclei experiments . in most cases , \n the coupling constants between hyperons are determined from the symmetry arguments . \n the coupling constants obtained in this manner show very minor effects on the mass of ns @xcite , so in many works the interactions between hyperons are justified to be omitted for simplicity . \n the purpose of this work is to explore the effect of the @xmath1 interactions on the eos and the resulting bulk properties of ns by employing a few skyrme - type models and a finite - range model that reproduce the empirical binding energies of the double-@xmath17 hypernuclei . for the nucleon and single-@xmath17 interactions and the nucleon - nucleon interactions \n , we also use the skyrme - type models that are consistent with the experimental data . \n we find that our results with these models turn out to be quite different from those of the rmf models , suggesting a possible solution to the hyperon puzzle . \n we find that some of our models both predict the maximum mass of @xmath3 and are in good agreement with the observationally - constrained mass - radius relation @xcite . \n we organize this paper as follows . \n ii explains the skyrme - type models for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interactions and the nucleon-@xmath17 ( @xmath0 ) interactions . \n as mentioned above , we use both the skyrme - type models and a finite - range force model for the @xmath1 interactions . sect . \n ii also contains some details of these models . sect . \n iii is devoted to the results about the properties of ns matter , and the consequent mass - radius relation of ns . \n we summarize our work and give some discussions in sect . \n we employ the standard skyrme - type forces for the @xmath18 interactions given in the form @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + t_2(1+x_2 p_\\sigma ) \\bm{k}'_{ij } \\cdot \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) \\bm{k}_{ij } + \\frac{1}{6 } t_3(1+x_3 \n p_\\sigma ) \\rho_n^\\epsilon ( \\bm{r } ) \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + i w_0 \\bm{k}'_{ij } \\cdot \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) ( \\bm{\\sigma}_i + \\bm{\\sigma}_j )   \\times \\bm{k}_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the spin exchange operator @xmath24 , and the nucleon density @xmath25 . \n we choose three models sly4 , ski4 , and sgi for the parameters of @xmath18 interactions . as shown in ref . \n @xcite , these models are in reasonable agreement with the mass - radius constraints of the observed ns presented in ref . \n the basic properties of the models are summarized in table [ tab : nnforce ] . \n we note that the models also satisfy the maximum mass constraints given by psr j1614 - 2230 or psr j0348 + 0432 . \n .nuclear matter properties and the maximum mass of ns calculated from the @xmath18 skyrme force models . \n @xmath26 : saturation density in unit of @xmath27 , @xmath28 : binding energy of the symmetric nuclear matter in unit of mev , @xmath29 : symmetry energy at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath30 : slope of the symmetry energy at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath31 : compression modulus of the symmetric matter at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath32 : ratio of the effective mass of the nucleon at the saturation density ( @xmath33 ) to the free mass of the nucleon ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 : maximum mass of ns in unit of the solar mass ( @xmath36 ) .

up perspective , as resulting from the interaction ( or likeness ) of individual characteristics @xcite . \n moreover , as the individual characterization might be driven by multiple aggregate concerns , the network approaches allow for simultaneously considering that multiplicity of individual aspects and the consequences of the aggregate structures themselves on the emergence of collective patterns . \n meanwhile , in the adoption of a network approach , one shall be aware that the choice of a given network representation is only one out of several other ways to look at a given set of elements . \n as connecting the elementary units of a system may be conceived in many different ways , that choice may depend strongly on the available empirical data and on the questions that a network analysis aims to address @xcite . \n the main question addressed in this paper is whether some relevant characteristics of research collaboration would emerge in networks where subjects are linked whenever they co - occur in a common paper . \n we hypothesized that gender imbalance in authorship of papers might influence the shape of those networks , allowing to uncover patterns from gender differences . \n if it happens , the emerging patterns may help to understand important characteristics of research collaboration , of the relationship among subjects and its relation to gender . \n the paper is organized as follows : next section presents the empirical data we work with and some preliminary statistical results . \n section 3 describes the network approach and the results from its application . \n section 4 concludes . \n the web of science ( wos ) is one of the major bibliometric databases ( together with google scholar and scopus ) and includes all scientific subjects . \n it comprises a total of 11,990 journals ( 8,778 from science and 3,212 from social sciences ) @xcite . \n concerning the scientific domain of economics , it includes 334 publications . \n the wos classifies each journal in one or more subjects ( or categories ) . \n taking as examples the journals * journal of informetrics * and * research policy * , the former is classified in `` computer science , interdisciplinary applications '' and `` information science & library science '' , while the latter is classified in `` management '' and `` planning & development '' .    from the original wos database a selection of articles was carried on adopting as criteria : articles published in wos indexed journals over the period 2010 -

@xcite-@xcite ) . \n regarding interdisciplinarity , our findings seem to contradict the hypothesis that women have more propensity to interdisciplinary research collaboration @xcite . \n moreover , we found that academic women in economics compared with their male counterparts reveal preference for the subjects environmental sciences , management and political sciences and that , conversely , the subjects social sciences , mathematics and finance display higher frequencies in papers either inclusively or exclusively authored by men . \n our main contribution relies in the adoption of a network approach allowing to uncover the emergence of a specific pattern when the network of scientific subjects is induced from a set of papers exclusively authored by men . \n such a male exclusive authorship condition is found to be the solely responsible for the emergence of that specific shape in the structure of the network . \n moving away from a _ star _ motif together with the loss of centrality of the subject management have an important bearing on the structure of the  male exclusive authorship network : when papers authorship includes just men , the larger distances between subjects in the network become even larger and this is mainly due to a decrease in the relative number of papers having management as a secondary subject . \n we find enough evidence that gender imbalance in scientific authorships brings a peculiar trait to the networks of subjects . \n such a peculiar trait might facilitate future network analyses of research collaboration and interdisciplinarity . \n acknowledgement : financial support by fct ( fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ) , portugal is gratefully acknowledged . \n this article is part of the strategic project : uid / eco/00436/2013 . \n the authors thank marilei kroetz for her work in the gender identification process . \n frandsen , t. f. ;

over - time pooling operation @xcite over the feature map and take the maximum value @xmath19 as the feature corresponding to this particular filter . \n the idea is to capture the most important feature \n one with the highest value  for each feature map . \n this pooling scheme naturally deals with variable sentence lengths . \n we have described the process by which @xmath20 feature is extracted from @xmath20 filter . \n the model uses multiple filters ( with varying window sizes ) to obtain multiple features . \n these features form the penultimate layer and are passed to a fully connected softmax layer whose output is the probability distribution over labels .    in one of the model variants , we experiment with having two ` channels ' of word vectors  one that is kept static throughout training and one \n that is fine - tuned via backpropagation ( section 3.2 ) . in the multichannel architecture , \n illustrated in figure 1 , each filter is applied to both channels and the results are added to calculate @xmath11 in equation ( 2 ) . \n the model is otherwise equivalent to the single channel architecture . \n for regularization we employ dropout on the penultimate layer with a constraint on @xmath21-norms of the weight vectors @xcite . \n dropout prevents co - adaptation of hidden units by randomly dropping out  i.e . , setting to zero  a proportion @xmath22 of the hidden units during foward - backpropagation . \n that is , given the penultimate layer @xmath23 $ ] ( note that here we have @xmath24 filters ) , instead of using @xmath25 for output unit @xmath26 in forward propagation , dropout uses @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the element - wise multiplication operator and @xmath29 is a ` masking ' vector of bernoulli random variables with probability @xmath22 of being 1 . \n gradients are backpropagated only through the unmasked units . at test time , the learned weight vectors are scaled by @xmath22 such that @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is used ( without dropout ) to score unseen sentences . \n we additionally constrain @xmath21-norms of the weight vectors by rescaling @xmath32 to have @xmath33 whenever @xmath34 after a gradient descent step . \n we test our model on various benchmarks . \n summary statistics of the datasets are in table 1 . \n || > m0.15 cm | > m0.25 cm | > m0.825 cm | > m0.825 cm | > m0.825 cm | > m0.8 \n cm * data * & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & _ test _ + mr & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & cv + sst-1 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + sst-2 & @xmath40 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + subj & @xmath40 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & cv + trec & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + cr & @xmath40 & @xmath51 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & cv + mpqa & @xmath40 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & cv +    * * mr * : movie reviews with one sentence per review . \n classification involves detecting positive / negative reviews @xcite . * * sst-1 * : stanford sentiment treebank  an extension of mr but with train / dev / test splits provided and fine -

rand * : our baseline model where all words are randomly initialized and then modified during training . * * cnn - static * : a model with pre - trained vectors from ` word2vec ` . all words  including the unknown ones that are randomly initialized  are kept static and only the other parameters of the model are learned . * \n * cnn - non - static * : same as above but the pre - trained vectors are fine - tuned for each task . * * cnn - multichannel * : a model with two sets of word vectors . \n each set of vectors is treated as a ` channel ' and each filter is applied to both channels , but gradients are backpropagated only through one of the channels . \n hence the model is able to fine - tune one set of vectors while keeping the other static . \n both channels are initialized with ` word2vec ` .    in order to disentangle the effect of the above variations versus other random factors , we eliminate other sources of randomness  cv - fold assignment , initialization of unknown word vectors , initialization of cnn parameters  by keeping them uniform within each dataset . \n results of our models against other methods are listed in table 2 . our baseline model with all randomly initialized words ( cnn - rand ) \n does not perform well on its own . while we had expected performance gains through the use of pre - trained vectors , we were surprised at the magnitude of the gains . \n even a simple model with static vectors ( cnn - static ) performs remarkably well , giving competitive results against the more sophisticated deep learning models that utilize complex pooling schemes @xcite or require parse trees to be computed beforehand @xcite . \n these results suggest that the pre - trained vectors are good , ` universal ' feature extractors and can be utilized across datasets . \n fine - tuning the pre - trained vectors for each task gives still further improvements ( cnn - non - static ) . \n we had initially hoped that the multichannel architecture would prevent overfitting ( by ensuring that the learned vectors do not deviate too far from the original values ) and thus work better than the single channel model , especially on smaller datasets . \n the results , however , are mixed , and further work on regularizing the fine - tuning process is warranted . \n for instance , instead of using an additional channel for the non - static portion , one could maintain a single channel but employ extra dimensions that are allowed to be modified during training .      as is the case with the single channel non - static model , \n the multichannel model is able to fine - tune the non - static channel to make it more specific to the task - at - hand . \n for example , _ good _ is most similar to _ bad _ in ` word2vec ` , presumably because they are ( almost ) syntactically equivalent . \n but for vectors in the non - static channel that were fine - tuned on the sst-2 dataset , this is no longer the case ( table 3 ) . \n similarly , _ \n good _ is arguably closer to _ nice _ than it is to _ great _ for expressing sentiment , and this is indeed reflected in the learned vectors .    for \n ( randomly initialized ) tokens not in the set of pre - trained vectors , fine - tuning allows them to learn more meaningful representations : the network learns that exclamation marks are associated with effusive expressions and that commas are conjunctive ( table 3 ) . \n .top 4 neighboring words  based on cosine similarity  for vectors in the static channel ( left ) and fine - tuned vectors in the non - static channel ( right ) from the multichannel model on the sst-2 dataset after training . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      we report on some further experiments and observations :    * kalchbrenner et al . \n report much worse results with a cnn that has essentially the same architecture as our single channel model . \n for example , their max - tdnn ( time delay neural network ) with randomly initialized words obtains @xmath131 on the sst-1 dataset , compared to @xmath132 for our model . \n we attribute such discrepancy to our cnn having much more capacity ( multiple filter widths and feature maps ) . \n * dropout proved to be such a good regularizer that it was fine to use a larger than necessary network and simply let dropout regularize it . \n dropout consistently added 2%4% relative performance . \n * when randomly initializing words not in ` word2vec ` , we obtained slight improvements by sampling each dimension from @xmath133 $ ] where @xmath134 was chosen such that the randomly initialized vectors have the same variance as the pre - trained ones \n . it would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre - trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements . \n * we briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by collobert et al . \n on wikipedia , and found that ` word2vec ` gave far superior performance . it is not clear whether this is due to mikolov et al . s \n architecture or the 100 billion word google news dataset . \n * adadelta @xcite gave similar results to adagrad @xcite but required fewer epochs . \n in the present work we have described a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks built on top of ` word2vec ` . despite little tuning of hyperparameters , \n a simple cnn with one layer of convolution performs remarkably well . \n our results add to the well - established evidence that unsupervised pre - training of word vectors is an important ingredient in deep learning for nlp .", "StartTimeOffset": 4721450442600, "RequestID": "807169a03d0e62f1e197e1ff10d317bc573ef02a", "TotalTokens": 4155}
{"ContextTokens": 2229, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "rotating radio transients ( rrats ) were first discovered by mclaughlin  ( * ? ? ? \n * ( 2006 ) ) and are characterized by occasional single radio pulses , with no underlying periodicity easily detected , in contrast to typical rotation - powered pulsars . \n the discovery of rrats was surprising and important as it revealed a class of neutron stars that had previously been missed by pulsar surveys , thereby suggesting a potentially enormous increase in the inferred neutron - star birthrate . \n moreover the discovery raised the issue of why some neutron stars show such sporadic emission , whereas others are ` on ' continuously . \n rrats may exhibit up to @xmath01000 periods of separation between detected pulses , and as such are not detected in periodicity searches . \n furthermore , observational biases against detecting rrats suggest that these sources represent a significant fraction of radio - active galactic neutron stars , yet the current known population is very small . today \n @xmath070 rrats are known however the vast majority do not yet have their basic properties measured . \n those rrats whose properties have been measured tend to have longer periods and are mostly seen to lie between the regular pulsars and the magnetars , as shown in the @xmath1 diagram in figure  [ fig : ppdot ] . \n this may suggest an evolutionary link between rrats and other pulsar classes , but with such a small known rrat population , it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding their place within the global pulsar population .    since the initial discovery of the first 11 rrats , there has been a major paradigm shift in radio pulsar searches . \n single - pulse searches are now routine and a large number of new rrat discoveries are being made ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? \n * keane  2010 ) ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , \n a lot of human involvement is required in examining the output of single - pulse searches in order to look for rrat - like patterns . \n this , along with the already present biases against finding rrats , makes expanding and studying the rrat population a difficult task . \n hence , it is imperative to make automated rrat searches a routine part of radio pulsar searching . \n we have developed new post - processing techniques for automatically identifying single bright astrophysical pulses , such as those emitted from rrats . in implementing this search algorithm on data from the green bank telescope 350 mhz drift - scan survey \n , we have discovered 33 new rrat candidates , of which 6 have already been confirmed . \n here we describe these techniques and present our discoveries . \n diagram for all known neutron stars outside of globular clusters . \n the 18 rrats with measured @xmath2 are indicated by triangles , and dots represent other neutron stars . \n lines of constant magnetic field are solid and lines of constant characteristic age are dashed . \n as can be seen , these 18 rrats tend to have longer periods and larger magnetic fields than the bulk of long - period pulsars.,width=283 ] \n we have searched for rrats in data from the green bank telescope ( gbt ) 350 mhz drift - scan survey . \n this survey was conducted over the summer of 2007 , while the azimuth track of the gbt was undergoing repairs , and thus the telescope was stationary at several fixed elevations , collecting data as the sky drifted over it . \n the data were analyzed in 140-s sections , corresponding roughly to the time it takes a point on the sky to pass through the full width half maximum of the telescope beam . \n this survey produced 134 tb of data , covering over 10,000 square degrees of the sky , and has yielded 34 pulsars thus far . for more information on this survey , see @xcite and @xcite . \n these data were then processed using the presto software suite ( @xcite ) , which included radio frequency interference ( rfi ) excision , de - dispersion , searches for periodic signals in the fourier domain , and single - pulse searches . in single - pulse searches , signals in the de - dispersed time series that deviate from the mean \n significantly are identified , and information such as signal - to - noise , time , dispersion measure ( dm ) , and pulse width is recorded . \n diagnostic  single - pulse plots \" summarizing this information are then produced for each beam and saved for human inspection . in this survey , \n the data were divided into 30,000 140-s  pointings \" , producing 120,000 such diagnostic plots ( 4 plots per pointing , each plot spanning a different dm range ) that then required visual examination . \n this is a tedious , time - consuming task , and can thus be a bottleneck in discovering single - pulse sources . \n we have developed an automated search algorithm in order to identify rrat candidates in the output of single - pulse searches described above , eliminating the need for manual inspection of each diagnostic plot produced . \n our algorithm is based on the following concepts :    1 . \n [ dmrange ] a bright signal will be detected over a range of dms , with the strongest detection at the optimal dm and weaker detections above and below this dm . \n [ rfidm0 ] since signals are strongest at the optimal dm , we expect that signals of terrestrial origin ( namely rfi ) will peak at a dm of 0 . \n we can thus classify any signals that peak at dm@xmath00 as not astrophysical and reject them . \n concept ( [ dmrange ] ) means that a given pulse , whether astrophysical or not , will be associated with many statistically significant  single - pulse events \" that will be found in the single - pulse search . \n these events will be spread over a small range of dms , and will occur at approximately the same time . \n the first step in our algorithm is thus to * group * events that belong to the same pulse by checking whether they satisfy this criterion , that is , lie within some small window of dm and time . \n once the single - pulse events in a beam have been divided into groups , we * examine each group s collective properties * in order to decide whether it behaves like an astrophysical pulse , and * rate * it based on these results . \n the first test we employ is group size . \n if a group has too few events , we classify it as noise . \n the following test examines signal - to - noise vs. dm behaviour . from concept ( [ rfidm0 ] ) \n , we expect that a group of events that is due to an rfi signal will have a peak signal - to - noise at dm@xmath00 . \n thus , any groups that satisfy this criterion are classified as rfi . \n finally , we again make use of concept ( [ dmrange ] ) by looking for groups that have peak signal - to - noise at some given ( non - zero ) dm , which then decreases above and below that given dm . \n these groups are classified as likely astrophysical pulses , and depending on the peak signal - to - noise attained , are classified as  likely \" to  very likely \" pulses . \n once the beams have all undergone this search algorithm , those that have been flagged as having  very likely \" pulses are visually examined . for those beams that indeed look like astrophysical sources , \n we then generate  waterfall plots \" , which are frequency vs. time plots that show arrival times of the signal in different frequency bins . \n since astrophysical signals experience a frequency - dependent dispersive delay while propagating through the interstellar medium , we use these waterfall plots as a final means of testing the astrophysical nature of a signal , before deciding whether it is a candidate worthy of follow - up . \n we have processed all 30,000 pointings of the gbt drift - scan survey with the search algorithm described above , resulting in a total of 33 rrat candidates . of the 7 candidates that have been followed up , 6 have been confirmed . \n the remaining sources look extremely promising , based on their strong single - pulse detections , as well as dispersive behaviour shown in waterfall plots . it should be noted that , remarkably , the number of rrat candidates found is comparable to that of regular pulsars ( 34 ) found in the drift - scan survey . \n figure  [ fig:1537 ] shows an example discovery and confirmation plot of one of the new rrat sources . \n the strength of the algorithm is illustrated in these plots : the pulses in the discovery observation may easily be confused with rfi when examined by eye , and this beam would have potentially been dismissed if it were only examined visually . \n the algorithm , however , successfully distinguished between the astrophysical pulses and the rfi in this beam , and correctly identified this source as an rrat candidate . \n 15  pc  @xmath3 , starting at t@xmath037  s , and various rfi spikes throughout . on the right , many strong pulses are seen , again at dm@xmath015  pc  @xmath3 . \n the top right panels of each diagram demonstrate the signal - to - noise vs. dm behaviour expected for an astrophysical pulse , as described in section  [ algorithm].,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] 15  pc  @xmath3 , starting at t@xmath037  s , and various rfi spikes throughout . on the right \n , many strong pulses are seen , again at dm@xmath015  pc  @xmath3 . \n the top right panels of each diagram demonstrate the signal - to - noise vs. dm behaviour expected for an astrophysical pulse , as described in section  [ algorithm].,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] \n we hope to begin timing the confirmed rrat sources soon , allowing us to measure their basic parameters and place them on the @xmath1 diagram \n . we will also follow up the remaining candidates , and begin timing observations of those that are confirmed . \n we are also working on making improvements to the search algorithm that will allow us to identify weaker pulses in data , as well as make the algorithm more robust to rfi in order to reduce the number of false positives . finally , \n since this code is not specific to the drift - scan survey it may be applied to other pulsar surveys . \n indeed , in the coming weeks it will be implemented in the ongoing green bank north celestial cap survey . applying the search algorithm to this extensive sky survey \n promises to yield many more rrat sources , since this survey will have improved sensitivity and will cover an area far larger than that of the gbt drift - scan survey . \n we hope that with this new automated search algorithm , the known rrat population will quickly grow , allowing us to study more of these fascinating objects and find their place within the global pulsar population .", "StartTimeOffset": 4732798718830, "RequestID": "e29f09f9f7ff55ebe79d64fd94916a2853871891", "TotalTokens": 2360}

{"ContextTokens": 1320, "GeneratedTokens": 135, "SynthesizedBody": "over the past few years there has been considerable work on the detection of two - dimensional galaxy overdensities in wide field imaging surveys for subsequent spectroscopic follow up \n . however , these systematic searches for clusters , fuelled by the availability of large ccd camera mosaics , are in many cases biased towards high density peaks of the galaxy distribution .    with the next generation of large multi - object spectrographs in their final construction phase , deep redshift surveys ( keck / deep2 and vlt / virmos ) are well within the horizon . \n it is now worthwhile to address the more ambitious task of constructing a three dimensional , statistically complete sample of high redshift galaxy clusters . \n here we describe a fully automated and objective algorithm for identifying and reconstructing galaxy systems , based upon 3d voronoi polyhedra and delaunay triangulation . \n a voronoi partition of the space into minimally sized convex polytopes is a natural way to measure packing . \n a voronoi polyhedron is the uniquely defined region of space around a galaxy ( seed ) , within which each point is closer to the seed than to any other galaxy . \n the faces of the voronoi cell are formed by planes perpendicular to the vectors between a galaxy and its neighbors . \n the volume inside the polyhedron is inversely proportional to the packing efficiency of its central galaxy ; a large cell volume is indicative of an isolated galaxy . \n the delaunay triangulation is the geometrical dual of the voronoi partition and is defined by the tetrahedron whose vertices are the 4 galaxies with the property that the uniquely determined circumscribing sphere does not contain any other galaxy . \n we thus may identify high - density peaks by selecting as `` cluster seeds '' the centers of all the voronoi cells with volume smaller than some threshold , and then use the scale length of the delaunay mesh to infer the strength of the physical aggregation . \n we then can define an adaptive cylindrical window in redshift space ( elongated in the @xmath0 direction ) with dimensions determined by the local scale factor and process all the delaunay connected galaxies with a rapidly converging `` inclusion - exclusion '' logic to identify cluster members .    in our algorithm , \n the parameters defining the adaptive search window are only weakly dependent on the galaxy density gradient which inevitably occurs in a flux limited survey , since our smoothing procedure immediately identifies regions of enhanced clustering where galaxies are generally more luminous . \n moreover the number of cluster interlopers aggregated into a system in a redshift space analysis is minimized and we simultaneously obtain a non - parametric local estimate of the surrounding density environment for each galaxy and a quantitative measure of the distribution of cosmological voids in the survey volume . \n we have tested our reconstruction scheme using mock catalogs modelling the deep2 redshift survey ( davis et al . \n 2000 ) derived from gif simulations ( coil et al . \n this survey will obtain high quality spectra for @xmath1 60000 galaxies between z=0.7 - 1.5 using the keck 2 telescope and deimos spectrograph , with the twin goals of studying the evolution of the properties and the large - scale clustering of high redshift galaxies . \n we used a lcdm model with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to mimic the selection function of the magnitude limited survey we make a rest - frame b - band cut of 23.4 , which at z @xmath1 1 corresponds to an apparent i - band magnitude with the appropriate k - correction matching the deep2 photometric selection criteria ( @xmath6 ) . in fig . \n 2a we present a mock catalog for one deep2-like field collapsed along the smallest axis , covering the redshift range @xmath0=0.7 - 1.2 ( a depth which corresponds to selecting the 1200 l / mm grating in the deimos spectrograph ) and containing a volume of roughly @xmath7 mpc h@xmath8 ( @xmath1 15000 galaxies ) . \n we have used six independent mock catalogs to determine how well the algorithm performs in identifying clusters of galaxies .    to determine the `` true '' distribution of clusters , we have applied in real space ( volume - limited simulation ) a standard percolation algorithm optimised for selecting virialized objects ( mean overdensity @xmath1 180 ) . \n the resulting distribution of those clusters with more than 5 members is shown in fig 2b . \n cluster candidates selected by the voronoi  delauney algorithm applied in redshift space ( flux - limited simulation ) are shown in fig 2c . \n note how the large - scale pattern defined by galaxy systems and the associations of clusters in higher order structures reproduce in an unbiased way the underlying real space landscape . \n the evolution of the comoving abundance of clusters as a function of their velocity dispersion @xmath9 and redshift @xmath0 is a sensitive function of cosmological parameters ( see newman et al . \n the statistical significance and robustness of the cluster abundance test depends critically on an unbiased mapping of the distribution properties of the cluster observables between real to redshift space . \n we have investigated the differential and integral distribution functions of the number of reconstructed clusters as a function of their richness , velocity dispersion and redshift . \n the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test confirms the similarity between the real and reconstructed distributions , and thus the reliability of our algorithm . \n this can be seen visually in fig . \n 4 where we show the two - dimensional distributions of the real and reconstructed clusters in redshift z and projected velocity dispersion @xmath9 . \n coil , a. , davis , m. , & szapudi , i. 2001 , pasp , in press , astro - ph/0107541 davis , m. , newman , j. a. , faber , s. a. , & phillips , a. c. , 2000 in proc . of the eso / ecf / stsci workshop on deep fields , ( garching , edition springer ) , astro - ph/0012189 newman , j. a. , marinoni , c. , davis , m. , & coil , a. 2001 , pasp , in press", "StartTimeOffset": 4773795248909, "RequestID": "8c6083ef60e517a45419cee3fc2b7bdf95adb397", "TotalTokens": 1455}

{"ContextTokens": 3710, "GeneratedTokens": 54, "SynthesizedBody": "describing the open system dynamics of a quantum object , the states of external fields such as the light field are usually represented by some form of statistical approximation : for instance , the master equation approach assumes an unchanging thermal state of the external fields , disregarding all effects which the system might have on them ( `` bath approximation '' ) . \n approaches such as the monte carlo wave function method @xcite or the subensemble density matrix @xcite consider measurements of the photons at the instant of their emission , thereby arriving at an easy to handle description of the open system dynamics while avoiding a more detailed description of the light field itself . \n however , in typical experimental situations , the light field is our only source of information , while the system dynamics must be deduced indirectly from the respective measurement protocols . \n furthermore , the type of measurement we choose to perform on the photons may influence the dynamics of the system . \n therefore , a closer look at the processes which allow us to measure the emitted photons may be helpful . for this purpose \n we should start with the complete schroedinger equation of the system and the field . \n the evolution of this state will then be analyzed with respect to a representation adopted to given measurement scenarios . \n in the most simple case , we have a localized two level system , consisting of the excited state @xmath0 and the ground state @xmath1 with a transition frequency @xmath2 , and a one dimensional field with linear dispersion @xmath3 coupled by a local interaction .    the field can be separated into two distinct branches , one with group velocity c for @xmath4 and one with group velocity -c for @xmath5 . in the following \n , we will further simplify the problem by considering only the branch with positive group velocity , extending it to negative values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 as shown in figure ( 1 ) . \n the introduction of negative frequencies can be justified on the ground that , since the emission of photons with zero or negative energy would violate energy conservation , such processes will only contribute to the dynamics on time scales smaller than @xmath8 . \n therefore , the amplitudes of those spurious field states should be small compared to those near @xmath9 @xcite . \n the relevant states for the emission process are the product state of the excited system state and the field vacuum , @xmath10 , and the product states of the ground state and the 1 photon field states @xmath11 . \n using these states as basis , the hamiltonian of our model is @xmath12\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this hamiltonian is a simple version of the hamiltonian used in wigner - weisskopf theory . \n therefore , we can proceed as in @xcite . \n the time dependent schroedinger equation is @xmath13 if we choose the initial condition @xmath14 , the result of the integrated schroedinger equation for the one photon part is @xmath15 this result can be substituted into the equation for the amplitude of the excited state . by using @xmath16 one obtains @xmath17 the integral over k , again , results in a delta function , and the evolution becomes local in time : @xmath18 \\langle e;vac.|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{(-i\\omega_0-\\gamma/2)t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the amplitudes calculated for the 1 photon states of our model are : @xmath19    we can test our assumption that the amplitudes for @xmath20 are much smaller than those near @xmath21 by calculating the k - space probability densities : @xmath22 for @xmath23 \n , this is the familiar lorentzian distribution . \n thus , for @xmath24 , the contribution of field states with @xmath25 will be negligible .    on smaller timescales , there are contributions from @xmath26 to @xmath27 due to the energy - time uncertainty . in a model with a more realistic dispersion relation , the k=0 component \n have a groupvelocity of 0 . \n consequently , there will be reabsorption of such components in the real space formulation , which leads to an interaction of the system with itself . \n the main effect of this interaction would be an energy shift in the spectrum , comparabel to the lamb shift in quantumelectrodynamics . \n however , since our model does not include such processes , there is no such energy shift and the lorentzian distribution of the emission centers on @xmath2 . \n it is now possible to calculate the real space amplitudes by fouriertransforming the k space result : @xmath28 figure ( 2 ) shows the spatiotemporal distribution of the field state . \n this function can be interpreted as the real space probability density for photon detection . \n in order to apply this result to realistic conditions in photon spectroscopy , it is necessary to give a more detailed interpretation of the @xmath29 states . in typical cases \n , the emission will be into an unrestricted three dimensional light field . \n therefore , an infinite number of degenerate modes with the same absolute value of k is available . in the plane wave basis with wavevector @xmath30 and a linear polarization given by @xmath31 , \n the interaction part of the hamiltonian is @xmath32 in many situations , it may suffice to inspect the symmetry of the system and of the field . \n for example , the spherical symmetry of an atomic system allows us to classify both the system and the field states according to the quantum numbers of the angular momentum , l and m ( for details , see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the following , \n we restrict the atomic states to @xmath33 ( l=0 ) and @xmath34 ( l=1 ) . \n a dipole transition emits only photons of @xmath35 with @xmath36 . \n since the total angular momentum is conserved , the system must change its quantum numbers l and m accordingly .    since for radii much larger than the wavelength spherical waves approach plane waves , the previous interpretation of the wave function in real space still applies , except in the immediate vicinity of the object . replacing x by r \n , the @xmath37 states now describe a photon at a distance r from the system , while the angular dependence and the polarization of the photon is given by the photon state quantum number m. with the z - axis as quantization axis , the amplitudes are @xmath38 the condition for transversality of the light field , @xmath39 , yields the angular dependence of the emitted intensity characteristic for dipole radiation . \n a simple application of this model is the standard quantum beat scenario ( three level system ) in which an atom in a magnetic field is excited from the groundstate @xmath40 and the @xmath41 sublevels of the excited p state @xmath42 . \n since we can apply our theory to both the @xmath43 and the @xmath44 transitions separately and since we are dealing with the linear dynamics of the schroedinger equation , we can immediately write down the complete evolution of both the field and the system in local representation : @xmath45 written in the m basis of the light field and the m basis of the system , quantum beats do not appear in the evolution of either subsystem . \n a simple transformation to another basis in atom- , @xmath46 @xmath47 and field - states @xmath48 @xmath49 shows , however , that beats do occur then , contrary to the statement made in @xcite , that orthogonal dipoles should definitely exclude beats . \n the wave function written in this basis for the case of @xmath50 now reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . \n this representation of the evolution clearly shows beats in both the system and the field . \n figure ( 3 ) shows the real space probability distribution of this linearly polarized photon . of course , whether beats are observed or not depends on the type of measurement performed . \n another application of this model is the description of entangled states between field and system if the decay is from a single excited level @xmath54 into two ( or possibly more ) alternative groundstates @xmath55 . \n however , the two groundstates will generally not be degenerate . \n therefore , the state of the system will start to evolve in time at the instant of the emission , t - r / c , causing a dependence of the system state on the field state @xmath37 . \n the measurement of a photon at r implies that a time of r / c has elapsed since emission , so that the state of the total system would be @xmath56 thus we can use the fact that our model treats emissions as instantaneous to replace the ground state with the temporal evolution of this two level subsystem . \n with @xmath57 we obtain the result of the complete evolution as @xmath58 & + & \\gamma_- e^{i\\omega_-(r / c - t)}|p , m=-1;r , m=+1\\rangle)\\,dr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the one photon part of this wave function carries a strong system - field correlation . in the case \n @xmath59 , any linear combination of @xmath60 and @xmath61 states may be observed , depending on the measurement results in the field . \n for example , we may transform to the field basis @xmath62 and the atomic basis @xmath63 as in section 3.2 . \n : @xmath64 & + & \\sin(\\delta\\omega(r / c - t))(|p_x;r , d_y\\rangle - |p_y;r , d_x\\rangle ) ) \\,dr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , we use the notation @xmath52 and @xmath53 . while the total probability of measuring a photon with @xmath65 polarization does not oscillate , those photon detections correlated with an atomic state of @xmath66 and @xmath67 both display beats as shown in figure ( 4 ) . \n the beats could therefore be seen by measuring the atomic state and separating out the photon detections accordingly . \n this seems to be at variance with the expectation that in this type of three level system , beats should be absent because a measurement of the atomic state would reveal the decay channel , @xmath68 or @xmath69@xcite . \n however , measuring the @xmath66 and @xmath67 states of the atomic system reveals only the phase of the beats , preventing the determination of the decay channel . \n coincidence measurements of this type can therefore be considered as quantum eraser measurements as described in @xcite and @xcite for the case of 2 spatially separated sources of photonscattering , since the measurement of @xmath66 and @xmath67 effectively erases the information to be gained by measuring @xmath60 and @xmath61 . \n the two cases described above and in section 3.2 , respectively , may be combined into a single four level system with a cascade decay leading from an excited level through two ( or more ) intermediate levels to the ground state . \n this model could thus be used to describe the quantum beats observed in cascade decays @xcite . \n the resulting wave function will include a two photon part , so it may be necessary to consider the boson nature of the photons when transforming to another measurement base . \n since the emission process is local in time and there is no interaction between the photons , our present model can be adapted to any other scenario by simply adding the effects of the possible channels of decay . in this way , it should be possible to develop a better understanding of the role which the optical measurement apparatus plays in quantum measurements . \n for actual measurements the atomic object and the field is embedded into a dissipative environment , usually a filter and a detector , which , again , may be specified by its interaction with the light field . the type of measurement process can be included in the form of a projection acting on the field part of the wavefunction . \n the choice of base states used should thus be made with a special experimental setup in mind . \n for example , a polarizer - detector setup can be considered as a projective measurement on @xmath70 states , where r is the distance between the system and the detector . with the 3-level system described by equation ( 23 ) , this would allow us to observe quantum beats . \n a more realistic representation would consider the limited area covered by the detector , meaning that actually a state of the form @xmath71 is measured , where @xmath72 is the proportion of photons emitted into the angle covered by the detector . \n @xmath73 represents a superposition of multipole states with @xmath74 . \n it ensures , that the measured state exists only in a limited area by interfering with @xmath75 in such a way , that real space components outside the emission angles covered by the detector vanish .    in our model , the field dynamics in real space rigidly move the field states away from the system at the speed of light ( see fig.1 ) \n therefore , the state of the field represents a temporal record of the field dynamics at the system . \n it does not matter at what distance r we choose to measure , since a shift in r is equivalent to a delay time @xmath76 . \n if we are only interested in time resolved spectroscopy , we may simulate the photon measurement directly at the system . \n this corresponds to the measurement approaches of @xcite and @xcite . \n however , as we have calculated the whole wavefunction of the field , we can also consider frequency resolved measurements . \n most frequency selective filters are based on an interference between optical paths of different length . \n this corresponds to a linear combination of different @xmath37 states of the field . \n a michelson interferometer would produce a measurement of @xmath77 in the detector , while a fabry - perot interferometer measures @xmath78 . \n coincidence measurements such as applied in @xcite can now be represented by a measurement base of @xmath79 , with @xmath80 as the delay time . \n we have presented an exactly solvable model for the unitary temporal evolution of the total system - field state . \n the assumptions used in the model are equivalent to the approximations of wigner - weisskopf theory . \n however , our approach enables us to provide a physical interpretation of these approximations in terms of locality and constant group velocity . \n also , it is possible to visualize the evolution of the wave function in space and time , allowing us to take a closer look both at time resolved spectroscopy and at the effect of interferometric filters . \n this clearly reveals the special role of the measurement process in quantum mechanics , which is often concealed by the application of approximations such as the bath approximation or the omission of correlations . \n 99 present adress : institute of technical physics , pfaffenwaldring 38 -

loss phenomena are common in the earliest stages of stellar evolution . \n this activity can be traced by water maser emission ( rodrguez et al . \n moreover these masers provide a good characterization of the age of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , since class 0 sources are the most probable candidates to harbor this emission ( furuya et al . \n 2001 ) .    in order to diagnose the physical conditions around ysos , and study the dynamics and the stage of evolution , we have analyzed the properties of ccs , nh@xmath5 , and water masers in the cloud surrounding the far - infrared source b1-irs ( iras 03301 + 3057 ) , a class 0 source ( hirano et al . \n 1997 ) located in the b1 molecular cloud . \n simultaneous observations of the j@xmath6=2@xmath7 - 1@xmath8 transition of ccs ( rest frequency = 22345.388 mhz ) and the 6@xmath9 - 5@xmath10 transition of h@xmath11o ( rest frequency = 22235.080 mhz ) were carried out on 2003 april 4 using the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( usa ) in its d configuration .    we have also processed vla archive data of the nh@xmath5(1,1 ) transition ( rest frequency = 23694.496 mhz ) . the observations were made on 1988 august 13 , with the d configuration . \n in addition to all these radio data , we have retrieved a k - band image from the image data of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , to get a better position for the infrared source . \n this image was processed with aips , and convolved with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , to search for extended emission . \n the most interesting characteristics of the ccs emission are its clumpy spatial distribution and the observed velocity gradient \n . there are three main clumps surrounding the central source , all of them are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the b1 core ( @xmath12 = 6.3 km s@xmath13 , hirano et al . \n the molecular gas in all these clumps shows clear velocity gradients , with less redshifted velocities at positions closer to the central object ( see fig . \n the ammonia emission is very extended ( @xmath14 ) and clumpy . \n the general tendency observed consists in a spatial anticorrelation with respect to the ccs emission , never reported before at such small scales ( @xmath04@xmath1 , 1400 au at 350 pc ) . \n we think that this anticorrelation is related to the chemical evolution of the source , but we need to continue with this kind of studies in other sources similar to b1-irs to derive consistent conclusions about the meaning of this distribution . \n our water maser observation shows a cluster of 23 spots , most of them are redshifted with respect to the main cloud velocity . \n they form an elongated structure ( see fig 2 ) , with a length of @xmath0 1.@xmath13 ( 455 au at 350 pc ) . \n we have detected a point - like source at 2 @xmath4 m from the 2mass archive . \n convolving the k - band image with a gaussian of 5@xmath1 fwhm , we have noticed an extended emission elongated south west from the point source . \n the point -

band is a reflection nebula elongated in the same direction as the water masers . \n our dynamical calculations reveal that motions of the water masers are unbound , since a mass of @xmath1712 m@xmath18 within 175 au would be needed to bind them . \n such a high mass is not consistent with our nh@xmath5 and ccs data . \n due to their proximity to the exciting source , and the shape and size of the distribution of the masers , it is very likely that the maser emission delineates the inner ( 1@xmath1 ) part of the jet that is driving the co outflow , near b1-irs and detected by @xcite . \n the velocity pattern observed in the ( redshifted ) ccs clumps can be interpreted in terms of infalling clumps which are strongly interacting with the outflow . \n what we see could be foreground ccs clumps falling toward the central source , but being stopped by the wind , explaining in this way the less redshifted velocities observed in the ccs lines at positions closer to the central source ( fig . \n however , an alternative possibility is that we could be observing the ccs clumps in the background moving away from the source and being accelerated by the molecular outflow . \n the moderately - high velocity blueshifted co emission detected by @xcite was proposed to be in a near pole - on configuration due to the position of the iras source with respect to the outflow , which was located just at the center of the blueshifted emission ( fig . \n 3 ) .      first , \n the 2 @xmath4 m point - like source , which is probably powering the outflow ( as suggested by its association with the water masers ) , is not located at the center but at the tip of the blueshifted co emission . \n the extended 2 @xmath4 m emission is elongated in the same direction that the cluster of water masers , and it is coincident with the shape of the co outflow . \n this coincidence further reinforces that the 2 @xmath4 m source marks the position of the powering source , and that the blueshifted lobe of the outflow is oriented towards the southwest of it . \n moreover the velocity gradient of the ccs can not be explained by a pole - on outflow . \n an outflow in the plane of the sky , however , could sweep the ccs material providing the velocity gradient observed . \n the geometry on the plane of the sky is reinforced by the lack of a velocity gradient of the water masers along its jet -

tuning have long been considered in the case of electroweak symmetry breaking . in many of these studies \n the degree of fine - tuning required was quantified through a measure of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the input parameters of the mssm @xmath2 . \n we use a similar measure @xcite to quantify the degree of fine - tuning required of the mssm parameters to produce an lsp that reproduces the observed dark matter relic density : @xmath3 we take the total tuning of a point to be @xmath4 . \n the calculation of @xmath5 primarily depends on @xmath2 through their effect on the annihilation cross - section of the lightest neutralino @xmath6 . \n this is primarily determined by the mass and composition of @xmath6 . \n this in turn is determined by diagonalising the neutralino mass matrix at low energy . \n the matrix depends upon @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . \n if one of these is much lighter than the others @xmath6 will be primarily of that form . \n this allows us to divide up the mssm parameter space depending on the composition of @xmath6 . \n a wino lsp ( @xmath10 ) or higgsino lsp ( @xmath11 ) annihilates very efficiently , resulting in too little dark matter , @xmath12 . \n a bino lsp ( @xmath13 ) annihilates primarily via t - channel slepton exchange . \n this process is only efficient for light sleptons and so bino lsps generally result in too large a relic @xmath14 .    therefore to fit the observed dark matter density we are required to move to unusual regions of the parameter space . \n one possibility is to consider a mixed lsp . \n if we have a bino lsp with just enough of either wino or higgsino mixed in , we can fit @xmath15 . \n this is the so called `` well - tempered '' neutralino championed in @xcite . \n alternatively we can consider a bino lsp in which the annihilation cross - section is enhanced via some means . \n this can occur in a few different ways . \n firstly , if there are light sfermions , t - channel sfermion is enhanced . \n secondly if @xmath16 the neutralinos can annihilate to an on - shell boson . \n finally if the nlsp is quasi - degenerate in mass with the lsp , there will be a significant nlsp number density at freeze out and we must factor in annihilations of the nlsp into our calculations of the susy relic density . \n all of these effects can enhance annihilation of a bino lsp to the extent that we fit the observed dark matter relic density . \n we would expect each region to exhibit a different sensitivity to the mssm input parameters . to study these regions we take 4 different sets of boundary conditions on the mssm input parameters @xmath2 at @xmath17 , beginning with the familiar case of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) . \n the rest of this talk is set out as follows . in section [ cmssm ] \n we consider the cmssm , which provides us with a useful reference point against which the subsequent non - universal cases may be compared . in section [ scalar ] \n we allow the third family soft sfermion and higgs mass squared to vary independently . in section [ gauge ] \n we consider neutralino dark matter with non - universal gaugino masses , but with a universal soft scalar mass . in section [ scalargauge ] \n we consider _ both _ the effects of including an independent third family sfermion mass squared _ and _ non - universal soft gaugino masses . \n section [ conc ] concludes the talk . \n the cmssm has 4 free inputs : @xmath18 @xmath19 is a common scalar mass that sets the soft masses of the sfermion and higgs sectors . \n @xmath20 is a common gaugino mass . \n @xmath21 sets the soft susy breaking trilinear coupling . \n @xmath22 is the ratio of the higgs vevs . \n finally the requirement that the model provide radiative electroweak symmetry breaking determines the magnitude of the susy conserving higgs mass @xmath9 but leaves the sign as a free parameter . \n the mass and composition of the lightest neutralino is determined by diagonalising a mass matrix that depends upon the parameters @xmath23 at the electroweak scale . in the cmssm @xmath24 at the gut scale . as running effects mean that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , gaugino mass unification sets @xmath27 . therefore , \n unless @xmath28 , the lightest neutralino will be dominantly bino .    in fig . \n [ fig : cmssm ] we consider the @xmath29 plane of the cmssm parameter space with @xmath30 . across this parameter space \n @xmath6 is bino . \n this generally results in @xmath31 . \n however at low @xmath19 the @xmath32 becomes light . in the light ( green ) region @xmath33 and the region \n is ruled out as this would result in a charged lsp . along the edge of this region @xmath34 . \n this means that at the time of freeze out there would have been a large number density of @xmath32 alongside the @xmath6 , allowing many more annihilation channels than are open for neutralinos alone . \n this results in a significant decrease of the neutralino relic density . in the multicoloured strip that lies alongside the @xmath32 lsp region , this coannihilation process results in @xmath35 . \n the varying colours of this strip represent the value of @xmath36 , defined by the colour legend on the right . \n coannihilation occurs when the lsp and nlsp are close in mass . as a result \n , the efficiency of coannihilation processes is highly sensitive to the mass difference @xmath37 . \n if these masses are determined by separate parameters we would expect that a large degree of tuning would be required to fit the observed dark matter density . in the coannihilation strip of fig . \n [ fig : cmssm ] the nlsp is the stau . \n the stau mass is set at the gut scale by @xmath19 and the neutralino mass is set by @xmath20 . as these are independent parameters , we would expect the @xmath38 coannihilation region to exhibit considerable fine - tuning . \n the colour coding of the coannihilation strip shows a tuning of @xmath39 , considerably lower than would be expected if @xmath40 and @xmath41 were unrelated . \n the smallness of the tuning comes from the fact that along the coannihilation strip @xmath42 . \n the running of the right handed slepton masses are strongly dependent on @xmath7 . \n when @xmath19 is small , the dominant contribution to the low energy @xmath32 mass is via this running contribution from @xmath7 . \n thus in this region of the cmssm @xmath40 depends strongly on @xmath20 , resulting in a correlation of the masses of the neutralino and the stau at low energy . \n it is this correlation of the masses that results in the low tuning observed . \n though we do not show it here , we have also investigated the other regions of the cmssm that fit @xmath15 . for large @xmath19 @xmath9 becomes small and we have a bino / higgsino lsp . \n we find that such regions exhibit a tuning @xmath43 , less natural than the coannihilation strip . for large @xmath22 we can also access a region in which @xmath44 . \n this allows for neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell pseudoscalar higgs boson . \n we find such an annihilation channel to require a tuning @xmath45 . finally at large @xmath22 \n the running of the @xmath32 mass is no longer dominated by @xmath7 . \n this breaks the correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath40 at low energies and results in the coannihilation strip that requires a tuning @xmath46 . \n this bears out our expectations that coannihilation should require significant tuning to achieve in normal circumstances . \n our first move away from the universality of the cmssm is to relax the universality between the generations of sfermions , setting the soft masses to be : @xmath47    this allows us to vary the 3rd family sfermion and higgs mass squareds separately from the 1st and 2nd families . \n this allows us to have light 1st and 2nd family sfermions without violating lep bounds on the lightest higgs . \n in such a region we will also have a normal mass hierarchy ( nmh ) in which the 1st family sfermions are the lightest and the 3rd family sfermions are the heaviest , in contrast to the inverted mass hierarchy found in the case of universal soft scalar masses .    in fig . \n [ fig : scalar1 ] we display the @xmath29 plane for @xmath48 tev , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . by increasing the soft mass of the higgs bosons to @xmath51 \n the lep bound has moved down to @xmath52 . as before we have a coannihilation strip but as @xmath53 , the coannihilation here is with selectrons and smuons rather than the stau .    as before the coannihilation strip exhibits a tuning @xmath54 across much of its length . \n this drops to @xmath55 for @xmath56 . \n this decrease has two causes . \n firstly , for @xmath57 we can access @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , the mass of @xmath60 and @xmath61 \n are almost entirely determined by the running effects from @xmath7 resulting in a strong correlation between @xmath62 and @xmath41 . \n this decreases the tuning required to provide coannihilation . secondly , \n as we move to low @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we decrease the mass of the sleptons themselves , enhancing neutralino annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange . indeed at point s2 t - channel slepton exchange accounts for @xmath63 of the annihilation . \n the cross - section for t - channel slepton exchange varies slowly with the mass of the exchanged slepton and is relatively insensitive to other parameters . \n therefore it requires little or no tuning to achieve . by maximising annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange \n we minimise the required tuning . \n we now relax the constraint of universal gaugino masses . by allowing @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath64 to vary \n independently we can control the bino / wino mixture of @xmath6 . \n @xmath64 also has a strong effect on the running of the higgs masses so by keeping @xmath64 large we can avoid the lep bound on the lightest higgs .    in fig . \n [ fig : gauge1 ] we show the @xmath65 plane for @xmath66 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . \n in contrast to previous figures there are a large number of strips that agree with @xmath15 . \n the strip running from g2 to g3 is the stau coannihilation strip we have seen before . \n the tuning of this strip agrees with our previous findings in the case of the cmssm . \n the strip that runs from g3 through g4 corresponds to a well - tempered bino / wino neutralino . \n as this strip exhibits a tuning of order 30 we once again find that such `` well - tempered '' regions are less natural than coannihilation strips . at low @xmath7 \n there are two broken vertical lines . \n these correspond to neutralino annihilation via the production of an on - shell @xmath67 or @xmath68 . \n the @xmath68 resonance stretches to @xmath69 but is too thin for this plot to resolve . \n this channel requires tunings @xmath70 and so can not be considered natural . \n finally , the yellow region that incorporates the point g1 represents annihilation solely via t - channel slepton exchange . \n this region requires a tuning @xmath71 and represents supernatural dark matter . \n finally we relax both the universality of the gaugino masses and the universality between sfermion generations at the same time . \n this allows us to test the robustness of our findings in each case against further non - universality . \n it also allows us to study a region in which @xmath72 and the lightest neutralino is a `` maximally - tempered '' bino / wino / higgsino .    in fig . \n [ fig : scalargauge2 ] we show the @xmath65 plane with @xmath66 , @xmath73 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . at low @xmath7 \n we find the @xmath68 and @xmath67 resonances as before . \n the new feature is the line at @xmath74 that incorporates the point sg3 . throughout this region @xmath6 \n is a mix of bino , wino and higgsino . at point \n sg3 the wino and higgsino components are roughly equal resulting in a maximally - tempered neutralino . \n this region exhibits a low tuning @xmath75 , considerably below that required for either bino / wino or bino / higgsino neutralinos . \n we have studied the naturalness of the annihilation channels that allow mssm neutralinos to account for the observed dark matter density . within the four different sets of gut scale boundary conditions considered , these annihilation channels each display characteristic degrees of fine - tuning . \n the largest tunings ( @xmath36 up to @xmath76 ) appear for annihilation via on - shell production of higgs bosons . \n moderate tunings @xmath77 are required for `` well - tempered '' neutralinos or slepton coannihilation with uncorrelated masses . \n the most natural annihilation channel is annihilation via t - channel slepton exchange . \n we have also found that certain rge effects can result in surprising drops in the tuning for different channels . \n this is clearest in the case of slepton coannihilation for low @xmath19 and @xmath22 . in this case \n the mass of both particles is dominated by @xmath7 and the low energy masses are correlated . \n this results in almost natural coannihilation , which refutes the conclusions of @xcite . \n these results have recently been extended to the case of a type i string inspired model @xcite . \n in such a model the input parameters differ from those of the mssm and the characteristic tunings of different annihilation channels can vary . \n s.  f.  king and j.  p.  roberts , arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3890, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the major problems in the study of agns is understanding the mechanisms responsible for making the gas lose large amounts of angular momentum , move from the host galaxy toward the nucleus , and feed the black hole . among the mechanisms that have been proposed , the principal ones are interactions , bars and nuclear spirals . \n the importance of bars and nuclear spirals have been addressed in several contributions to this conference ( combes , crenshaw , gadotti , emsellem , martini , maciejewski , among others ) , and here we will discuss the role of interaction .    starting with gunn ( 1979 ) , who suggested that interactions can play an important role in feeding agns , this mechanism has been studied by several groups , both from the theoretical and observational point of view . from the theoretical point of view , n - body simulations by noguchi ( 1987 ) , barnes & hernquist ( 1992 ) , byrd et al . \n ( 1986 ) , lin , pringle & rees ( 1988 ) , hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) , mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) , taniguchi & wada ( 1996 ) , among others , have shown that mergers , minor mergers and flybys can be responsible for bringing gas from the disk to the nuclear region . during this process \n the gas is shocked and compressed , leading to a period of enhanced star formation before it can be accreted by the black hole . \n this prediction is confirmed by the observation of higher levels of h@xmath0 , infrared and radio emission in interacting galaxies ( keel et al . \n 1985 ; kennicutt et al . \n further evidence comes from the fact that luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies are closely related to interacting systems ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .    on the other hand , \n the observational evidence for the influence of interactions in feeding agns is not very clear . in the case of high luminosity sources , like quasars \n , there is evidence that they are related to interacting systems ( hutchings 1982 ; heckman et al . \n 1983 ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ) . \n however , in the case of lower luminosity sources , like seyfert galaxies , the situation is not so clear . \n there is no consensus on the importance of interactions in feeding their nuclei , and whether these galaxies have an excess of companions . \n the current results can be divided into 3 groups : those with an excess of seyfert galaxies with companions relative to normal galaxies ( e.g. simkin , su & schwarz 1980 ; dahari 1984 ; rafanelli , violato & baruffolo 1995 ; laurikainen et al . \n 1994 ) ; those with no difference between seyferts and normal galaxies ( fuentes - williams & stocke 1988 ; ulvestad & wilson 1984 ; de robertis , yee & hayhoe 1998 ) ; and those with a higher percentage of seyfert 2s than seyfert 1s with companions ( laurikainen & salo 1995 , and dultzin - hacyan et al . \n 1999 ) . \n we believe that the contradictory results obtained by different papers are most likely due to the way they selected their samples and control samples , as pointed out by heckman ( 1990 ) . a major requirement for one to be able to do a proper comparison between the percentage of agn and normal galaxies with companions , is to have a sample of active and control galaxies matched by their host properties . \n previous studies also had to deal with the fact that they usually did not have information about the redshifts of nearby galaxies projected on the sky , so they were not always able to know if these galaxies were physically associated . \n this required the application of statistical corrections for the number of background and foreground objects projected around the galaxies being studied . \n in this section we present the results of a recent study of the percentage of companions in galaxies with different activity types ( schmitt 2001 ) , where most of the selection effects , as well as other problems pointed out above , were avoided . instead of using the more traditional technique of selecting a control sample of galaxies to match the agn one , the approach used in this paper was to employ a sample of galaxies selected by their host properties , independent of the fact of being active or not . \n the sample selected for this study was the palomar survey ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997a ) , which comprises all the galaxies brighter than b@xmath1 mag in the northern hemisphere . \n this sample is ideal for this work because it includes both the agn and the control sample in itself . \n besides mitigating the sample selection problem , the palomar sample presents several additional advantages relative to other samples . \n it provides homogeneous high - quality spectroscopic measurements of emission line fluxes , and activity classification of all the galaxies . \n this sample contains a large enough number of galaxies , with a large range of parameters ( e.g. host galaxy morphology and nuclear luminosity ) ensuring a significant comparison between the different activity types , and allowing us to draw robust statistical conclusions . for a detailed discussion of other advantages of this sample relative to other ones commonly used in the literature , and for a discussion of possible selection biases which affect them , \n see ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) .    starting with the original sample of 486 galaxies from ho et al . \n ( 1997a ) , we excluded local group galaxies and all those with b@xmath2 mag , thus reducing the total number of objects to 451 . \n these galaxies were divided in 5 groups , according to their nuclear activity type . \n the groups and the number of galaxies in each one of them are : 46 seyferts , 193 hii galaxies , 88 liners , 63 transition objects and 61 absorption line galaxies . \n we point out that most of the hii galaxies in this sample have only quiescent star formation . \n also , we do not try to separate the seyfert galaxies into seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s . \n the influence of interactions on agn activity was studied using two techniques . \n first we compared the environments where galaxies with different activity types are found . \n this was done using the local galaxy density parameter ( @xmath3 ) , which was defined by tully ( 1988 ) as the density of galaxies brighter than m@xmath4 mag in the vicinity of the object of interest . \n we found that the different activity types have similar distributions of @xmath3 values , indicating that there is no significant difference in their environments ( see the contribution by maia for results on a different sample ) . \n the second technique consisted of searching for companions around the galaxies in the palomar sample . \n this was done using ned and the digitized sky survey images . \n the criteria used to determine if a galaxy has a companion are similar to the ones used by rafanelli et al . \n ( 1995 ) , but modified to allow a slightly larger search region . \n we determine that a galaxy is a companion if its distance to the galaxy of interest , the primary galaxy , is smaller than 5 times the diameter ( d@xmath5 ) of that galaxy , the difference in brightness between them is smaller than 3 magnitudes ( @xmath6 3 mag ) , and the difference in radial velocities is smaller than 1000 km  s@xmath7 ( @xmath8 1000 km  s@xmath7 ) . \n the palomar sample presents a major advantage , relative to most samples , in the latter criterion . since redshift surveys such as the cfa2 ( falco et al . \n 1999 ) are observing galaxies up to @xmath9 , we are able to obtain radial velocity information even for the faintest possible companions of galaxies in our sample .    considering that most of the galaxies in this sample have m@xmath10 , we can calculate that this technique is sensitive to companions as faint as m@xmath11 , which is similar to the absolute magnitude of the smc ( m@xmath12 ) . for more typical galaxies , with magnitudes around m@xmath13 ( m@xmath14 ) , \n this technique is sensitive to companions slightly fainter than the lmc ( m@xmath15 ) . \n however , we are not sensitive to lower luminosity dwarf spheroidal and irregular galaxies , which were suggested by de robertis et al . \n ( 1998 ) as possible triggers of activity in seyfert galaxies . \n the results from the comparison of the percentage of galaxies with companions among the different activity types are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] . \n we find in the left panel of this figure that , when all the galaxies in the sample are considered , there is a similar percentage of seyfert and hii galaxies with companions . \n however , a surprising result arises when we compare these percentages with those for liner s , transition and absorption galaxies , which present significantly larger percentages of companions , by a factor of approximately two . \n a detailed statistical comparison between the different activity types is presented in schmitt ( 2001 ) . \n this result seems to contradict all previous results available in the literature , which indicated that the percentage of seyfert and hii galaxies with companions was either similar to or higher than that of other galaxies . \n however , this contradiction is solved when we take into account the morphological types of the galaxies in our sample . \n ho et al . ( 1997b ) showed that different activity types have different distributions of morphological types . \n a particularly important result of their analysis is the fact that most absorption galaxies and a significant percentage of liners and transition galaxies are found in elliptical or s0 hosts . \n on the other hand , almost all hii galaxies and a high percentage of seyferts have morphological types sa or later . since the percentage of elliptical galaxies increases with the density of the environment , what is known as the morphology - density effect ( dressler 1980 , charlton et al . \n 1995 ; budavri et al . \n 2003 ) , one would expect to find a higher percentage of elliptical than spiral galaxies with companions . \n as a consequence of this effect , the percentage of liner , transition and absorption galaxies with companions should on average be higher than in the case of seyfert and hii galaxies .    to address this issue we separate our sample into two groups , those with morphological types e and s0 , and those with morphological types sa and later . \n the results are presented in the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig1 ] , respectively . \n the middle panel shows the percentage of early type galaxies with companions , as a function of the separation between the galaxies , where we can see that liner , transition and absorption line galaxies have similar percentages of companions . \n this panel does not include seyfert and hii galaxies because the sample does not have many of these galaxies in ellipticals and s0 s hosts . \n the comparison between late type galaxies shows that all activity classes have similar percentages of galaxies with companions . \n similar results were found by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 2003 ) , using only galaxies with morphological types between sab and sbc . comparing the percentage of early and late type liner s with companions we find a frequency 2 times higher in the former , indicating that the contradictory results obtained using all galaxies in the sample were due to the mismatch of morphological types of the different activity classes . \n finally , we address whether there is a difference in the percentage of seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s with companions . \n laurikainen & salo ( 1995 ) and dultzin - hacyan et al . \n ( 1999 ) found that , when compared to normal galaxies , seyfert 1s have a similar percentage of companions , while for seyfert 2s this percentage doubles . however , as discussed in schmitt et al . \n ( 2001 ) , their results can be attributed to the way their samples were selected , based on ultraviolet excess . since the nucleus of seyfert 2s is hidden from direct view , the amount of ultraviolet emission reflected in our direction is very small , indicating that the ultraviolet excess detected in their seyfert 2s is due to a source outside the torus , like a starburst . since strong star formation is related to interactions ( see next section ) , and a large percentage ( @xmath1640% ) of seyfert galaxies are known to have circumnuclear star formation ( cid fernandes et al . \n 2001 ) , it is likely that their results were influenced by selection effects . \n in fact , schmitt et al . ( 2001 ) show that , when we use a sample of seyfert galaxies selected from an isotropic property , 60@xmath17 m luminosity , both seyfert types have similar percentages of galaxies with companions . more recently , \n ho et al . ( \n 2003 ) found a higher percentage of seyfert 1s than seyfert 2s with companions in the palomar sample . \n nevertheless , they note that this result can be due to the fact that some broad - lined seyfert galaxies in their sample are actually seyfert 2s . due to the high sensitivity of this survey \n , they were able to detect the reflected broad lines in some seyfert 2 galaxies like in ngc1068 , in direct light . \n taking into account cases like this might in fact remove the difference between the two seyfert types . \n the results presented in the previous section indicate that there is no significant difference in the percentage of normal galaxies and low luminosity agns with companions , or in their environments . \n however , one might argue that interactions may be more important for higher luminosity agns , or for sources at higher redshifts . in the case of hii galaxies \n , we find that when we take into account only the objects with l(h@xmath0)@xmath18 erg s@xmath7 in the palomar sample , 65% of them have companions . for comparison \n , this percentage drops to @xmath1630% for lower luminosity sources . \n this result is consistent with those from kennicutt et al . \n ( 1987 ) and keel et al . \n ( 1985 ) , indicating that interactions can be responsible for the enhancement of the luminosity of these galaxies . \n in the case of agns , studies by brown et al . \n ( 2001 ) , miller et al . \n ( 2003 ) and grogin et al . \n ( 2003 ) , based on strong agns at higher redshifts , found that there is no difference in the environment or the number of companions around these galaxies compared to normal ones . \n nevertheless , a different result was obtained by kauffmann et al . \n ( 2004 ) , based on a much larger sample of agns extracted from the sloan survey . \n they found a higher fraction of luminous agn in lower density environments , which indicates that the fraction of galaxies able to host strong agn decreases in high - density environments . \n we saw in the previous sections that there is no difference in the percentage of agns and normal galaxies with companions . combining this fact with the lack of an excess of agns , relative to normal galaxies , with bars or nuclear spirals \n , one can interpret these results as evidence for these mechanisms not being important in the agn feeding process . \n however , a different interpretation , in particular for the case of interactions , have been proposed by several authors ( corbin 2000 ;

hernquist & mihos 1995 ) indicate that an interaction first moves gas toward the nucleus , where its temperature and density increases and a period of strong star formation happens . later on this process \n the gas loses more angular momentum and is accreted by the black hole , with the galaxy being detect as an agn . \n taking into account the fact that all galaxies with bulges are believed to have massive black holes in their nuclei ( magorrian et al . \n 1998 , gebhardt et al . \n 2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) it is reasonable to assume that when an interaction happens they can pass through different periods of activity . \n first one would detect an hii like nucleus , which could later evolve into a period of seyfert activity , when the gas is being accreted by the black hole at a high rate , and finally become a liner or transition galaxy , when the amount of gas available to feed the nucleus is small . \n observational evidence in favor of this scenario comes from the detection of recent star formation , with ages around 100  myr , in the nuclear region of at least 40% of seyfert and liner / hii galaxies \n ( cid fernandes et al . \n 2001 , and this conference ) .    the importance of interactions for the proposed scenario can be tested observationaly . \n a relatively easy test is to compare the asymmetry indices ( conselice 1997 ) of seyfert and normal galaxies . \n if interactions play an important role in feeding agns , one would expect larger asymmetries in seyfert galaxies compared to normal ones , or an evolution of this index from one activity type to another . \n similarly , it is also possible to use hi  21  cm to detect the signature of interactions no longer detectable in optical images . \n the contribution by lim et al . shows the results of such a study , where they find that seyfert galaxies present much more distorted and extended hi emission than normal galaxies . \n it would be important to extend this study to a larger , well defined sample .", "StartTimeOffset": 4885389630796, "RequestID": "99af3a1149f6e9e10d327c2a0322f822df79f792", "TotalTokens": 4001}
{"ContextTokens": 3886, "GeneratedTokens": 202, "SynthesizedBody": "since the discovery of superconductivity in the @xmath0 phase of iron under pressure @xcite , several observations have hinted that the electron pairing has an unconventional origin . \n firstly , the restricted pressure range of the superconducting ( sc ) state is hard to explain by bcs theory @xcite . \n the partial resistive transitions observed implied an unusual sensitivity to disorder , a characteristic property of certain unconventional superconductors . \n proximity to the ferromagnetic phase suggests that spin fluctuations could be involved in the relevant electronic interactions . \n subsequent experiments confirmed the unusual properties of @xmath0-fe . \n an attempt to observe superconductivity in a high purity commercial sample failed _ [ sample # 0 , goodfellow 4n+ , with impurities ( ppm ) : ag @xmath7 1 ; al @xmath7 1;cu @xmath7 1 ; si 1]_. however , to achieve the dimensions necessary for a pressure experiment , the sample had been rolled down to a thickness of around 3@xmath8 m , introducing disorder which significantly raised its residual resistivity . \n further experiments succeeded in obtaining complete superconducting resistive transitions @xcite when special care was taken over the choice of samples and their preparation , to avoid not only chemical impurities but structural disorder due to mechanical work . \n other indications about the nature of the superconductivity come from the normal state resistivity of the @xmath0 phase at low temperature . \n this appeared , at a pressure @xmath9gpa , to follow a @xmath10 power law with a strongly enhanced prefactor over a broad range of temperature , a @xmath11-dependence expected of a nearly ferromagnetic fermi - liquid ( nffl ) . \n the presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations could imply @xmath12-wave triplet superconductivity , a scenario suggested in the case of zrzn@xmath13 @xcite , which has many features in common with iron ( partial resistive transitions , non - fermi liquid power law , sensitivity to disorder ) . \n this stands in contrast with band structure calculations @xcite where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are expected to dominate the ground state , and @xmath12-wave superconductivity is not favoured . \n the nature of the pressure - driven bcc - hcp @xmath14-@xmath0 transition complicates the situation . \n the transition is martensitic @xcite , and its pressure width ( but not its hysteretic behaviour ) is highly dependent on the pressure conditions @xcite . in the quasi - hydrostatic conditions of the steatite medium used in our experiments , where pressure gradients are up to 5% \n , this should lead to a transition spread over at least 10 gpa , very similar to the sc pressure range . \n the superconductivity may therefore be somehow linked with the structural transition itself , rather than being an intrinsic property of the @xmath0 phase . in this series of experiments \n we have not addressed this question , though it may turn out to be a crucial one . \n future studies using different pressure media should help to clarify the issue . \n the high pressure experiments were carried out using the same bridgman anvil technique used for ref . \n the aim of these follow - up measurements was to explore further the role of structural disorder in the appearance or otherwise of superconductivity , and to confirm the non - fermi liquid @xmath10 behaviour of the normal state resistivity in the @xmath0 phase . \n we wished to investigate whether superconductivity could be destroyed , and/or recovered or induced by mechanical work and annealing , respectively . \n there were four samples in this study , three came from the superconducting batches reported in @xcite , one from dresden ( # 6 ) and two from osaka ( # 3,4 ) . \n the remaining sample ( # 5 ) _ [ goodfellow 99.998% fe , impurities ( ppm ) : ag @xmath7 1 ; al @xmath7 1 ; cu @xmath7 1 ; mg 1 ; mn 1 ; ni @xmath7 1 ] _ was obtained from the same commercial metallurgical supplier as # 0 . \n no trace of superconductivity had been found in a previous investigation of sample # 0 , where the residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) was 15 . \n ( the rrr is defined by @xmath15 and used as a measure of sample quality . ) \n the four samples were prepared as follows : + they were rolled down to a thickness appropriate for the pressure experiment(@xmath16 ) . \n initial rrr values of up to 300 were reduced to @xmath1750 by this operation . \n three of the samples ( # 46 ) were subsequently annealed in an induction furnace for 24 hours at 1000@xmath18 in a high vacuum ( @xmath19 ) . \n after annealing , rrrs in the range 245310 were recovered in samples from all sources , and grain sizes comparable to the eventual sample length were observed . \n sample ( # 3 ) was left unannealed . \n the samples were then cut using a razor blade to the appropriate width and length . \n they were arranged in the pressure cell , along with a lead manometer , so that current passed through in series . \n four - point resistance measurements could be carried out separately on each sample . \n a knowledge of the each sample s dimensions enabled the absolute resistivity to be calculated with an error of less than 15% over the whole pressure range , neglecting the compressibility . \n effect of disorder in different samples on the superconducting transition of iron . \n the dashed line suggests the @xmath20 variation vs. @xmath2 . ]    the effect of disorder on the superconducting state can be seen in fig . \n [ fig : tcrho0 ] , where the resistivity of three representative samples # 0 # 1 and # 3 are shown at pressures close to the maximum @xmath21 ; their residual resistivities were 2.13 , 0.77 , and 1.19 @xmath22 respectively . with increasing disorder , measured by @xmath2 , \n the resistive transition becomes only partially complete , then disappears entirely . \n the remaining samples had resistance drops somewhere between # 1 and # 3 . a transition in # 3 , \n the unannealed sample , was only detectable once the pressure had reached 22@xmath23gpa , while the annealed samples started to show signs of superconductivity almost as soon as the structural transition had initiated ( as identified in the room - temperature resistivity ) . rolling and annealing thus have opposite effects , tending to suppress or restore the superconductivity , with associated @xmath2 variation . \n the metallurgical state , rather than the chemical impurity level appears to be the dominant factor . \n sample # 1 , however , exhibited the highest @xmath20 ( @xmath24k ) . \n it was not annealed or rolled , but cut to shape with a diamond saw , implying that the annealing process may introduce some contamination which can affect @xmath25 . \n these results suggest that if @xmath2 can be lowered further , @xmath20 values larger than 2.5@xmath23k could be obtained . \n the resistivity of @xmath0-fe on a @xmath10 scale at selected pressures . \n inset : in a magnetic field @xmath26 = 1 t , the @xmath10 dependence persists below @xmath20 . ]    figure [ fig : rhot53 ] shows the relation @xmath27 in sample # 6 at several pressures , extending up to nearly 35@xmath28 , with the upward deviation at higher temperature ascribed to electron - phonon scattering . similar temperature dependence was seen in the other samples . if the exponent was allowed to vary , a fit of @xmath29 gave @xmath30 between 1.66 and 1.75 over the entire superconducting pressure range . \n there is an evident change with pressure of the residual resistivity @xmath2 , along with the temperature coefficient @xmath3 . \n the inset of fig . \n [ fig : rhot53 ] shows that the @xmath10 law remains valid down to very low temperature when the superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field of 1@xmath23 t . \n the normal - state resistance varied with magnetic field @xmath26 as @xmath31 up to 8@xmath23 t at 4.2@xmath23k and 700@xmath23mk . \n resistivity signature of the @xmath14-@xmath0 transition of iron with increasing pressure at 4.18 k and 293 k. ]    figure [ fig : behr_gf ] shows the resistivity at room temperature and 4.2@xmath23k in a superconducting ( # 6 ) and a non - superconducting sample ( # 0 ) as the pressure is increased . \n the @xmath14-@xmath0 transition is clearly visible at both temperatures , with a substantial increase in @xmath32 . \n however , the martensitic @xmath14-@xmath0 transition should start at @xmath33gpa in a steatite medium according to mssbauer effect experiments @xcite . \n the kink observed in @xmath32 at higher pressures , around 12@xmath23gpa , with no precursor signs is therefore unexpected . \n it could nevertheless be attributed to the disconnection of the conducting @xmath14 region by the growing amount of @xmath0 phase .    after a rounded maximum \n , the resistance at both temperatures drops quickly and more or less linearly with pressure , and in both cases can be extrapolated to the @xmath14-fe values at pressures close to the disappearance of superconductivity . \n the origin of the pressure - induced change in resistivity at room temperature might be due to a change in the electron - phonon coupling , or more likely to the large increase in spin disorder when passing from the magnetically ordered @xmath14-state to the @xmath0 phase . \n the effect of magnetic ordering on the resistivity has been explored in metastable non - magnetic @xmath34-fe at ambient pressure @xcite , where a large difference is found in the room - temperature resistivity between the magnetically ordered and non - magnetic states . \n we might therefore expect @xmath0-fe to be analogous .    at low temperature , where the phonon contribution is negligible , \n the increase in @xmath32 is associated with additional disorder , but the very similar pressure dependence of @xmath32 at these two temperatures suggests that the scattering is at least in part of the same magnetic origin . \n the two samples shown in fig . \n [ fig : behr_gf ] behave similarly at room temperature , apart from a shift ascribed to the residual term . at 4.2@xmath23k , \n interestingly , the increase in resistivity associated with the @xmath35 transition is smaller for a lower @xmath2 . \n single crystalline iron whiskers , which can be prepared with rrrs around 1000 @xcite , therefore offer a good path to obtaining a higher @xmath20 . \n pressure dependence of ( a ) the superconducting transition of various fe samples and ( b ) the @xmath3 coefficient in the law @xmath27 . ] \n figure [ fig : tcanda ] shows @xmath20 as a function of pressure , compared with the @xmath3 coefficient of a fit to the resistivity using a @xmath36 power law in the @xmath14 phase and a @xmath10 law in the @xmath0 phase . \n the @xmath21 phase diagram in ref . \n @xcite is confirmed by our measurements . \n the superconductivity started to emerge exactly at the kink in @xmath37 . \n as the resistive transitions were highly current dependent and partial in most cases , the onset was used as a criteria for @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath20 was defined where the resistivity curve started to deviate visibly from the normal state temperature dependence . \n surprisingly , the onset of superconductivity was found to be much less sensitive to current than other criteria , such as a 50% , or even 1% drop in resistance from the normal state . \n the resistivity drop became larger in every sample as the pressure increased , even beyond the maximum in @xmath20 . \n the very large value of @xmath3 in the sc domain [ fig . \n [ fig : tcanda](b ) ] is evidence of a strongly correlated electronic phase . \n the value of @xmath3 reflects the strength of interaction between the electrons and spin fluctuations , thus the correlation seen between @xmath38 and @xmath21 is strong evidence for a magnetically mediated pairing scenario . \n moreover , there appears to be a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath25 in different samples ( including those not shown ) . \n it is somewhat surprising that the value of @xmath3 would vary between samples , but as they were all measured in the same cell , and their resistivities normalised at ambient pressure , we can have some confidence that this is a genuine observation . \n spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity is usually associated with a well defined quantum critical point at a particular critical pressure @xmath39 , where non - fermi liquid behavior of the resistivity is expected @xcite . \n in contrast , a @xmath36 dependence was never recovered in the entire sc domain in our measurements .    the critical field of @xmath0-fe at selected pressures . \n two @xmath20 criteria are used at 18.6 gpa . ] \n figure [ fig : hc2 ] shows the upper critical field @xmath40 for sample # 6 determined using an onset criterion for @xmath25 . \n the extrapolated value of @xmath41 ( 0.73@xmath23 t at 18.6@xmath23gpa and @xmath42 t at 22.5@xmath23gpa ) is much larger(by a factor of up to 70 ) than that of the lead manometer , which has a nearly identical @xmath20 . \n @xmath40 is also linear , without the usual curvature , at least down to @xmath43 . \n interpretation of this is difficult , because the internal magnetic field in the sample itself may be higher still . \n hints that this is the case come from the current dependence of the resistance within the transition . \n this could be fitted very well to a flux - flow type linear current - voltage relation , accompanied by a small quadratic term , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath6 , and @xmath45 was very small ( an equivalent current density of 0.17  @xmath46 ) , indicating an extremely low pinning density . \n this flux - flow like behaviour was present even with no externally applied magnetic field .    taking a value of 0.73@xmath23 t for @xmath41 , \n the coherence length @xmath47 is around 20@xmath23 nm , which is comparable to the mean free path @xmath48 , derived from band structure calculations @xcite . \n a requirement for the clean limit , i.e. @xmath49 , is another feature of unconventional superconductivity .    the initial slope @xmath50 , which is proportional to the electronic effective mass in a clean limit scenario , appears to be larger for a @xmath12 below the @xmath20 maximum , suggesting a critical region close to the emergence of superconductivity . in any case , @xmath51 reaches values larger than that observed in any other sc element in the periodic table . \n in a narrow pressure window , both the superconductivity and normal phase of iron show features which point to a key role for spin fluctuations . the closest similar example seems to be zrzn@xmath13 ( @xmath52k ) @xcite . \n the higher @xmath25 of iron may result from stronger magnetic interactions , reflected for example in the large curie temperature of iron s ferromagnetic phase . \n experimentally , it is not clear whether superconductivity is an intrinsic property of @xmath0-fe or is related to the martensitic transition . \n iron is the first simple element to be observed exhibiting non - fermi liquid behaviour in its resistivity , and to be a candidate for spin - mediated superconductivity . \n 99 shimizu k , kimura t , furomoto s , takeda k , kontani k , onuki y and amaya k 2001 _ nature _ * 412 * 316 mazin i i , papaconstantopoulos d a and mehl m j 2002 _ phys . \n * 65 * 100511 jarlborg t 2002 _ phys . lett . \n a _ * 300 * 518 jarlborg t cond -

{"ContextTokens": 2270, "GeneratedTokens": 242, "SynthesizedBody": "by virtue of the no - hair theorem , black holes in general relativity are fully and uniquely characterized by only three parameters : their masses , spins , and electrical charges ( israel 1967 , 1968 ; carter 1971 , 1973 ; hawking 1972 ; robinson 1975 ; mazur 1982 ) . \n these objects are described by the kerr - newman metric ( newman et al . \n 1965 ) , which , in the case of astrophysical black holes , reduces to the kerr metric ( kerr 1963 ) , since any net charge quickly neutralizes .    the no - hair theorem , \n then , provides a means to test general relativity by verifying that black holes are indeed kerr black holes . \n several such tests have been suggested to date , which are based on observations of either gravitational waves ( see hughes 2010 for a review ) , electromagnetic emission from accretion flows ( johannsen & psaltis 2010a ) , pulsar - black hole binaries ( wex & kopeikin 1999 ) , the ephemeredes of stars around the supermassive black hole sgr  a * at the galactic center ( will 2008 ) , or of the quasar oj287 ( valtonen et al . 2011 ) .    while tests in the regime of weak gravitational fields can rely on a parameterized post - newtonian formulation ( e.g. , will 1993 ) , strong - field tests require a careful modeling of the black hole spacetime itself in terms of a parametric deviation from the kerr metric . \n these kerr - like spacetimes depend on one or more free parameters in addition to the mass and spin , and signatures of possible violations of the no - hair theorem can be studied as a function of the deviation parameters . \n several parametric deviations have been constructed so far ( e.g. , manko & novikov 1992 ; collins & hughes 2004 ; glampedakis & babak 2006 ; yunes & pretorius 2009 ; vigeland & hughes 2010 ; vigeland , yunes , & stein 2011 ; johannsen & psaltis 2011b ; yagi , yunes & tanaka 2012 ) . \n in this paper , i review the kerr - like black hole spacetime constructed by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) , which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon even for high values of the spin and large deviations from the kerr metric . \n this property makes this metric an ideal framework for strong - field tests the no - hair theorem with observations of the accretion flows of black holes . \n the kerr metric is a stationary , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat , vacuum solution of the einstein field equations and , due to the no - hair theorem , the only spacetime in general relativity that has all of these characteristics . \n kerr - like metrics retain as many of these properties in order to closely mimic the observational appearance of kerr black holes . \n all of them include the kerr metric as the limiting case if the deviation parameters are set to zero .    by construction , \n parametric deviations from the kerr metric are usually stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat . \n if such a metric is also a vacuum solution in general relativity , it either harbors a naked singularity or is plagued with pathological regions in the exterior domain where causality is violated ( see johannsen et al . \n some kerr - like metrics are valid only for small or intermediate values of the black hole spin ( e.g. , glampedakis & babak 2006 ; yunes & pretorius 2009 ) , while others are based on an expansion in the deviation parameters in order to remain a vacuum solution of the einstein equations under certain conditions ( e.g. , vigeland & hughes 2010 ) . \n depending on the desired application , additional metric properties can be important , such as its petrov type ( vigeland et al . \n 2011 ) or violations of parity ( yunes & pretorius 2009 ; yagi et al . \n 2012 ) . \n the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) in boyer - lindquist - like coordinates is given by the line element @xmath0 \\left(1-\\frac{2mr}{\\sigma}\\right)dt^2 -\\frac { 4amr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } [ 1+h(r,\\theta)]dtd\\phi + \\frac { \\sigma[1+h(r,\\theta ) ] } { \\delta + a^2\\sin^2\\theta h(r,\\theta ) } dr^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sigma d\\theta^2 + \\left [ \\sin^2\\theta \\left ( r^2 + a^2 + \\frac { 2a^2 mr\\sin^2\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ) + h(r,\\theta ) \\frac{a^2(\\sigma + 2mr)\\sin^4\\theta } { \\sigma } \\right ] d\\phi^2 , \\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1    this metric is a stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat parametric deviation that describes an actual black hole for all values within the range of spins @xmath2 without relying on an expansion in the deviation parameters @xmath3 and that is regular , i.e. , it is free of any pathologies outside of the event horizon . \n possible nonzero lowest - order deviations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , of the kerr metric are ruled out by current solar - system tests of gravity and by the requirement that the above metric reduces to newtonian gravity far from the black hole . for simplicity \n , i will allow the leading - order coefficient @xmath5 to be the only nonvanishing deviation parameter .    with this choice \n , the shape of the event horizon depends on the values of the spin and the parameter @xmath5 . \n figure  [ properties ] shows the location of the horizon in the @xmath6-plane of a black hole with a value of the spin @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . while the event horizon of a kerr black hole is spherical , the horizon of a black hole in this metric is prolate for positive values of the parameter @xmath5 and oblate for negative values of the parameter @xmath5 . for high values of the spin and values of the parameter @xmath5 exceeding a maximum bound as shown in figure  [ properties ] \n , the central object turns into a naked singularity .    the properties of this spacetime \n make it ideally suited for tests of the no - hair theorem that involve observations of accretion flows . the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) \n is often taken to be the inner edge of geometrically thin accretion disks and can be arbitrarily close to the event horizon in the case of rapidly spinning black holes . since relativistic effects are most prominent in the immediate vicinity of black holes , it is critical that this region is properly modeled by a parametric deviation . since the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) is regular everywhere outside of the horizon , the electromagnetic emission of accretion flows \n can be modeled self - consistently . \n figure  [ properties ] also shows the location of the isco as a function of the spin and the parameter @xmath5 . for increasing values of the spin and the deviation parameter , the radius of the isco approaches the event horizon \n accretion flows of black holes allow us to observe potential violations of the no - hair theorem across the electromagnetic spectrum ( johannsen & psaltis 2010a ) . \n observables include ( a ) the direct imaging of the event horizon with sgr  a * ( johannsen & psaltis 2010b ;

silbergleit et al 2001 ) as a viable model of the quasi - periodic variability observed in both stellar - mass and supermassive black holes ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . \n the effects of potential violations of the no - hair theorem on iron line profiles and quasi - periodic variability may be observed with upcoming or future x - ray missions such as _ astro - h _ , _ athena _ and _ \n loft_.    tests of the no - hair theorem and of general relativity that are based on observations of the accretion flows of black holes require a carefully designed parametric deviation from the kerr spacetime . \n the metric by johannsen & psaltis ( 2011b ) provides the necessary framework and is ideally suited for the description of rapidly - spinning black holes , which are mostly found in nature ( brenneman & reynolds 2009 ; mcclintock et al . \n observational tests of the no - hair theorem can be realized in the near future .", "StartTimeOffset": 4931311636930, "RequestID": "4083f2b093fff1e117d32af3bc5007d46eecf438", "TotalTokens": 2512}
{"ContextTokens": 1693, "GeneratedTokens": 100, "SynthesizedBody": "codex (= cosmic dynamics experiment ) is a concept for an extremely stable , high - resolution optical spectrograph for the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) . \n the science case for codex encompasses a large range of topics , including the search for exo - planets down to earth - like masses , primordial nucleosynthesis and the possible variation of fundamental constants . however , its prime science driver is the exploration of the universal expansion history by detecting and measuring the cosmological redshift drift using qso absorption lines . \n this is also one of the 9 ` prominent ' science cases chosen by the e - elt science working group to be among the highlights of the entire e - elt science case . \n a description of the codex project as a whole was given by @xcite . \n the recognition that an ultra - stable , high - efficiency , high - resolution optical spectrograph would not only be an extremely valuable instrument for the e - elt but also for the vlt led to the development of the espresso concept (= echelle spectrograph for precision super stable observations , see l.  pasquini s contribution to these proceedings ) . \n again , there are a large number of applications for such an instrument , as several other contributions to these proceedings have highlighted . \n hence , there is also a very strong science case for espresso , including e.g.  detailed studies of the intergalactic medium and of stellar abundances . \n however , apart from these scientific drivers , espresso will also fulfil another role : codex will represent a major development in high - resolution optical spectrographs compared to existing instruments such as uves and harps . in order to achieve its science goals codex will have to deliver an exceptional radial velocity accuracy and stability , i.e.  @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 over a timescale of @xmath2  yr . \n although the basic design concepts are already in place , several of the sub - systems needed to achieve the codex requirements do not currently exist . \n however , they will be implemented in espresso for the first time . \n hence , in many respects espresso will be a codex precursor instrument that will allow us to test and gain experience with the novel aspects of these instruments . here \n we will discuss espresso in the context of its codex precursor role , both in a technical sense as well as with respect to the main codex science driver , which we briefly describe next . \n the discovery from type ia sne that the universal hubble expansion appears to have begun accelerating at a relatively recent epoch , and its profound implications for fundamental physics have sparked an intense interest in the observational exploration of the universe s expansion history . \n several methods for measuring the hubble parameter @xmath3 already exist but all of them are either geometric in nature or use the dynamics of localised density perturbations . \n the simplest , cleanest and most direct method of determining the expansion history , however , is to observe the dynamics of the global robertson - walker metric itself . \n one way to achieve this is by measuring the so - called redshift drift , i.e.  the tiny , systematic drift as a function of time in the redshifts of cosmologically distant sources ( fig.[vdot ] ) . \n this effect is directly caused by the de- or acceleration of the universal expansion and can hence be used to determine its history . \n a measurement of this effect would be able to provide evidence of the acceleration that is entirely independent of the snia results or any other cosmological observations , and that does not require any cosmological or astrophysical assumptions at all . \n it would also provide @xmath3 measurements over a redshift range inaccessible by other methods . \n recently , @xcite found that a @xmath4-m telescope would indeed have the photon collecting power to detect the redshift drift by monitoring the redshifts of qso absorption lines over a timescale of @xmath2 years ( fig . \n [ vdot ] ) , providing a strong motivation for a codex - like instrument at the e - elt . \n the uves and harps experiences have allowed us to identify a number of properties that a spectrograph must feature in order to deliver exceptional radial velocity accuracy and long - term stability , including : simultaneous wavelength calibration , a fully passive instrument with zero human access , located inside a vacuum tank which is itself located inside a nested environment in an underground facility that allows progressively more precise temperature and pressure control , and the flux - weighted timing of observations with sub - second precision . \n temperature control of the ccd will be particularly important , while high system throughput will also be of the essence . \n some of these concepts are already established . \n however , two of the most critical aspects are also those requiring the most r&d : light scrambling and wavelength calibration .    at a resolution of @xmath5 a typical pointing accuracy of @xmath6  arcsec corresponds to an error of @xmath7  m  s@xmath1 necessitating a scrambling gain of @xmath8 in order to reach @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 accuracy . hence , in addition to any fibre we will require a dedicated scrambling device to ensure that a photon s position on the ccd only depends on its wavelength but not on its position on the entrance aperture . \n current wavelength calibration sources such as thar lamps and i@xmath9 cells are sub - optimal in several respects , their non - uniformity and lack of long - term stability being among the concerns . however , a new concept for wavelength calibration has recently emerged . a ` laser frequency comb ' \n system provides a series of uniformly spaced , very narrow lines whose absolute positions are known a priori with a relative precision of @xmath10@xmath11 ( see a.  manescau s contribution ; @xcite ) . \n neither of the two systems above currently exist , but they would be developed for espresso . \n being able to test and validate them ` on the sky ' would provide valuable experience and input for further improvements . \n the scientific goals of codex are sufficiently removed from current observational reality to require validation and demonstration of feasibility of all aspects of data handling and analysis . \n this includes data acquisition strategies ( e.g.  minimum and maximum viable exposure times ) , the tracking of ccd distortions , and the accuracy of flat - fielding , sky subtraction and scattered light corrections . \n the extraction of the cosmological signal from the data will also require testing . \n issues include how to deal with qso variability and the accuracy of the conversion to the cosmological reference frame . \n in addition espresso will allow us to determine the currently unknown intrinsic widths of the narrowest metal absorption lines in order to reassess their usefulness for the drift experiment , and to look for any sources of astrophysical noise so far overlooked . \n data on qsos collected with espresso for other scientific purposes would allow us to address all of the above issues . \n we estimate that @xmath12 hours of observations of the brightest known qsos would provide an end - to - end system verification , from data acquisition to signal extraction , at the level of @xmath13@xmath14  cm  s@xmath1 . \n since espresso will have characteristics similar to those of codex the question arises whether espresso can be used to make a start on the redshift drift experiment . \n the idea is that since espresso would be available several years before codex data appropriately collected with espresso could serve as a ` zeroth ' epoch measurement , effectively extending the time baseline of the experiment for a few years , thereby improving the final result without delaying it . \n [ ol_om ] shows the comparison of the cosmological constraints in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane expected from a drift experiment using codex only ( coloured ellipses ) and codex + espresso ( solid contour ) , where we have assumed that espresso would take up operation @xmath18 years before codex . \n evidently the extension of the time baseline by @xmath18 years is not enough to offset the lack of the vlt s photon collecting power compared to the e - elt : the improvement of the constraints is only quite modest , with the lower limit on @xmath16 increasing by @xmath2 per cent .", "StartTimeOffset": 4939756293964, "RequestID": "5a32e051d2409356d999809685d1fa78499e1974", "TotalTokens": 1793}

ngc  3516 : @xcite ; ngc  5548 : @xcite , @xcite ; mrk  509 : @xcite , @xcite ; ngc  7469 : @xcite ) . \n the x - ray absorbing gas itself contains material spanning a large range of ionization parameters @xcite , and it is likely that this broad range of physical conditions can also include the uv - absorbing ions . \n this is a natural prediction of the thermally driven wind model of @xcite , and would also be likely in disk - driven winds .    to address some of these questions , \n we have been conducting a survey of the @xmath5 brightest agn using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. the short wavelength response ( 9121187  ) of _ fuse _ @xcite enables us to make high - resolution spectral measurements ( @xmath6 ) of the high - ionization ion o  vi and the high - order lyman lines of neutral hydrogen . as of november 1 , 2002 , we have observed a total of 87 agn . of these , \n 57 have @xmath7 , so that the o  vi doublet is visible in the _ fuse _ band . \n the o  vi  doublet is a crucial link between the higher ionization absorption edges seen in the x - ray and the lower ionization absorption lines seen in earlier uv observations . \n the high - order lyman lines provide a better constraint on the total neutral hydrogen column density than ly@xmath8 alone . \n lower ionization species such as c  iii and n  iii also have strong resonance lines in the  band , and these often are useful for setting constraints on the ionization level of any detected absorption . \n the lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen also fall in the  band , and we have searched for ( but not found ) intrinsic @xmath9 absorption that may be associated with the obscuring torus . \n as shown in the left panel of figure 1 , absorption is common at all luminosities , and over 50% ( 30 of 53 ) of the low - redshift type 1 agn observed using  show detectable o  vi  absorption , comparable to those seyferts that show longer - wavelength uv @xcite or x - ray @xcite absorption . \n none show intrinsic @xmath9 absorption . \n we see three basic morphologies for o  vi  absorption lines : ( 1 ) * single * : 13 of 30 objects exhibit single , narrow , isolated o  vi  absorption lines , as illustrated by the spectrum of ton  s180 @xcite . \n pg0804 + 761 , shown in the top panel of figure 2 , is another example . \n ( 2 ) * blend * : multiple o  vi  absorption components that are blended together . \n 10 of 30 objects fall in this class , and the spectrum of mrk  279 is typical @xcite . \n the middle panel of figure 2 shows mrk 478 as another example . \n ( 3 ) * smooth * : the 7 objects here are an extreme expression of the  blend \" class , where the o  vi  absorption is so broad and blended that individual o  vi  components can not be identified . \n ngc  4151 typifies this class @xcite . \n the mini - bal qso pg1411 + 442 is another example of this class , shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 . \n individual o  vi  absorption components in our spectra have fwhm of 50750 , with most objects having fwhm @xmath10 . \n the multiple components that are typically present are almost always blue shifted , and they span a velocity range of 2004000 ; half the objects span a range of @xmath11 . \n as shown in the right panel of figure 1 , the maximum outflow velocities show a tendency to increase with source luminosity , perhaps indicating that radiative acceleration plays some role in the dynamics . \n note also that there is a population of low - velocity absorbers present at all luminosities . \n the multiple kinematic components frequently seen in the uv absorption spectra of agn clearly show that the absorbing medium is complex , with separate uv and x - ray dominant zones . in some cases \n , the uv absorption component corresponding to the x - ray warm absorber can be clearly identified ( e.g. , mrk  509 , @xcite ) . in others , however , _ no _ uv absorption component shows physical conditions characteristic of those seen in the x - ray absorber ( ngc  3516 , @xcite ; ngc  5548 , @xcite ) . \n one potential geometry for this complex absorbing structure is high - density , low - column uv - absorbing clouds embedded in a low - density , high - ionization medium that dominates the x - ray absorption . \n disk - driven winds are a possible explanation for some cases of agn outflows . by analogy to stellar winds , one would expect the terminal velocity of an agn outflow to reflect the gravity of its origin . \n disk - driven winds should therefore have velocities in the range of several thousand . \n objects with broad , smooth profiles might fall in this category . \n the geometry proposed by @xcite suggests that these objects should have only modest inclinations . \n however , two prime examples of seyferts with broad smooth absorption troughs , ngc 3516 @xcite and ngc 4151 @xcite , are likely the highest inclination sources in our sample given their extended , bi - conical narrow emission - line region morphologies @xcite and their opaque lyman limits @xcite . \n the lower velocities we observe in objects like ngc 3783 and ngc 5548 are more compatible with thermally driven winds from the obscuring torus @xcite . in these thermally driven winds , \n photoionized evaporation in the presence of a copious mass source ( the torus ) locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to total gas pressure ( the ionization parameter @xmath12 ) at a critical value . for agn \n spectral energy distributions lacking a strong extreme ultraviolet bump , such as the composite spectra of quasars assembled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the ionization equilibrium curve exhibits an extensive vertical branch . \n thus , at the critical ionization parameter for evaporation , there is a broad range of temperatures that can coexist in equilibrium at nearly constant pressure . \n for this reason , the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous . \n outflow velocities are typical of the sound speed in the heated gas , or several hundred , comparable to the velocities seen in many agn .    in summary , we find that o  vi  absorption is common in low - redshift ( @xmath7 ) agn . \n 30 of 53 type 1 agn with @xmath7 observed using  show multiple , blended o  vi  absorption lines with typical widths of @xmath13 that are blueshifted over a velocity range of @xmath14 1000 . \n those galaxies in our sample with existing x - ray or longer wavelength uv observations also show c  iv absorption and evidence of a soft x - ray warm absorber . \n in some cases , a uv absorption component has physical properties similar to the x - ray absorbing gas , but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between the uv and x - ray absorbing components .", "StartTimeOffset": 4947569535553, "RequestID": "842a1d7810dc64da59ac8f4ea7c605bc5d2dda25", "TotalTokens": 2767}

relativistic limit is described by the famous kompaneets equation @xcite @xcite . \n the analysis of the results obtained through the hot electron gas in the cluster through the use of this equation are well - known @xcite-@xcite . \n nevertheless , it was soon realized by many authors , including sunyaev himself , that due to the very small probability that an incoming photon is scattered even once in its passage through the gas , a compton - like scattering of a photon off an electron was a much more suitable mechanism to explain the effect . \n this trend of ideas has been recently reviewed by dolgov et al @xcite where the reader may find more literature about the subject . \n the somewhat intriguing result is that both approaches lead to identical results , a fact that needs further clarification . \n we address this question in this paper . \n secondly , the role of the optical depth @xmath1 , related to the distance a photon can travel in the plasma before it is scattered off an electron , plays in the way the broadening of the spectral lines of the scattered photon is modified by the doppler effect , has not yet been justified in a convincing manner . here \n we address this question form an entirely different point of view . \n and thirdly , we also show that this different interpretation of @xmath1 also leads to the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect in a rather trivial way . \n we begin our discussion by establishing a general expression for the full distorted spectrum , @xmath2 of the scattered radiation off the plasma . \n let @xmath1 be the optical depth as discussed above . \n this quantity is a direct measure of the probability that a photon is scattered off an electron in the gas . \n thus , since the effect is small , @xmath3 is the probability that the photon traverses the plasma unscattered . \n therefore , @xmath4 \\,d\\bar{\\nu } \\end{array } \\label{uno}\\ ] ] the first term in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) is self - explanatory , the lower limit justified since @xmath5 , the incoming flux is zero for negative frequencies . \n the second term , the important one , defines a gaussian probability function describing scattering of a photon with incoming frequency @xmath6 off an electron whose average kinetic energy in the gas , in the non - relativistic approximation is @xmath7 . \n this function has been thoroughly discussed in earlier work @xcite so we shall not discuss it here further . in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) the incoming flux is given , for @xmath8 by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the temperature of the cosmic background radiation , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath12 is planck s constant , and @xmath13 the speed of light . \n further , @xmath14 is the width of the spectral line at frequency @xmath15 and its squared value reads @xcite : @xmath16 in eq.([dos ] ) @xmath17 is the temperature of the electron scatterers , @xmath18 is the electron mass and @xmath19 for @xmath20 . \n notice should be made of the fact that the mathematical expression for @xmath21 corresponds to what in the literature is called the inverse compton scattering @xcite . \n in particular , this is the reason of the factor @xmath22 in such equation . to show this fact we take into account the frequency distribution function for photons with incoming frequency @xmath23 isotropically scattered by electrons with velocities @xmath24@xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the expected value for the photon frequency at fixed @xmath27 is then given by : @xmath28 direct application of the equipartition energy theorem allows us to identify @xmath29 @xmath30 . \n physically , this implies that a typical photon scattered off an electron will have a temperature dependent blue shift simply given by @xmath31 . \n it is interesting to notice that a similar `` frequency shift approach '' leads to the analytical well known expression of the kinematic sz effect . \n this is shown in the appendix . \n ( [ uno ] ) can be evaluated analytically leading to an expression which is identical to the one reported in the literature . setting in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) @xmath32 we get that @xmath33 \\,d\\alpha \\label{cinco}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 since @xmath35 is a small number @xcite and @xmath36 is an analytical function of @xmath15 we may expand the integrand in eq . \n ( [ cinco ] ) in a taylor series : @xmath37 all odd powers of @xmath38 yield zero upon integration so , after a straightforward calculation , we get that @xmath39 to first order in @xmath40 @xmath35  we reproduce _ exactly _ the analytic expression for the distortion curve @xcite-@xcite . \n it is also interesting to notice that , taking into account the second order terms in @xmath35 included in eq . \n ( [ ocho ] ) , the crossover frequency @xmath41 corresponding to the solution of equation @xmath42 is now clearly dependent on the value of @xmath35 namely , on the electron temperature , a feature not ordinarily recognized for a non -

emission process of photons by electrons to first order in @xmath35 . \n the problem posed in ref . \n @xcite requiring an explanation of why two different mechanisms lead to the same result is now mathematically solved . \n finally , we want to stress that it is now clear why the curves describing the thermal sz effect obtained by numerical integration of different mathematical expressions turn out to be identical . \n we therefore expect that the relativistic sz effect and other photon scattering problems in hot plasmas can be handled by a similar procedure . \n the central idea of the convolution integral approach to cmbr distortions is that , in a dilute gas , a scattering law @xmath52 is given by what in statistical physics is known as the _ \n dynamic structure factor _ , where @xmath53 and @xmath15 are the corresponding incoming / outcoming photon frequencies . \n then , one computes the distorted occupation number through the convolution integral @xmath54 with @xmath55 in the non -

, if there are extra resonators side coupling to the optical cavity cells of the crow , fano interference can lead to a large change of bandwidth of the system when a small refractive index modulation is employed@xcite . \n the velocity of light can therefore be dynamically slowed down and even stopped . unlike the case of eit the light is coherently stored in a static way in the resonance cavity

coupled optomechanical crystals , shown in figure 1 . the single optomechanical crystal cell , co - localizing photonic and phononic resonances in a quasi one - dimensional optomechanical crystal , is proposed by the research group led by painter@xcite . \n the mechanical modes of the optomechanical crystal cell can be divided into common and differential modes of in - plane and out - plane motion of these nanobeams . for simplicity \n , we just consider the case that the gaps between the nanobeams are time - independent , i.e. the common mode case . \n therefore the coupling between neighboring optical cavities is constant . to excite the system , \n a probe optical signal is dropped in the optomechanical array in a side - coupled configuration , and the output signal is dropped out in a similar manner . with this consideration , the hamiltonian of the system in the reference frame rotating with probe laser frequency @xmath1 can be written as    [ h ] @xmath2here @xmath3 and

evanescently coupling of intercavity .    when the intracavity fields have a large amplitude , i.e. in the strong - driving limit , we can linearize the hamiltonian by setting @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 is the steady mean value and @xmath13 is the corresponding fluctuation around its steady value . with this ansatz , \n we then obtain the linearized hamiltonian    @xmath14    where the

@xmath35the hamiltonian will have the diagonalized form    @xmath36    from eqs . \n ( [ ckdk ] ) and ( [ hk ] ) one can note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 operators represent two types of elementary excitations ( phonon - photon polaritons ) in coupled optomechanical array system , which is the result of the coherently mixing of photons and phonons through coupling in each optomechanics cell . \n the dispersion relations of lower and upper branches polaritons are determined by    @xmath37    it is found that the original single optical band structure is split into two bands owing to the interaction between photons and phonons . \n the bandwidths of lower and upper branches , respectively , are @xmath38where    @xmath39    with the detuning @xmath40 . compared to the original optical band , \n the bandwidth of the lower branch polariton is enlarged and the upper one is compressed . moreover \n , the most important thing is that both of these bandwidths of lower and upper bands can be modulated by changing parameters , such as @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath42 . \n figure figure2 shows a typical picture of the bandwidth of lower branch polariton dependent on @xmath42 , from which one can note that the bandwidth decreases with increasing @xmath42 . in more detail , when @xmath43 , the bandwidth of lower band @xmath44 , corresponding to the maximum bandwidth ; when @xmath45 , the bandwidth is approximately equal to zero . \n the insets are the corresponding band structures of polariton when detuning ( a)@xmath46 ; ( b ) @xmath47 and ( c ) @xmath48 . \n @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . here \n @xmath42 is in units of @xmath9 . \n , width=307 ]    on the other hand , it is known that the group velocity of polaritons in a lattice is related with dispersion    @xmath52    which is also dependent on parameters @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath53 and therefore can be tuned . \n such a tunable band structure leads to a tunable group velocity . \n figure [ figure3 ] shows the lower branch polariton with a momentum @xmath54 . \n we observe its group velocity decreases rapidly from its maximum value @xmath9 and vanishes as @xmath42 increases . \n in fact , such tunable band structure can play an important role in optical communication and quantum memory , for example , fan suggested using a tunable crow to slow and stop light pulse@xcite . \n .,width=307 ]    here we briefly demonstrate the process , taking the lower branch polariton as an example , to slow the light pulse in optomechanical crystal array . to begin with \n , the optical cavity is adjusted to be resonant with laser frequency , so the detuning is @xmath55 . at this point \n , the bandwidth of lower branch is largest and can accommodate the entire light pulse , and the lower branch polariton is made up of photons , shown in figure [ figure4 ] . \n after the pulse enters completely into the optomechanical array , we then compress the bandwidth of lower branch polariton adiabatically by tuning the resonance frequency of the optical cavity until @xmath56 . further compressing the bandwidth , more and more photons are converted to mechanical modes in the lower branch \n , meanwhile , the velocity of polaritons slows down and approaches to zero .    from the point of conversion between photons and mechanical collective excitations \n , one can also understand the mechanism of stoping light . \n because the total excitations number @xmath57 commutes with hamiltonian @xmath58 , when adjusting some parameters , such as @xmath53 , the total excitations number is conserved , while the numbers of photons and mechanical collective excitations @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not conserved due to not commuting with the hamiltonian . \n hence the photons and mechanical collective excitations are mutually convertible , which results in mapping the light onto the mechanical vibration and vice versa . \n figure [ figure4 ] illustrates that the conversion between the photons and mechanical collective excitations . the number of mechanical collective excitation increases , from zero to unity , while the number of photons decrease from unity to zero , with increasing the detuning @xmath42 .     and \n @xmath32 represent the ratio of photons and phonons in the lower branch polariton . \n solid and dashed lines represents @xmath61 and @xmath31 respectively . \n other parameters are the same as in fig . \n [ figure2].,width=307 ]    we keep in mind that the rate of tuning cavity frequency should be less than the band gap between upper and lower branches , which is given by    @xmath62    this limitation avoids the polaritons in lower branch jumping up to the upper branch . \n figure [ figure5 ] shows that the band gap first linearly decreases and then linearly rises with increasing the detuning @xmath42 . \n the minimum value of band gap is about @xmath63 when the detuning of optical cavity is resonant with mechanical resonator .    . \n other parameters are the same as in fig . \n [ figure2].,width=307 ]    to practically stop light in the coupled optomechanics array , we tune the detuning between optical cavity field and probe laser by adjusting the refractive index of material , e.g . \n si , which makes up of the optomechanical crystal . in our scheme \n , the amplitude of detuning modulation is the same order of magnitude of the mechanical resonance frequency , so the refractive index shift should be    @xmath64    which is feasible in practical optoelectronic devices@xcite . here \n we have taken the typical parameters @xmath65 thz , @xmath66 ghz@xcite . \n we have studied the model of light transmission in a spatial periodic optomechanical crystal array . \n the optical cavities of the array evanescently couple to each other one by one to form a crow . in the strong driving limit , we linearized the system and obtained the dispersion relations of lower and upper branch polaritons with bogoliubov transformation in the momentum space . \n our results show that the modulation of detuning between optical cavity and laser light can vary the bandwidths of polaritons , which has been demonstrated to be able to stop and release a light pulse . \n we thank andrew bolt for polishing english .", "StartTimeOffset": 4970446857954, "RequestID": "6da440b35642837a46b45e501f12588a0b93ac63", "TotalTokens": 3159}

photon correlation and to determine entanglement . \n the effects of finite pulse duration , chirping and pulse sequence on these quantities can be studied . \n we also analyze the effects of pulses on the contributions of the noise operators compared to the initial operators . \n the solutions eqs . \n ( [ ak sol ] ) and ( [ aq sol ] ) are linear combinations of initial field operators and atomic noise operators . \n thus , the two -

photon state @xmath68 @xcite . for raman - eit scheme which shows nonclassical correlation , \n the coefficient is _ inseparable _ \n @xmath69 @xcite . \n thus , one might expect to find entanglement in the steady state as well as in the transient . \n however , we find no entanglement for the raman - eit scheme at all times and with any control field @xmath70 and phase @xmath71 of the laser . \n we emphasize that the inseparability of @xmath72 only implies correlation , and may not give entanglement depending on the complex phase @xmath73 of @xmath59 through @xcite @xmath74 which relates the quantity @xmath67 with normalized correlation @xmath75 . \n = 8.8 cm    = 8.8 cm \n based on the results , we discuss the effects of laser pulses on nonclassical photon correlation , entanglement and the contribution of quantum noise . \n several interesting effects are found for excitations with ultrashort pulses . \n first , let us compare the results ( fig . \n [ cwpulsedrr ] ) with c.w . \n lasers and pulsed lasers for identical and resonant lasers : @xmath76 referred to as _ double resonant raman _ ( drr ) . \n continuous wave lasers give a fresnel - like oscillations between classical and quantum regimes , showing no apparent nonclassical correlation ( fig . \n [ cwpulsedrr]a ) . \n the oscillations have a period @xmath77 , are due to optical nutation @xcite which do not show up in the case of pulsed excitations due to the adiabaticity . \n laser pulses give nonclassical correlation much larger ( fig . \n [ cwpulsedrr]b ) than the correlation from c.w . laser . \n this is one of the main results . \n the correlation increases substantially for pulse width @xmath78 shorter than @xmath79 ( fig . \n [ widthrc]a ) . \n the physical explanation comes from two points : a ) a short pulse carries a large bandwidth . \n b ) correlation is a measure of the amount of spectral interrelation between the stokes and anti - stokes photons \n .      pulses with finite detunings @xmath80 produce large nonclassical correlation ( fig . \n [ widthrc]b ) . here , \n the bandwidth of the generated pulses of photons are enhanced by another mechanism ( in addition to the short pulse duration ) ; i.e. the spontaneous raman processes from the two laser pulses . however , for c.w . \n case , the correlation does not depend on the rabi frequencies regardless of whether there is detuning or not . \n = 8.6 cm      we now analyze the effects of chirping of the pulses . \n we consider the chirped carrier frequency of the form @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . \n figure [ chirp]a serves to remind the spectral content of positively chirped and negatively chirped pulses . when the pulses are chirped identically ( @xmath83 ) , there is no significant effect on the correlation ( fig . [ \n chirp]b ) . for opposite chirping ( @xmath84 ) and sufficiently large @xmath85 \n , the correlation shows a peak . \n this can be understood qualitatively from fig . \n [ chirp]a . \n the two - spectral  wings  span an effectively broad spectrum of photons that resulted in a large correlation \n . the correlation can be further enhanced by displacing the control pulse slightly such that both pulses overlap partially . \n this yield an extremely large transient `` correlation pulse '' . if the pulses are entirely separated , the chirping has no enhancement effect on the correlation . \n the raman - eit scheme has a very large @xmath86 at times much smaller than the lifetime @xmath87 , but decays rapidly to zero for large times , corresponding to steady state photon antibunching found in previous studies @xcite . \n figure [ entanglepulse ] shows the entanglement for different pulse sequences for drr scheme \n .      the _ symmetrical _ initial condition @xmath88 that gives quantum correlation does not give entanglement . \n we obtain entanglement with a different initial condition @xmath89 . \n this initial condition ensures that stokes photon is produced first before an anti - stokes photon since there is little or no population in level @xmath90 . \n but a more important point that explains entanglement is that , the state of the atom which generates the anti - stokes photon carries quantum information about the stokes photon . the simultaneous excitations by lasers ensures that both stokes and anti - stokes are driven with the same phase . \n this explains how _ identical _ lasers configuration and @xmath89 can generate entangled photon pairs . \n = 8.0 cm    = 8.8 cm      the increased spectral bandwidth due to the pulses may be favorable for the correlation ( see fig . [ cwpulsedrr]b ) but not for the entanglement . _ coincident pulses _ give entanglement while partially overlapping pulses in both intuitive and counter - intuitive sequences do not give entanglement . \n figure [ dwidthrc ] illustrates how the entanglement parameter @xmath67 varies with pulse width @xmath91 and laser field @xmath92 for drr scheme . \n the oscillatory feature implies that the presence of entanglement could be very sensitive to the variations of @xmath91 and @xmath92 . \n our analysis shows that the oscillations in the transient entanglement can be understood via the pulse area concept . \n the parameter @xmath67 is phase sensitive @xcite and would be affected by the amplitude @xmath93 of the pulse area which manifests as a phase . \n = 8.7 cm      figures [ noiseraman]a , c show the stokes photon number for single raman transition with only the pump field . \n as expected , the contribution of quantum noise is significant for resonant pump field ( fig . [ noiseraman]a ) but negligible for spontaneous raman ( weak and far detuned pump ) ( fig . [ \n noiseraman]c ) . \n this shows that quantum noise is important and contributes to the photon numbers when the field is resonant and gives rise to spontaneous emission . \n if a pump pulse is used instead , the stokes photon number increases significantly but the proportion of the noise contribution is reduced ( fig . [ noiseraman]b ) . \n this can be understood : the pump pulse corresponds to a range of frequencies , but only the resonant frequency contributes significantly to the noise through spontaneous emission while most frequencies that are off - resonant undergo spontaneous raman process which gives very little noise .    when a resonant c.w \n . control field is applied ( in addition to the pump field ) we have anti - stokes photons in the raman - eit ( electromagnetic induced transparency ) scheme ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) @xcite . \n the contribution of the noise to the stokes photon number becomes significant despite the large pump detuning ( see fig . \n [ noiseraman]d ) . \n this seems surprising , but can be explained as due to the _ noise in population _ level @xmath96 due to the spontaneous emission noise of the anti - stokes photons . \n to summarize , we have presented a method to obtain exact solutions of photon operators that include quantum noise . \n the method enables exact computation of a variety of quantities that involve products of photon operators such as photon correlation , entanglement and squeezing in the _ transient regime . _ \n the results enable us to study the effects of pulsed excitations on the nonclassical photon correlation and entanglement . \n short laser pulses produce much larger quantum correlation compared to c.w \n the correlation profile is essentially independent of laser field for resonant pulses . \n finite detuning of the pulses can very large correlation . \n most importantly , we have studied how the laser pulses parameters like chirping , duration and pulse sequence can give an extremely large nonclassical photon correlation . \n chirping of the pump and the control lasers in an opposite manner increases the correlation . \n the correlation increases further for partially overlapping pulses . \n we provided explanation based on the spectral content and large bandwidth of the laser pulses that conspire to enhance the photon correlation . \n we learned that the initial condition of the atom determines the transient entanglement and correlation . \n we explained how identical _ _  _ _ lasers configuration and initial condition @xmath89 can generate entangled photon pairs . \n we apply the pulse area concept to explain why the transient entanglement varies ( oscillates ) with pulse width and the laser field . \n we have also found that the laser pulses tend to reduce the contribution of quantum noise to the photon number . \n all these results provide conceptual insights that show the significance of pulsed excitations on quantum properties .", "StartTimeOffset": 4973999943989, "RequestID": "d21d21048cec158c043a67a349cc7e7e14263713", "TotalTokens": 3935}
{"ContextTokens": 3919, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "the sun has provided us with a problem that has puzzled researchers for many decades . \n the solar corona has a sustained temperature of the order of one million kelvin , three orders of magnitude higher than the photosphere . on top of \n that the corona shows magnetic structures in the form of loops reaching high into the corona through several pressure scale heights while still being below the resolution limit of the best instruments available at the appropriate wavelengths . \n even though several heating processes could be at work , with bulk heating largely independent of the mechanism creating the slender loops , both effects are concentrated around active regions , and there are therefore strong indications that they are related . \n if the bulk and loop heating mechanisms are actually the same , the heating mechanism must operate partly on scales smaller than the resolution limit of 1.0(@xmath0 725 km ) of the trace instrument @xcite in order to explain the high reaching slender loops , and partly on scales comparable to the size of an active region . \n both the bulk heating and the loops are believed to be related to magnetic processes , but identifying the main contributing effects has proven difficult . \n coronal active regions need a continuous thermal energy input of @xmath1 in order to counter thermal conduction and x - ray losses at coronal temperatures . \n several heating mechanisms have been proposed , among them wave dissipation , direct current ( dc ) dissipation , and nano  flares . \n wave dissipation is only possible for alfvn waves , since the other magneto  sonic wave modes are diffracted and dissipated by the strong wave speed gradient in the chromosphere region . to make alfvn waves dissipate their energy in the corona is not easy and the physical requirements are hard to meet . \n direct current dissipation is relatively easy to realize , but it has been unknown whether it is possible to induce enough current in the observed , nearly potential magnetic field configuration , and at the correct heights . \n flares have until recently been a promising candidate , but observations now seem to indicate that the power in the observed nano  flares is insufficient ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n the dc heating mechanism appears to be the most promising one . \n it was proposed 30 years ago @xcite , and has received a lot of attention over the years ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * to mention just a few ) . \n these works have generally argued that the mechanism is feasible , but have been unable to actually demonstrate that it works , in the sense that it produces the right amount of heating , and the observed type of coronal structures . \n an important step forward was taken when @xcite and @xcite showed that the dissipation does not depend on , or depends only very weakly on the magnetic reynolds number ( or equivalently , the resolution of numerical experiments ) .    as pointed out by @xcite and others , \n it is necessary to deal with the correct geometry and stratification in order to verify or falsify a proposed mechanism . \n one can not , for example , hope to reproduce the distribution of heating along the length of loops without representing the loop geometry reasonably correctly . \n in addition , since the main cooling mechanisms depend strongly on topology ( for thermal conduction ) and on density stratification ( for radiative cooling ) , it is obvious that the question of coronal heating can only be answered by employing a sufficiently realistic setup . \n we use a 3d magneto - hydro - dynamics ( mhd ) code @xcite to simulate a typical scaled down active region , including a simple photospheric driving and starting with a potential field extrapolation from an mdi magnetogram , in order to investigate if the convective motions of the solar photosphere are sufficient to heat the corona through magnetic field line braiding . \n we conclude that even though the magnetic field remains not far from a potential field configuration , the convective driving is all that is needed to heat the corona and produce hot loops such as those seen in , e.g. , the trace 171  filter , through a dc heating mechanism . \n the numerical code uses 6th order differential operators and 5th order translational operators on a staggered mesh to solve the fully compressible mhd equations . \n radiative cooling @xcite and spitzer conductivity @xcite along the magnetic field are included in the energy equation . \n the velocity field at the lower boundary is updated through a procedure that smoothly changes horizontal velocities for a given scale from one random pattern to another over a turn - over time appropriate for each scale . \n the horizontal velocity pattern is generated from a velocity potential with randomly phased 2-d fourier components , with amplitudes that follow a power law @xmath2 . \n the velocity power spectrum is then @xmath3 , typical velocities at scales @xmath4 are @xmath5 , and the corresponding turn - over times @xmath6 . \n we choose to set @xmath7 , which is consistent with observed super granulation and granulation turnover times ; @xmath8 hours at scales @xmath8 mm , and @xmath9 s at scales @xmath10 mm , respectively . \n a power spectrum @xmath11 is also consistent with the large scale part of the power spectrum in well established simulations of convection on granular and meso granular scales @xcite . at smaller scales the granulation velocity power deviates from @xmath11 , peaking at @xmath12 and decreasing at even larger @xmath13 . \n these scales are , however , below the horizontal resolution of the present experiment . \n we increased the velocity field amplitude by about a factor two , relative to the rms horizontal velocity from convection simulations , in order to counter the effects of our extended chromosphere and transition region ( see section [ initialcond ] ) . \n it remains to be seen if future simulations , with improved vertical and horizontal resolution , will be able to achieve similar results while using a properly normalized velocity power spectrum . \n the initial conditions were resolved on a uniform grid with 111 points in the vertical direction @xmath14 , including 11 `` ghost zones '' , and @xmath15 grid points in the horizontal ( periodic ) directions @xmath16 . \n the grid spans a volume @xmath17 excluding ghost zones , giving a resolution of 0.3 mm vertically and 0.5 mm horizontally .    the requirements of having a high plasma beta ( @xmath18 ) at the lower boundary , while at the same time reaching the much lower coronal pressures across a thin chromosphere , gives a resolution problem not easily solved on a uniform grid , and requires a compromise . \n we chose to extend the thickness of the `` chromosphere '' to about 4 mm , in order to be able to cover the large change of pressure there with about one point per scale height . \n this solution has the side effect that if the heating decreases exponentially with height ( as seems to be the case ; see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , we underestimate the heating . \n our chromosphere is roughly 1.5 mm thicker than the val models of the solar chromosphere @xcite . \n the corresponding decrease of the heating is approximately compensated for by our increase in velocity driving amplitude . \n the lower boundary and photosphere is kept at a constant temperature @xmath19 . \n the upper boundary is kept at the initial temperature ( @xmath20 ) during the start - up phase . thereafter \n a vanishing vertical derivative of temperature is assumed , thus enforcing a vanishing vertical component of the thermal conductive flux there . \n the initial condition for the magnetic field is derived from a magnetogram of active region 9114 , observed near disc center by trace and by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) on august 8 , 2000 . \n the original magnetogram was cropped at a perimeter chosen to intersect a minimum of magnetic field , and was then made periodic by taking a fourier transform . \n the physical range of the observed active region was then scaled down from @xmath21 mm to 50 mm in order to fit in the computational domain , while still having magnetic structures on even the smallest scales . \n this was done because the details of the magnetic field are not terribly important , since we did not try to reenact the dynamics of ar9114 in particular . \n we are satisfied to have a reasonable realistic initial distribution of the magnetic field in our model , and aim rather at studying the generic behavior of active regions . \n the initial magnetic field was obtained by making a potential extrapolation from the vertical magnetic field from the magnetogram . in the subsequent evolution \n , the magnetic field at the boundary evolves under the control of the random horizontal velocity field , specified as explained above . \n the vertical velocity is assumed to vanish at the boundary . \n the horizontal velocity field is divergence free by construction , so the evolution corresponds to moving the foot points of the magnetic field around , while conserving the magnetic flux density . \n after an initial start - up phase the simulation evolves towards a quasi - stationary configuration with a hot tenuous corona with temperatures of the order a million k. the horizontally averaged temperature peaks at about @xmath22 mk , about 6 mm above the transition zone . \n maximum temperatures @xmath23 mk are reached about 10 mm above the transition zone , where the average temperature is @xmath24 mk ( these are mentioned merely as examples  the detailed numbers are expected to vary between active regions ) . \n the temperature , density , pressure , electric current density , and velocity all vary considerably across horizontal planes , but tend to vary much less dramatically along magnetic field lines . \n the average density at a height of 10 mm above the transition zone is @xmath25 g@xmath26 , or about @xmath27 atoms per @xmath26 . \n the maximum density is typically 2030 times higher ; i.e. , around 23@xmath28 @xmath26 . \n the large variation of density and temperature between magnetic field lines is the main cause of the appearance of loop  like structures in fig . \n [ trace171.fig ] . \n the chromosphere and transition region turn out to be of crucial importance , as predicted by @xcite . \n the root mean square electric current decreases exponentially by almost three orders of magnitude in the lower chromosphere . \n there , the magnetic field is non  force  free , with a very intermittent lorentz force that interacts with both gas pressure gradients and inertial forces .    in the upper chromosphere \n the magnetic field gradually becomes nearly force  free , and therefore the scale height of the @xmath29 distribution approaches that of @xmath30 ( cf . \n [ j2distr.fig ] ) . \n even though there are large variations in horizontal planes , over which the current distribution is very intermittent , the height dependence of the root mean square electric current in the corona more or less follows that of the magnetic field , as is to be expected from a distribution with approximately `` constant alpha '' ( @xmath31 ) along magnetic field lines .    in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona the density and pressure scale heights rapidly change to much larger values . \n the average joule dissipation thus decreases faster than the radiative cooling in the corona , and therefore the peak of the average temperature occurs low in the corona . \n the temperature structure from the transition region to the maximum of the temperature is mainly determined by heat conduction along magnetic field lines .    the average joule dissipation , which balances the sum of thermal conduction losses and radiation losses , increases monotonically with decreasing height , which makes it difficult to unambiguously define an average coronal heating rate \n however , over the region in height where the temperature is larger that one million k , the average heating rate is @xmath32 erg @xmath33 s@xmath34 . \n the heating varies considerably over the horizontal plane , with much larger average rates in the immediate neighborhood of the active region patches of strong magnetic field ( except right above the sunspot , where the heating rate is low ) . \n the heating rate in the 25% of the horizontal area that covers the central part of the active region is 23 times higher than the average over the whole model . \n = 1        fig . 1 : histogram of current density squared as a function of height . \n dark colors are higher filling factor . \n the upper and lower dashed lines are the horizontal averages of the magnetic field strength squared and the joule heating squared , respectively . [ j2distr.fig ]    the joule heating is plotted as a scatter histogram in fig . \n [ j2distr.fig ] . \n although there is a relatively large scatter in the numerical values at each height , the horizontal average shows a smooth , roughly exponential height dependence . \n the magnetic dissipation thus indeed decreases roughly exponentially with height , as was proposed by @xcite , and as was deduced from trace data by @xcite . \n note that the scale height of the heating empirically is found to increase with loop length ; @xcite report a ratio @xmath35 between the scale height and the loop length . \n such an approximate proportionality should indeed be expected , if the heating is controlled by a roughly constant winding number from one loop end to another @xcite . \n = 1            [ trace171.fig ]    slender loops of the type observed by trace in full size active regions are seen in this simulation as well ( fig . \n [ trace171.fig ] ) . \n they show that it is possible , merely by using a random photospheric convective velocity pattern , to create thin slender loops that do not expand much with height , and are almost isothermal , as required if they are to be observed in the narrow trace filters . \n two loops have been followed ; the first was selected for its brightness in the trace 171 filter and the second for its large electric current density . \n their magnetic field line traces may be seen in fig . \n [ trace171.fig ] , and their temperature , gas pressure and current helicity @xmath36 have been plotted along the loops in fig . \n [ brightloop.fig ] . \n the loops both show a nearly constant pressure and temperature in the corona , maintained by the spitzer conductivity forcing a small gradient in temperature along the loops . \n the winding number for the small loop is almost an order of magnitude larger than for the large loop , creating a level of heating that puts it outside the trace 171 filter , and thus renders it invisible in fig . \n [ trace171.fig ] . \n bright loops seen in the trace 171 filter generally have small winding numbers . \n this suggests a scenario where loops are for a short period of time subjected to excess winding , which raises their chromospheric temperatures and evaporates mass ( lowers the local height of the transition zone ) . \n the spitzer conductivity maintains the coronal part of the loops close to isothermal , now with increased density and temperature . \n if the heating is only moderate , the individual loop may show up as bright in the trace 171 filter for a prolonged period , while if the heating is large the loop will pass through the trace 171 filter quickly , and will only be visible for a brief period of time . during this time \n these loops should be characterized by having large velocities along them , because of un  balanced pressure gradients . \n inspection of the arrangement of field lines along loops reveals an effect that is a likely explanation for the apparent lack of expansion with height of the slender loops . \n we find that a circular cross section at the top of loops is mapped to very flat cross sections in the loop legs , presumably caused by the shearing motions in the photosphere . \n this , or even more complicated arrangement of field lines , is likely to explain why projected cross sections do not follow the naive @xmath37 scaling expected for cross sections that remain circular . \n = 1        fig . \n 3 : temperature ( full line ) , gas pressure ( dashed line ) , and current helicity ( @xmath38  dotted line ) as a function of height @xmath39 for the two loops traced in fig . \n [ trace171.fig ] . \n [ brightloop.fig ] \n these initial investigations , to be followed by more detailed and extensive numerical experiments , have established that the dc ( braiding ) heating mechanism , originally proposed by @xcite , is effective and seems to be sufficient to heat the solar corona . because of the very low plasma beta in the low corona above active regions , the dissipation of even a very small fraction of the non - potential magnetic energy is sufficient to heat the tenuous coronal plasma . \n the heating has a scale height behavior , consistent with the observational limits set by @xcite for large scale coronal loops and by @xcite for a range of loop sizes . \n the results are not directly comparable to typical active regions on the sun , for three related reasons . first , the simulated region is small compared to typical solar active regions , which makes the loops correspondingly shorter . \n second , the total simulated time is only about 40 minutes , corresponding to only a few turn - over times of the granular size part of the photospheric velocity field . \n this means that motions on larger scales , with much longer turn - over times , have yet only had little influence on the magnetic field , so large scale shears are still missing . \n third , there is no emerging flux at the lower boundary , so part of the poynting flux through the lower boundary is missing . \n nevertheless , the results are tantalizing , and allows the identification of qualitative effects that are independent of these quantitative shortcomings . \n the heating process automatically creates slender loops consistent with the ones seen in the solar corona by trace . \n these loops have , at the time when they show up in the emulated trace filter , almost constant temperature and density , and are not in hydrostatic equilibrium . \n the near uniform temperature is caused by the spitzer conductivity forcing the loop to keep a small temperature gradient . \n the non - hydrostatic stratification is a signature of the fact that these loops are dynamic ; they are caused by short duration excess heating , which causes up flows that increase the density along those magnetic field lines that are subjected to the excess heating . \n this defines the loop , and causes a selection effect ; a loop will typically be observed when its density is near maximum , at which time it is by definition not in hydrostatic equilibrium . even though the loops modeled here are shorter than the ones where deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium have been found observationally @xcite \n , the same mechanism applies .", "StartTimeOffset": 4988864256832, "RequestID": "e25bdbd675f2f857d34d303a10ec63facc9c0bd1", "TotalTokens": 4084}
{"ContextTokens": 3530, "GeneratedTokens": 136, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent papers it has been proposed a mechanism based on the r - mode instability for the evolution of the internal magnetic field in millisecond accreting compact stars @xcite . \n r -

scale @xmath8 $ ]  yr . \n these estimates are compatible with the theoretical predictions given by @xcite and @xcite . \n we begin our analysis at @xmath9 . \n we follow the evolution of the external magnetic field @xmath10 while the internal field @xmath11 diffuses outside of the core . for simplicity \n we assume an exponential growth of the external magnetic field : @xmath12 \\label{evb}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and the initial _ external _ magnetic field is assumed to be @xmath14  g. the latter is a rather typical strength for neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .    in figure  [ fig.1 ] \n we show the evolution of the _ external _ magnetic field obtained by using eq . \n ( [ evb ] ) .    in the following \n we consider the diffusion of the new generated internal magnetic field separately in the case in which mass accretion is still active and in the case it has terminated . \n $ ]  yr . the blue area indicates the value of the internal poloidal component @xmath15 $ ]  g which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the toroidal component @xmath16 . here @xmath17  g.,width=340,height=264 ]      here \n we consider the evolution of a _ recycled _ neutron star in a scenario in which the mass accretion phase ends within a few million years after @xmath18 . in this case \n the evolution of the spin period of the star is quite simple because it is not necessary to take into account the interaction between the accretion disk and the magnetic field during the diffusion of @xmath19 . \n the total angular momentum of the star satisfies the equation  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the angular momentum of the star and @xmath10 is obtained from eq .  [ evb ] .    in the following we indicate with @xmath23 the spin period at the time @xmath24 and we treat @xmath23 as a free parameter . \n notice that the internal magnetic field can develop only if the star enters the r - mode instability region @xcite . \n the upper limit of this region is characterized by a period @xmath25 whose precise value depends on the viscous properties of the star and on the possible existence of the ekman layer  @xcite . \n therefore also the parameter @xmath23 is bound by the condition @xmath26  ms . \n we stress that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not the same for every star . \n they actually depend on the very complicated evolution of the internal magnetic field which in turn is related to the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see for instance figure  3 of @xcite ) . \n results for the evolutionary paths in the @xmath31 plane are shown in figure  [ fig.2 ] . \n the shaded strip includes the possible trajectories of the stars ( the red arrows are included as guidelines for the temporal evolution ) . \n the shape of this strip is regulated mainly by the three parameters @xmath6 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( @xmath30 plays a marginal role ) . \n the width of the strip at the beginning is fixed by @xmath25 and @xmath32 . \n the latter parameter corresponds to the minimal period reachable by a recycled msp . \n observationally its value is of the order of @xmath33  ms  @xcite . \n @xmath27 fixes the width of the strip at late times and @xmath6 regulates the height of the elbow : the smaller @xmath6 the higher the elbow . \n stellar objects under study are labeled . \n the dashed line corresponds to stars accreting at the eddington limit  @xcite . \n the shaded area includes possible paths ( indicated by the red arrows for the case without mass accretion ) of msps after @xmath18 ( see text ) . \n notice that the two @xmath34 stars lie well inside the shaded area.,width=340,height=264 ]    remarkably , we can populate the region above the line corresponding to the eddington limit ( dashed line ) . \n this is exactly the region where j1823 - 3021a and j1824 - 2452a lie .      if the mass accretion phase lasts tens or hundreds of million years after @xmath18 , the evolutive scenario is more complicated . \n the plasma flowing onto the neutron star forms an accretion disk whose inner edge is given by the coupling radius of the magnetosphere ( of the same order of magnitude of the alfvn radius ) @xmath35 \n the interaction between the magnetic field of the compact object and the conducting material flowing from its companion can provide the necessary torque @xmath36 to spin up the pulsar  @xcite . however , under certain conditions , it is possible that this interaction leads to a torque reversal . \n the growth of the external field @xmath10 causes the magnetic boundary @xmath37 to move outward relative to the corotation radius @xmath38 defined as the distance at which the spin frequency of the star is equal to the keplerian frequency . \n the star enters a propeller phase when @xmath39 : a centrifugal barrier prevents the material to flow onto the star and a new braking torque @xmath40 acts to slow down the pulsar  @xcite . \n ( green line ) , @xmath41 ( red line ) and period @xmath42 of the star ( blue line ) . \n the dashed black line indicates the moment at which the spin equilibrium phase takes place . \n here we assume @xmath43  ms , @xmath44  g and @xmath45 . \n _ panel ( b ) _ : frequencies at which the spin equilibrium phase takes place as a function of the mass accretion rate . \n we show two examples , corresponding to @xmath46  ms ( gray area ) and @xmath47  ms ( cyan area ) . \n the width of the strips corresponds to the uncertainty on @xmath48 ( see yellow area in figure  [ fig.1 ] ) . \n the red dot refers to the case shown in panel ( a ) . \n , width=340,height=264 ]    in figure  [ fig.3]a we show a typical evolutionary path for an accreting neutron star if the diffusion of the internal poloidal component @xmath11 is taken into account . the growth of the external magnetic field @xmath49 leads to the end of the spin - up phase . \n the star evolves into an equilibrium spin phase , it alternates between spin - up and spin - down ( @xmath50 ) and finally it appears as a radio pulsar at the end of the mass accretion phase .    finally , \n from the analysis presented above we can notice that in order to reach high spin frequencies it is necessary a mass accretion rate @xmath51 ( see figure  [ fig.3]b ) . \n in the previous section we have presented a general scenario for the evolution of msps when the production and the diffusion of the internal magnetic field is taken into account . in this section \n we concentrate on the cases of the two isolated pulsars j1823 - 3021a and j1824 - 2452a .    in the most widely discussed model , \n msps have been re - accelerated through mass accretion , in particular by having spent a fraction of their lives as part of a lmxb . \n the way by which they end up as isolated pulsars is still not fully understood . \n a possibility is that the companions are destroyed through ablation caused by energetic radiation from the pulsar @xcite . \n another possibility requires mass loss from the companion which can take place in very close binary systems due to tidal dissipation @xcite . a totally different scheme to produce an isolated msp is the one in which the pulsar had an interaction with another star or binary in the globular cluster , and was spun - up in the process @xcite . in the following \n we will concentrate on the scenario in which msps are produced in lmxbs . \n + the pulsar j1823 - 3021a , located in the globular cluster ngc 6624 , was discovered in 1994  @xcite . \n the fermi large area telescope has recently detected the @xmath52 ray counterpart of its pulsations  @xcite with a luminosity of @xmath53 ergs s@xmath54 , the highest observed @xmath52 ray luminosity for any msp . \n the pulsation period @xmath42 is @xmath55 ms and the observed spinning down rate is extremely large @xmath56 s s@xmath54 , larger by far than the typical value for other msps . \n these properties make j1823 - 3021a an extremely interesting stellar object . \n the total observed @xmath52 ray emission implies that a significant fraction of @xmath57 is due to the intrinsic spinning down rate @xmath0  @xcite . within the standard magnetic dipole model for pulsar emission , \n such a large @xmath0 is generated by a large surface magnetic field @xmath58 , larger than @xmath59 g. this fact represents a puzzle for standard msp theory  @xcite : if j1823 - 3021a was spun - up by mass accretion from a companion , due to its large magnetic field @xmath58 , even assuming an accretion rate at the eddington limit @xmath60 , the star would have reached a period @xmath61 ms , which is larger than its present period . \n + the isolated millisecond pulsar j1824 - 2452a is located in the globular cluster m28 at @xmath62  kpc from the sun @xcite . \n the pulsation period is @xmath63  ms and the observed spinning down rate is @xmath64 s s@xmath54 . \n indirect evidence exists that this large @xmath0 observed is indicative of the true value , e.g. the detection of glitches @xcite , giant pulses @xcite , strong x - ray pulses @xcite and a large second period derivative @xmath65 @xcite . as for j1823 - 3021a , \n the large @xmath0 implies a surface magnetic field @xmath66  g and the combination of values ( @xmath31 ) is difficult to explain in the standard msps theory . \n + note that these anomalous pulsars can be explained in the standard model if the accretion occurred at super - eddington rate . \n about such a possibility , we note that all the accreting compact stars detected up to now in lmxbs have steady mass accretion rates @xmath67  @xcite presented in @xcite in parentheses refer to these active periods and not to steady accretion . ] . \n moreover , taking into account also the interaction between the external magnetic field and the accretion disk , a minimal value for the mass accretion rate @xmath68 is necessary to accelerate the stars up to the present spin frequency . for lower values of @xmath29 \n the accreting ns enters a propeller regime that prevents a further acceleration . \n in our analysis we have presented a scheme in which the msps can populate the region occupied by j1823 - 3021a and j1824 - 2452a . \n it is important to remark that the existence of a propeller phase does not invalidate the possibility to interpret these two special msps in our scheme . \n indeed , in figure  [ fig.3]a we show that the spin frequency of the star does not change significantly during the spin equilibrium phase : even if a fast spin - down of the star takes place during the propeller regime @xcite , the star nevertheless will continue to appear as a radio pulsar in the shaded area of figure  [ fig.2 ] . concerning the two anomalous stellar objects they are no more accreting and if a propeller phase took place during accretion it is clearly already over . \n the exact position in the @xmath42-@xmath2 plane before a possible propeller phase can not be determined precisely , but it was located at higher frequencies : the existence of this phase would make therefore even more difficult to interpret these two objects within the standard pulsar model ( because they would lie further from the eddington limit ) but it is easy to accommodate in our model . \n we have discussed the evolution of the external magnetic field of recycled msps due to the diffusion of strong internal magnetic fields generated by r - modes during the mass accretion phase . \n our analysis is based on the previous work of @xcite and @xcite where it has been shown that r - modes generate strong internal magnetic fields in accreting compact stars . \n we have shown that the growth of the external magnetic field affects the evolution of the spin - down rate @xmath0 of the msps and that this mechanism can explain the high @xmath0 of j1823 - 3021a and of j1824 - 2452a . \n our analysis open new evolutionary paths for the _ recycled _ msps in the @xmath31 plane . \n g.p . acknowledges financial support from the italian ministry of research through the program rita levi montalcini .", "StartTimeOffset": 5011089549937, "RequestID": "ee1bce3f58eb78f5dcbb052503fec9f98e665d4c", "TotalTokens": 3666}

{"ContextTokens": 3783, "GeneratedTokens": 173, "SynthesizedBody": "schrodinger @xcite attempted to construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom that were related to classical orbits . \n such a construction was easy for the harmonic oscillator , and these are the well known coherent states @xcite@xcite . \n the hydrogen atom , however , proved to be more difficult and the question was not resolved at that time . \n the issue has become relevant again in connection with the rydberg atoms @xcite in microwave cavities . \n various considerations have led to different proposals @xcite for the coherent states of the hydrogen atom . \n some used the dynamical groups so(4 ) or so(4,2 ) . \n however , a state of the class did not go into a state of the same class under time evolution . \n klauder @xcite has constructed coherent states with the property that under time evolution these remain coherent states . \n recently one of us @xcite constructed a set of coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator which was unique when precise connection to the classical phase space and dynamics was demanded . \n we construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by classical phase space variables . \n @xmath0 the definition of these variables and their relation to the classical orbit is explained later . \n the angle variable @xmath1 now has the range @xmath2 . \n note that only the bound state spectrum has been used . \n wave packets built out of scattering states with similar properties can also be constructed using our techniques , but will not be considered here . \n we have the resolution of identity in the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the bound states ,    @xmath3\\!d\\theta \\int_{-1}^{1}\\!d((j+1/2)\\hbar\\ , cos\\,\\beta ) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\alpha \\int_{-1}^{1}\\!d((j+1/2)\\hbar\\ , cos\\,\\delta ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{2in}\\times \\int_{0}^{2\\pi } d\\gamma |   r,\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\theta\\rangle \\langle r,\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\delta,\\theta | \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4d\\theta \\equiv \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }   \\frac{1}{n } \\int_{-n\\pi}^{n\\pi}d\\theta.\\ ] ] this corresponds to averaging over an infinite number of classical orbits . \n the measure is exactly the classical phase space measure invariant under canonical transformations . under time evolution , @xmath5 correspondence to the kepler problem ------------------------------------    the bound state kepler problem \n is conveniently described @xcite by three action variables @xmath6 and their corresponding angle variables @xmath7 . \n ( these are related to the variables in ref @xcite through @xmath8 . ) \n the hamiltonian @xmath9 involves only @xmath10 . \n @xmath11 @xmath12 is the magnitude of the total angular momentum , and @xmath13 is the z component of the angular momentum . \n the angle variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 are also constants of motion in this problem because their corresponding frequencies are zero . only @xmath16 changes in time as @xmath17 where t(r ) is the time period of the orbit . \n it has been observed in @xcite@xcite that the time evolution in equation ( 4 ) is possible only if the angle variable @xmath16 is extended to the covering space ; @xmath18 this is because the energy levels are incommensurate . \n after one period the wave packet is not reproduced , though grossly it has the same features . \n this uniquely fixes the dependence on @xmath16 . \n @xmath19 under rotation we require these wave packets to go into one another as these labels do . \n @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath16 do not change under rotation of axes . ) \n @xmath14 is the angle between the y axis and the line of nodes . \n ( i.e. the line of intersection between the orbital plane and the x - y plane . ) \n @xmath15 is the angle between the line of nodes and the major axis ( fig 1 ) . \n also @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inclination of the orbit . \n ( i.e. the angle between the normal @xmath24 to the orbit and the z axis . ) \n thus under rotation of the orbit around the z axis ( by angle @xmath25 ) , @xmath14 increases by @xmath25 while @xmath15 and @xmath23 do not change . \n this uniquely requires the dependence on @xmath14 to involve @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the generator of rotations about the z axis . a rotation about the line of nodes by an angle @xmath28 increases @xmath23 by @xmath28 while keeping @xmath14 and @xmath15 unchanged . \n this fixes the dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath14 so that it involves @xmath29 . \n this is because the rotation about line of nodes corresponds to @xmath30 . \n finally a rotation about the normal @xmath31 by angle @xmath28 increases @xmath15 by @xmath28 while keeping the other two angles constant . \n this rotation corresponds to @xmath32 therefore the dependence on @xmath33 is required to be @xmath34 note that this rotation precisely corresponds to taking an orbit in the x - y plane with the major axis along the x direction into the orbit labelled by @xmath35 .    we may exploit the dynamical o(4 ) symmetry of the hydrogen atom to fix the dependence on @xmath12 also . \n in addition to the conserved vector * j * related to rotational invariance , we have another conserved vector * k * along the major axis ( fig 2 . ) \n related to the laplace runge lenz vector . \n we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the eccentricity of the orbit is @xmath38 . \n the role of the vector * k * is to deform the orbits by changing @xmath12 . \n the o(4 ) symmetry corresponds to independent rotations of the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the 3-dimensional space .    consider a circular orbit in the x - y plane . \n now @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in the z direction . \n imagine a rotation of @xmath39 about the 2-axis by an angle @xmath43 and an equal and opposite rotation of @xmath40 . \n this will give a non zero @xmath44 of magnitude @xmath45 along the x direction and @xmath46 of magnitude @xmath47 along the z direction . \n thus the orbit has been deformed into an elliptic orbit in the x - y plane with @xmath48 . \n the above analysis shows the following . in order to have the right transformation properties of the classical variables @xmath49 under the full o(4 ) symmetry \n , the dependence on @xmath50 has to be via @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . \n classically this will rotate and deform a circular orbit in the x - y plane into the orbit with the labels @xmath35 ( without changing the size of the major axis ) . \n quantum mechanically the former corresponds to the state @xmath54 . \n therefore we may expect the coherent state to have the form @xmath55 with a proper choice of @xmath56 this will have the properties we require . \n however we find that it is much more natural and convenient to use a different set of action angle variables . \n note the close relation to the angular momentum coherent states . \n note also that the angle variables @xmath57 are involved in rotation about the third axis whereas the angles @xmath23 and @xmath43 related to the action variables are involved in rotation about the one and two axes . \n this is a general feature as seen below . \n consider a spinning object with spin quantum number j and gyromagnetic ratio @xmath58 in an external magnetic field b in the z direction . \n the hamiltonian is @xmath59 . \n classically the spin will precess about the z axis with frequency @xmath60 . \n the action variable is @xmath61 which measures the inclination to the z axis and the angle variable @xmath62 , is the azimuthal angle of the precessing spin . \n we now show that , by requiring classical time evolution , semi - classical limit and correct rotation property for the states @xmath63 labelled by the classical phase space of this system , we obtain uniquely the angular momentum coherent states @xcite . \n we have @xmath64 to reproduce the classical evolution , @xmath65 under rotation by angle @xmath66 about the x axis , @xmath67 goes to @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the classical spin to be associated to the spin quantum number @xmath71 . \n in order that @xmath72 have this property , we have to choose @xmath73 as seen below . note that we have precisely got the angular momentum coherent state labelled by @xmath67 and @xmath1 . \n we now show that this has the right semi classical limit and resolution of identity @xmath74 for large @xmath71 , @xmath75 peaks at @xmath76 i.e. the dominant contributions come from the states @xmath77 .    as @xmath61 and @xmath1 are action angle variables , the phase space measure is @xmath78 . \n now @xmath79 with the identification @xmath80 . \n ( this means that we must associate classical @xmath80 to the spin quantum number @xmath71 . ) \n thus the angles @xmath67 and @xmath1 appearing in the angular momentum coherent state eq . \n ( 12 ) can be interpreted as classical phase space variables for a precessing spin with @xmath1 as the angle variable and @xmath81 as the corresponding action variable . \n in place of the conserved variables @xmath82 we will use other variables suggested by the o(4 ) symmetry . \n we will use the two o(3 ) subgroups in o(4 ) generated by @xmath83 . \n we define @xmath84    in place of quantum states @xmath85 we are now using @xmath86 of @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively . \n ( the @xmath71 quantum number is the same because @xmath89 ) . \n @xmath71 takes half integer values @xmath90 we get the states @xmath91 by going to the coupled basis @xmath92    the new angles are related to the earlier angles as follows ( ref fig.2 ) . \n the @xmath87 rotation rotates the classical vector @xmath93 from the z axis to @xmath94 without affecting @xmath88 . \n similarly the @xmath95 rotation rotates the classical vector @xmath96 from z axis to @xmath97 therefore the projection of * j * on the z axis gives @xmath98 where @xmath99 the line of nodes is along @xmath100 and therefore has the direction cosines @xmath101 . therefore @xmath102 with @xmath103 . \n @xmath104 is obtained by taking the component of * k * along the line of nodes and therefore @xmath105 and @xmath106 the orbit is simply obtained from the vectors * j*+*k * and * j*-*k * because it is perpendicular to * j * and has the major axis along the direction @xmath44 with magnitude @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bohr radius . \n also the eccentricity is given by @xmath109    the classical phase space measure in the new variables is @xmath110 for large @xmath70 , the state @xmath111 gets dominant contribution from @xmath112 and @xmath113 . \n this is exactly as wanted by bohr quantization of the action angle pairs because @xmath114 and @xmath115 . \n therefore we only have to fix @xmath116 by requiring the correct semi - classical limit and resolution of identity . \n we want @xmath116 to peak at @xmath117 as bohr quantization gives @xmath118 . \n also to get a resolution of identity we require @xmath119 for all @xmath71 . for normalization \n we require @xmath120 where @xmath121 . \n all these requirements are met by @xmath122 thus we get the coherent state as in equation no.(1 ) . \n in case of the harmonic oscillator coherent states @xmath123 the expectation values of the position and momentum operators are directly given by the real and imaginary parts of the label @xmath124 . \n also they are minimal uncertainty states . for our coherent states , \n these properties are not valid exactly , but are valid asymptotically in the semi - classical region @xcite . \n this is a consequence of the semi - classical limit of our coherent states where the correspondence principle may be applied . \n consider the expectation value of an operator @xmath125 in a coherent state . for large values of @xmath126 and @xmath13 ( in units of @xmath127 ) , the coherent state is dominated by the states @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . \n now , the correspondence principle relates the expectation value of @xmath132 to the value of the corresponding classical variable @xmath133 for the corresponding classical orbit . \n thus asymptotically , our coherent states are wave packets peaked around position , momenta etc . corresponding to the action angle variables labelling it . \n also , asymptotically they would be minimum uncertainty states \n . more detailed consideration of these properties for small values of the action variables will be considered elsewhere . \n we have constructed wave packets for the hydrogen atom , labelled by points of the classical phase space which follow classical orbits very closely . \n they have the correct semiclassical limit corresponding to bohr quantization . \n in addition , they have the desirable property that the resolution of identity involves exactly the classical phase space measure . as a consequence of incommensurate energy levels \n , our wave packets do not return to the original state after one period , but the overall features do not change . \n one may interpret this as follows : the wave packet has ( an infinite number of ) internal degrees of freedom , which may not return to the original state after a period . \n one of us ( h.s.sharatchandra ) thanks professor k.h.mariwalla for helpful discussions and pointing out references . \n e. schr@xmath134dinger , _ naturwissenshaften _ * 14 * , 644 ( 1926 ) j. r. klauder and e. c. g. sudarshan , fundamentals of quantum optics ( new york : benjamin ) ( 1968 ) ch . \n 7 j. r. klauder and b. s. skagerstam , coherent states ( singapore : world scientific ) ( 1985 ) j. g. leopold and i. c. percival , phys . \n lett . * 41 * , 944 ( 1978 ) ; e. j. galvez , b. e. saver , l.moorman , p. m. koch and d. richards , phys . \n lett . * 61 * , 2011 ( 1988 ) ; d. meschede , h. walther , and g. m@xmath135ller , phys . \n lett . * 54 * , 551 ( 1985 ) ; m. brune , j. m. raimond , p. goy , l. davidovitch , and s. haroche , phys . \n * 10 * , 1899 ( 1987 ) l. s. brown , am . j. phys . * \n 41 * , 525 ( 1973 ) ; j. mostowski , lett . math . phys . * 2 * , 1 ( 1977 ) ; d. bhaumik , b. dutta -

dimensional 8-point gauss procedure and dividing the region of integration into pieces small enough to guarantee the overall accuracy of 10 significant digits . from fig.[f0]b \n it is clear that a technical precision of ekhara of the order of 0.1% was achieved . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    for isr of @xmath1 pair ( fig.[f00]a ) , a factorisation similar to photon emission holds @xcite and adding isr pair production to isr photon production results just in a change of the radiator function , thus radiative return method still can be used @xcite . on the other hand , fsr of @xmath1 pair ( fig.[f00]b ) \n is model dependent , the same way as it is the emission of a real photon , and the question of its relative , to isr , contribution to the cross section is as important as for the photon emission . \n one can observe , that @xmath1 pair emission resembles a lot photon emission , with big contributions of fsr for inclusive configurations ( fig.[f1]a ) of a @xmath4factory , which can be easily reduced , by suitable cuts , to a negligible level ( fig.[f1]b ) . \n moreover , the cuts which reduce photon fsr reduces as well the @xmath1 pair fsr . in addition , analogously to photon fsr , @xmath1 pair fsr is completely negligible at @xmath5factories . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    the most relevant information , how big is the contribution of the process @xmath10 in comparison to the main process used in the radiative return method , mainly @xmath29 , is presented in fig.[f2 ] for da@xmath4ne energy , both without any cuts ( fig.[f2]a ) , and with cuts resembling kloe event selection @xcite ( fig.[f2]b ) . the results of @xmath29 cross section were obtained using phokhara 3.0 mc generator @xcite and in the following , whenever we refer to @xmath29 cross section we mean cross section obtained using phokhara 3.0 . as one can see from fig.[f2 ] , the contribution of the @xmath1 pair production is below 0.5% , independently on the cuts . \n it is @xmath25 dependant , being big for low @xmath25 values . \n even if it is small , this 0.5% contribution can become important , when aiming at the precision below , or of the order of 1% , for the @xmath30 cross section measurement . at @xmath5factories , the relative contribution of the pair production might be as big as 0.9% ( fig.[f4]a ) and it is again @xmath25 and cut dependent ( fig.[f4]b ) . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    -0.4 cm    -0.2 cm -0.2 cm \n -0.4 cm    as stated already , isr of electron pairs can be treated in a similar way as isr of photons resulting in the change of radiator function in the radiative return method . \n however , one can alternatively try to treat it as a background to the process with photon(s ) emission . in this case , the most natural way of reducing that background is to veto the electron ( positron ) in the final state . in fig.[f3 \n ] we show an example of such a procedure performed for @xmath4factory energy . \n we assume here that an electron or positron can be seen , and the event rejected , if its angle with respect to the beam axis is bigger then 20@xmath31 . \n fig.[f3]a shows that up to 50% of the events pass the rejection procedure , when no other cuts are applied . \n however , in the case of kloe event selection , which requires that the @xmath1 pair is emitted along the beam axis , one rejects only a small fraction of these events ( fig.[f3]b ) . \n -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    the situation is completely different at @xmath5factories , where one can almost completely reduce the background coming from @xmath1 pairs ( fig.[f5 ] ) , by rejecting the events with at least one charged lepton , electron or positron , in the detector . \n we have constructed the monte carlo generator ekhara , which simulates the reaction @xmath0 based on initial and final state emission of a @xmath1 pair from @xmath2 production diagram . \n a detailed study of this process , as a potential background for @xmath3 measurement via radiative return method , shows that it can become important , when the experimental precision will reach 1% , or better . \n m.  davier , s.  eidelman , a.  hcker and z.  zhang , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2674, "GeneratedTokens": 125, "SynthesizedBody": "the internet has revolutionized science and society in many ways . \n studies of human communication networks nowadays deal with data sets of thousands people or more . gone are the days when one had to rely solely on interview surveys and observational studies . these new and larger data sets open up new possibilities \n one does not only get higher precision in the measurement of network structure , one can also rid the structural quantities of finite size effects that would hinder the prediction of phenomena such as large - scale information spreading . \n the accessibility of large data sets has also drawn the interest of statistical physicists , habitually working in the large - scale limit , to this traditionally sociological field . \n the sociologists themselves , naturally , contribute to the development , and make the study of communication networks a thriving interdisciplinary arena . \n internet has , of course , changed other aspects of society than science . in the perennial human quest to find a partner , romantic or \n otherwise , the internet provides a new _ modus operandi_. in this paper we study a swedish internet community , pussokram.com , intended for romantic communication among adolescents . \n the methods we propose do not only work for dating communities , but for internet communities in general . \n our definition of an internet community is a set of html - pages facilitating some type of directed messages ( i.e.  not all messages are broadcasted to the whole community ) , and where each member is associated with a home page . \n this definition includes social networking sites @xcite but excludes , for example , news groups @xcite . \n the data we use , the same as in ref . \n @xcite , are anonymized lists of contacts \n triples @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the id - number of the sender , @xmath2 is the id - number of the receiver , and @xmath3 is the time ( in seconds ) since an arbitrary start time . \n the ids are integer numbers with no relation to the users of the real community . \n we do not have access to the messages themselves , nor the individual presentations on the user homepages ( or any other text or images either ) . \n researched data sets of electronic communication have often been constructed from email exchange  , and to a lesser extent from communication within internet communities  @xcite . \n the advantage with internet communities is that they are a closed system  all communication can be recorded . the network of emails is a much larger and more important phenomenon . but studies of email networks are plagued by statistical biases due to the openness of the system . for email communication one typically samples a set of individuals and either restricts the data to messages sent within the group ( which leaves the message set incomplete )  @xcite or one includes contacts to outer vertices , which does not include contact between outer vertices . \n for this reason the study of internet communities may not only be of interest _ per se _ , but is also illuminating towards the general structure of electronic communication .    the goal of this paper is to say something about what makes a user successful in the community . given our very restricted data \n needless to say , the most relevant information is in the text and imagery we do not have  is there anything that can be said ? \n we propose simple measures for attractiveness and activity and observe that they are positively correlated in the contact sequences . \n more than that , these two quantities are more strongly correlated for the real - world data than for the null model we propose . \n it thus pays off , directly or ( more likely ) indirectly , to be an active community member . \n .[tab : sizes ] the sizes of our three data sets : the number of vertices @xmath4 , edges @xmath5 and contacts @xmath6 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the previous section we defined three vertex - specific measures for internet community contact sequences . \n we measured the probability distribution and the correlations between the measures . \n the design of the measures does not exclude that correlations may be induced by the growth of the community . to frame the correlations associated with the psychology of the community members \n , we need something to compare the values with , i.e.  a null model . \n in fact , we propose two null models , one more and one less restricted . we follow the general approach of ref . \n @xcite and sample randomizations of the real - world data set rather than constructing parametric null models . in both these models \n we will keep the sizes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the same as in the original contact sequences . not only that \n , we assume the growth of @xmath4 is unrelated to the psychology of the community members , we also keep the time evolution of @xmath4 the same as in the real data . furthermore , \n as the community grows with time the communication rate in the data should also be growing . with a parametric null model \n this would be hard to implement , but we just keep the set of times from the real data and the communication rate exactly the same as in the real - world contact sequence .    in the first , less constrained , model we apply the restrictions above . \n a randomized contact sequence is constructed as follows :    1 . \n [ enu:1c ] for each vertex @xmath1 add one contact to or from ( with equal probability ) at time @xmath7 . \n the other vertex of the contact is chosen with uniform randomness among the vertices present in the data at this time . \n [ enu : rest ] draw @xmath8 times randomly from the set of non - first contacts . \n ( i.e.  contacts @xmath0 , such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 . ) \n add contacts between vertices present in the community at these times . \n step [ enu:1c ] ensures that the number of active members is the same in the randomized sequence as in the real - world data . \n step [ enu : rest ] makes the set of times almost equal to the empirical set of times . \n note that , contacts between two vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath11 will give rise to two contacts in the randomized sequence ; so the set of non - first contacts used in step [ enu : rest ] will be slightly ( @xmath12 ) larger than @xmath8 .    as mentioned in the previous section \n a broad activity distribution has been observed in many data sets similar to ours . \n one may argue that activity is a rather independent trait , little connected to the contact dynamics . whether or not this is true \n , we construct a null model to test how the reality differs from such a scenario . to generate a random sequence realization for this model we loop over all contacts @xmath0 and replace @xmath2 ( the vertex the message is sent to ) by a random vertex @xmath13 present in the community at time @xmath3 . \n clearly this procedure conserves @xmath6 . \n it may result in a few isolated vertices ( vertices of zero out - degree who looses their incoming links ) , and a slightly altered time evolution of @xmath4 ( vertices whose first contact is incoming may appear later in the randomized community than in the real - world data ) . for our data these effects are small , and we assume them to be negligible . \n values of the linear ( pearson s ) correlation coefficient between attractiveness , activity and participance rates for the real and null model networks can be found in table  [ tab : corr ] . \n first we note that the attractiveness and activity are more strongly correlated in the real community than in both models , and that this holds for all three networks . \n this means that the correlation between attractiveness and activity is not an artifact of the growth of the community ( by comparison with model 1 ) , neither is it a result of a skewed distribution of a ( hypothetical ) intrinsic activity ( by comparison with model 2 ) . unlike the attractiveness vs.  activity correlation \n , the correlation between activity and participance rate seems to a large extent to be an effect of the growth of the network . \n we see that model 2 induces a very high correlation between activity and participance rate . \n model 2 randomizes the recipients but keeps the rest of the communication the same as in the original data . \n the fact that the users engage in dialogs is an explanation for the lower correlation in the real world data  two users sending contacts to only each other , but frequently is active but have low participance ratio . \n the correlation between the participance rate and attractiveness of the real data is even more different from the null model than the attractiveness - activity correlation . \n this means that the vertices of highest degree in the social network generated by the communication are also the one that most frequently get incoming new contacts . \n another interesting observation is that the messages data have higher attractiveness correlations than the guest book and all contacts data . \n since the messages are not publicly visible one can assume that the real romantic communication takes place here rather than in the guest book writing . \n this strengthen the conclusion that active users are attractive in internet dating . \n we note that ( spearman type ) rank correlations are typically a little stronger than the linear correlations , but since they add little new information to the discussion we do not include them in our tables . \n in this paper we have introduced three measures to characterize users in online communities : attractiveness , activity and participance rate ( measuring how fast a user get to know others in the community ) . \n while these three measures are sensible in general internet communities , we evaluate them for an internet dating community  @xcite . how and why people end up as partners is well studied in an off - line setting  @xcite ; attractiveness in terms of body shape  @xcite , facial characteristics  @xcite and body odor  @xcite are all well - known . with internet communities playing an increasingly important role on the dating scene \n @xcite one need to complement the studies of in - real - life attractiveness with investigations of online romantic preferences . in this paper \n we find that the attractiveness ( the number of incoming new contacts per time ) is positively correlated with activity ( the number of contacts taken per time ) , and that this correlation is significantly stronger than for our two null models . \n we find this heightened correlation in the real - world data even stronger in the dataset of e - mail - like messages than in the other data sets ( including messages visible to the whole community ) . \n since the activity , as we measure it , is rather invisible to other members , this correlation has to be a secondary effect . \n ( writing in guest books increases ones visibility and is a , presumably small , direct effect . ) \n it is natural to assume that the users that send many messages , and thus invest much time into their community , also spend comparatively more time embellishing their homepages . \n the conclusion is thus that it pays off to spend effort on one s personal presentation . \n another factor is that highly active users are most likely logged in more often than low - activity users . \n since currently logged in users are displayed , the increased visibility of frequently logged in members may boost the attractiveness of active users . \n we also find highly skewed , power - law - like distributions of attractiveness , activity and participance rate . \n the mechanisms behind electronic communication and offline behavior are presumably very different . nevertheless , similar quantities in off - line relationships , such as the number of partners per time , are also known have this feature  @xcite . \n research on the structure and dynamics of internet communities is still a young field . \n their statistical advantages ( being closed systems ) compared to e - mail exchange make us anticipate much future work with both data analysis and modeling approaches . \n d.  i. perrett , k.  j. lee , i.  s. penton - voak , d.  r. rowland , s.  yoshikawa , d.  m. burt , s.  p. henzi , d.  l. castles , and s.  akamatsu . \n effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness . , 394:884887 , 1998 . \n j.  r. tyler , d.  m. wilkinson , and b.  a. huberman . \n email as spectroscopy : automated discovery of community structure within organizations . in m. \n huysman , e.  wenger , and v.  wulf , editors , _ communities and technologies _ , pages 8196 . \n kluwer , deventer , 2003 . \n s.  whittaker , l.  terveen , w.  hill , and l.  cherny . \n the dynamics of mass interaction . in s. \n poltrock and j.  grudin , editors , _ proceedings of the 1998 acm conference on computer supported cooperative work _ , \n pages 257264 , new york , 1998 . \n association for computing machinery .", "StartTimeOffset": 5127936782481, "RequestID": "c8a651bf5c4ca7d5c704a195fb07979266044e2f", "TotalTokens": 2799}
{"ContextTokens": 3406, "GeneratedTokens": 192, "SynthesizedBody": "generally , the aim of our study is to analyze the possibility of the microscopic optical potential to give a physical interpretation of the total reaction cross sections of @xmath0he ,  @xmath1li on @xmath2si ( see refs . \n @xcite-@xcite ) including some preliminary data on the @xmath3li+@xmath2si reaction at the energies e=5 - 50 a mev ( see fig .  1 ) , and at present we study only the @xmath3he,@xmath3li @xmath4si cross section . \n there is the following motivation of this task . \n first , an interpretation of experimental data with a help of usually applied phenomenological optical potentials does not answer questions both on the nuclear structure of colliding nuclei and on the mechanism of their scattering . \n moreover , such kind of fitting is , in fact , only the parametrization of data by introducing a set , say , of the six or more free parameters , which are different for different energies and kinds of interacting nuclei . \n otherwise , the microscopic models do not contain free parameters and provide the possibility to test the models of nuclear structure . \n particularly , in this paper we use the current models of the projectile nuclei @xmath5he and @xmath5li to estimate a sensitivity of total cross sections to a behavior of their densities in the peripheral region . in calculations \n , we use the tanihata model @xcite and the cluster - orbital shell - model approximation ( cosma ) @xcite of density distributions of bare protons ( z ) and neutrons ( n ) in nuclei @xmath6 where @xmath7 are parameters of the models . \n also , densities of the large - scale shell - model ( lssm ) @xcite is also presented together with the @xmath5li density from tables of  @xcite . in fig .  2 one sees the visual distinction of shapes of the proton , neutron and the nuclear matter densities obtained in these models . \n between these densities only the lssm has the realistic exponential behavior at large distances while the others have the gaussian shape of tails .    in sec .  2 , \n the double - folding model ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , including the exchange term , is applied to calculate the real part of the microscopic optical potential whereas for its imaginary part we takes the form obtained in @xcite basing on high - energy approximation ( hea ) theory of scattering . \n applications of the microscopic potentials are made in sec . \n the role of the coulomb potential is also analyzed by comparison of cross sections calculated with the traditional coulomb potential of the uniform charge density distribution , and with that obtained in the framework of folding procedure accounting for the realistic nuclear charge density distributions . \n then , we discuss the method of adding free parameters to account for influence of collective modes of nuclei . \n summary and conclusion are done in sec . \n the double - folding nucleus - nucleus potential ( the real one ) consists of the direct and exchange parts : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the one - particle projectile ( p ) and target ( t ) matrices of densities . \n the modern calculations are usually apply the effective paris nucleon -

nucleus momentum , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the nucleon mass , and therefore there occurs the typical non - linear problem . \n here we paid an attention on the important role of the exchange effect in calculations of nucleus - nucleus real potentials . \n this is depicted in fig .  3 where the double - folding @xmath23-potential for the @xmath5he+@xmath2si scattering at e=25 mev / nucleon is calculated with a help of two different every so often kinds of effective @xmath13 potentials , the paris cdm3y6 and the reid ddm3y1 potentials . \n they have different sets of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) . \n it is seen , that their direct parts has different signs , and thus the exchange part plays the crucial role in forming the whole nuclear potential . \n note that when constructing microscopic optical potentials people usually use only the real double - folding potential ( [ eq2.1])-([eq2.4 ] ) while the imaginary part is taken in a phenomenological form with free parameters fitted to experimental data for each specific energy individually . \n instead , in our calculations we use below the imaginary part as it is done in the microscopic optical potential ( hea - potential ) obtained in @xcite basing on the hea theory . \n its imaginary part is as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the form factor of a pointlike nuclear density , and @xmath28 is the total nucleon - nucleon cross sections that is parametrized in @xcite as a function of the nn collision energy . \n the superscript h indicates the hea roots of the potential . \n fig .  4 exhibits microscopic calculations of the total reaction cross sections based on the given folding potentials ( [ eq2.2],[eq2.3],[eq2.6 ] ) and using density distributions of the projectile nuclei @xmath5he and @xmath5li . \n it is seen that they exceed the experimental data and their shapes follow to the data at energies higher than 15 mev / nucleon . \n numerical calculations of cross sections were made by using the code dwuck4 @xcite . \n on the next step of our study , to fit cross sections to the data we renormalize strengths of the real and imaginary parts of the potential @xmath29 this procedure is commonly used for the real double - folding potential when one adds the phenomenological imaginary part having itself several free parameters . \n contrastingly , in our study , on the first stage , we introduce only two parameters to renormalize strengths of the real @xmath23 and imaginary @xmath30 parts , calculated microscopically . \n 5 shows the results for the @xmath5he+@xmath2si cross section when the most realistic lssm projectile density of @xmath5he was taken in calculations . \n one sees that the renormalization makes it possible to agree calculations to experimental data at larger energies , whereas a significant discrepancy between the theory and experimental data at lower energies is still unchanged . \n we also mention that there exist some kind of ambiguity when comparing calculated cross sections with the data . here \n we show two nearby curves , the solid one has renormalization parameters n@xmath31=n@xmath32=0.5 , and the dashed one n@xmath31=1.0 , n@xmath32=0.4 . \n so , we conclude that in the framework of microscopic `` volume potentials '' ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , the simultaneous explanation of the data in the whole region of measurements is not possible . in this connection , at lower energies , the coulomb interaction can be thought play a pronounced role in the nuclear reaction mechanism . \n so , to get more precise results we computed the coulomb potential using the microscopic folding formula ( [ eq2.2 ] ) with the realistic charge lssm density and the @xmath33 charge interaction potential @xmath34 . \n such coulomb potential and corresponding cross sections was calculated for the @xmath5he@xmath4si system and compared to that obtained traditionally with a help of the uniformly distributed charge in the sphere of the radius of the sum of radii of colliding nuclei . on the left side of fig . \n 6 we exhibit the both potentials . \n one sees the visible difference of them in the interior region and their small separation in the peripheral band , while at larger distances they coincide to one another . \n however this changes do not reveal themselves in behavior of cross sections ( right side of fig . \n 6 ) , and the `` bump '' of the @xmath5he+@xmath2si total reaction cross section at e@xmath35 mev is not explained by correcting the coulomb potential . \n going step by step in the framework of our goal to study an applicability of microscopic potentials , at this stage we intend to simulate an influence of nuclear collective modes on the mechanism of nucleus - nucleus scattering . \n it is known from the theory of inelastic scattering that excitations of nuclear collective states can be understood by introducing transition potentials in the form of the derivative of an elastic scattering potential . with respect to this prescription , \n we add the derivatives @xmath36 of our microscopic template potentials ( `` surface terms '' ) to construct optical potentials @xmath37\\,+\\ , i{\\left}[n_{im}w^h - n_{im}^{(1)}r{dw^h\\over dr}{\\right}],\\ ] ] @xmath38\\,+\\ , i{\\left}[n_{im}v^{df}-n_{im}^{(1)}r{dv^{df}\\over dr}{\\right}],\\ ] ] thus , when fitting cross sections to the data we have two else free parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 responsible to the contribution of collective terms . \n in fig.7 we demonstrate result of calculations obtained for two kinds of nucleus - nucleus potentials . \n one of them ( left panel ) is calculated for the paris effective nn - potential cdm3y6 with the lssm density of @xmath5he , and the other one ( right panel ) is for the reid bdm3y2 nn - potential @xcite with the fdm - model ( functional density method ) @xcite of density of @xmath5he . \n the fitted coefficients are @xmath41=0.7 , @xmath39=0.4 , @xmath42=0.5 , @xmath40=0.03 ( cdm3y2 case ) , and @xmath41=1 , @xmath39=0.212 , @xmath42=0.3 , @xmath40=0.038 ( bdm3y2 case ) . \n it is seen that by introducing derivatives one can get the fairly well agreement with the experimental data in the first case , and the qualitative description for the second potential . \n these potentials with the `` surface terms '' have more smooth diffuseness layers as compared to `` the volume potentials '' ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , and this behavior is in correspondence with the models of collective motions of a nuclear surface .    by the way , such semi - microscopic optical potentials need in further improvements to exclude free parameters and to give their fully microscopic interpretation . in this connection , \n the problem of the physical nature of an enhancement in the @xmath5he+@xmath2si total reaction cross section at about 10 mev over the coulomb barrier is still calls for experimental and theoretical investigations . \n in particular , the study of angular distributions in elastic channel can decrease an ambiguity of parameters of semi - microscopic optical potentials . \n microscopic models of nucleus - nucleus optical potentials have no free parameters . \n they are constructed by using physical characteristics of structure of colliding nuclei and of effective nucleon - nucleon forces in nuclear medium . \n we considered a possibility of the microscopic folding potentials to study the total cross sections of reactions @xmath5he+@xmath2si and @xmath5li+@xmath2si . \n it was shown that a little renormalization of strengths of this potentials by introducing two parameters allow for explain the data at comparably higher energies @xmath43 mev / nucleon . in this region , the cross sections , calculated with the help of several developed models of the projectile nuclei , are closely related to each other . \n simultaneously , it is seen the visible disagreement of these calculations with the lower - energy data , and so that this is the subject of further investigations . \n our treatment to use the microscopically calculated coulomb potential does not improve results at these energies . \n this turn us to remind that , in general , the ordinary folding potentials take into account only one - particle density distributions of colliding nuclei , and thus effects of another channels , connected with nuclear collective excitations and the nucleon removal reactions , can also play a role in collisions of nuclei . \n these effects were approximately accounted for by adding the derivatives of the folding potentials to the basic microscopic `` volume potential '' , and as a result , the fairly well agreement was obtained with the data at lower energies . \n thus one can conclude that the more developed theory of reactions with exotic beams is called rather than the use of some kind of phenomenological constructions of averaged optical potentials based only on methods of double - folding calculations . \n 99 -1.mm i.v.kuznetsov , e.bialkowski , m.p.ivanov , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n * 65 * 1569 ( 2002 ) . \n m.k.baktybaev , a.duisebaev , b.a.duisebaev , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 66 * , 1615 ( 2003 ) . \n v.yu.ugryumov , i.v.kuznetsov , k.b.basybekov , _ et al _ , _ nucl . \n a _ * 734 * , e53 ( 2004 ) . \n v.yu.ugryumov , i.v.kuznetsov , e.bialkowski , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 68 * , 16 ( 2005 ) . \n yu.g.sobolev , a.budzanowski , e.bialkowski , _ et al _ , _ bull . \n acad.sc . , \n physics _ * 69*,(2005 ) 1790 . \n i.tanihata , _ et al _ , _ phys . \n b _ * 289 * , 261 ( 1992 ) . \n m.v.zhukov , b.v.danilin , d.v.fedorov , _ et al _ , * phys . rep . * * 231 * , 151 ( 1993 ) . \n s.karataglidis , p.j.dortmans , k.amos , and c.bennhold , _ phys . \n c _ * 61 * , 024319 ( 2000 ) . \n j.d.patterson and r.j.peterson , _ nucl . \n a _ * 717 * , 235 ( 2003 ) . \n d.t.khoa and g.r.satchler , _ nucl \n a _ * 668 * , 3 ( 2000 ) . \n v.k.lukyanov , e.v.zemlyanaya , k.v.lukyanov , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 69 * , 240 ( 2006 ) . \n r.j.glauber , _ lectures on theoretical physics _ ( interscience , new york , 1959 ) , p.315 . \n a.g.sitenko , _ ukr . fiz . journal _ * 4 * , 152 ( 1959 ) . \n s.charagi and g.gupta , _ phys . rev . \n c _ * 41 * , 1610 ( 1990 ) . \n p.d.kunz and e.rost , _ computational nuclear physics _ v.2 ( eds : langanke k.et al . , springer verlag , 1993 ) p.88 . \n o.m.knyazkov , i.n.kukhtina , s.a.fayans , _ phys . at \n _ , * 61 * , 533 ( 1998 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 5135914769224, "RequestID": "6968b9ae45f36c8c62c6ff733aa789fe47bddd6d", "TotalTokens": 3598}
{"ContextTokens": 2407, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "evolutionary population synthesis predictions depends strongly on the stellar inputs . \n one of them is the library of stellar spectra used to compute the integrated population spectrum . to interpret the integrated light of post - starburst galaxies in the near - ir , where the bulk of the energy of luminous evolved stars is emitted \n , one needs to introduce in some way the spectral signatures of such stars ( essentially molecular absorption bands ) . \n asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb stars ) are characterized by low temperatures as well as high luminosity . \n the third dredge - up phenomenon on the agb , due to the recurrent penetration of the convective envelope into the carbon - rich layers , brings the products of the helium burning nucleosynthesis to the surface ( see mowlavi , 1998 , for a review ) , and is responsible for the eventual conversion of some m stars to carbon stars . \n this process is highly efficient in metal - poor systems , where the c stars can dominate the agb stars population luminosity at low metallicity ( groenewegen 1998 ) . \n another particularity of the most evolved agb stars is their high rate of mass loss ( @xmath2 , zijlstra 1998 ) . \n these stars , surrounded by a dusty envelope , emit most of their energy at wavelengths from a few to a few hundred microns . \n they can be missed in optical surveys , and accounting for circumstellar extinction reduces the predicted emission of the agb population even in the near - ir spetral region ( see habing , 1996 , for detailed review ) .    for intermediate age populations one must take into account all the agb properties pointed out above . \n the different librairies used in the literature , empirical or synthetic ones , ( terndrup et al . \n 1990 , lanon & rocca - volmerange 1992 , fluks et al . \n 1994 , lejeune et al . \n 1998 ) have introduced cool static giant stars , but they are not appropriate to distinguish between red giant stars and agb stars . \n bressan et al . \n ( 1998 ) have taken the presence of the agb stars into account in their modelling of the intermediate age population by assigning , to each point of an isochrone , parameters of a dusty envelope model and performing radiative transfer calculations to correct the spectra of static giant star . \n this method is promising but it takes into account only the effects of the circumstellar shells around agb stars . our principal motivation is to recognise the presence of agb stars in the integrated near - ir spectrum of a stellar population and to introduce all the effects pointed out above to be able to interpret accurately the spectrophotometric propreties of intermediate age stellar populations . \n the scope of this paper is to construct a new stellar library taking into account the relevant processes affecting the near - ir spectra of agb stars . \n the spectra of our sample ( lanon & wood , 1997 ) cover a broad spectral range ( 0.52.5@xmath3 m ) quasi - instantaneously , i.e. with no phase mixing . \n this sample consists of a wide range of cool objects : @xmath4 o - rich miras and @xmath5 c - rich miras , with various periods ( between @xmath6 and @xmath7 days , corresponding to different luminosities ) , observed @xmath8 times or more on different phases ( up to @xmath9 times ) . for reference and comparison , \n the sample also includes spectra of non - variable m - type giants , supergiants , lmc and galactic bulge variables , and oh / ir and c / ir . the near - ir spectra , taken at 2.3 m anu telescope at siding spring observatory , have a resolution of @xmath10 and are connected with overlapping low resolution optical spectra , taken at mt stromlo observatory . \n the quality of the spectra is good ; the s / n per resolved element usually reaches @xmath11 in atmospheric windows and the typical uncertainty on ( i - k ) is @xmath12mag . \n + the data confirm that the long period variables display much deeper near - ir molecular absorption bands than the cool and luminous static stars ( bessell et al . \n to estimate the luminosity of our spectra , we have used the l@xmath13-p relation of kanbur et al . \n ( 1998 ) , and an instantanous bolometric correction , obtained from the individual spectra themselves ( mouhcine et al . in preparation ) . \n + the effective temperature ( t@xmath14 ) determination is more problematic ( see haniff et al . \n 1995 for the essential reasons , which we can not discuss in enough detail here ) , and will strongly affect in the synthetic integrated spectra . \n the shape of the spectral energy distribution of the o - rich long - period variables ( lpvs ) is similar at most phases to that of static m giants ( fig.1 ) . \n alvarez et al . \n ( in preparation ) find that the optical spectra of lpvs can be fitted well with static giant model atmospheres . \n this might be interpreted as an indication that the t@xmath14 scale of the lpvs and static giants are equivalent . \n a large grid of static giant spectra was used to determine the effective temperatures of the spectra of our sample . feast ( 1996 ) has derived an alternative temperature scale for lpvs using a data set grouping m mira and non - mira stars . \n the colour - t@xmath14 relation derived is steeper than the one derived using the static giants models : cool mira spectra are assigned lower t@xmath14 values . \n this relation could be biased since the t@xmath14 used in feast s fit are derived from angular diameter measurements , who are interpreted using uncertain models both to correct for limb - darkening and to convert a monochromatic radius to the effective radius ( rosseland optical depth 2/3 or 1.0 ) . \n the situation is complicated by the uncertainties about the pulsation mode of some lpvs . \n in addition , the t@xmath14 derived can be biased if there is some scattering source ( dust ? ) in the upper atmospheres of lpvs that makes them appear bigger than they are ( wood , private communication ) . \n + to be conservative we have constructed two different librairies considering the two different t@xmath14-(j - k ) relations . \n schematically , the thermal pulses move stars up and down in luminosity along the evolutionary tracks , while the lpv pulsations ( periods of @xmath15 days ) occur perpendicular to the tracks ( large t@xmath14 shifts ) , deeply modifying the spectral type , the shape of the global energy distribution and the spectral signatures of the stars . \n the evolutionary tracks represent the evolution of static parent stars of the pulsating long period variables . how do we deal with this problem ? how to determine the stellar spectrum to associate with each point of the evolutionary tracks \n ? there are two approaches to adopt . \n one is to obtain properly weighted averages of the phase dependent spectra of individual stars , for various masses and evolutionary stages . \n this approach is , in principle , correct , but needs a huge amount of data or large pulsating model grids , which makes this approach very hard practically . \n the second approach , which was adopted , is to average the instantaneous spectra by temperature bin , disregarding phase and the pulsation properties . \n this approach is supported by the fact that , in our sample , no systematic correlation between the molecular indices and the luminosity or amplitude was found . \n in addition , this approach needs much less data . \n + our library also contains carbon stars . using interferometric angular diameters , in combinaison with bolometric flux , dyck et al . \n ( 1997 ) have found that there is small range of effective temperatures for c - stars over a large range in spectral type , and derived that t@xmath16 k. finally , the library includes 5 oh / ir and several observations of 1 c / ir star . \n this library of averaged spectra is constructed for population synthesis modelling . \n it should become public before the end of the year . \n we acknowledge the fruitful collaboration with r. alvarez , b. plez , m. scholz , p. wood , for different aspects of this work . \n alvarez , r , lanon , a , plez , b , in preparation bessell , m. , schloz , m. , wood , p. , 1996 , a&a , 307 , 481 bressan , a , granato , g. , silva , l. , 1998 , a&a , 332 , 135 dyck , h. m. , van belle , g. t. , benson , j. a. , 1996 , aj , 112 , 294 feast , m. w. , 1996 , mnras , 278 , 11 fluks , m. a. , plez , b. , the , p. s. , et al , 1994 , a&as , 105 , 311 groenewegen , m. a. t. , 1998 , eds . \n le bertre et al , 191 iau sympo . in press habing , h. j. , 1996 , a&ar , 7 , 97 haniff , c. a. , scholz , m. , tuthill , p. g. , 1995 , mnras , 276 , 640 kanbur , s. m. , hendry , m. a. , clarke , d. , 1998 , mnras , 289 , 428 lanon , a. , mouhcine , m. , fioc , m. , silva , d. , 1999 , a&a , 344 , l21 lanon , a. , rocca -

frequency resolution in an uncertainty principle of short wave packet . according to the complemental relation between the time and the frequency \n , we can improve time resolution in high frequency band , can improve frequency resolution in lower frequency band instead of time resolution . \n we began to employ with wavelet transform to achieve such resolution and to make more clear appearance of burst gravitational waves . \n this research is supported in part by a grant -
