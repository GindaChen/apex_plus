The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Ariz., which sits on the Mexican border. Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helped Mexican authorities nab the cartel members, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the US border, ICE rep Gillian Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand. \"This operation was conducted with utmost secrecy to maintain the element of surprise and to ensure the safety of the Mexican law enforcement officers executing it,\" Christensen said, per CNN. ICE helped Mexican federal police into the US to keep them safe during the operation, Christensen said. The sting also netted the seizure of several assault-type weapons and hundreds of pounds of drugs. \"ICE applauds the government of Mexico for their bold action in taking down this criminal organization and for their continued pressure on the Sinaloa Cartel throughout Mexico,\" Christensen said. The arrests are the latest blow to the Sinaloa Cartel after the arrest of El Chapo on Jan. 8. The 24 people arrested Friday have not been identified.

Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees Fahrenheit, 96% of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture (the Guardian reports kernels are 14% water) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains Phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture.

During the Oct. 23 surgery, De Jesus began to bleed \"quite heavily. ... In the midst of this, Mr. Al-Abed removed what he clearly believed to be the appendix. He thought he found it, removed it, and gave to a nurse what later turned out to be Patient A's ovary,\" the tribunal heard. Coker, who was eating lunch at the time, was never summoned, nor was he aware the surgery was taking place. The mistake wasn't uncovered until much later. The Telegraph reports that De Jesus returned to the hospital in severe pain on Nov. 7; two days later another doctor realized she still had her appendix, and the next day she went into surgery to have it actually removed. Instead, she died on the OR table, having earlier delivered a stillborn boy. Her cause of death was ruled as multiple organ failure due to septicemia.

Scientists originally thought calves made noise when they wanted food, but that appears to not be the case, according to Science. Researchers now theorize baby humpbacks whisper to help their moms keep track of them while the family is on the move. Mother humpback whales will occasionally whisper back to their calves despite being capable of making much louder noises, Seeker reports. It's possible the calves themselves are also physically capable of making louder noises. This suggests to researchers the whales are whispering to avoid being detected by predators\u2014such as killer whales, which Videsen says \"can use these sounds ... like homing cues\"\u2014or by male humpback whales that would break up the family. If that's the case, it could be evidence of high intelligence in humpbacks. \u201cIt can only make you happy to hear these sounds,\" Videsen says. NPR has a recording of the whispers.

Elise Huchard and Dieter Lukas studied 260 species; in about 45% of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says Huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies\u2014though not their own\u2014so the mom is available for mating. In the case of Chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes Lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the \"most detailed to date\" on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But Mom has a Jerry Springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the Telegraph reports. After all, \"males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own,\" Lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: The researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports Smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too.

Whoever did it had knowledge about how the chicken farms operate, says Clarendon County Sheriff Randy Garrett; the suspect or suspects bypassed the alarm systems in order to change the chicken house temperatures. Young chicks need the temperature to be around 95 to 100 degrees; as they get older, that temperature drops to 65 to 70 degrees, the sheriff says. \"Depending on the age of the birds, they knew whether to jack the heat up\" or turn it down, he says. \"They had all that knowledge of the farms and how many weeks growth the chickens were.\" The alarm systems are set to control the temperature and ventilation and notify farmers via phone if the buildings get too hot or cold, but without the system working, chickens can die in as little as an hour, the sheriff says. \"They roasted them,\" says one farmer who lost 200,000 chickens. \"I hate for them to be destroyed like that.\" The employee who discovered the deaths first noticed steam coming from the chicken houses, and found the inside temperature at 115 degrees. \"The heat could have knocked you down,\" he says. \"It takes dirty people to do something like that.\" Pilgrim's Pride laid off 60 people prior to the killings, which have caused an estimated $1.7 million in losses to the farmers.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, getting to nine figures would be an auction record for a painting by an old master\u2014that is, a European who painted before about 1800. But not just any old master: Leonardo da Vinci. His \"Salvator Mundi,\" or the savior of the world, is one of fewer than 20 da Vincis known to exist, and all the others are held by museums. It's currently owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who will likely be selling it at a loss. He bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million, and per his rep, \"the forthcoming auction of this work will finally bring to an end a very painful chapter.\" The pain he's referring to relates to Rybolovlev's dealings with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier, who counted Rybolovlev among his clients. Bouvier himself had purchased the work privately for $80 million; the 60% increase in price spurred allegations of fraud and ongoing court cases. But the drama began before then, with what Christie's calls \"the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century.\" It says it's known the painting belonged to both King Charles I of England and King Charles II, but the painting was lost from 1763 until 1900 when the work\u2014which had \"extensive repainting\" over Jesus' face and hair\u2014was purchased as a work attributed to one of da Vinci's followers. It sold at auction in 1958 for what Quartz reports was $60. A group of art dealers bought it in 2005, painstakingly restored it, and announced their find, the first da Vinci to be discovered since 1909.

A big mess ensued: Hippensteel and Ousley divorced in March; Eisenberg and his former fianc\u00e9e are in the midst of custody proceedings over their 6-year-old child; and both Hippensteel and Eisenberg face misdemeanor charges of unlawful disclosure of intimate visual material. Hippensteel was arrested earlier this month for allegedly blackmailing her ex-husband with the sex videos during their divorce proceedings, threatening to send them to the Christian high school where he worked if he didn't give her money. Ousley showed police records appearing to prove he gave Hippensteel $7,812.21. She then allegedly sent the videos to Eisenberg, who says he received them on Feb. 2, and also allegedly sent them to Ousley's employer. Ousley resigned after administrators confronted him about the videos. The videos also somehow ended up on pornhub.com. On Thursday, a judge barred Eisenberg from contacting Ousley or his former fianc\u00e9e.

Only 22 survivors lived long enough for the ship to be found, notes CNN. The son of the ship's dentist tells CNN that he regards the Indianapolis as his father's grave, and that \"I don't think I have cried this hard in my adult life.\" He adds that, \"my mother would be torn to pieces if she were still living.

Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable.

Morgan has inserted himself into the life of Lee, 95, according to the restraining order. The filing accuses Morgan, 42, of taking advantage of Lee's impaired hearing, vision, and judgment, moving Lee from his longtime family home and preventing family and associates from contacting him. Morgan was arrested on Monday for allegedly filing a false police report by calling 911 saying burglars were in his house when in fact two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on Lee. Morgan's arrest and ouster is the latest and thus far most dramatic move in a struggle that has emerged over Lee's business and fortune since his wife of 69 years, Joan, died in July. Police have been investigating reports of elder abuse against Lee since at least February, and had issued an emergency order keeping Morgan from Lee before Wednesday's order was issued. Lee has for decades been revered as a comic book giant for his central role in creating the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and other major Marvel characters.

The Post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against Kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him (two of whom have never spoken out publicly before); BuzzFeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with Kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly \"brainwashed\" by Kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call \"Daddy.\" They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups. And BuzzFeed's sources say Kelly rules all aspects of the women's lives, telling them when to eat and sleep and what to wear, among other things, and punishing them if they break a rule. Parents who spoke to both publications claim Kelly is keeping their children from contacting them. Read both pieces in full here and here.

As for virgins, they faced double the cancer risk faced by those who'd had sex, the Telegraph reports. The reasons behind the findings aren't clear, but lead researcher Marie-Elise Parent notes that frequent sex means more frequent ejaculation; earlier studies, she says, have indicated that frequent ejaculation helps prevent prostate cancer. But the findings, based on surveys of 3,200 subjects, didn't hold true for men sleeping with men, the Independent reports. Men who had sex exclusively with men and had had more than 20 partners actually saw twice the prostate cancer risk of men who'd never slept with men. Parent says she has only \"highly speculative\" explanations for that, and anyway, those findings weren't statistically significant. So is all this a good reason for men to run out and sleep with as many women as possible? Parent throws a little cold water on that particular fire: \"I don't think we can say that.

But new research from Duke University shows that the magic lasts a little longer than previously thought: Rather than being limited to the period right after birth, the window lasts all the way up 'til Junior turns three, say researchers. \"And for some (racial) subgroups,\" says study author Christina Gibson-Davis, \"that moment lasts even longer.\" African-American moms, for example, mostly married after the child's third birthday. Other findings, per the survey of 5,255 kids born outside wedlock in the US: Some 64% of kids born to unwed parents eventually saw mom tie the knot, though the caveats here are that it wasn't necessarily to their dad and that many of those unions dissolved. \"These marriages are fragile,\" says Gibson-Davis. \"If you think that stable marriage is beneficial for kids, very few kids born out of wedlock are experiencing that.\" The odds of those marriages lasting are better when dad, rather than step-dad, is involved. After a decade, 54% of marriages involving a step-father crumbled, while that number was 38% among biological fathers. Race did not factor here.

They then made super-attractive hybrids by pairing the most attractive in both buckets.
