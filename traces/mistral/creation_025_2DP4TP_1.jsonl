B&N originally had not specified why Pareneros, who did not receive severance, was fired, the Wall Street Journal reports. Parneros initially sued because, he claimed, the company fired him for no reason after just 14 months on the job; B&N says in its suit that Parneros \"downplays what occurred.\" Now, in response to the bookseller's countersuit, he has issued a statement denying all of the company's allegations. The sexual harassment claim is \"completely false\" and he never bullied anyone, he says, adding that he was also \"fully supportive of the sales process from the start.\" But B&N says that in addition to the female employee who says that, on two occasions, Parneros subjected her to unwanted touching or sexual comments, the company has received \"additional complaints about Parneros\u2019 inappropriate behavior toward women\" since he was fired. Pareneros' suit sought $4 million in severance plus other damages; B&N's suit says the company should be allowed to recoup Pareneros' salary, bonus, and any other benefits accrued during the time his \"disloyal conduct\" was allegedly occurring, plus cancel his outstanding equity awards.

Billings, Montana, news station KULR-TV reports that Jeff Murphy of Batavia, Illinois, was looking for the treasure that antiquities dealer and author Forrest Fenn said he stashed somewhere in the Rocky Mountains several years ago. The investigation by Yellowstone officials into Murphy's death was kept private, but KULR obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request, the AP reports. The investigative report reveals Murphy's wife told park authorities that Murphy was looking for the treasure when she called to report him missing. Murphy's body was found June 9, 2017. He had fallen about 500 feet down a steep slope. The report ruled the death an accident. The lure of the treasure, which is said to be worth nearly $2 million, has prompted thousands to comb areas of New Mexico, Yellowstone National Park, and elsewhere. Murphy is one of several people who have died while looking for the treasure; the deaths have led some to call for an end the treasure hunt. Besides the danger to the treasure hunters, they note that search and rescue efforts for missing treasure hunters are costly. Fenn has dropped clues to the chest's whereabouts in a cryptic poem in his memoir, The Thrill of the Chase. Those who have lost their lives to the hunt include a 54-year-old grandfather, a pastor whose body was found in a river, and a 31-year-old whose raft flipped in another river.

Mother humpback whales will occasionally whisper back to their calves despite being capable of making much louder noises, Seeker reports. It's possible the calves themselves are also physically capable of making louder noises. This suggests to researchers the whales are whispering to avoid being detected by predators\u2014such as killer whales, which Videsen says \"can use these sounds ... like homing cues\"\u2014or by male humpback whales that would break up the family.

In a study in the journal Perception, scientists had a group of 19 healthy (i.e., no brain damage or other malady that would affect sensation interpretation) volunteers between the ages of 22 and 34 stick out their feet and have their toes prodded, and while 94% knew if it was their big toe or little toe being touched, only 57%, 60%, and 79% could correctly ID their second, third, and fourth toes, respectively. Meanwhile, when asked to ID their fingers using the same method, the rate shot up to 99%. The most problems came in differentiating between the second and third toes, per a press release, and no subject was able to guess every toe correctly. The confusion seemed to be more prevalent when testing a subject's non-dominant foot, and surprisingly, just under half of the volunteers reported feeling like one of their toes wasn't even there. \"We do know of medical conditions that can cause people to lose the sense of one of their digits,\" Nela Cicmil, one of the study's co-authors, says in the release. \"The people being tested here were healthy, yet some were reporting the feeling of a missing toe.\" Why this finding could potentially be useful: If healthy people aren't able to \"feel\" their toes accurately, tests that check toes for sensation or movement may not be the best method to assess if a patient may have brain damage. Plus, \"a better understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie simpler mistakes of body representation \u2026 will help us to understand disturbance of body image in more complex cases like anorexia,\" Cicmil tells AFP.

Elise Huchard and Dieter Lukas studied 260 species; in about 45% of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says Huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies\u2014though not their own\u2014so the mom is available for mating. In the case of Chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes Lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the \"most detailed to date\" on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But Mom has a Jerry Springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the Telegraph reports. After all, \"males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own,\" Lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: The researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports Smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too. Huchard and Lukas will be studying them next.

When they didn't show at the resort, the cops were alerted, and they were found at the bottom of the cliff early Sunday. The older boy was dead at the scene.

Researchers looked at 422 proteins present in sperm, and found that among the smokers, one was absent, 27 underrepresented, and six overrepresented.

To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually. But the fish also gave off a chemical signal with urine. In cases where the barrier had tiny holes allowing water to flow through, for example, the smaller fish appeared to get a signal from the larger fish to stop their attack since they were more likely to show aggression when the barrier was solid. Both the smaller and larger fish also peed more when presented with another fish than they did when alone, especially when the barrier between them kept them from receiving the other fish's signals.

The UK woman became estranged from her mother in 1978 when Ilott, at 17, went to live with her boyfriend, who ultimately became her husband. In 2002, Ilott's mother, Melita Jackson, made her last will, specifically noting that Ilott had been disinherited and instructing executors to fight any claim Ilott might attempt to make on the estate. Jackson died in 2004, leaving the majority of her $600,000 estate to animal charities. In 2007, Ilott challenged the will under the Inheritance Act, which allows a child to sue if a parent's will does not reasonably provide for their maintenance, per the Evening Standard. She argued she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded and that she, now a mother of five herself, was living on state benefits because she had no pension. A district judge awarded her about $60,000 of the estate. Quite a bit of back-and-forth followed, per the BBC: Ilott then tried to get more of the money, leading a High Court judge to reverse the district judge's decision, awarding Ilott nothing. In 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled she should get some of the money, but in 2014, again battling to get more of the money, the High Court denied her. The following year, however, she won a challenge at the Court of Appeal, which heard testimony that she couldn't even afford clothes for her children, and was awarded about $200,000. But three of the animal charities that were named in Jackson's will then challenged that increase, and now the Supreme Court has ruled in their favor. It's the first time a suit under the Inheritance Act has made it to the highest court, the Telegraph reports. Ilott will still get the original $60,000 she was awarded.

The decibel level of the bells is the equivalent of a chainsaw; the Swiss Accident Insurance Fund says human exposure to this level of noise for even eight hours a day would negatively and seriously affect health. And since the bovine ear is even more sensitive than the human one, the bells might lead to deafness in cows, reports Time. But the head of the Swiss Countryside Union counters that the cows only wear \"size 31\" bells during ceremonial occasions\u2014as little as once a year, reports the Local. He brushes off the idea of replacing the bells, which farmers use to locate their cattle, with GPS devices; farmers point out that reception in the alpine areas would be poor. The study didn't investigate whether the bells had any effect on milk production.

In fact, more than 4,000 brewers are battling for less than a dozen popular hop varieties \"like a bunch of wolves going after a carcass,\" Wicked Weed Brewing co-owner Luke Dickinson tells the Wall Street Journal. The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65% in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature (it takes the vines two to three years), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. \"To deal with a few boxes of this [variety] and few pellets of that is a real challenge,\" says Diane Gooding of Gooding Farms in Idaho.

Burtschin hurried over in his boat and pulled out Shadow's lifeless body. \"As soon as I saw her in the water, I thought she was dead,\" he tells WPTV.

That's essentially what the Hubble Space Telescope has captured in a new image of the Twin Jet Nebula, a shimmering planetary nebula that strongly resembles a winged insect, reports CNET. What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the European Space Agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun. \"The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf,\" the ESA says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display. At the center of each wing, blue areas represent violent jets of gas gushing into space at approximately 621,000mph. Discovered in 1947 and officially known as PN M2-9, the Twin Jet Nebula gets its more common name from its shape. \"If the nebula is sliced across the star, each side of it appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines,\" says the ESA. Astronomers believe the nebula is only about 1,200 years old, based on how quickly the wings are expanding, which they will continue to do. Mashable reports Hubble took a colorful shot of the nebula in 1997, but it isn't nearly as clear as this latest photo.

Morgan was arrested on Monday for allegedly filing a false police report by calling 911 saying burglars were in his house when in fact two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on Lee. Morgan's arrest and ouster is the latest and thus far most dramatic move in a struggle that has emerged over Lee's business and fortune since his wife of 69 years, Joan, died in July. Police have been investigating reports of elder abuse against Lee since at least February, and had issued an emergency order keeping Morgan from Lee before Wednesday's order was issued. Lee has for decades been revered as a comic book giant for his central role in creating the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and other major Marvel characters. Morgan is a memorabilia dealer and Marilyn Monroe expert who befriended Lee's daughter and only child JC Lee. Lee appeared in a video posted to his Twitter account Sunday declaring that Morgan was his only partner and representative, and anyone claiming otherwise was lying.", "StartTimeOffset": 2245928016603, "RequestID": "ede5bd4bc2a9473db17ae8c2e955def3", "TotalTokens": 1207}
