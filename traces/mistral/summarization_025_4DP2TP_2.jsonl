{"ContextTokens": 2477, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum antiferromagnetism for unfrustrated systems has been one of the most extensively researched subjects in condensed matter physics . \n one of the simplest models in this family , the nearest neighbor spin @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice , has been studied extensively : analytically with spin wave  @xcite and schwinger boson approaches  @xcite and numerically with quantum monte carlo  @xcite  ( which has no `` sign problem '' for bipartite lattices ) . \n that said , effects from physical imperfections such as the presence of open edges  @xcite and static non magnetic impurities  @xcite are less well understood and hence are areas of active research .    in this paper , we study quantum antiferromagnetism on the cayley tree  ( or bethe lattice  @xcite ) a bipartite lattice without loops , with the motivation of understanding the low energy spectrum of the spin half heisenberg model on this lattice . \n the cayley tree has the well - known general pathology that , in the thermodynamic limit , the number of boundary sites is a finite fraction of the total number of sites ; as a consequence , different ways of approaching the thermodynamic limit may give different results in any problem based on the cayley tree . \n a particular manifestation of this for the antiferromagnet is that finite trees may have a large excess of sites belonging to one sublattice over the other . \n our systematic study of the low energy spectrum of the spin half heisenberg hamiltonian on the cayley tree shows that the effect of sublattice imbalance is to create a `` tower of states '' , lower than the anderson tower of states  @xcite . \n a similar result was obtained by wang and sandvik  @xcite from their study of spin half antiferromagnets on diluted square lattices . aided by numerical calculations , \n we propose a framework for understanding this effect . \n we also find that schwinger boson mean field theory  @xcite is a good description of the many body ground state and can reproduce many of its features quantitatively . \n previous studies of this model by otsuka  @xcite and friedman  @xcite focused primarily on ground state properties and excited states were not considered in these studies . \n more recently kumar et al . \n @xcite have significantly extended this analysis to both the spin-1/2 and spin-1 heisenberg model . \n we use all these studies as useful benchmarks for our own numerical calculations .    from a theorist s perspective \n , the cayley tree achieves many simplifications which makes exact solutions possible , e.g. the bose hubbard model on this lattice was recently solved by semerijan , tarzia and zamponi  @xcite . \n it is also the basis of approximations such as the brinkman - rice treatment of the hubbard model  @xcite . \n more recently , it found applications in the treatment of the quantum impurity problem which is at the heart of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . it does not appear that a spin model has been realized on such a topology experimentally ( though there has been interest in the study of dendrimers  @xcite ) .    in our case , the complete absence of loops makes this lattice conducive for the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite . with the dmrg method we have an explicit ( yet compact ) representation of ground and excited state many - body wavefunctions which gives us abundant information to understand the low energy properties of these systems . \n in particular , reduced density matrices can be used as tools to understand properties of these states  @xcite . \n the remainder of the paper is divided as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] \n we introduce the model and lattices being investigated and define a measure of sublattice imbalance associated with them . in section  [ sec : dmrg ] , we give a brief overview of our implementation of the dmrg algorithm applied to generic trees . in section  [ sec : gs ] , we discuss the general properties of the ground state and excited states of the bond - centered cayley tree . in section  [ sec : sma ] , we use a variational ansatz given by the single mode approximation , in conjunction with an argument from first order perturbation theory , to explain the finite size scaling of the spin gap . finally , in section  [ \n sec : sbmft ] , we corroborate our observations of the ground state properties , by the use of the schwinger boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) . \n we consider the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 heisenberg model with uniform coupling @xmath2 , @xmath3 in this paper , we use the spin rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg_hamiltonian ] ) , to label many body states by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 refers to the spin of the state and @xmath6 is its @xmath7 component .    on a bipartite lattice ( with sublattices _ a _ and _ b _ ) , like the cayley tree , with @xmath8 sites in sublattice _ a _ and @xmath9 sites in sublattice _ \n , it is rigorously known  @xcite that the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian has a net spin @xmath10 . \n the first kind of tree we consider is the `` bond - centered '' cayley tree of the form depicted in fig .  [ \n fig : bond_site_center](a ) . \n the number of sites @xmath11 for such a cluster is related to the `` generation '' @xmath12 by , @xmath13 since the bond centered clusters have no `` global imbalance '' i.e. @xmath14 , the ground state is a singlet ( and the monotonicity of the energy with total spin @xmath5 implies that the first excited state is a triplet ) .        as mentioned before \n , the notion of `` local sublattice imbalance '' will be crucial in understanding the low energy physics . for the bond centered cluster , we define a measure of imbalance ( which we refer to as @xmath15 from here on ) by dividing the cluster at the central bond into two equal parts . \n we count the excess of one sublattice over the other in one half of the cluster and multiply by 1/2 for spin 1/2 . \n it can be easily shown that @xmath16 is related to the generation @xmath12 as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is for @xmath12 odd(even ) . \n [ fig : bond_site_center](b ) is the more usual way of defining a cayley tree and which we refer to as `` site - centered '' . the number of sites is related to the generation @xmath12 by , @xmath19 unlike the bond centered cluster , a global sublattice imbalance exists here which leads to a ground state spin of @xmath20 . \n we measure the imbalance @xmath21 in either of the three symmetrical arms of the site centered cayley tree : specifically , we count the excess sites of one sublattice over the other ( in one arm ) and multiply by 1/2 . \n this definition is particularly convenient as it gives us @xmath22 for all @xmath12 . a recent publication on the study of the heisenberg model on the cayley tree by kumar , ramasesha and soos  @xcite considers the site - centered clusters . \n we confirm their results for the site - centered case , but interestingly find that the bond - centered cluster has significantly different ground and excited state properties . \n we will provide some brief comparisons in section  [ sec : gs ] to illustrate this point . \n how is the situation different if there is no imbalance locally ? to address this , we introduce the `` fibonacci cayley tree '' . the recipe for constructing the generation @xmath23 \n fibonacci - cayley tree is to combine the generation @xmath12 and @xmath24 trees by connecting their roots ( head sites ) to a common site ( which in turn serves as the root ( head site ) of the generation @xmath23 tree ) . \n [ fig : bond_site_center](c ) illustrates this construction . \n the total number of sites @xmath11 at generation @xmath23 is , @xmath28 observe that @xmath29 satisfies the fibonacci recursion , that is , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the @xmath12-th fibonacci number , which justifies the name of the tree . \n the size of this lattice grows as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the golden ratio @xmath34 . also , every 3rd generation is unbalanced by 1 and every other generation is both globally and locally balanced . \n table  [ table : fibonacci ] shows the sizes of the fibonacci - cayley clusters along with the number of sites in the even and odd sublattices for up to @xmath35 generations . \n .number of sites in a fibonacci - cayley tree as a function of generation @xmath12 . \n @xmath36 is number of @xmath37 sublattice sites ; @xmath38 except for the entries marked with @xmath39 , in which case @xmath40 . \n the total count is @xmath41 .

{"ContextTokens": 3521, "GeneratedTokens": 107, "SynthesizedBody": "in a 1988 review in the _ handbook on the physics and chemistry of rare earths _ c. k. jrgensen asked the rhetorical question is quantum chemistry feasible ?  and with special regard to these elements he answered sorry , not today ; perhaps next century @xcite . presently , in the new century , the structure and reactivity of @xmath0 elements is a flourishing domain of theoretical chemistry [ insert reviews .. ] the main features of the chemistry of the lanthanides and the actinides can be deduced from simple atomic calculations . in figs . [ \n fig : lne]-[fig : anr ] we present orbital properties extracted from numerical 4-component relativistic hartree - fock calculations@xcite averaging over the valence configuration @xmath1 for the neutral lanthanide and actinide atoms . \n we have chosen this configuration , which is not the ground state configuration for all the @xmath0 elements , since it gives access to information about the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals . from the orbital energies in fig . \n [ fig : lne ] we observe a distinct energetical separation of the @xmath5 orbitals from the @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals of the lanthanides which explains their chemistry dominated by the @xmath8 oxidation state . \n we note that the @xmath6 levels cross the @xmath7 level towards the end of the series , a feature which may induce convergence problems in atomic calculations not exploiting the full atomic symmetry . \n [ fig : ane ] shows a somewhat different situation for the actinides in that the @xmath9 levels are energetically close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 levels at the beginning of the series , but are then strongly stabilized towards the end of the series . \n these features translate into a rich oxidation chemistry for the early actinides and a restriction to the @xmath8 oxidation state for the late actinides . \n this in turn explains the challenge of separating the minor actinides americium and curium from the lanthanides in the treatment of nuclear waste [ ref ] . \n looking at mean radii @xmath12 , we observe in fig . \n [ fig : lnr ] a distinct spatial separation of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals in the lanthanides , whereas the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals come quite a bit closer in the actinides . \n [ discuss lanthanide contraction ] it is also interesting to observe that whereas the spin - orbit splitting in the @xmath2 shell is considerably stronger than for the @xmath3 shell , any difference in spatial extent is hardly visible for the spin - orbit components of the @xmath2 shell . \n this can be understood from the fact that the @xmath2 orbitals are in general quite contracted and so any deformation of the orbitals is energetically very much more expensive than for the @xmath3 shell . \n with these observations in mind it was all the more surprising when clavagura _ \n @xcite reported a clear example of @xmath5 participation in bonding in luf@xmath13 since lutetium is at the very end of lanthanide series where one would expect the @xmath5 orbitals to be the most inert . \n the conclusion was seriously questioned by roos _ \n @xcite as well as ramakrishnan _ \n _ @xcite . \n the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the possible @xmath5 participation in luf@xmath13 by an independent approach . \n we employ a trick that may be useful for other purposes as well . \n we extend our electronic structure analysis to all trihalides ( x = f , cl , br , i ) of lutetium as well as of lawrencium . \n we thereby provide a comparison of covalency between these two elements , of relevance for the delicate problem of separation of the late actinides from the lanthanides . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] we describe our methodological approach . \n computational details are given in section [ sec : comp ] . in section [ sec : results ] we present and discuss the results of our geometry optimizations and electronic structure analysis , before concluding in section [ sec : conclusion ] . \n the question about the participation of @xmath2 orbitals in bonding in the lanthanides and actinides is very much a leading question :    1 . \n it assumes that one can identify these atomic orbitals in the electronic structure of the molecule . \n it assumes that one can unambiguously distinguish bonding from non - bonding contributions to the electronic structure of the molecule .    in order to tackle the first point we perform 4-component relativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) and kohn - sham ( ks ) calculations of the trihalides of lutetium and lawrencium ( lux@xmath13 and lrx@xmath13 , x = f , cl , br and i ) and investigate their electronic structure by projection analysis@xcite , that is we expand the molecular orbitals ( mos ) in pre - calculated orbitals ( index @xmath14 ) of the constituent atoms ( index @xmath15 ) . \n @xmath16 the fragment orbitals are usually restricted to the occupied orbitals of the selected configurations of the constituent atoms of the molecule . \n the expansion is completed by the polarization contribution @xmath17 which by construction is orthogonal to the fragment orbitals . once the expansion coefficients @xmath18 have been obtained a population analysis may be carried out completely analogous to , but without the basis set sensitivity of a mulliken population analysis . \n the selection of fragment orbitals should be adjusted if the gross population of the polarization contribution is significant . \n the next point is somewhat more difficult due to the invariance of the electronic energy under rotations of the occupied orbitals of these closed - shell molecules . \n this rotational freedom can be exploited to transform from canonical hartree - fock or kohn - sham orbitals to localized orbitals , or , in the terminology of mulliken@xcite , from spectroscopic to chemical mos . \n however , there is an abundance of possible localization criteria and thus perhaps not a clear answer from such an approach . \n the problem would have been simpler for the trihalide of any other lanthanide than lutetium since one would then expect inert @xmath5 orbitals to form an open shell . \n there would accordingly be a _ variance _ of the electronic energy with respect to rotations between the open- and closed - shell orbitals . \n however , this immediately suggests the strategy that we will pursue in this paper : we will place @xmath5 orbitals from an atomic calculation in an artificial open - shell with fractional occupation close to , but not equal to 14 . \n if the @xmath2 atomic orbitals now localize to the open shell , we have unambiguous evidence that they are chemically inert . \n all calculations reported in this paper are based on the 4-component dirac - coulomb hamiltonian with a gaussian charge distribution as the nuclear model using the recommended values of ref . \n the numerical atomic calculations were performed using the grasp code @xcite . \n molecular relativistic 4-component hartree - fock and density functional ( pbe @xcite and b3lyp @xcite ) calculations were carried out using the dirac08 package @xcite . \n we employed the cc - pvtz gaussian basis sets of dunning and co - workers @xcite for f , cl and br and equivalent sets of dyall and co - workers @xcite for i , lu and lr . the small component basis set for the 4-component relativistic calculations has been generated using restricted kinetic balance imposed in the canonical orthonormalization step@xcite . \n all basis sets are used in uncontracted form . \n hf and ks geometry optimizations were carried out using analytic and numerical gradients , respectively . for pyramidal ( @xmath19 ) and planar ( @xmath20 ) structures we employed the lower c@xmath21 and c@xmath22 symmetries , respectively . \n test calculations with cc - pvdz basis sets indicate that the resported structures can be considered converged with respect to the chosen basis sets . for the projection analysis fragment orbitals \n were generated by average - of - configuration hf calculations and ks calculations with fractional occupation , corresponding to ground state electronic configurations of the atoms . \n in table [ tab : lux3 ] , [ tab : lrx3 ] we present hf , b3lyp and pbe calculation for lutetium and lawrencium trihalides lux@xmath13 , lrx@xmath13 ( x = f , cl , br , i ) respectively . for the former trihalides , the lux@xmath13 , \n there exist a large number of theoretical works whereas very limited works concerned the lawrencium trihalides . since we will discuss the two table separately . in table [ tab : \n lux3 ] we summarise our result together with theoretical and experimental values from the literature , given also in the table the method ( or the hamiltonian ) and the basis set used to obtain these values . \n firs of all looking to the bond lengths in table [ tab : lux3 ] on see that our values using b3lyp have the best agreement with experimental ones and second there is a good agreement with the literature for the respective method ( or hamiltonian ) , especially with the hf values of ref . @xcite,@xcite and the pbe of ref . \n + concerning the geometrical shape and the bond angle we see that hf give a planer geometry for all the trihalides whereas b3lyp and pbe gives a pyramidal geometry for the luf@xmath13 only and a planar geometry for the other trihlides . \n increasing of the bond angle towards the heavier trihlides can be understood having in mind that the heaver halides have weaker ability to polarize the metal atom which means less distribution of the electronic density around the metal atom favoring a planar geometry with the highest bond angel of 120 grad and longer bond length towards the heavier halides as seen in table [ tab : lux3 ] . \n +      we have studied the possible @xmath5 orbital participation in bonding in luf@xmath13 by the approach presented in sections [ sec : theory ] and [ sec : comp ] . \n the results are summarized in table [ tab : luf3 ] . \n we first calculated the neutral lutetium atom in @xmath23 with linear supersymmetry . \n the resulting coefficients were exported to @xmath24 symmetry . \n the lu @xmath5 orbitals were next imported into a molecular calculation on luf@xmath13 in the optimized pyramidal geometry and kept frozen in an initial calculation on the neutral molecule . \n starting from the resulting molecular coefficients a series of ks calculations with fractional occupation , that is 14-@xmath25 electrons ( @xmath26 $ ] ) in 14 spinors , were carried out and the resulting molecular orbitals studied by projection analysis . in each calculation vector for each occupied orbital \n was selected based on overlap with the starting molecular coefficients . \n however , it is seen from table [ tab : luf3 ] that the electronic energy goes smoothly into the energy of the fully relaxed neutral molecule as the hole @xmath25 tends towards zero , indicated that we indeed obtained the ground state of the molecule for each value of @xmath25 . \n +   + * conclusions*[sec : conclusion ] the presented four component relativistic result for the trihalides of lutetium and lawrencium , lux3 , lrx3 ( x= f , cl , br , i ) respectively using density functional theory ( dft ) shows that the trend of bonding is from lighter to the heavier halide atoms and between 4f/5f atoms lu and lr .

{"ContextTokens": 3806, "GeneratedTokens": 246, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last two decades , a significant amount of observational and theoretical effort has been dedicated towards the understanding of an `` unusual '' class of pulsars , namely the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) . \n these relatively bright x - ray sources ( @xmath1ergs@xmath2 ) , discovered either as peculiar short x - ray bursts or steady x - ray emitters , were soon recognised as a distinct class of neutron stars with respect to the well known radio pulsar or x - ray binary populations ( see @xcite for a review ) . \n the arguments that lead to this conclusion are the following : first , axps and sgrs are x - ray pulsators with spin periods in the range 5 - 12s . \n furthermore , their rotational energy loss @xmath3 inferred from their spin - down rate ( @xmath4 , where i , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the neutron star moment of inertia , angular velocity and angular velocity time derivative ) is insufficient to power the observed x - ray luminosity ( note that for the large majority of isolated pulsars , detected both in radio and x - ray band , the x - ray luminosity is typically 0.1% of the @xmath3 ; @xcite ) . \n second , there is no evidence for a companion star ( through the search for doppler orbital modulation of the x - ray spin period , and through observations at other wavelengths ; @xcite ) , which might power their emission through the accretion mechanism , at least with a mass greater than 0.1m@xmath7 . \n an alternative source of energy is therefore required to power the x - ray emission of axps and sgrs .    assuming these sources being isolated x - ray pulsars with a dipole magnetic field configuration and purely magnetic dipole losses , their inferred magnetic fields are extremely high , b@xmath8  g : these magnetic fields have been identified as the possible additional energy reservoir . in fact , \n if axps and sgrs are indeed `` magnetars '' , i. e. isolated highly magnetic neutron stars , many of their bizarre x - ray properties might be explained : the x - ray luminosity is naturally provided by the decay of these ultra - strong magnetic fields , while their peculiar short bursts may result from magnetic induced cracks on the neutron star surface ( @xcite ; 1995 ) . \n moreover , the long lasting flux enhancements observed in some magnetars @xcite may be associated to single fractures on a larger spatial scale , or to the episodic onset of a wind energised by frequent , small scale fractures and/or quasi - steady seismic vibrations @xcite . in this scenario , \n the magnetars magnetic fields are all above the so - called `` quantum critical field '' @xmath9  g , at which the radio pulsations are expected to be suppressed by processes such as photon splitting which may inhibit pair - production cascades @xcite responsible for creating the radio emission of the normal radio pulsars . \n however , the discovery of high magnetic field radio pulsars @xcite and transient radio pulsed emission from one axp @xcite put many uncertainties with this respect making again theoretically plausible a link between axps and radio pulsars .    in the past years , radio observations of axps and sgrs , performed using different antennas and arrays , have given always negative results ( e.g. @xcite ) both to timing and interferometry searches , but revealing in a few cases some reliable associations with snrs @xcite and in one case an interesting stellar wind bubble blown by the massive progenitor @xcite . \n however , in some peculiar circumstances radio counterparts were detected : a ) the sgrs giant flares , rare , catastrophic and highly energetic events , have been discovered powering a radio outburst , which slowly faded with a timescale of weeks @xcite , b ) during the outburst of the only confirmed transient axp , xte j1810 - 197 , the very large array ( vla ) observations ( with angular resolution of 6 \" ) revealed a point source of flux density @xmath10mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite , which has recently been discovered as pulsated at the neutron star spin period @xcite .    with this picture in mind \n we have undertaken a systematic deep search for radio pulsations in three confirmed ( , , ) and one candidate axp ( ) , visible from the southern hemisphere using the parkes radio telescope . \n observations and data analysis are described in  [ sec : obs ] while in  [ sec : results ] we report on the obtained results , discussed in the context of the magnetar scenario in \n [ sec : conclu ] . \n diagram for radio pulsars ( dots ) and magnetars ( stars ) . \n the dashed line represents the limit for radio emission quenching . \n the four sources surrounded by a square emit in radio besides being above this line . \n the three confirmed axps of our sample for which a determination of @xmath11 is available are surrounded by a circle . ] \n in table [ tab1 ] the sample of observed axps is presented . for each object the name , period and period derivative of x - ray pulsations , the derived surface magnetic field , \n the estimated distance d and the association with a snr or with a nebula are listed .    [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     none of the pulsed signals found during this blind search could arise from any of the axps that we observed , because of the discrepancy in position . \n figure [ fig4 ] shows , for four different values of the dm , the upper limits on the flux density at 1.4 ghz reached for the four pointed regions of the sky as a function of the spin period . \n these limits have been estimated using equation [ eq1 ] with @xmath12 and multiplying the limit obtained by a factor @xmath13 taking into account losses due to the search technique ( see @xcite ) . \n note that the @xmath14 threshold adopted here is higher with respect to the one used in the previous step of the analysis : this is because , given the huge amount of radio frequency interferences ( rfi ) with which we have to deal when doing a blind periodicity search ( especially at low s / n ) , we can not safely state as a good candidate a suspect with s / n less than , usually , 8 . \n the rfi problem is not so important when folding the time series at a specific value of the period , hence in that case we can be less conservative using a lower threshold for the candidate selection and , consequently , for the @xmath14 to adopt in the @xmath15 calculation .        in order to verify the reliability of the quoted flux density limits \n , we can compare the catalogued fluxes of the 18 redetected pulsars ( obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue : ) with those estimated putting in equation [ eq1 ] their detection periods , dms and s / ns ( or mean s / n , for pulsars with multiple detections ) and considering the offset of the detection beam with respect to the true position of the pulsars . \n the ratio between the estimated and the catalogued values of the flux densities are shown , as a function of the rotational period , in figure [ fig5 ] . \n note that the s / n used to estimate the flux density , may sensibly vary from one observation to another ( e.g. because of the different response of different beams in which the pulsar is detected , or because of rfi ) , leading to a large uncertainty in the estimate of the flux density . \n averaging the s / ns from different observations would lead to a better match between the estimated and catalogued fluxes .    ) and the catalogued value of the flux density of the 18 redetected pulsars . the errorbars are drawn assuming , besides the errors on the measured values , a 20% error on the estimated fluxes . \n the mean value of the ratio calculated over the 18 sources is @xmath16 ( 2-@xmath17 error ) . ]    finally no new rrat - like signal has been found in the single pulse search over the 52 observed regions , while two previously known pulsars ( j17053950 and j18440433 ) have been detected also through their single pulses . \n no radio pulsation has been found from the four southern axps observed , down to a limit of @xmath18 mjy ( table [ tab2 ] ) .    comparing the upper limits on the luminosity at 1400 mhz ( defined as @xmath19 ) for our targets with the luminosity of the observed radio pulsar population in the galactic field ( figure [ fig6 ] ) \n , we note that the limits reached by our search are a factor of six lower than the median of the population . \n the values obtained for our sample are in fact in the range 2.8  3.8 mjy kpc@xmath20 ( shaded region in fig . \n [ fig6 ] ) while the median of the distribution in luminosity of the observed radio pulsars in our galaxy is 18.0 mjy kpc@xmath20 . \n if the luminosity function of axps reflects that of observed canonical pulsars we can calculate that the probability for all our four targets to have luminosities below our limits is only @xmath21 . \n similar results are obtained comparing the upper limits on @xmath22 for our sample with the luminosity distribution of only young pulsars ( with characteristic ages @xmath23 yr ) or long period pulsars ( with p @xmath24 3 s ) . \n a comparison with the few high magnetic field radio pulsars ( having magnetic field strengths above the quantum critical field line ; figure [ fig1 ] ) is not statistically significant , having only four objects in this class . \n however we note that all their luminosities , as well as the radio luminosity of @xcite , are greater than the limits obtained for the axps . \n note however that , if we compare our results with the _ intrinsic _ luminosity distribution of the radio pulsars ( dashed line in figure [ fig6 ] ; @xcite ) , we obtain a probability of @xmath25% that our observations are not deep enough to detect a radio pulsed signal from our targets .    in considering the causes of the non detection of a radio pulsed signal from our four targets , besides the luminosity bias , we must take into account the possibility that , although the x - ray beam is pointing toward us , the radio beam , usually narrower , is not . assuming a pulse duty cycle of @xmath26 ( hence a beam semi - aperture @xmath27 ) , typical of long period pulsars and similar to that of the radio pulsed signal detected by @xcite in the transient axp ( @xmath28 at 1.4 ghz ) \n , we can calculate , following e.g. @xcite , that the probability that such a narrow radio beam misses the earth is @xmath29 . \n the composite probability that the beams of all four axps are not pointing toward us is hence @xmath30 . \n the non detection of rrat - like bursts from any of these axps , despite our long exposures , seems to weaken the hypothesis that rrat bursts might be related to the short bursts observed from the magnetars leaving us with other plausible conjectures of a relation with other classes of neutron stars such as middle aged radio pulsars displaying giant pulses @xcite or with x - ray dim isolated neutron stars @xcite . \n the only case of a detection of radio pulsations from an axp concerns the only confirmed transient magnetar @xcite . \n radio emission from this source is strongly related with the occurrence of an outburst of its x - ray emission @xcite , as well as an ir enhancement @xcite . \n furthermore , whereas the x - ray flux is decaying exponentially with timescale of a few hundreds days @xcite , radio emission is still on more than 3 years after the x - ray outburst . \n interestingly the sole other possible transient axp is the candidate , one of our targets . \n our radio observations of this source were performed more than six years after its possible x - ray outburst occurred in 1993 , hence unfortunately nothing can be safely concluded from our upper limits , in favor or against the possible radio and x - ray correlation during the outbursts of this source . \n however , assuming that experienced , after the x - ray outburst , a phase of radio emission similar to that of , our null detection implies that the fading of the radio emission has a time scale of the order of few years : in particular , if at the onset of its putative radio emission phase had a similar luminosity as , this would imply a decrease in @xmath22 of a factor of @xmath31 over six years . \n mb , ap , lb , tds and nda received support from the italian ministry of university and research ( miur ) under the national program _ \n prin2005 2005024090_001_. nr is supported by an nwo post - doctoral fellow . \n the parkes radio telescope is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro . \n f. , pivovaroff m.  j. , kaspi v.  m. , manchester r.  n. , 2002 , in slane p. , gaensler b. , eds , asp conf . \n ser . 271 : neutron stars in supernova remnants a sensitive targeted search campaign at parkes to find young radio pulsars at 20 cm . \n pp  37 +          gaensler b.  m. , kouveliotou c. , gelfand j.  d. , taylor g.  b. , eichler d. , wijers r. a. m.  j. , granot j. , ramirez - ruiz e. , lyubarsky y.  e. , hunstead r.  w. , campbell - wilson d. , van  der horst a.  j. , mclaughlin m.  a. , fender r.  p. , garrett m.  a. , newton - mcgee k.  j. , palmer d.  m. , gehrels n. , woods p.  m. , 2005 , nature , 434 , 1104                g. , faulkner a. , stairs i.  h. , camilo f. , manchester r.  n. , lyne a.  g. , kramer m. , damico n. , kaspi v.  m. , possenti a. , mclaughlin m.  a. , lorimer d.  r. , burgay m. , joshi b.  c. , crawford f. , 2004 , mnras , 352 , 1439      m. , bell j.  f. , manchester r.  n. , lyne a.  g. , camilo f. , stairs i.  h. , damico n. , kaspi v.  m. , hobbs g. , morris d.  j. , crawford f. , possenti a. , joshi b.  c. , mclaughlin m.  a. , lorimer d.  r. , faulkner a.  j. , 2003 , mnras , 342 , 1299      lorimer d.  r. , faulkner a.  j. , lyne a.  g. , manchester r.  n. , kramer m. , mclaughlin m.  a. , hobbs g.  b. , possenti a , stairs i.  h. , camilo f. , burgay m. , damico n. , corongiu a. & crawford f. mnras , submitted          m.  a. , lyne a.  g. , lorimer d.  r. , kramer m. , faulkner a.  j. , manchester r.  n. , cordes j.  m. , camilo f. , possenti a. , stairs i.  h. , hobbs g. , damico n. , burgay m. , obrien j.  t. , 2006 , nature , 439 , 817", "StartTimeOffset": 45541892375, "RequestID": "b7d43d0780e347bbab488c8b42523b1d", "TotalTokens": 4052}
{"ContextTokens": 2414, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "magnetic phenomena at surfaces and interfaces have been studied extensively in recent years . \n this interest in surface magnetism has been stimulated by the needs of technology ( magnetic storage media , spintronics ) as well as the development of tools for research in this field , both experimental ( e.g. the spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscope ) @xcite and computational ( increasing speed and memory capacity of computers ) .    reduced number of nearest neighbors at surfaces and lowering of crystal symmetry due to the presence of the surface are known to have a deep impact on magnetic properties . \n the magnetic moments of atoms in the surface layer are often substantially enhanced as compared to corresponding local magnetic moments inside the bulk . \n elements that are known to be nonmagnetic in their bulk form can be magnetic when placed on a surface . \n an interesting example of how the chemical and geometrical properties of a surface may influence the magnetism of an adsorbate has been reported recently . \n experiments indicated that iron monolayers on the ( 001 ) tungsten surface had zero net magnetization ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in contrast , e.g. , to iron monolayers on the w(110 ) surface that are known to be ferromagnetic @xcite . \n the question whether they were really non - magnetic or rather antiferromagnetic was resolved by kubetzka @xcite using the spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscope . here , antiferromagnetic @xmath1 fe - monolayer on the w(001 ) was directly observed . \n the subsequent theoretical study by ferriani @xcite showed that iron and cobalt monolayers tend to be antiferromagnetic on the w(001 ) surface while v , cr and mn monolayers tend to the ferromagnetic order . \n it should be noted that just an opposite trend is observed on the w(110 ) surface , on which v , cr , and mn monolayers are @xmath2 antiferromagnets while fe and co order ferromagnetically . \n the same or similar situation as on the w(110 ) surface occurs also on many other substrates , e.g. on cu , ag and pd ( 001 ) surfaces ( see references in @xcite ) . \n our goal is to generalize the above study to the case of binary two - dimensional alloys on the w(001 ) surface . \n the disorder in the surface layer and the interaction between chemically different surface atoms are expected to lead to new types of magnetic phases . \n we have focused on the femn system in which alloy constituents exhibits antiferromagnetic ( fe ) and ferromagnetic ( mn ) order as pure overlayers . \n the frustration that results from the competing interactions will play a key role in formation of more complex magnetic structures . \n the electronic structure was described in the framework of the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method with the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite . \n the spin - polarized local density approximation ( lda ) with the parametrization of vosko , wilk , and nusair @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential was used . \n the spin - orbit interaction was neglected . \n the surface green function formalism was used to describe the electronic structure of an overlayer on substrate with realistic boundary conditions . \n the substitutional disorder was treated by means of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which neglects local environment effects . \n in addition to the standard asa , a dipole surface barrier was included . \n the geometry of the system is the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice of tungsten with the experimental lattice constant . \n the self - consistent electronic structure calculations were performed on an eight - layer slab : the slab consisted of four tungsten layers , one layer of @xmath0 transition - metal alloy , and three empty layers that mimicked the vacuum above the surface . \n the slab was then matched to a semi - infinite vacuum region on one side and to a semi - infinite tungsten bulk on the other side . \n the layers of the surface slab form an ideal continuation of the bulk structure and possible layer relaxations are neglected . \n we have tested the stability of various magnetic phases of two - dimensional random overlayers on the w(001 ) substrate . \n in addition to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase , we have also considered the dlm phase ( disordered local moments ) , the so - called apm phase ( antiparallel arrangement of moments ) , and the uncompensated dlm ( udlm ) phase . \n the dlm phase is defined by randomly oriented local magnetic moments . \n the distribution of directions is uniform in the whole space . \n such a structure can be efficiently studied using the spin - polarized cpa : the infinite number of possible orientations of local moments can be replaced by two equally large groups of atoms with opposite orientations of local moments . \n the dlm phase of a binary alloy x@xmath3y@xmath4 can be formally described as a four - component alloy x@xmath5x@xmath6y@xmath7y@xmath8 , where the superscripts denote the orientations of respective local moments . \n the dlm structure has a zero total magnetization similarly as any antiferromagnetic structure . \n in contrast to an ordered antiferromagnetic structure , however , the local moments in the dlm phase are distributed on the lattice randomly . \n energetic preference of the dlm arrangement to the ferromagnetic one is an indication that the antiferromagnetic arrangement would be favored over ferromagnetism . \n the apm arrangement in a binary alloy is defined as a magnetic phase in which all local moments of one component are aligned in one direction and all local moments of the other component are aligned in the opposite direction . \n the apm phase can be described as x@xmath9y@xmath10 . \n this arrangement resembles a ferrimagnetic one in a similar way as the dlm resembles antiferromagnetism . \n it should be noted that both the antiferromagnet or ferrimagnet assume the existence of two different sublattices while the dlm or apm arrangement exist on one lattice .    a mixed magnetic state , which we denote as dlm(x)+fm(y ) , \n can be represented by a ternary compound x@xmath5x@xmath6y@xmath11 . \n the most general phase is the uncompensated dlm state ( udlm ) . \n it can be approximated as a four - component alloy x@xmath12x@xmath13y@xmath12y@xmath13 where all occupation probabilities ( concentrations ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are arbitrary with the obvious constraints @xmath18 and @xmath19 . \n all previously discussed phases can be viewed as special cases of the udlm . \n the local magnetic moments of fm , dlm and apm phases of the femn / w(001 ) alloy are shown in fig . \n 1 and contrasted with behavior of the fev / w(001 ) system . magnetic moments of mn and also of fe are rigid , only weakly influenced by their environment . \n total energies for the femn / w(001 ) alloys in different magnetic phases are presented in fig .  2 . \n to analyze it , let us consider pairwise magnetic interactions only and suppose that the magnetic interaction between two atoms is determined by the atoms themselves independently of their environment . \n we can then approximate the dependence of energy on magnetic configuration by a simple quadratic form @xmath20 specifically , we get : @xmath21 the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 have been chosen to fit the calculated total energies of the ferromagnetic fe / w(001 ) surface , the ferromagnetic mn / w(001 ) surface , and the fe@xmath25mn@xmath25/w(001 ) surface in the apm phase .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we have also investigated the udlm states to find the state with the lowest total energy . \n good sampling of possible udlm configurations requires a large number of calculations . \n we have therefore performed calculations for only three different compositions of femn ( see table  [ tabu ] ) . it should be noted that for all concentrations mn moments prefer ferromagnetic alignment ( @xmath26  =  0 ) .    for some surface alloy compositions , \n there are udlm states that have lower total energy than the special magnetic arrangements discussed so far . \n we have verified that the formula ( [ eq1 ] ) describes fully self - consistent calculations for femn alloys with a good accuracy even in the udlm phase under the assumption that parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are determined from calculated total energies of the dlm , fm , apm , and dlm+fm phases . \n the existence of udlm phases is a consequence of the interplay between the three basic trends discussed above .    for pure fe and mn monolayer \n is the first interlayer distance reduced by 13.7% and 4.7% , respectively @xcite . to judge the impact of interlayer relaxation on our results , we have reduced distances between femn alloy addlayer and the first tungsten layer by 10% . \n this relaxation has no remarkable influence on magnetic behavior of femn alloy film . \n nevertheless , the surface relaxation suppress magnetic moments of iron and manganese atoms slightly because of @xmath27-band broadening due to stronger bonding with substrate . \n we have investigated magnetic ground states of two - dimensional binary femn transition - metal alloys on w(001 ) . for pure monolayers \n we have found that fe overlayer order antiferromagnetically while mn atoms prefer the ferromagnetic alignment . in alloy monolayers , fe and \n mn tend to orient their local magnetic moments antiparallel to each other . \n incompatible tendencies of magnetic moment alignments among fe and mn atoms lead to an uncompensated dlm phase , which becomes the calculated ground state for some alloy compositions . \n this indicates tendency to a non - collinear ground state . to reach a more detailed understanding of the alloyed monolayers on w(001 ) , further sp - stm measurements as well as theoretical calculations \n are needed . + * acknowledgments *", "StartTimeOffset": 72621747511, "RequestID": "0cf2396bc07b4a41a58ae1a56068209c", "TotalTokens": 2560}

detected events , we used the @xmath28 correlations ( see figure  [ mom ] ) , the total parallel momentum versus the total charge on an event by event basis . for the analysis , only the events with a total parallel momentum greater than @xmath29 of the beam momentum were kept , @xmath30 mev / c . \n the events were sorted as a function of two observables correlated with the impact parameter @xcite : @xmath32 , the total transverse energy , and @xmath31 , the total charged particle multiplicity . \n three regions are defined according to cuts made perpendicular to the ridge line of this correlation , which we refer to as t1 , t2 and t3 ( see figure  [ molty ] ) . \n the cuts were made in order to retain approximately the same number of events in each region . \n events in the t1 region correspond to less dissipative ( peripheral ) collisions , while those in t3 correspond to more dissipative ( central ) collisions . \n table  [ expsorg ] shows the corresponding average values of the total transverse energy , the total multiplicity , the residue ( the biggest fragment ) velocity and charge in the three regions .       in perspective one should understand why the alpha particle multiplicity is underestimated by gemini \n this could be connected to the dependence of the level density parameter @xmath33 from the excitation energy ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in the present work , \n the lestone parameterization was used , but there are different formulae describing this dependence of @xmath33 that could be used alternatively in the backtracing .    in order to better enhance the differences between the two models , an attempt could also be done using the backtracing of dynamical observables , more sensitive to the coulomb effects @xcite . \n one should however recall that some of the dynamical observables ( like velocities for example ) are mass dependent . \n this addresses the problem of the choice of the mass parameterization previously evoked . on this subject \n , we may hope to gain some useful insight by upgrading in the mass identification of existing @xmath34 devices like chimeraps or by new generation projects like fazia ( four 4@xmath35 a z ion array )  @xcite . \n h.fuchs and k.m@xmath36hring , rep . \n 57 ( 1994 ) 231 . \n s.shlomo and j.b.natowitz , phys . \n c 44 ( 1991 ) 2878 . \n european physical journal a30 ( 2006 ) , special issue : dynamics and thermodynamics with nuclear degrees of freedom . \n j. pochodzalla et al . , \n lett . 75 ( 1995 ) 1040 . \n m.dagostino et al . , phys . \n b 473 ( 2000 ) 219 . j.richert and p.wagner , phys . \n ( 2001 ) 1 . \n h.a.bethe , phys . \n 50 ( 1936 ) 332 . \n a.bohr and b.mottelson , nuclear structure , vol.1 , benjamin ed . \n , new york , ( 1969 ) . \n g. bizard et al.,phys . \n lett b 302 ( 1993 ) 162 . \n g.f bertsch , p.j . \n siemens , phys . \n 126 b ( 1983 ) 9 ; + j.e . \n finn et al . , phys . \n lett 49 ( 1982 ) 1321 . \n j.b.natowitz et al . , phys . \n c 65 ( 2002 ) 34618 . \n l.manduci , phd thesis(2004 ) , universit de caen ( france ) , + _ http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00011469/fr/ _ \n p. dsesquelles et al . , nucl . \n phys . a604 ( 1996 ) 183 . \n p. dsesquelles et al . , nucl . phys . \n a633 ( 1998 ) 547 . \n o. lopez , lpc caen ; procedings of the xlvith international winter meeting on nuclear physics ( 2008 ) , bormio ( italy ) . \n r.j.charity et al . , nucl . \n a476 ( 1988 ) 516 and references therein . \n j.p.bondorf et al . , phys . \n 257 ( 1995 ) 133 . \n a. bonasera , f. gulminelli and j. molitoris , phys . \n ( 1994 ) 1 . \n a.guarnera,m.colonna,ph.chomaz , phys.lett . \n b 373 ( 1996 ) 267 . \n courtesy dr . \n e. galichet . \n j.pouthas et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a357 ( 1995 ) 418 . \n j.pouthas et al . nucl . \n instr . and \n meth . a369 ( 1996 ) 222 . \n m. prlog et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a482 ( 2002 ) 674 . m. prlog et al . \n instr . and meth . \n a482 ( 2002 ) 693 . s. aiello et al . \n a 583 ( 1995 ) 461 . \n a. pagano et al . \n phys . a 681 ( 2001 ) 331 . \n a. pagano et al . \n phys . a 734 ( 2004 ) 504 . \n l. tassan -

( 2 ) the equation is linear . ( 3 ) the equation leads to relativistic dispersion relation for plane waves ( in other words , being consistent with de broglie relations ) . \n the history of the square root klein - gordon equation ( srkg equation ) goes back to the early years of relativistic quantum mechanics . in the 1927 weyl \n proposed the operator @xmath7 for the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . \n but he did not expand his idea as a comprehensive theory and also other pioneers of quantum mechanics used different methods for the formulation relativistic quantum mechanics which led to other wave equations such as dirac and klein - gordon equations . on the other hand , although the srkg equation lacks proper theoretical characteristics and even gets rid of some difficulties that other relativistic wave equations have ( such as klein paradox and `` zitterbewegung '' ) , but higher order derivatives in this equation makes it look more complicated than the other quantum wave equations ; therefore it attracted less attention during the historical development of relativistic quantum mechanics . \n but after derivation of this equation from bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite , it was more attention . in this regard , in the recent years , theoretical characteristics and integral representations of this equation have been attracting special attention @xcite . \n also , this equation has been successfully used in description of several relativistic problems and phenomena ; such as relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite , waves in relativistic quantum plasma @xcite , relativistic ( quark ) bound states @xcite , and the relativistic bohmian mechanics @xcite . \n we particularly note the consistency of the results of this equation with the experimental spectrum of mesonic atoms @xcite . \n in addition , since this equation is of first order with respect to time , there is the possibility of using the born interpretation , @xmath0 , for the interpretation of the wave function and as a result it avoid of negative probability problem of the klein - gordon equation . in this regard , k. kowalski and j. rembielinski derived , the position born s probability density and its corresponding current density in the momentum representation as follow @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9    in which the `` velocity '' , @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 . this very possibility of a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function has been often the stimulus to using this equation . on the other hand , \n the lorentz invariance of the srkg equation has always been under discussion because of its high derivatives , in fact checking lorentz invariance of this equation is complicated and can not be specified easily . \n therefor sometimes because of the inequality of time and space derivatives , this equation has been mistakenly accepted as a frame dependent equation and incompatible with special relativity @xcite . \n but it has been shown that if the wave function is scalar this equation is lorentz invariant ( in the absence of interactions ) @xcite . \n but we need to pay attention that born rule , @xmath12 , is inconsistent with assuming the wave function as scalar . \n because the position probability density is the first component of the probability current four - vector and can not be scalar . on the other word , because of the relativistic length contraction , the probability density can not be scalar . \n hence , born rule ( eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) can not be a proper interpretation for the scalar wave function . \n in fact in the rest of this article we will show even if the wave function is not scalar , born rule will still not be proper for the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function . \n it means that no transformation will be found for the wave function in a way to cause born probability density and born current densities(eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) become altogether as one four - vector . \n so , the born rule must be modified to conform with lorentz symmetry . \n in this regard , we find a proper relativistic modification of the born rule for scalar wave function ( spin 0 particles ) in the section ( i ) and for spin 1/2 particles in the section ( ii ) . \n we propose the relativistic generalization of the born rule as follows : @xmath13 in which @xmath14 , is defined as : @xmath15 the expression ( [ 5 ] ) is the simplest covariant generalization of the eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) . \n in fact by means of direct ( and also long ) calculation , we can see that @xmath16 is actually a four - vector and as a result,@xmath17 is a four - vector as well - of course if the wave function be scalar(see section ii ) . \n it can also be simply shown that @xmath17 ( as was defined above ) satisfies the continuity equation . \n it is obvious that the first component of the @xmath17specify the relativistic generalization of the born rule in the momentum representation : @xmath18 the question that arises at this point is whether the definition ( [ 7 ] ) lead to a positive definite probability density . for answering this question , we note that the coefficient @xmath19 in the expression ( [ 7 ] ) can be separated as follow : @xmath20 where @xmath21.through the aid of this separation , the position probability density can be derived in position space representation as follow : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is compton wavelength ; @xmath24 . \n so eq.([7 ] ) leads to a positive - definite probability density . \n it is clear that in non- relativistic limit , @xmath25 , the equation ( 9 ) reduce to born rule , @xmath26 . \n in addition , if @xmath27 then @xmath28 and the expression ( [ 7 ] ) gives the non - relativistic expression ( [ 3 ] ) . \n it means that whenever the width of wave packet in momentum space is small in comparison with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 will be negligible . as a result , based on uncertainty relations , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 \n is considerable only if the width of wave packet is smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath33 . to see this fact explicitly , \n we plot the relativistic ( eq.([9 ] ) ) and nonrelativistic ( born rule ) probability density for a particle in one dimensional infinite square well potential . from fig . \n ( 1 ) it is obvious that if the width of the box , @xmath34 , is greater than the compton wavelength of the particle , @xmath23 , the diagram of the relativistic probability density , @xmath31 , will be coincident with the diagram of the born probability density , @xmath35 ; and whenever the width of the box is smaller than the compton wavelength then @xmath31 will deviates from @xmath35 . \n in fact if@xmath36 then the probability of the particle s presence in the box will be uniform(see figure.1 ) .     ; red diagrams represent the relativistic probability density,@xmath31 , for the first excited state n=2 of particle in infinite potential well . \n the diagram is drawn considering different width of the box : ( a)@xmath37 , ( b)@xmath38 and ( c)@xmath39 . ] \n particle and spin @xmath72 particle in one dimensional box . \n the ( dashed ) green line represents born probability density , the blue line represent @xmath69 and the red line represent the @xmath82 . \n the wave function of particle is considered as @xmath83 which @xmath84 is the width of the box and we consider @xmath85 . ] \n in this article we have introduced relativistic generalization for the born rule for particles with zero and half spins . \n therefore it seems that the srkg equation with the appropriate interpretation of the wave function can be adapted to use for particles having various spins . \n 99 h. weyl : zeit . \n f. physik 46 ( 1927 ) pp . \n 38 - 44 e. e. salpeter and h. a. bethe , phys . \n 84 , 1232 w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , int . j. mod . phys . a 7 ( 1992 ) 6431 . \n w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , int . j. mod \n . phys . a 14 ( 1999 ) 2309 j.j . \n kohn , l. nirenberg , communications in pure and applied mathematics , 18,293295.(1965a ) . \n no.5 , 199.8 kh . \n namsrai , international journal of theoretical physics , vol.37,no.5 , 199 . \n k. kowalski and j. rembielinski , phys . rev a 84 , 012108 ( 2011 ) t. l. gill , w. w. zachary and m. alfred , j. phys . \n 31 t. l. gill and w. w. zachary , j. phys . \n 38 , 2479- 2496 , ( 2005 ) . \n f. brau , j. math . \n 39 , 2254 ( 1998 ) . \n zhi - feng li , jin - jin liu , w. lucha , wen - gan ma and f. f. schberl , j. math . \n 46 , 103514 r. l. hall , w. lucha and f. f. schoberl , j. phys . a 34 ( 2001 ) , 50595064 . \n k. kowalski , j.rembielinski,phys.rev.a 81:012118,2010 f. haas , journal of plasma physics / volume 79 / spe- cial issue 04 / august 2013 , pp 371 - 376 j. l. friar and e. l. tomusiak , phys . \n c 29 , 1537 published 1 april 1984 w. lucha , franz f schberl , physics letters b , volume 387 , issue 3 , 24 october 1996 i. w. herbst , math.phys . \n 53 ( 1977 ) , 285294 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3856, "GeneratedTokens": 237, "SynthesizedBody": "in this paper , we consider a single - source multicast discrete memoryless relay network in which the source wants to send the same message reliably to multiple destinations with the help of one or more relays . a model of relay networks \n was introduced by van der meulen in  @xcite . \n however , the single - letter capacity characterization has been open even for three - node relay networks , i.e. , relay networks having a source , a relay , and a destination . in their seminal paper \n @xcite , cover and el gamal developed two fundamental coding strategies for three - node relay networks . \n one of them is decode - and - forward ( df ) , where the relay decodes the message and forwards it to the destination , which was shown to be optimal for physically degraded channels @xcite . \n df was generalized for multiple relays in  @xcite . in another strategy , \n compress - and - forward ( cf ) , the relay compresses its received block and sends the compressed information to the destination . \n cf was shown to achieve the capacity for some classes of relay networks  @xcite . \n recently , cf was generalized to noisy network coding in @xcite for multiple relays , which includes many previous results on relay networks @xcite as special cases . \n a potentially better strategy is to decode as much as possible and compress the residual information , i.e. , a combination of df and cf  @xcite . \n indeed such a strategy was shown to be optimal by kang and ulukus for a certain class of diamond networks in  @xcite , which consists of a source , a noisy relay , a noiseless relay that receives exactly what the source sends , and a destination that has orthogonal finite - capacity links from relays . \n for this class of diamond networks , it was shown that a combination of df and cf at the noisy relay is optimal and the cut - set bound is in general loose  @xcite .    in this paper , we show the optimality of a combination of df and cf for a new class of single - source multicast relay networks with an arbitrary number of nodes , which includes the class of diamond networks in @xcite as a special case . in this class , which we call multicast tree networks , \n a network has a tree topology in which the root node is the source and each parent node in the graph has at most one noisy child node and any number of noiseless child nodes . \n we note that the achievability and converse for diamond networks in @xcite can not be directly generalized to those for our multicast tree networks . \n first , the codebook constructions and relay operations of the coding scheme in @xcite for diamond networks , which has a single destination , vary according to the link capacities from relays to the destination . \n this can not be used for multicast tree networks since they have arbitrarily many destinations . \n next , it would not be easy to generalize the converse proof technique in @xcite for diamond networks , which have only four nodes in three levels , for our multicast tree networks , which have arbitrarily many nodes in arbitrarily high levels . \n therefore , for these two reasons , we need new techniques . \n the key technical contributions in the achievability and converse in this paper are as follows :    * achievability : for the generalization to multicast tree networks , we construct a _ robust _ coding scheme where codebook constructions and relay operations are independent for each node and do not depend on the network topology . \n such a robustness of the coding scheme makes the generalization from a single destination to multiple destinations possible . * \n converse : to get a very simple min - cut expression , we use a novel technique of iteratively manipulating inequalities , i.e. , we recursively reduce a number of inequalities into one using the tree topology . \n the organization of this paper is as follows . \n the model of a class of multicast tree networks is presented in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : main ] , we present lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the class of multicast tree networks and show a condition for these two bounds to coincide . in section [ sec : achievability ] , we derive the lower bound by presenting a coding scheme where each noisy relay employs a combination of df and cf and each noiseless relay performs a random binning . in section [ sec : ub ] , the upper bound is shown using a recursion exploiting the tree topology . in section [ sec : diamond ] , we present an equivalent capacity expression for diamond networks that shows that without loss of optimality we can construct the coding scheme such that what is compressed after decoding at a noisy relay is a noisy observation of almost uncoded information . the conclusion of this paper is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n the following notations will be used in the paper . for \n two integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] denotes the set @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes a row vector @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes @xmath7 . \n @xmath8 for a set @xmath9 denotes a row vector @xmath10 . according to the context \n , @xmath11 sometimes denotes the single -

{"ContextTokens": 3818, "GeneratedTokens": 151, "SynthesizedBody": "problems of packing and space tiling have fascinated scientists for a very long time . \n kepler s 1611 essay _ on the six - cornered snowflakes _ is probably one of the earliest publications on the subject . \n here he conjectured that cubic close packing and hexagonal close packing are the most efficient ways to fill a space using equally sized spheres . \n it was nt until 1998 that kepler s conjecture was finally announce to be proven ( with 99% degree of confidence ) by thomas hales  @xcite . \n recent advances in particle synthesis  @xcite have opened the way to the production of colloidal particles that are anisotropic both in shape and surface chemistry . \n this provides an unlimited number of building blocks that can spontaneously organize into an unprecedented variety of structures with potentially novel functional , mechanical , and optical properties . for these reasons , \n the problem of efficient packing of nanoparticles is under intense investigation . \n most of the work on particle crystallization and self - assembly in the last decade has focused on monodisperse  @xcite or polydisperse  @xcite systems of spherical or regularly shaped particles ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) . \n nevertheless , there are several important cases in which the shape of the single components can not be tailored at will ; however , an efficient packing , or an understanding of the physical properties of these densely compressed systems , is highly desirable . \n two examples of outstanding problems in this category are the storage of grains  @xcite and protein crystallization  @xcite . \n both examples can be ideally thought of as two different aspects of the problem of understanding the role of shape in particle packing . in the first case the goal is to efficiently pack a system of randomly - shaped polydisperse grains . in the second case \n the aim is to crystallize non - spherical , yet equally shaped monodisperse components . \n the latter case is the focus of the present paper . \n we want to understand how the ability of particles to form macroscopically ordered crystal structures is affected by their shape . \n specifically , we analyze how random perturbations from the ideal spherical shape affect the crystallizability of a densely packed system of indistinguishable hard particles . \n although a few papers have dealt with the thermodynamic behavior of soft / deformable particles as a model for polymer brushes or polymer - coated colloids ( @xcite and references therein ) , to the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first study where shape distortions , frozen onto the particles , are explicitly and systematically accounted for . \n the problem of crystal formation is poorly understood . from a thermodynamic standpoint , \n classical nucleation theory informs us that a crystal can only be formed via a barrier crossing event . \n the free energy gain to form a nucleus of a stable crystalline structure in a supersaturated solution has to balance out the free energy cost associated with the formation of an interface between the solid and the fluid parent phase . \n the gibbs free energy cost , @xmath0 , associated with this event has a strong dependence on the interfacial free energy , @xmath1 : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and the chemical potential difference between solid and fluid phase , respectively . as @xmath1 is very hard to extract from experiments , \n computer simulations are the tool of choice to study and analyze this important process in detail \n .    one way to investigate our problem could be to measure the dependence of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) on the magnitude of the shape perturbations at constant @xmath4 . \n this approach would be appropriate when considering a system that is polydisperse in shape and size ; however , in our case , we have to study a statistically relevant number of systems each containing @xmath5 identical particles with the same shape perturbation . \n such an approach is therefore impractical because ( a ) it would require the computation of a phase diagram for every system with a given particle realization ( about 500 in this study ) and ( b ) for sufficiently large shape deformations the fcc structure that nucleates out of a solution of hard spheres may not necessarily be the most stable one , and this would lead to a meaningless comparison of unrelated @xmath1s .    given these limitations , our strategy will be to generate a large number of particle shapes , sort them in terms of the extent of their asphericity , and simply analyze whether they organize into an ordered and periodic structure ( whatever that might be ) once compressed at large densities . \n we are left with the problem of devising a new model that allows for an effective control of the particle s degree of asphericity . \n unfortunately there is not a unique way of introducing perturbations on the particle shape , so we have opted for a model that , without loss of generality , weds simplicity and numerical efficiency . \n in our model , each particle is built by setting the center of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) spheres of diameter @xmath8 at random positions inside a spherical shell of diameter @xmath9 . \n the overall volume generated from the resulting overlapping aggregate defines our new particle . \n deviations from the ideal spherical shape can be conveniently controlled by varying @xmath10 and @xmath6 . \n values of @xmath10 and @xmath6 were chosen to achieve wide coverage of the range of possible particle geometries . for @xmath11 \n one recovers the spherical limit , and as @xmath10 increases , particles develop larger and larger shape distortions . in a similar fashion , \n large values of @xmath6 result in a bumpy but overall isotropic particle , whereas small values of @xmath6 tend to generate very anisotropic shapes . \n once a particle is built , the center of mass of this cluster of balls is determined , and the entire cluster is scaled so that its total volume equals that of a spherical particle of diameter @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath12 . any two particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 interact via a hard repulsive potential defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 run over all spheres of rescaled diameter @xmath18 constituting particle @xmath13 and particle @xmath14 respectively . \n experimental realizations of colloidal particles similar to ours could be generated using the approach described in reference  @xcite to create uniform nonspherical particles with tunable shapes . \n figure 1 shows a few snapshots of particle shapes obtained for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath10 . \n and @xmath6 built according to the scheme described in the text.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    to analyze the high density behavior of these systems we used monte carlo simulations in the @xmath19 ensemble . \n given the large number of simulations involved in this study , we limited the size of our systems to a total of @xmath20 particles . \n we use a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions . using as a reference the hard - spheres model , i.e. coexistence reduced pressure and volume fraction respectively at @xmath21 and @xmath22 \n , we performed , for each system with a given particle realization , a series of simulations at increasing values of pressure beginning at @xmath23 with a typical increment of @xmath24=0.5 or smaller . \n we ran each simulation for a minimum of @xmath25 monte carlo sweeps after thermalization . \n the largest pressure was set by either the crystallization of the system , or by the reaching of a volume fraction @xmath26 , above the glass transition point of hard spheres @xmath27 . \n crystallization was detected in our samples with a combination of methods : ( a ) standard spherical - harmonics based bond order parameter @xmath28  @xcite , ( b ) a careful monitoring of the system volume fraction over time for sudden jumps , and ( c ) visual inspection . \n we investigated a total of 487 different particle shapes . \n we find that at least two order parameters are required to properly characterize the shape of each particle . \n the first is its asphericity @xmath29 ( as opposed to the commonly used sphericity , @xmath30  @xcite ) , defined in terms of the surface to volume ratio of a particle @xmath31 with respect to that of a sphere of diameter @xmath8 , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 given our model setup , @xmath34 , @xmath29 simplifies to @xmath35    the second parameter , @xmath36 , measures the orientational symmetry of the particle . \n it is used to describe the asphericity of random walks  @xcite , and it is obtained by combining invariants of the particle inertia tensor @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the three principal eigenvalues of the inertia tensor of the particle , i.e. , the three principle radii of gyration of the particle . both parameters \n are defined so that they are equal to @xmath42 for a perfectly spherical particle , and approach @xmath43 for extremely aspherical ones . \n note that @xmath29 depends intimately on the value of @xmath10 used to construct the particle , whereas @xmath36 depends only on the angular distribution of spheres about the center of mass  that is , it is completely independent of @xmath10 . \n figure  [ plot ] summarizes the main result of our paper .     and @xmath36 . \n filled circles indicate particles that easily crystallized , while open squares indicate particles that did not . \n data include results for 487 total particle geometries , including 85 using @xmath44 , 200 using @xmath45 , 92 using @xmath46 , and 110 using @xmath47 . \n the solid line is a guide to the eye.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is obtained by collecting the crystallizability of the 487 systems built out of the 487 different particle geometries we have generated across the @xmath29 , @xmath36 spectrum . each point in the @xmath29 \n vs @xmath36 diagram represents the result of a set of simulations at different pressures . \n as would be expected , crystallization is favored when both @xmath29 and @xmath36 are small @xmath48 that is , when the particles are nearly spherical by both measures . \n a roughly inverse relationship is clearly evident ; particles with large @xmath29 must have very small @xmath36 in order to have a hope of crystallization , and vice - versa . but more importantly \n , we find the existence of a clear boundary delineating the crystallizability limit for every possible shape generated with our model ( small deviations at the interface are likely due to finite size effects and or the limited length of our simulations ) . \n this is quite remarkable because it provides a very useful way of predicting whether a particular particle shape can pack into a crystalline structure by simply measuring the experimentally accessible @xmath29 and @xmath36 . \n we find that a good empirical expression to describe the phase boundary is @xmath49 . \n this curve is only meant to serve as a guide to the eye and to give an approximate numerical estimate of the location of the phase boundary for @xmath50 . \n notice that for smaller values of @xmath36 our data seem to indicate a sharp end of the crystal boundary . \n we believe this to be an artifact of our particle model . \n in fact , that region is where the value of @xmath10 becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath51 ) to break the compactness of the particles generated with our method , especially those with smaller values of @xmath6 . \n furthermore , as small values of @xmath36 indicate a large orientational symmetry , we expect this region to be heavily populated by specific geometric arrangements , whose packing properties , at large values of @xmath29 , will be extremely sensitive of the particular value of @xmath6 . \n as our model is intended to describe randomly shaped particles , our diagram does not include the results for particles designed with very specific shapes such as rods , plates or regular polyhedric geometries that are known to crystallize . \n these particular cases would generate sharp peaks around specific values of @xmath36 . \n furthermore , is not clear that our two order parameters , that have after all been selected to describe asphericity , would be the most appropriate to study deviations from an arbitrary non spherical designed shape . \n we therefore limited our study to @xmath52 , to explicitly avoid trivial cases as rod - like ( @xmath53 ) and plate - like particles ( @xmath54 ) . \n two obvious questions present themselves in the face of these data . \n the first is : what is the nature of the crystals formed when particles do easily crystallize ; does the system present translational but not orientational order , as expected for @xmath55 , or does the rotational motion of the particles becomes restricted for large values of @xmath29 ? \n the second is : what sets the boundary between the two phases ; do the particles that fail to easily crystallize do so because they become kinetically trapped or because of the lack of a stable crystal phase ?    to address the first question \n , we measured the rotational diffusion , @xmath56 , for 20 systems that easily crystallize , all at a reduced pressure @xmath57 and near the phase boundary . as a reference we also plotted @xmath56 for nearly spherical particles , obtained by setting @xmath58 , where we know particles are free to rotate at their lattice sites . \n as can be seen in fig . \n [ rot ] , we find no evidence that particles in the crystalline phase become orientationally arrested or manifest an orientationally anomalous behavior . \n the only effect is that of decreasing their diffusion constant , but this is expected from simple geometrical considerations . \n it is obvious that at very large densities , regardless of the specific phase a system selects , particles orientations will manifest a glassy behavior or eventually freeze . \n @xcite it is therefore of interest to also look at the dynamical properties of those particles in systems do not easily crystallize and are located just across the phase boundary from the ones that do easily crystallize . \n these results , obtained at the same reduced pressure @xmath59 , are also shown in fig . \n we find no signature of anomalous dynamics , neither in the rotational ( fig . \n [ rot ] ) , nor in the translational ( fig . \n [ trans ] ) degrees of freedom , i.e. such systems behave as regular fluids . \n this result is by no means conclusive , as a thorough investigation of this last point would require larger system sizes and an event - driven dynamics of the components . \n our results seem to suggest that what sets the location of the phase boundary is not a sudden slowdown of the dynamics of the system , but more likely an increase of the gibbs free energy difference between the crystalline and the fluid phase , analogously to that found for polydisperse spherical particles  @xcite \n . it would be interesting to investigate the equilibrium properties and the stability of candidate crystalline structures for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath36 to investigate whether our boundary line coincides with the onset of crystal instability , but for the reasons given above , we have not attempted to do so . \n apart from the details concerning the dynamics of these systems , our results show that , for aspherical particles , shape and crystallizability can be directly and easily correlated when particles are characterized in terms of their asphericity via @xmath36 and @xmath29 . \n it is possible that for some highly asymmetric particle geometries a non - cubic box would accommodate crystallization whereas a cubic one would not ; however , we believe this is a secondary effect and its relevance is likely within the range of errors due to finite size effects . \n our data suggest precise limits for the manufacture of nanocomponents expected to crystallize , and may have important implications for the problem of protein crystallization . \n the latter system is clearly far more complex than the one we explored , since not only shape , but also interparticle direct interactions ( which are not necessarily isotropic ) , are responsable for the organization of proteins into large macroscopic crystals . \n nevertheless , it would be interesting to systematically explore to what extent a similar correlation exists in this case . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation under career grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 149463730236, "RequestID": "f99cfad85a7b4116b05535c9d72c08aa", "TotalTokens": 3969}
{"ContextTokens": 3959, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "it is presently accepted that most stars form in clusters , although the details of the cluster - formation process , especially the origin of their structural properties , remain a matter of active research ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? \n * lada & lada 2003 ) ) . \n in particular , a number of structural properties of the clusters have been uncovered that still require an adequate theoretical understanding , such as : i ) the existence of a mass segregation in the clusters , with the most massive stars lying closer to the cluster s center ( ) ; ii ) the distribution of protostellar separations , which appears to have no characteristic scale ( ) ; iii ) the likely existence of an age gradient in clusters , with the youngest stars being located in the highest - density regions ( ) . \n numerical simulations have begun to offer some insight about these properties . have concluded , from a suite of simulations of self - gravitating , decaying isothermal turbulence , that the most massive stars form in situ at the cluster centers , rather than `` sinking '' there through dynamical interactions in the cluster itself . \n however , they gave no physical explanation as to why the most massive stars should form there . \n more recently , ( * ? ? ? \n * kuhn et al.(2015b ) ) have suggested , by comparing multi - wavelength observations of stellar clusters with numerical simulations , that clusters form by mergers of `` subcluster '' structures , although again no explanation of why such mergers should occur is provided . \n the presence of subunits of somewhat different ages in the clusters has also been pointed out by . \n a physical mechanism capable of providing a unifying scenario to these properties is the one advanced by . \n these authors proposed that , if molecular clouds ( mcs ) are assembled by large - scale colliding streams of warm , atomic gas , they rapidly condense into the cold atomic phase , becoming jeans - unstable and beginning to collapse globally . \n moreover , the collision of the streams causes moderately supersonic turbulence ( ) in the cold gas , which produces a spectrum of density fluctuations , where large - amplitude , small - scale ( lass ) fluctuations are superposed on smaller - amplitude , larger - scale ( sals ) ones ( e.g. , ) . \n since these density fluctuations are nonlinear , the lass fluctuations have shorter free - fall times than the sals ones , therefore completing their collapse earlier . \n this process is therefore similar to fragmentation , except that the density fluctuations are of turbulent origin and are therefore nonlinear . in what follows \n , we will refer to this scenario as `` hierarchical gravitational collapse '' ( hgc ) . \n this scenario also predicts that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in molecular clouds ( mcs ) evolves over time , as a consequence of the evolution of the clouds themselves as they go through global gravitational collapse (; ; ) .    in this contribution \n , we describe results of a model on the evolution of the sfr and of cluster assembly in a numerical simulation of mc formation and evolution , emphasizing the role of hgc in the resulting structure of the cluster . \n several models for the sfr and the core mass function ( cmf ) have been put forward in the last decade ( e.g. , ; ; ) , all based on the notion that mcs are globally supported by supersonic turbulence , and with the sfr given by the collapse of local density fluctuations induced by the turbulence . \n operationally , the computation of the sfr in these models is performed by using the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density field  which is known to have a lognormal form for a non - self - gravitating , isothermal turbulent gas ( ) to compute the mass fraction at densities above a suitably defined density threshold , and dividing it by a timescale characteristic of its density range . \n details of the similarities and differences between these models have been given by . \n models of this kind are intrinsically _ stationary _ , as they assume that the mcs are in approximate virial equilibrium between turbulence and gravity . in these models , \n the main controlling parameters are those characterizing the turbulence  the mach number @xmath0 , the _ virial parameter _ \n @xmath1 ( ) , and perhaps the ratio of compressible to solenoidal energy ( ) . \n however , the basic premise of equilibrium in the stationary models is inconsistent with the scenario of hgc , since in the latter , the cloud is assumed to be in global gravitational collapse . \n a model combining the calculation of small - scale collapse as in the above models with the large - scale collapse of the whole cloud has been presented by and . in what follows \n we will refer to this as `` _ the evolutionary model _ '' . in it , \n in addition to the calculation of the instantaneous sfr as in the models mentioned above , the evolution and collapse of the cloud ( with the associated systematic increase of its mean density ) are also followed in time . \n the cloud is assumed to be formed by the collision of warm atomic streams , and to grow in mass by the continued accretion of this material , which undergoes a phase transition to the cold phase as it enters the cloud . \n the cloud also develops turbulence through a combination of the nonlinear thin - shell instability ( ) and the kelvin - helmholz , rayleigh - taylor , and thermal instabilities ( see , e.g. , ) . because the cloud is collapsing , the instantaneous mass fraction at high densities increases in time , and therefore so does the instantaneous sfr . \n knowing the sfr at all times , the total mass in stars can be computed and , assuming a standard imf , the instantaneous number of massive stars is also computed . \n these feed back on the cloud through ionizing uv radiation , and the rate of ionization can be computed using standard prescriptions ( ) , eventually destroying the cloud . \n contrary to the stationary equilibrium models , in the evolutionary model the turbulence parameters are not free , but rather they are assumed to have the ( fixed ) values typical of the cold atomic medium . \n thus , the turbulence is assumed to be _ moderately _ supersonic , with mach number @xmath2 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? \n * heiles & troland 2003 ) ) . \n the only remaining free parameter is the total mass involved in the cloud -

law mass distribution , with a slope consistent with the salpeter value . \n that is , in this simulation , the sink particles correspond to individual stars , with a realistic mass distribution . \n this allows following the cluster dynamics realistically as well . \n the box size is 256 pc , and the initial density and temperature in the box were @xmath10 and @xmath11 k , respectively . \n two colliding streams of gas , of radius 64 pc and length 112 pc and with opposite velocities of magnitude @xmath12 each , were set to collide at the @xmath13 plane in the simulation . \n a turbulent velocity field with a spectrum peaking at wavenumber @xmath14 ( so that the fluctuation size scale is smaller than the radius of the colliding streams ) was applied to trigger instabilities in the compressed layer . for more details , \n we refer the reader to c+13 .    in this simulation , \n three main clusters form , two of which are sufficiently massive to disperse / evaporate the dense gas around them on a timescale of @xmath15 myr . \n stars begin to form at @xmath16 myr , and the first hii  regions appear at @xmath17 myr . at @xmath18 myr \n , the dense gas has been cleared from a radius of @xmath19 pc around the clusters . \n figure [ fig : sim_imgs ] shows , in the _ left panel _ , one snapshot of the simulation , at @xmath20 myr into the evolution , in which the growing hii  regions around the two most massive clusters can be seen as faint shells around the clusters , while the filamentary structure of the cloud is still noticeable in general . \n the clusters themselves have formed along the main filamentary structures in the cloud , and contain @xmath21@xmath22 . \n myr , showing the three clusters that form within filamentary structures . \n the box size is 256 pc and the ruler shows a scale of 159 pc . \n the color bar indicates the local density in @xmath23 . _ \n right panel : _ a zoom -

scale gravitational collapse , funneling gas into the cores within them , as observed by in a numerical simulation of cloud formation and collapse . \n moreover , these authors observed a hierarchy of collapses within the filaments , so that _ small clumps , which are sometimes forming stars already , are falling onto larger - scale ones_. this means that the late - stage clusters are assembled from smaller sub - units that formed in the filaments in the periphery of the trough of the large - scale gravitational potential well . \n this is illustrated in the _ right panel _ of fig . \n [ fig : sim_imgs ] , which shows a zoom - in around the second most massive cluster ( hereafter , `` cluster 2 '' ) of those seen in the left panel , at @xmath24 myr . \n it can be seen that this cluster is actually composed of three groups at this time , which later ( at @xmath25 myr ) merge to form a single larger cluster . operationally defining a group \n is a nontrivial task , because the gas clumps continue to form stars over extended periods of time due to the accretion from the filaments onto them . \n we thus define membership to a group by a sequence of steps . at early times , \n when the groups are clearly distinct by eye , we apply a `` friends - of - friends '' algorithm to the stars to define the groups . \n subsequently , as new stars are formed , we assign them to the groups whose center of mass is closest to the new star . also , we define the radius of the group at each time as the distance from its center of mass to the second most distant star . \n finally , we say that two groups have merged when the distance between their centers of mass is smaller than the larger of the two radii . \n the evolution and assembly of the central group in the _ right panel _ of fig . \n [ fig : sim_imgs ] is illustrated in fig.[fig : cluster_evol ] , which shows the projected positions of the sink particles on the @xmath26 plane at times @xmath27 , 21.44 , and 21.70 myr into the evolution of the simulation in the _ left , middle , _ and _ right _ panels , respectively . \n it is seen that , at the earlier time , the system consists of two subgroups , which approach each other and finally merge . \n in general , we observe this mechanism operating at all scales in our simulation , with groups in turn consisting of subgroups , and so on , implying that the clusters must exhibit a self -

scale , hierarchical gravitational collapse ( hgc ) of the clouds may be responsible for at least three observed properties of open clusters : 1 ) that there appears to be an increase of the sfr , so that the age distributions of clusters generally have a tail of older stars ( 3 - 7 myr ) , while most stars are young ( 1 - 2 myr ; ) ; 2 ) that they appear to have a self - similar structure , observationally manifested in an absence of a characteristic scale in the distribution of protostellar separations ( ) . in our simulation , this is manifested in the hierarchical membership of the stellar units that conform a cluster ; 3 ) that the clusters appear to consist of subunits of slightly different ages that merge to form larger structures ( ( * ? ? ? \n * kuhn et al . \n 2015b ) ; ) . \n these are natural consequences of hgc in globally collapsing clouds . \n the global collapse produces an increase of the sfr . \n the hierarchical nature causes , at large scales , filamentary structures that feed the star - forming clumps for extended periods of time and , at small scales , it produces local star - forming sites that fall into the troughs of the large - scale contracting structures .", "StartTimeOffset": 160156165337, "RequestID": "38612af323e240f9b48bfc8799f01aee", "TotalTokens": 4257}

{"ContextTokens": 3071, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "there has been significant recent progress in the study of galaxy formation within a cosmological context , mainly due to a phenomenological approach to this problem . \n the idea is to start with a structure formation model that describes where and when galactic dark haloes form . a simple description of gas dynamics and star formation provides a means to calculate the amount of stars forming in these haloes . \n stellar population synthesis models then provide the spectral evolution , i.e.  luminosities and colours , of these galaxies . \n many physical processes are modelled as simple functions of the circular velocity of the galaxy halo . therefore \n , the tully - fisher relation is the most obvious observational relation to try and predict , as it relates the total luminosity of a galaxy to its halo circular velocity . \n however , most phenomenological galaxy formation models do not simultaneously fit the i - band tully - fisher relation and the b or k band luminosity function . \n when one sets the model parameters such that the tully - fisher relation has the right normalization , the luminosity functions generally overshoot ( e.g.  kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; kauffmann , colberg , diaferio & white 1999 ) , certainly for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 standard cdm cosmology ( in the form given by davis et al .  1985 ) that we consider in this paper . \n alternatively , when making sure that the luminosity functions matches by changing some of the model parameters , the tully - fisher relation ends up significantly shifted with respect to the observed relation ( e.g.  cole et al .  1994 ; heyl et al . \n 1995 ) .    in order to keep the modelling as analytical as possible , an extension to the press & schechter ( 1974 ) prescription for the evolution of galaxy haloes ( e.g.  bond et al . 1991 \n ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ) has been a popular ingredient for implementations of a phenomenological theory of galaxy formation . \n however , the eps formalism is designed to identify collapsed systems , irrespective of whether these contain surviving subsystems . \n this ` overmerging ' of subhaloes into larger embedding haloes is relevant to the problem of matching both the galaxy luminosity function and the tully - fisher relation , as the central galaxy in an overmerged halo is the focus of a much larger cooling gas reservoir than the reservoir that galaxy is to focus of in case its parent subhalo survives . \n traditional n - body simulations suffer from a similar overmerging problem ( e.g.  white 1976 ) , which is of a purely numerical nature , caused by two - body heating in dense environments when the mass resolution is too low ( carlberg 1994 ; van kampen 1995 ) .    in order to circumvent these problems , we use an n - body simulation technique that includes a built - in recipe for galaxy halo formation , designed to prevent overmerging ( van kampen 1995 , 1997 ) , to generate the halo population and its formation and merger history . \n this resolves most of the discrepancy sketched above , _ and _  allows us to make the modelling more realistic by adding chemical evolution and a merger - driven bursting mode of star formation to the modelling . once stars are formed , we apply the stellar population synthesis models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) to follow their evolution . \n we have enhanced these models with a model for the evolution of the average metallicity of the population , which depends on the starting metallicity . \n feedback to the surrounding material means that cooling properties of that material will change with time , affecting the star formation rate , and thus various other properties of the parent galaxy . \n the key ingredients of the model are described below . \n we refer to van kampen et al . \n ( 1999 ) for a much more detailed description and discussion of the model , and a list of the choices for the various parameters involved . \n this is often treated by monte - carlo realizations of the analytic ` extended press - schechter ' formalism , which ignores substructure . \n we use a special n - body technique to prevent galaxy - scale haloes undergoing ` overmerging ' owing to inadequate numerical resolution . \n each halo contains a single galaxy at formation . \n when haloes merge , a criterion based on dynamical friction is used to decide how many galaxies exist in the newly merged halo . \n the most massive of those galaxies becomes the single central galaxy to which gas can cool , while the others become its satellites . \n when a halo first forms , it is assumed to have an isothermal - sphere density profile . \n a fraction @xmath3 of this is in the form of gas at the virial temperature , which can cool to form stars within a single galaxy at the centre of the halo . \n application of the standard radiative cooling curve shows the rate at which this hot gas cools below @xmath4  k , and is able to form stars . \n energy output from supernovae reheats some of the cooled gas back to the hot phase . \n when haloes merge , all hot gas is stripped and ends up in the new halo . \n the star formation rate is equal the ratio of the amount of cold gas available and the star - formation timescale . \n the amount of cold gas available depends on the merger history of the halo , the star formation history , and the how much cold gas has been reheated by feedback processes . \n we also model star bursts , i.e.  the star - formation rate may suffer a sharp spike following a major merger event .      the energy released from young stars heats cold gas in proportion to the amount of star - formation , returning it to the reservoir of hot gas . \n our work assumes the spectral models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) ; for solar metallicity , the results are not greatly different from those of other workers . \n the imf is generally taken to be salpeter , but any choice is possible . unlike other workers , we take it as established that the population of brown dwarfs makes a negligible contribution to the total stellar mass density , and we do not allow an adjustable @xmath5 ratio , @xmath6 , for the stellar population \n .      the evolution of the metals must be followed , for two reasons : ( i ) the cooling of the hot gas depends on metal content ; ( ii ) for a given age , a stellar population of high metallicity will be much redder . \n the models of jimenez et al . \n ( 1998 ) allow synthetic stellar populations of any metallicity to be constructed . \n with the set - up described above we match both the b and k band luminosity function and the i - band tully - fisher relation , for an @xmath0 standard cdm structure formation scenario . resolving \n the overmerging problem is the major contributor to this result , but the inclusion of chemical evolution and starbursts are also important ingredients . \n the new ingredients we have added to the modelling of galaxy formation are needed in order to make the models more realistic , and are not introduced simply in order to give yet more free parameters . nevertheless , our resolution to the tully - fisher / luminosity function discrepancy may well not be unique , and various other changes to the ingredients of the phenomenological galaxy formation recipe might produce similar results . \n for example , we have not studied the influence cosmological parameters have on the model galaxy populations , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are likely to be the important parameters . \n other types of ingredients are possible as well : somerville & primack ( 1998 ) resolve some of the discrepancy using a dust extinction model plus a halo - disk approach to feedback . \n one way of resolving the worries about degeneracies in the cosmological / physical parameter space will be to include data at intermediate and high redshifts , which is being gathered with increasing speed and ease , and at increasingly higher redshifts . in this contribution \n we show a preliminary comparison of the correlation properties of galaxies at redshift @xmath10 . \n recently , giavalisco et al .  ( 1998 ) gave an estimate for the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath11 for a sample of lyman - break galaxies at this redshift . \n they found @xmath12mpc and @xmath13 . \n we selected our model galaxies in exactly the same way as giavalisco et al . \n ( 1998 ) did , and compared two of the models produced by van kampen et al . \n ( 1999 ) , models @xmath14 and @xmath15 , to the observational data . the first model ( @xmath14 ) , which is as close as possible to the model by cole et al .  ( 1994 ) , but with the mass - to - light parameter @xmath16 , gives @xmath17mpc and @xmath18 . the second model ( @xmath15 ) , which includes starbursts and chemical evolution , gives @xmath19mpc and @xmath20 . \n both models fit the correlation function at @xmath21 very well , and can not be distinguished from each other .    as the observed correlation data are still relatively uncertain at this moment in time \n , it is premature to rule out models on the basis of this data . \n the two models discussed above have similar predictions for low redshifts , but predict different clustering properties at high - redshift . \n however , the differences are not large , so one needs either really good data , or a much larger variety of observational characteristics of the high - redshift galaxy population .    many thanks for the loud vocal support from outside the conference building during my presentation . \n i like to think that the people of marseille just wanted to show how much they supported everything i said ...    bond j.r . , cole s. , efstathiou g. , kaiser n. , 1991 , apj , 379 , 440 bower r.j . , 1991 , mnras , 248 , 332 carlberg r.g . , 1994 , \n apj , 433 , 468 cole s. , aragn - salamanca a. , frenk c.s . , navarro j.f . , \n zepf s.e . , 1994 , mnras , 271 , 781 davis m. , efstathiou g. , frenk c.s . \n , white s.d.m . , 1985 , \n apj , 292 , 371 heyl j.s . , cole s. , frenk c.s . , navarro j.f . , 1995 , mnras , 274 , 755 giavalisco , m. , steidel c.c . , adelberger , k.l . , \n dickinson , m.e . , \n pettini , m. , kellogg , m. , 1998 , apj , 503 , 543 jimenez r. , padoan p. , matteucci f. , heavens a. , 1998 , mnras , 299 , 123 kauffman g. , white s.d.m . , 1993 , mnras , 261 , 921 kauffmann g. , colberg j.m . , diaferio a. , white s.d.m . , 1999 , mnras , 303 , 188 kauffmann g. , white s.d.m . , guiderdoni , 1993 , mnras , 264 , 201 lacey c.g . , cole s. , 1993 , mnras , 262 , 627 press w.h . \n , schechter p. , 1974 , \n apj , 187 , 425 somerville r.s . , \n primack j.r . , 1998 , astro - ph/9802268 van kampen e. , 1995 , mnras , 273 , 295 van kampen e. , 1997 , in clarke d.a . , west m.j . , \n 12th ` kingston meeting ' on theoretical astrophysics : computational astrophysics , asp conf . \n vol . 123 . \n , san francisco , p. 231 , astro - ph/9904270 van kampen e. , jimenez r. , peacock j.a , 1999 , mnras , in press , astro - ph/9904274 white s.d.m . \n , 1976 , mnras , 177 , 717", "StartTimeOffset": 238419270893, "RequestID": "a0d8ad9af9ba404695efc9b888b7ffed", "TotalTokens": 3241}
{"ContextTokens": 3763, "GeneratedTokens": 62, "SynthesizedBody": "energy localization in the form of breathers has been intensely investigated over the past several years @xcite . \n these highly localized long - lived excitations in translationally invariant nonlinear arrays are of great interest because they provide a mechanism for energy storage that does not rely on defects . indeed , the fact that these excitations are often mobile ( which they would in general not be if the localization were defect - induced ) makes them particularly interesting in the context of efficient transport of vibrational energy  @xcite . \n exact breather excitations , that is , breathers that persist forever , can be confirmed analytically and constructed numerically for certain nonlinear infinite arrays of interacting masses , among them nonlinear arrays with no local potentials and interactions between neighboring sites that vary as @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite . \n the @xmath2 s denote displacements of the masses at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n when the interactions are not precisely of this form , or when the array is finite , or when other excitations ( for example , phonons or other localized excitations ) are present in the system , it is no longer possible to prove that there are exact breather solutions . \n nevertheless , it is possible to explore the problem numerically . in particular , in this paper we study the asymptotic dynamics of localized excitations in the one - dimensional fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) @xmath5-model at zero temperature and during thermal relaxation . \n we corroborate that long - wavelength thermal excitations have a profound effect on breather stability . \n since thermal fluctuations are inevitable in any real system , zero - temperature results must be applied with appropriate caution . \n these results extend our earlier work to much longer time regimes  @xcite , and agree with and complement those of piazza et al . \n the conditions for breather stationarity and longevity are thereby further clarified . \n we present our numerical results in secs .  [ zero ] and [ nonzero ] , and end with a brief summary in sec . \n [ summation ] . \n the hamiltonian for the fpu @xmath5-model is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of sites , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the harmonic and anharmonic force constants , respectively . \n we set @xmath10 throughout . \n the equations of motion with free - end boundary conditions are integrated using a fourth order runge - kutta method with time interval @xmath11 ( further reduction leads to no significant improvement ) . \n the total energy of the array is the sum over individual symmetrized site energies @xmath12  @xcite . \n a zero temperature environment with the least disturbance to the dynamics in the chain is achieved by connecting only the ends of the chain to such an environment via a dissipation term . \n this is accomplished by adding a term of the form @xmath13 to the equations of motion for sites @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite .    since we do not _ a priori _ know the form of the longest - lived localized excitation \n , we initially create an excitation of the  odd parity \" breather configuration with amplitudes @xmath16 , and zero velocity at each site . \n the frequency of the resulting oscillatory motion increases with increasing @xmath17 , which must be chosen so that this frequency is above the phonon band edge at @xmath18 . \n this excitation is not an exact stationary solution of the equations of motion , so it typically sheds some energy while re - accommodating amplitudes and frequencies , and settles into an excitation that is very long - lived . \n the discarded energy appears in the form of phonons that travel away from the localized excitation and dissipate quickly , in a time @xmath19 , across the ends of the chain . \n the balance of the energy remains localized , most of it ( @xmath20 for @xmath21 ) on the three initially excited sites , and decays exponentially with an extremely long characteristic time @xmath22 . \n = 3.0 in    to extract exponents and characteristic times , it is crucial to have data that covers both time scales , and to normalize the data in such a way that one behavior does not mask or distort the other  @xcite . \n we introduce the _ normalized energy _ @xmath23 and the _ modified normalized energy _ \n @xmath24 : @xmath25 the denominator in the first contains the initial energies , and in the second the energies after the discarded phonons have dissipated ( but before the remaining localized excitation has decayed appreciably ) . in our illustrations we take @xmath26 . \n = 3.0 in    in fig .  [ fig1 ] we show typical results for the normalized energy for three excitation amplitudes over more than six decades of time . \n the modified normalized energy shows essentially the same behavior . \n if the decay of the long - lived excitation is exponential , we expect @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] vs @xmath29 to be straight lines over the appropriate long time intervals . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] we clearly see this behavior , which extends over the entire time interval for the higher ( but not the lower ) amplitude excitation . \n the slope for the @xmath21 curve leads to a decay time of @xmath30 , a number reported here merely to stress its enormous magnitude . \n the frequency of the localized breather increases with increasing amplitude and hence is more separated from the phonon band for larger @xmath17 , leading to a slower decay of more energetic breathers . \n as the breather loses its energy , its frequency decreases , and eventually as it approaches the phonon band edge the decay becomes more rapid . \n this behavior is evident in the @xmath31 curve in fig . \n we also find that longer chains exhibit a longer decay time : residual amplitude of the breather at sites far from its center decreases rapidly with increasing distance and thus the chain end sites have less energy to dissipate . \n figure  [ fig3 ] confirms the exponential behavior of the breather decay  @xcite . for two initial amplitudes \n , the figure shows @xmath32 $ ] vs @xmath33 , which yields a straight line of slope @xmath5 if the decay is of the form @xmath34 . \n the inset shows the values of the slopes as a function of time . \n for @xmath21 pure exponential behavior @xmath35 is confirmed throughout the time range presented . \n the deviation from pure exponential decay for the lower amplitude breather is evident . \n = 3.0 in    a breather of a given amplitude has a well - defined characteristic frequency . in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we show this frequency in relation to the phonon band edge as a function of time for the cases discussed above . for 31-site chains , \n the frequency of the breather of initial amplitude @xmath21 decreases very little over the entire simulation , while that of initial amplitude @xmath31 decreases more markedly . \n consistent with the fact that the breather does not disappear entirely in the time range shown , its frequency never reaches the phonon band edge . if the initial amplitude of the excitation were even smaller , or the simulation time much longer , or the chain shorter , the breather would eventually disappear . \n this last case is illustrated in fig . \n the disappearance of the breather coincides with its frequency reaching the band edge . \n the inset shows @xmath36 , the ratio of the energy on the five sites around the breather to the total energy . \n this parameter is of order unity when most of the energy is localized on a small number of sites . \n the situation is less certain when a localized excitation evolves in a thermal environment . \n other excitations in the medium perturb the breather , and its eventual fate varies from one realization to another . to illustrate the complexity of the situation , we present two scenarios . \n = 3.0 in    we begin with a chain that is initially in thermal equilibrium at a nonzero temperature @xmath37  @xcite . at time @xmath38 \n , the end sites of the thermalized chain are connected to a zero temperature bath via a purely dissipative term  @xcite . \n we follow the thermal relaxation of the chain and , in particular , the dynamics of breathers that may spontaneously appear during relaxation if the initial temperature is sufficiently high . \n figure  [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of the total energy in a chain of @xmath39 sites initially thermalized at temperature @xmath40 . \n the figure also shows the energy in only the four sites @xmath41 . after a relatively short time ( @xmath42 time units in this particular realization ) almost all of the energy settles in these sites and remains there . \n the excitation around the four sites turns out to be an  even parity \" breather , with maximum displacements @xmath17 and @xmath43 alternating on sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 , smaller but not negligible amplitudes at sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and essentially no motion of the other sites . \n the frequency of the breather , initially @xmath48 , decreases very little for the duration of the simulation . in fig . \n [ fig5 ] we also present the modified normalized energy . \n its decay is clearly exponential , with an enormously long time constant , @xmath49 . \n thus this breather , even in our relatively short chain , is essentially stationary . \n this decay time is much longer than that reported in the previous section , consistent with the fact that the amplitude of the breather that has emerged spontaneously is larger . \n the thermal relaxation process has swept the lattice clean of all other excitations , allowing the breather to survive undisturbed . \n this process was described in our earlier work  @xcite . \n there we reported a stretched exponential rather than a purely exponential decay , a conclusion that relied on the normalized rather than the modified normalized energy  @xcite , on a time history that was not sufficiently long , and on a statistical average over a thermal ensemble that included realizations where no breather appeared during the thermal relaxation process ( and where the energy dissipation was consequently much more rapid ) .    in our second scenario , at @xmath38 a breather is explicitly injected into a chain that is in thermal equilibrium at a very low temperature ( too low for the spontaneous formation of breathers ) . \n the chain is then allowed to relax into a zero temperature heat bath . \n we find that the thermal background invariably sets the breather in motion , and causes the breather to collide with other excitations and with the chain boundaries . \n collision events not only cause the breather to keep moving , but also lead to breather degradation through loss of energy upon collision  @xcite . \n the resulting lifetime @xmath22 of the breather is then in general much smaller than in the first scenario . \n the lifetime is also much smaller than that of a breather of the same amplitude injected into a zero temperature chain . \n we find this behavior even when the temperature is extremely low ( all the way down to @xmath50 ) . as a quantitative check \n we have explicitly injected a breather of initial amplitude @xmath21 into a chain thermalized at @xmath51 . \n the system is then allowed to relax into a zero temperature bath , as before . \n compared to the lifetime of the breather in the zero temperature chain , the lifetime of the breather is now much reduced , @xmath52 . \n a similar comparison with @xmath53 again leads to dramatically different lifetimes , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath51 ) . \n note that it does not much matter whether the injected breather is of even or odd parity ( we inject an odd one ) . \n why is a breather created spontaneously during thermal relaxation more stable than one explicitly injected into a thermalized chain , even at extremely low temperatures ? \n the answer lies in the effect of different phonons on breather dynamics  @xcite . \n whereas short wavelength zone - boundary phonons contribute to spontaneous breather formation (  modulational instability \" ) , breathers are most strongly perturbed by the longest wavelength phonons . \n these are also the phonons that dissipate most rapidly out of a chain with free - end boundaries into a zero - temperature bath . in the higher temperature system , \n when the breather is created spontaneously the long wavelength phonons have already dissipated and , as dissipation continues up the phonon spectrum , the breather is increasingly less disturbed until it reaches a spatially stationary very long - lived configuration  @xcite . on the other hand , \n if the breather is injected into a thermalized system , the breather is subject to strong disturbance by long wavelength phonons even at the very lowest temperatures until these phonons dissipate . \n an injected breather in the thermalized scenario is therefore a more fragile excitation than a spontaneously created breather of the same amplitude . to confirm this description \n we have followed the dynamics of a breather injected into a relaxing chain _ \n after _ the long wavelength phonons have decayed , and find the breather to be almost as stable as one in a zero - temperature simulation . \n for example , for a zero - temperature injected breather of initial amplitude @xmath57 in a chain of 31 sites ( @xmath58 ) , we find a lifetime @xmath59 . in a chain \n initially thermalized at @xmath60 and then allowed to relax , if we wait until @xmath61 before injecting the same breather we find a somewhat shortened but still very long lifetime of @xmath62 , in any case much longer than it would be if injected at @xmath38 . \n we have also observed a breather in a chain whose temperature is maintained at an extremely low but nonzero value . \n the breather in this case is always fragile , continuing to move and lose energy until it degrades completely . \n the zero temperature stability of the breather is therefore a somewhat singular result . \n our work supports three main conclusions concerning the dynamics of breathers in fpu @xmath5-chains : 1 ) at zero temperature in finite chains , breather - like excitations remain stationary and localized , and their energy decays exponentially with time ; 2 ) the decay time at zero temperature is extremely long , increasing with increasing chain length and with increasing initial breather amplitude ; 3 ) long wavelength thermal background sets the breather in motion , which in turn leads to a more rapid decay of the breather . \n the zero - temperature result is in this sense fragile . \n we have confirmed that breather decay for any particular realization is exponential  @xcite until the breather frequency closely approaches the phonon band edge . \n however , since the characteristic exponential time varies considerably from one realization to another , an ensemble averaged decay may be of stretched exponential or other form . \n the authors are grateful to f. piazza for enlightening discussions . \n this work was supported by the engineering research program of the office of basic energy

the first results have been published quite recently  @xcite . in regards to qed shifts of _ quasidegenerate _ levels , they have only been obtained this year for the first time  @xcite , with the help of the method that we present in this talk . \n as is well known , relativistic electrons orbiting a nucleus are well treated with the _ dirac equation _ , in which the nucleus can be considered as point - like or not . \n we thus treat the binding to the nucleus _ non - perturbatively _ by using `` bound - state qed ''  @xcite ( the coupling constant of the nucleus - electron interaction is @xmath2 , which is not small for highly - charged ions ) . in this formalism , however , qed effects are taken into account by treating the electron - electron interaction _ perturbatively _ ( with coupling constant @xmath3 ) , and both the electron and photon fields are _ quantum _ fields ( i.e. , in _ second_-quantized form ) ; the only difference with the free - field case used in high - energy physics is that electronic creation and annihilation operators create and destroy atomic states instead of free particles . \n a few methods allow one to extract energy levels from the bound - state qed hamiltonian : the two - time green s function method  @xcite , the method being developed by lindgren ( based on relativistic many - body perturbation theory merged with qed )  @xcite , the adiabatic @xmath4-matrix formalism of gell - mann , low and sucher  @xcite , and the evolution operator method  @xcite . \n some other methods yield atomic energy levels , but they include qed effects only _ partly _ or approximately ( such as the multiconfiguration dirac - fock method  @xcite , configuration interaction calculations  @xcite and relativistic many - body perturbation theory  @xcite ) .    however , \n only _ two _ methods can in principle be employed in order to calculate energy levels of _ quasidegenerate _ atomic states [ e.g. , the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 levels in heliumlike ions , which are experimentally important ] : the two - time green s function method and the method being elaborated by lindgren . \n we present in this talk a non - technical introduction to the first method . \n the two - time green s function method has also the advantage of yielding a _ simpler renormalization procedure _ than the gell - mann  low  sucher method in the case of _ degenerate _ levels  @xcite . \n all the methods that extract atomic energy levels from the bound - state qed hamiltonian study the _ propagation _ of electrons between two different times . \n the methods differ in the number of _ infinite _ times used :    ( a )  in the gell - mann  low  sucher method , the atomic state under consideration evolves from time @xmath7 to time @xmath8 with an adiabatic switching of the interaction ; ( b )  in lindgren s formalism  @xcite , the evolution is from time @xmath7 to time @xmath9 , which avoids problems associated with the two infinite times in the @xmath4-matrix approach of gell - mann  low  sucher ; ( c )  in the two - time green s function method , that we present here , the adiabatic switching is completely avoided by studying the propagation of electrons between _ two finite times_. we note that adiabatic switching of the interactions is physically motivated in the study of collisions between particles that start very far from each other , but this switching is not so easily related to the physical description of the orbiting electrons of an atom . \n the _ effective hamiltonian _ derived from qed by the two - time green s function method has matrix elements between the various degenerate and/or quasidegenerate states under study ; the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are the atomic energy levels predicted by qed ( to a given order ) . \n this effective hamiltonian is however _ not _ associated to a schr \" odinger equation of motion ; our hamiltonian is equivalent to the submatrix used in the perturbation theory of degenerate and quasidegenerate states ; in this respect , the approach of the two - time green s function method differs from the spirit of the bethe - salpeter equation . \n the qed hamiltonian of the method is defined with the help of a green s function that represents the propagation of @xmath10 electrons between two different ( finite ) times ( @xmath10 is the number of electrons of the atom or ion that we want to study ) ; this propagation is represented in fig . \n [ fig : green ] . \n the energy levels of an @xmath10-electron ion or atom can be recovered by studying the _ energy _ \n representation @xmath11 of the green s function , i.e. , by doing a fourier transform : this function _ has ( simple ) poles at the atomic energy levels \n _  @xcite . \n such a result is similar to the k \" all ' en - lehmann representation  @xcite . as an example , fig . \n [ fig : greenpoles ] depicts the poles of the two - particle green s function . \n the two - time green s function method provides a way of _ mathematically _ extracting from the green s function the positions of the poles , i.e. , the atomic energy levels  @xcite ; the procedure handles degenerate and quasidegenerate atomic levels without any special difficulty  @xcite . \n one of the basic ideas behind the pole extraction is found in the following mathematical device , which uses _ any _ contour @xmath12 that encloses the pole in order to find its exact position : if the function @xmath13 has a simple pole at @xmath14 , then we have from complex analysis @xmath15 the contour @xmath12 is only required to encircle the pole and to be positively oriented , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : contourint ] . since the green s function has simple poles at the atomic energy levels  @xcite , eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) is a way of obtaining them . \n when qed shifts of degenerate of quasidegenerate levels are calculated , the _ scalar _ green s function @xmath0 of eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) is simply replaced by a finite - size _ matrix _ defined on the space of levels under consideration  @xcite . \n obviously , _ analytic _ properties of the green s function  @xcite are important in the evaluation of eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) . \n we have developed a set of _ graphical _ techniques that allow one to obtain the laurent series of the green s function @xmath11 by a _ \n systematic _ procedure . \n the idea behind these techniques consists in displaying the analytic structure of the green s function step by step ; each step explicitly extracts _ \n one _ singularity , and we proceed until we have exhausted all the singularities of the green s function ; at this point , contour integrals such as eq . \n ( [ eq : polerecover ] ) can be calculated quite simply . \n it is impossible to give here a full account of the method we use for deriving the effective , finite - size qed hamiltonian . \n however , we can mention a particular feature of our calculational strategy : a very special `` particle '' appears in our algorithm ; this particle is quite simple since it `` disintegrates '' immediately ( zero life time ) and can not move ( zero probability for going from one position to a different one ) . in mathematical terms , the coordinate - space propagator of this particle is a four - dimensional delta function @xmath16 $ ] that we represent by a special line in feynman diagrams . \n the experimental accuracy on transition energies is so high that second - order ( i.e. , two - photon ) effects must be taken into account in order to compare experiments with theory . \n we thus have very recently calculated the contribution of the self - energy screening  @xcite to the qed effective hamiltonian ; this contribution corresponds to the following physical processes : @xmath17 our result is part of the current theoretical effort developed with the aim of matching experimental precisions .", "StartTimeOffset": 302576344104, "RequestID": "05913f8585c94f05979c661fe6bae782", "TotalTokens": 2357}

{"ContextTokens": 3412, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "the hybrid pixel detectors in operation at the lhc today @xcite and installed around 2007 represent a great achievement in particle physics instrumentation , but have limitations in rate capability , radiation hardness , power and mass , imposed by the technology that was available at the time of their design . \n work within the atlas collaboration has since focused on developing new technology rather than on a specific detector design . \n the developments discussed here are a new readout integrated circuit called fe - i4 , new sensor developments , mechanical structures based on a new type of high thermal conductivity carbon foam , and electro - mechanical integrated structures . \n the technology developments follow a road - map inspired by the requirements of a future high luminosity lhc upgrade , but has the generic goals of reducing mass and cost while increasing rate capacity and radiation tolerance . as individual technologies mature , they can be deploy as soon as the need or opportunity arises . the `` insertable b - layer '' ( ibl ) upgrade  @xcite will deploy in 2013 the fe - i4 integrated circuit , high thermal conductivity carbon foam , `` slim edge '' planar sensors , and 3d sensors . \n other near term upgrades are being considered that would also deploy the fe - i4 integrated circuit along with diamond sensors ( a beam luminosity monitor ) and 3d sensors ( a far forward pixel detector ) . together with further new technologies ( on - stave power conversion , high speed data transmission , etc . ) \n , all the technologies described in this paper would be available for deployment on a 2018 time scale and this possibility is under consideration . \n photograph of the fe - i4 readout chip ( left ) and fe - i3 ( right ) . \n the width and height as shown are 20.3 mm by 19.2 mm for fe - i4 and 7.4 mm by 11.0 mm for fe - i3,width=302 ]    the fe - i4 pixel readout integrated circuit has been developed with the generic goals of increasing rate capability and radiation tolerance and reducing system cost  @xcite . \n cost reduction is mainly achieved by making the integrated circuit area as large as possible , since flip chip bump bonding cost scales approximately with the number of chips processed rather than with area processed , and until now bump bonding has been the main cost driver . \n fe - i4 is therefore the largest pixel readout ic produced to date : fig  [ fig : chips ] shows a photograph of fe - i4 next to the present atlas pixel readout chip called fe - i3 . \n bump bonding cost reduction is not critical for the ibl project because the total active area is small ( 0.15m@xmath0 ) . \n however , the large format of fe - i4 is critical to fitting the tight radial envelope constraints of ibl . \n additionally , only 10% of the fe - i4 area is devoted to periphery ( compared to 30% for fe - i3 ) and this is again critical for the ibl geometry .    the small fe - i4 periphery is a secondary benefit of a new readout architecture  @xcite . \n the reduced periphery is achieved because all hit storage is within the pixel matrix itself . \n the primary purpose of this new architecture is to achieve much higher rate capability than previous chips . \n this is critical for ibl ( due to higher hit rate at smaller radius ) . \n the new readout stores hit charge and timing locally within a 4-pixel region until selected by an external trigger . \n this was possible by taking advantage of the high digital circuit density in the 130 nm feature size cmos process used . \n increased radiation tolerance is also achieved by the 130 nm process . \n each fe - i4 chip has 26,880 pixels 50@xmath1 m wide by 250@xmath1 m long . \n pixel sensor development has been ongoing in several large collaborations  @xcite . within atlas \n the ibl project provided a significant boost to pixel sensor prototyping and characterization . \n a planar n - in - n ibl sensor design is based on the sensors used in the present atlas pixel detector  @xcite , adapted to the ibl needs by reducing the pixel size to match fe - i4 granularity and the sensor wafer thickness to 200@xmath1 m . a new guard ring design maximizes the possible operation voltage and minimizes the inactive edge . \n the so - called``slim - edge '' design , uses 13 guard rings on the bias side of the sensor to manage the potential drop between bias contact and physical sensor edge . \n the distance from the last guard to the dicing edge is 100@xmath1 m . \n the edge pixels on the electrode side of the sensor overlap the guard ring area to collect charge from as close as possible to the physical edge . \n further details can be found in  @xcite . \n a `` double sided '' \n 3d sensor ibl design has the measuring and biasing electrodes etched into the p - type silicon bulk from opposite sides , penetrating most of the thickness , but not all the way through . \n this makes processing and bias connection simpler . \n the sensor bulk is laterally depleted between n@xmath2-type measuring electrodes and p@xmath2-type biasing electrodes . \n 3d sensors allow for high field strength and good charge collection after heavy irradiation with relatively low bias voltages . \n the ibl 3d design uses two n@xmath2 electrodes per pixel , surrounded by six p@xmath2 biasing electrodes , to provide good charge collection without excessive capacitance  @xcite . \n the sensors are 230@xmath1 m thick and have an inactive guard ring area 225@xmath1 m wide . \n two guard ring variants have been developed using combinations of n@xmath2 columns and p@xmath2 columns forming fences around the active area . \n thermal conductivity vs. density for new carbon foam . \n finite element calculates ( squares and triangles ) are compared with sample measurements ( circles).,width=302 ]    a new type of all - carbon thermally conductive foam has been developed for silicon pixel and strip mechanical supports  @xcite . \n the foam is readily machinable and has low radiation length , yet thermal conductivity two orders of magnitude higher than conventional foams of the same density . \n [ fig : foamk ] shows finite element analysis predicted foam conductivities compared to sample measurements . \n the foam is produced using a reticulated vitreous carbon ( rvc ) foam precursor and increasing the thermal conductivity through combination of chemical vapor deposition and heat treatment . \n a standard fabrication has been developed producing blocks 2.5 cm thick and @xmath3cm@xmath0 . \n a common basic concept uses a small coolant tube glued to foam , coupled with high stiffness carbon facings to form rigid , lightweight structures supporting modules and their electrical connections . due to the high foam conductivity , such structures efficiently couple heat for small tubes typical of co@xmath5 evaporative cooling \n this is the atlas baseline for all future pixel support structures ( including ibl ) and also a candidate for silicon strip supports . \n the reliability of such foam - based structures has been validated by extensive thermal cycling and repeated shock , before and after irradiation up to 1grad . \n three types of pixel structures have been prototyped , all based on evaporative co@xmath5 cooling in ti tubes coupled to the surfaces with thermally conductive carbon foam . \n these are the ibl stave , box beam stave , and `` i - beam '' coupled layer structures . \n box beams have been made up to 1.4 m long by 4 cm wide , including embedded electrical cables . \n also demonstrator bent sections have been made , which can be used to increase pseudorapidity coverage of barrel sections improving the transition to forward coverage . \n i - beam coupled layers have been made up to 1 m long . by radially coupling two measurements layers , \n a very stiff structure can be made , thereby saving mass in support frame structures- even long i - beams can be end - supported . \n [ fig : staves ] shows a 1.4 m long box beam prototype with embedded cables next to a 1 m long i - beam prototype fig . \n [ fig : iblstave ] shows detail views of one end of a 2 cm wide ibl stave . \n stave cable designs have been produced compatible with serial powering of all modules on a stave , using aluminum conductors . \n the fe - i4 chip contains so called `` shunt - ldo '' voltage regulators  @xcite designed to support serial power distribution . in ibl \n these regulators are used to permit safe operation with point - to - point power over resistive cables ( the voltage drop in the cables is comparable to the load ) . \n photograph of a 1.4 m long box beam stave prototype ( bottom ) and a 1 m long i - beam stave prototype ( top).,width=510 ]     photographs of an end of an ibl stave . \n the width is 2cm.,width=302 ] \n the insertable b - layer ( ibl ) is the first planned upgrade to the atlas inner tracker . \n it consists of new barrel layer of pixels to be mounted inside the existing detector , without altering it . \n the present atlas pixel inner layer has approximately a 1 cm gap to the outer envelope of the beam pipe , and additional room will be created by replacing the existing beam pipe with a new one of reduced diameter . in the context of new technology development , it is interesting to recall that the original atlas pixel technical design report  @xcite called for a smaller radius , smaller pixel size inner layer than was eventually implemented . \n the reason for the change was lack of sufficiently advanced technology- a smaller pixel size chip could not be designed in the cmos process used at the time , and the radiation and rate tolerance requirements could not be met at the desired small radius . in this sense , \n the new technology that is being deployed in ibl can finally achieve the original atlas design goals . \n [ fig : iblphotos ] shows a photograph of the present detector exactly as it is mounted around the beam pipe , as well as cross sections view of barrel layers and the ibl . \n the ibl is approximately 64 cm long at a mean radius of 3.2 cm . \n thanks to the small radius , a single barrel covers the full pseudorapidity range of the atlas tracking system . \n it is made up of 14 staves with 32 fe - i4 chips each . \n the ibl mass target in the active region is 1.5% of a radiation length at normal incidence . \n the additional high precision measurement , at smaller radius and with low mass translates into a significant improvement in the performance of he atlas detector : the purity of b -

{"ContextTokens": 3839, "GeneratedTokens": 219, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding the mechanisms of learning and maintenance of effective behavior in stochastic environments with complex hierarchy of goals is one of key issues in the study of neural processing and for the development of bio - inspired artificial intelligence . \n however , these mechanisms are better understood if history of their development is taken into account .    fields of machine learning and adaptive behavior have been rapidly developing in the recent decades . \n one of the most popular approaches in these areas is reinforcement learning ( rl ) @xcite and its modifications . it can be effectively used for learning of autonomous agents in many domains . \n however , problem spaces with multiple goals require execution of alternative behavioral strategies that are not possible for rl algorithms , since the behavior of the agent is determined by the single value function . \n also , it is not always possible to define appropriate value function _ a priori_. to address this issue approaches for the generation of reinforcement values using evolutionary algorithms are currently under development @xcite . \n other algorithms are also unable to produce effective solution for the environments with hierarchy of goals @xcite . \n the various methods designed for the generation of behavioral sequences @xcite in most cases can not effectively work in situations with a large number of goals present in the environment and when an agent has to autonomously explore them . \n neuroevolutionary approaches have been successfully used for the synthesis of autonomous agent s controllers in low - formalized tasks @xcite .    to solve the problem of alternative behaviors \n the algorithm should implement non - markov decision process in opposite to reinforcement learning @xcite . \n in other words for selection of different actions at the same state of the environment an agent should have memory of previous actions . \n short - term memory ( stm ) is extensively covered in the area of recurrent neural networks research in terms of the signal reverberation @xcite and serial order recall @xcite . \n theorists suggested reverberation phenomenon as significant mechanism for stm @xcite . nevertheless neural principles underlying generation of the behavior as a non - linear integration of the sensory information and internal state of the network are not yet discovered . as well \n the question of the role stm plays in the adaptive behavior with alternative actions is still underexplored .    in this paper \n we present a model of an agent situated in an environment with hierarchy of goals . \n the behavior of the agent is controlled by recurrent neural network . \n we simulated evolution of agents in the model world and studied emergence of short - term memory and its role in adaptive behavior . \n in the current study a state of an environment in which an autonomous agent `` lives '' is represented by binary vector :    @xmath0    at any discrete time step the agent may change a single bit of this vector to the opposite . \n thus , environmental structure is a @xmath1-dimensional hypercube . \n every dimension of this hypercube might be interpreted as some feature of the real environment , for instance temperature , pressure , etc . \n competing goals of different complexity are prespecified in the environment as an ordered set of single bit changes of the environmental state vector :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a number of target bit of the state vector , @xmath4 is target value of the bit , @xmath5 is a complexity of the goal \n . goals of varying complexity are defined in the environment , together forming a branched hierarchical structure . \n we have generated structure of the environment by , firstly , composing hierarchy of full goals and then each goal was divided into sequence of subgoals . \n to determine the complexity of a particular environment we introduce occupancy based on a probabilistic approach :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the number of goals in an environment , @xmath8 is the number of unique bits of the state vector , changed during the process of achieving a goal ( single bit can be changed several times ) . \n the value , which is opposite to the occupancy , we shall call the difficulty of the environment :    @xmath9    reward is associated with each goal in the environment and directly proportional to the complexity of corresponding goal . after the agent reached goal , level of accruing reward associated with this goal is reset and then linearly recovers to the original value over the time @xmath10 \n .    environment can be either deterministic or non - deterministic . in the later changes of the state vector \n occur not only when the agent performs actions , but also stochastically according with a fixed probability . \n agent s behavior in the environment is controlled by artificial neural network ( ann ) of arbitrary topology , which develops through the evolutionary process . \n ann is divided into input , output and number of hidden layers . \n the network consists of mcculloch - pitts neurons with nonnegative logistic activation function . \n signal passes through the synapse only when output value of a presynaptic neuron is above a certain activation threshold ( was set to 0.5 in all simulations ) . \n thus , we introduce two possible states for each neuron : active ( when output is above a threshold ) and inactive ( otherwise ) . \n the current state vector of the environment is directly fed to the neurons of input layer of the network . \n hidden layers allow existence of recurrent connections with delayed transmission . \n pair of the most active neurons of output layer encodes agent s action at the current time step . \n each pair stands for a particular bit of the state vector and target value . \n thereby transfers of a bit from 0 to 1 and vice versa are encoded by different pairs of the output neurons . \n the agent could produce ineffective actions , when attempts to change a state of a bit to one in which it already is . \n population of agents evolves in the hypercube environment described in previous section . \n every individual is separately placed in the environment to evaluate fitness . for a given time the agent operates in the environment , reaching goals and accumulating reward . \n value of accumulated reward is inaccessible to the agent and total reward affects its reproductive success .    to evolve agents anns we used neuroevolutionary algorithm based on duplication of neurons . \n this algorithm is similar to well - known neat @xcite as it makes possible evolution of neural network topology but in more natural way by duplicating neurons with attached connections . \n specifically we use _ \n neuron s duplication _ mutation when duplicated neuron inherits from parent the whole synaptic structure instead of _ add node _ mutation of neat . \n incoming connections of the descendant and parent neurons retain its previous weights , while weights of outgoing connections divided in half for both neurons . \n thus , two neurons in the aggregate perform the former function , but later in evolution the descendant neuron could diverge into a separate structure . to optimize evolution by \n dynamically reducing dimensionality of the search space we also introduced _ delete connection _ mutation , which performed in the same manner as _ add connection _ mutation . \n neurons that lost all their connections are being deleted from the network . \n we did not use any crossover algorithm , since preliminary results of comparison between two versions of evolutionary algorithm ( with crossover and without ) have not showed significantly difference . \n the structure of the agents networks in initial population consists of input and output layers and one additional interneuron , which will be an ancestor for all future interneurons . \n this initial interneuron is fully connected to input layer ( by incoming connections ) and to output layer , herewith there are no initial direct connections between input and output neurons . \n we used the following parameters of the artificial environment in all simulations : dimensionality of the hypercube environment @xmath1  8 bits ; agent lifetime duration @xmath11  250 time steps ; reward s recovery time @xmath10  30 time steps ; probability of random change of the state vector s bit @xmath12  0.0085 ( for each bit ) . \n evolutionary algorithm was running with parameters : population @xmath13  250 agents ; period of evolution @xmath14  5000 generations ; probability of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath15  0.6 ( for each synapse ) ; variance of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath16  0.08 ; probability of adding the synapse @xmath17  0.1 ( for whole network ) ; probability of deleting the synapse @xmath18  0.05 ( for whole network ) ; probability of neuron s duplication @xmath19  0.007 ( for whole network ) . \n as the first step we studied how occupancy of the environment affects efficiency of evolved behavior in deterministic and stochastic environments . \n as expected the simulation results show the growth of an average cumulative reward with increase of the occupancy , reflecting that a task is easier when the environment is more densely populated with goals ( fig . \n [ fig : statevolution ] ) . \n agents evolved in non - deterministic environments behave significantly more successfully ( fig . \n [ fig : statevolution ] ) in terms of average accumulated reward and in most cases have richer repertoires of behavior . \n such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that during the `` life '' in an environment which could suddenly change the agent with a wider spectrum of behavioral policies should be more successful . \n thus stochasticity of the environment contributes to the selection of agents with more flexible and robust behavior , allowing them to reach greater number of goals from different initial position . \n however , with increasing probability of random changes in the environment one can observe a sharp decline in the efficiency of the evolution ( data not shown ) due to the destabilization of all policies caused by excessively frequent changes in the environment . \n we then analyzed evolution of behavioral sequences of the agents in the environment of intermediate goal occupancy . \n typical evolved behavior usually consists of two phases : preliminary phase of converging to the main behavioral cycle and then residing on it . in a particular behavioral run \n both of these phases depend on the initial state of the environment , from which the agent has been started . \n we shall call the main behavioral cycle ( sequence of actions or attained goals ) a behavioral strategy \n .    results of simulations demonstrate that sharp increase in the average cumulative reward among the population usually coincides with emergence of a large number of new cycles and their dynamic competition . \n corresponding periods are the most interesting in the study of behavioral evolution . on the fig . \n [ fig : behevolution ] we give an example of such period . \n one can observe competition between different behavioral strategies during a very limited evolutionary period . \n herewith new strategies are appearing as an extension of previously evolved cycles . \n extension can be implemented not only as simple addition of a new part to an old one , but also as complex compilation of two strategies . \n eventually one of the strategies wins the competition and dominates in the behavior of the most of the population . \n then evolution occurs through increase in number of states , from which it could be implemented . \n the analysis of behavioral strategies emerging in the simulated evolution shows that the agents acquire ability to store short - term memory due to reverberation in the neural network by recurrent connections . \n the evidence for short - term memory comes from the fact that agents can implement policies based on alternative actions . \n agents usually can perform different actions from one state of the environment depending on the previous history of behavior . \n state transition diagram for the exemplar evolved behavior with three alternative actions is shown on the fig . \n [ fig : alternativebehavior ] . \n such phenomenon would not been possible in the case of reactivity work of the neural network . \n corresponding behavior is generated by a neural network consists of 30 neurons with only 15 interneurons and 611 synaptic connections . \n only a small number of neurons significantly change output and affect the decision making at states associated with alternative situations . \n this group of neurons is specialized on particular alternative actions . \n the majority of neurons remain at the same level of activity , while neurons which determine a behavior change their activity from zero to maximum level . \n based on the various behavioral policies the deepest short - term memory we found was at least 4 past states ( lower bound ) . \n such conclusion was made after considering situations in which alternative actions are performed with the same history of behavior and , thus , the lower bound can be determined as the first different action of the two behavioral sequences . \n the ability to use short - term memory makes possible implementation of much more complex behavior and accumulation of more reward during the agent s `` life '' . \n example of a behavioral strategy , based on the alternation of two cycles of actions , is shown on the fig . \n [ fig : behstrategy ] . \n since after the goal is reached it restores the reward for a fixed number of time steps , such a strategy allows goals that were reached on the first cycle to restore their value , while the agent passes the second cycle . \n behavior on the fig . \n [ fig : behstrategy ] can be implemented using short - term memory with depth of two states .    primitive alternative behavior in the model \n could also be supported by slow neurodynamical process ( fig . \n [ fig : slowprocess ] ) . in this case \n the `` memory '' , required to perform alternative actions , could be up to 30 previous states . \n the mechanism underling this type of behavior is oscillatory dynamic of the neuron s output . \n while output of a neuron is above threshold , and therefore transmitted by outgoing connections , agent performs the first part of behavior . at some point output falls below the transmission threshold and the neuron no longer inhibits the other neuron , which activity is essential for the second branch of behavior .        in the records of neural network activity ( fig . \n [ fig : rasterplot ] ) during the entire period of autonomous agent s behavior one can identify both neurons , that are active while performing most of the actions , and neurons , that are active only in a very limited number of states of the environment ( sometimes even in a single state ) . \n in our study we have explored possibility of evolutionary emergence of short - term memory in recurrent neural networks controlling agents behavior in multi - goal environments . on the first stage we analyzed overall dynamics of a model . as expected , performance of agents was worse when the number of goals in environment was smaller . on the other hand it turned out surprisingly that in stochastic environments agents with more flexible and stable behavioral policies evolve and able to accumulate more reward in comparison to agents in the same environment but without noise . \n this phenomenon is quite unusual for machine learning algorithms @xcite , since in the case of non - deterministic environment the performance is usually worse . \n detailed investigation of evolutionary dynamics revealed that the evolution of agents consisted of two stages : rapid emergence / development of new behavioral strategies and their propagation among the population . \n formation of new strategies was usually manifested as complex integration of few already existed .    on the level of individual behavior we found that evolution develops strategies , which are based on alternative actions . \n that happens due to acquisition of ability to operate with short - term memory and , therefore , to select actions taking into account previous history of behavior . \n evolution discovered two different neuronal mechanisms for implementation of alternative actions : first one is based on integration of sensory information and internal signal , which is reverberating through recurrent connections ; and the second is based on slow neurodynamical oscillatory processes . in fact , there is no need to recruit synaptic plasticity during the agent s `` life '' to have an effective use of short - term memory . \n it is important to notice that emergence of the ability to operate with short - term memory in our model occurs without any artificial prerequisites in the structure of an evolutionary algorithm . \n the next stage of presented study is introduction of learning during agent s `` life '' , since it makes significant contribution into development of adaptive behavior . \n the main mechanism of learning algorithm is detection on the neuronal level of problems for the whole organism situated in environment . \n possible approach to the construction of such algorithm is the use of research in the theoretical neuroscience @xcite . \n singh , s. , lewis , r. , barto , a.g . \n : where do rewards come from ? in : taatgen , \n n.a . , van rijn , h.

{"ContextTokens": 3911, "GeneratedTokens": 270, "SynthesizedBody": "synthetic adhesives are usually soft , essentially incompressible materials that do not flow . \n they are used in the form of thin films of typically 100 m m in thickness . \n their adhesive properties are often tested in a controlled test that mimics the typical situation of two solid bodies linked by an adhesive . in the so - called probe - tack geometry , introduced by zosel ( 1985 ) , a flat , solid punch , called the probe , \n is brought into contact with an adhesive film deposited on a rigid substratum . after a certain contact time , the force is recorded while the probe is being pulled away ( figure 1a ) . because the adhesive material is almost incompressible , pulling the solid bodies apart causes a strong convergent deformation and thus a strong resistance to separation , i.e. to good adhesion . \n furthermore , because the resistance of the adhesive is so important , the deformability of the entire system , and in particular the compliance of the machine itself may play a role . \n elastic energy is stored for some time , until the adhesive gives way and causes a sudden separation , as discussed in a specific geometry by francis et al . \n sudden separation is possible when instabilities develop in the bulk of the adhesive material so as to relieve much of the stress . \n such instabilities have been observed directly during separation in a modified version of the probe - tack test ( lakrout et al . , 1999 ) and shown to fall into two main categories , viz . \n fingering instabilities and cavitation . \n both types of instabilities are driven by the need for relieving the stress . \n when air fingers protrude from the edge of the sample towards the center , they bring atmospheric pressure well into the sample and thus relieve the negative pressure that has developed near the center due to the applied traction . in the case of purely viscous liquids , this is the well - known saffman- taylor instability ( saffman et al . , 1958 ) . \n cavitation also relieves stress since the growing bubbles provide some of the extra volume required by the plate separation . since \n adhesive materials are usually more elastic than viscous , they are most often subject to cavitation , which involves strong deformations on the scale of the sample thickness . \n they almost never undergo fingering , which would involve deformations on the scale of the entire sample . when a very viscous liquid is used in this geometry instead of proper adhesive material , fingering is observed at low separation rates while cavitation occurs at higher rates ( poivet et al . , unpublished observations ) , which further illustrates the fact that both mechanisms compete in relieving the applied tensile stress . \n both fingering and cavitation involve strong deformations in the sample during separation and thus cause a large energy dissipation , ranging typically from @xmath0 to @xmath1 j / m@xmath2 for good adhesives , which is much higher than typical surface energies in the @xmath3 j / m@xmath2 range . \n a number of properties are associated with an adhesive . \n it is usually a soft material that does not flow and made of polymers whose molecular architecture may vary ( cross - linked polymers , block - copolymers ) \n . it can accommodate large defor- mations in order to dissipate a large amount of energy , yet it is essentially incompressible . \n the need for relieving the applied stress is so strong in the thin film geometry that if the adhesive material is too resistant , e.g. if it is very elastic , fingering and cavitation from the edge of the sample may occur at the interface , as shown by ghatak ( 2000 ) and shull ( 2000 ) . \n this highlights the fact that not only the bulk of the adhesive film , but also its interfaces with the solid bodies set up during the bonding process , must resist separation efficiently . \n the quality of the contact between the adhesive and the substrata results from the interplay of inter- actions at different length scales . on the molecular scale \n , it results generically from van der waals interactions ( israelachvili , 1992 ) . \n surface chemical bonds ( gent et al . , 1972 ) , macromolecular interdigita- tion ( raphal et al . , 1992 ) or macromolecule elongation ( lake et al . , 1967 \n ) , however , may enhance significantly the strength of the interface for specific substratum - adhesive pairs . \n surface treatments and cleaning are also essential . on the micrometre scale , solid substrates usually display some degree of surface roughness ( greenwood et al . , 1966 ) that may reduce the degree of intimacy of the contact with the adhesive if the adhesive material is not very soft ( dahlquist , 1969 ; fuller et al . , 1975 ; creton et al . , 1996 ; crevoisier et al . , 1999 ) . for very soft adhesives , however , the surface roughness of the substratum may paradoxically enhance the strength of the interface , as small air bubbles trapped at the interface may generate suction effects upon traction ( gay & leibler , 1999b ) .    when seeking a bad adhesion even with good adhesives , the main strategy is to weaken the contact at the body surface , and in particular to use non - wetting surfaces , i.e. surfaces such that the gain in surface energy upon making contact with the adhesive is small . \n when spread on such surfaces , most liquids do not spread spontaneously but gather into droplets . on very weakly wetting surfaces , in particular on lotus leaves and on other plants and on some insect wings ( wagner et al . \n , 1996 ; barthlott et al . , 1997 ; neinhuis et al . , \n 1997 ) , millimetric drops are almost complete spheres and can easily roll . \n solid surfaces were successfully designed to mimic this `` lotus effect '' and the surface design , an array of micrometer - sized poles , enhances the weak wettability achieved through chemical treatment ( bico et al . , 1999 ) . \n the mechanisms described above , by which the adhesive material undergoes heterogeneous defor- mations upon traction , involve the bulk of the adhesive film . \n however , as seen from a distance , the adhesive joint appears to be the interface between both solid bodies , and its deformations due to traction can be seen as a fracture propagating at this interface . in this perspective \n , adhesion phenomena are connected to the field of fracture mechanics . \n a small notch cut on one side of an elastic band ( figure 2a ) illustrates a number of points . \n if the band is pulled gently , it stretches homogeneously except in the vicinity of the notch where it is less stretched ( figure 2b ) . \n in other words , elastic energy is stored in the material but the notch relieves some of this energy . if the band was cut further , the notch would be longer and relieve more stress . \n this will not happen spontaneously unless it is pulled more strongly . \n it will generally happen when the elastic energy released by the notch propagation is sufficient to break further bonds at the interface and propagate the fracture . \n this is a central concept in fracture mechanics , called griffith s criterion ( griffith , 1920 ) . \n since the energy stored depends on the elastic properties of the entire system , not only does the elasticity of the testing apparatus play a role if it is soft enough , but very non - intuitive behaviors may arise . \n the fracture may propagate within the adhesive film i.e. its cohesion affected , or it may take place at the interface with one of the substrates . more generally , when considering a stack of several layers from different materials ( figure 2c ) , the system may break upon traction or peeling . \n the system may choose between different fracture mechanisms ( interfacial or cohesive , with further choice in a layered system ) . \n at first , it usually chooses the weakest mechanism in terms of force since it triggers separation first and thereby relieves the stress on the other possible mechan- isms . in the long run , however , fracture propagation is driven by the elastic energy stored in the system under tension which must exceed the energy required by the fracture . \n the system thus tends to choose the separation mechanism that dissipates the smallest amount of energy per unit surface area since the fracture will then be able to propagate faster . \n but , when a sheet of paper is torn out of note - pad , depending on how exactly the paper is pulled and how the note - pad is held , the sheet may detach neatly or be torn . due to the mismatch in the elastic properties of the note - pad and the paper sheet , \n the fracture may propagate along a path that does not minimize the energy dissipation . \n more generally , in a layered system , the elastic properties of the various layers may prevent the fracture from migrating towards its energetically optimal location . \n as discussed above , separating both substrata in the probe - tack geometry is difficult because the lateral extension of the adhesive joint is much greater than its thickness ( thin geometry ) . \n it is also essential that both substrata are rigid ( figure 1a ) . indeed , when an adhesive tape is considered , the sticky side is the adhesive film , while the non - sticky side is the ( very flexible ) backing . \n thus , the backing plays the role of one of the substrata . but \n peeling a tape off a table is quite easy because the backing is flexible and only a restricted region of the adhesive is under tension at any given time during peeling ( figure 1c ) . \n peeling is , in general , so much easier that it is avoided as much as possible in practical situations . \n for instance , adhesive hooks for bathroom or kitchen utensiles are designed in such a way that the hook deformations induced by a hanging weight cause the adhesive layer to be locally compressed rather than peeled , otherwise the adhesive joint would soon be ruined ( figure 1e , f ) . \n although similar to peeling at first sight , detach- ment by tilting is difficult if both the substrata are rigid . indeed , tilting one object ( for instance , the probe in the probe - tack geometry ) involves com- pression of the adhesive film along the vicinity of one edge , and traction on the other edge and on most of the region of contact with the object ( figure 1b ) . \n hence , tilting the object is very similar to pulling it . \n tilting becomes similar to peeling only at the point where the adhesive joint is not longer thin , i.e. if its lateral dimensions are comparable to its thickness , it is then easy . \n this feature is used by tropical lizards ( geckoes ) , which can climb walls at considerable velocities . \n their adhesive feet consist of a hierarchy of structures . \n the smallest structure is the spatula ( 0.2 @xmath4 m in width ) . \n adherence to the wall is important , even if it is rough , because spatulae can achieve contact with it somewhat independently of one another . \n however , foot removal is obviously achievable without too much effort . because spatulae are independent \n , they can be tilted simultaneously and peeled away from the wall . due to their small lateral dimension , \n this can be done with little effort ( autumn et al . , 2000 ) . in short , geckos use peeling on the lowest scale to lift their feet . \n a round object can roll on a sticky surface , whereby a new contact with the adhesive is made at the front , while separation , similar to peeling , is achieved at the rear ( figure 1d ) . \n because the separation dissipates more energy than is provided by the contact , a sufficient sideward force must be applied for the object to move . \n experiments conducted on glass cylinders in contact with rubber ( charmet et al . , 1995 and references therein ) show that such rolling can occur also if the applied force has a normal component . \n for example , cylinders can roll both on and under an inclined rubber sheet . \n similarly , marine organisms attached to a boat s hull undergo a sideways force as well as a lift force ( because the flow is usually in the inertial rather than viscous regime ) \n . they may thus roll if the water velocity is moderate , and they may even detach if the lift component of the force is high . \n if the organisms are rigid , gregarious settlement behavior hinders flow - driven detachment , since when attached together , they constitute a solid with a large lateral extension , which turns easy rolling into more demanding tilting ( figure 3 ) . \n testing fouling release properties of coatings some- times involves real - size experiments on ships , but more usually laboratory scale characterization . \n hydrodynamic effects scale with dimension . in particular , \n boundary layers are much smaller in laboratory tests than under ship - operating con- ditions ( schultz et al . , 2003 ) , \n thus attached bodies should be scaled down accordingly ( figure 4a , b ) . \n the interpretation of laboratory tests therefore needs to combine information from different types of experiments . \n for example , small ` toy ' particles on small ships can be used in laboratory tests to mimic organisms to measure what lateral and normal drag forces and torques they undergo at various locations on the ship and at various equivalent ship speeds ( figure 4b ) . \n after proper upscaling of these forces and torques , the laboratory or small boat tests with live organisms should be performed under con- ditions where forces and torques can be reproduced ( figure 4d ) . \n these parameters can be measured if the organisms are located on small , instrumented patches inside larger panels ( figure 4e ) . \n alterna- tively , if the organism under study is rigid , the forces and torques can be applied to it mechanically , in the absence of any flow ( figure 4c ) . \n if the organism is much more rigid than the coating , or , more generally , if its mechanical properties are known , its detach- ment can be mimicked with more convenient real- size ` toy ' objects with an experimental set - up that controls the forces and torques . \n the mechanics of adhesion briefly described in the previous sections suggest the following direction for fouling release coatings . if an aggregate of rigid organisms on the surface is considered on a classical thin coating , the only detachment mode is tilting ( figure 3 ) . \n but , if the coating is flexible in some sense , then an easier detachment mode , similar to peeling , may appear . \n it is suggested that a coating consisting in an inextensible , flexible , very thin upper layer and a much softer lower layer , may provide enough local compliance to accompany a tilting object and peeling away from it , thus easing its detachment ( figure 5 ) . \n such a coating may be capable of easily releasing rigid organisms . \n synthetic adhesives are efficient because they involve several mechanisms for dissipating a large amount of energy upon detachment ( see reviews by kinloch , 1996 , gay & leibler , 1999a , and creton & fabre , 2002 ) . \n some of these mechanisms , and the associated mechanical aspects , have been reviewed and may enhance understanding of the settlement and release of fouling organisms and thereby lead to improvements in the design of fouling release and non -

ir background light  @xcite and a quite detailed understanding of the evolution of ir galaxies with cosmic epoch , e.g.  @xcite . \n the ir galaxy luminosity function has a strong positive luminosity evolution from redshifts @xmath3 to 1 ( see  @xcite ) , implying that more luminous ir galaxies dominate the ir output with increasing redshift . beyond @xmath4 , \n basically all the ir light is produced by luminous and ultra -

bright spectra of more than 600 @xmath9 galaxies is presented elsewhere  @xcite . \n the completed first half of the zcosmos - bright program provides us with good - quality redshifts and spectra for 24 ir galaxies with @xmath1 over 1.5 deg@xmath7 of the cosmos field . \n these galaxies are tracers of the most intense star -

{"ContextTokens": 3645, "GeneratedTokens": 73, "SynthesizedBody": "the most important event in neutrino physics of the last decades was the solving of the solar neutrino problem . \n the sun appeared in this case as a natural laboratory for investigations of neutrino properties . \n there exists a number of natural laboratories , the supernova explosions , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics . \n it means that microscopic neutrino characteristics , such as the neutrino magnetic moment , etc . , would have a crucial impact on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events . \n one of the processes caused by the photon interaction with the neutrino magnetic moment , which could play an important role in astrophysics , is the radiative neutrino spin flip transition @xmath1 . \n the process can be kinematically allowed in medium due to its influence on the photon dispersion , @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the refractive index ) , when the medium provides the condition @xmath4 . in this case \n the effective photon mass squared is negative , @xmath5 . \n this corresponds to the well - known effect of the neutrino cherenkov radiation  @xcite . \n there exists also such a well - known subtle effect as the additional energy @xmath6 acquired by a left - handed neutrino in plasma . \n this additional energy was considered in the series of papers by studenikin et al . \n @xcite as a new kinematical possibility to allow the radiative neutrino transition @xmath1 . \n the effect was called the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath7 ) , and later the similar effect `` spin light of electron '' ( @xmath8 ) was discovered . for unknown reasons , the photon dispersion in medium providing in part the photon effective mass , was ignored in these papers . \n however , it is evident that a kinematical analysis based on the additional neutrino or electron energy in matter ( caused by the weak forces ) when the matter influence on the photon dispersion ( caused by electromagnetic forces ) is ignored , can not be considered as a physical approach . \n similarly , in the @xmath8 effect the authors  @xcite considered the matter influence on electron by the weak forces and ignored the electromagnetic interaction , taking the unphysical case of a pure neutron medium . \n it should be noted that even in the conditions of a cold neutron star , the fraction of electrons and protons can not be exacly zero , @xmath9  @xcite . moreover , even if this unphysical case of a pure neutron medium is considered , one should take into account the electromagnetic interaction of electrons with the magnetic moments of neutrons , which can be much more intensive than the weak interaction effects . \n a consistent analysis of the radiative neutrino spin flip transition in medium was performed in our papers  @xcite , where the medium influence both on the photon and neutrino dispersion was taken into account . \n it was shown that the threshold arose in the process , caused by the photon ( plasmon ) effective mass . \n this threshold left no room for the so - called `` spin light of neutrino '' and `` spin light of electron '' in the real astrophysical situations . \n in the series of papers  @xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations including the effective matter potentials .    in this paper , we remind the basic points of our criticism upon the @xmath7 effect , and give some comments on the method of exact solutions  @xcite . \n as it was already mentioned , the effect of the `` spin light of neutrino '' proposed in  @xcite was based on the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 induced by the medium influence . \n just this additional energy provides an effective mass squared @xmath10 to the left - handed neutrino , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino four - momentum in medium , while @xmath13 would form the neutrino four - momentum in vacuum , @xmath14 . \n it will be further seen that the neutrino vacuum mass @xmath15 , a great attention was paid to in the @xmath7 analysis  @xcite , may safely be neglected . \n given a @xmath16 interaction , caused by the neutrino magnetic moment , the left - handed neutrino effective mass @xmath17  ( [ eq : effective_mass ] ) would open a kinematical possibility for the process @xmath18 , if the photon effective mass is less than @xmath17 .    basing the consideration of the `` spin light of neutrino '' on the additional left - handed neutrino energy , the authors  @xcite , nevertheless , did not analyse this value in detail . \n the expression for this additional energy of a left - handed neutrino with the flavor @xmath19 was obtained in the local limit of the weak interaction  @xcite , see also ref . \n @xcite , and can be presented in the following form @xmath20 ,   \\label{eq : enulgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath21 are the number densities of background electrons , protons , neutrons , and neutrinos , and @xmath22 are the densities of the corresponding antiparticles . to find the additional energy for antineutrinos , one should change the total sign in the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) .    as is seen from eq . \n ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) , this value becomes zero in the charge - symmetric plasma . \n this means that the local limit of the weak interaction does not describe comprehensively the additional neutrino energy in plasma , and the non - local weak contribution must be taken into account . \n the analysis of this contribution was first performed for the conditions of the early universe  @xcite .    the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma , which is identical for both neutrinos and antineutrinos , \n can be presented in the form @xmath23 ,   \\label{eq : w_nloc}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy of a neutrino propagating through plasma , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the averaged energies of plasma neutrinos and electrons correspondingly . in a particular case of a charge \n symmetric hot plasma , this expressions reproduces the result of refs . \n @xcite : @xmath27 the minus sign in  ( [ eq : w_early ] ) unambiguously shows that in the early universe the process of the radiative spin - flip transition is forbidden both for neutrinos and antineutrinos . \n the absolute value of the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) grows with the neutrino energy . \n it means that this contribution can be essential at ultra - high neutrino energies . \n to show manifestly that the case considered in the papers by studenikin et al . \n @xcite , with taking the additional left - handed neutrino energy @xmath6 in plasma and ignoring the photon dispersion , was really unphysical , let us consider the region of integration for the @xmath28 conversion width . in fig . \n [ fig : disp ] , the photon vacuum dispersion line @xmath29 is inside the allowed kinematical region ( left plot ) , but the plasma influenced photon dispersion curve appears to be outside , if the neutrino energy is not large enough ( right plot ) . \n conversion width with the fixed initial neutrino energy @xmath24 is inside the slanted rectangle shown by dashed line . \n the vacuum photon dispersion ( if the medium influence is ignored ) is shown by bold line in the left plot . \n the photon dispersion curve in plasma is shown by bold line in the right plot . \n , scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for the fixed plasma parameters , the threshold neutrino energy @xmath30 exists for coming of the dispersion curve into the allowed kinematical region . even for the interior of a neutron star this threshold \n neutrino energy is rather large : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the plasmon frequency . \n one could hope that the `` spin light of neutrino '' may be possible at ultra - high neutrino energies . \n however , in this case the local limit of the weak interaction is incomplete , and the non - local weak contribution into additional neutrino energy @xmath6 must be taken into account . \n this contribution has always a negative sign , and its absolute value grows with the neutrino energy . \n one could only hope that the window arises in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath33 . \n for example , in the solar interior there is no window for the process with electron neutrinos at all . \n a more detailed analysis of this subject was performed in our papers  @xcite . \n to construct the amplitudes of the fermion spin - flip conversion processes @xmath0 , it is necessary to know the solutions of the dirac equation including the matter effects . in the series of papers \n @xcite the authors declare that they have developed a powerful method of exact solutions of the modified dirac equations in matter . \n first of all , there is some progress in the last papers  @xcite with respect to the @xmath7 effect . \n namely , the five completely unphysical regions of parameters , which were discussed in details in the previous papers , are removed from the analysis , and only one case of an ultra - high neutrino energy is considered . \n however , an essential threshold effect is still not mentioned at all . \n an incorrect statement is repeated in  @xcite that our results  @xcite for the case of an ultra - high neutrino energy exactly reproduce the results of the authors  @xcite . \n in fact , the width for the process @xmath18 obtained in our papers  @xcite had much more general form being valid for arbitrary neutrino energies above the threshold , while the process width presented in  @xcite could be valid for the neutrino energies much greater than the threshold .    as in the previous papers , the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma is not taken into account in  @xcite , while it is essential at ultra - high neutrino energies . without this non - local weak contribution , the dirac equation in medium for a neutrino is approximate by definition , and the term of an `` exact solution '' becomes dubious .    making an attempt of constructing a new approach to the description of the neutrino and electron processes in matter , the authors  @xcite refer to the method of exact solutions developed for the processes in a strong external electromagnetic field . \n however , it is not a good justification . the strong field influence on the properties of charged particles is the essential non - perturbative effect where the analysis of the quantum processes , based just on exact solutions , is required . on the other hand , the matter influence on the neutrino and electron processes due to \n the weak interaction is essentially perturbative in any conceivable astrophysical conditions . \n moreover , the explicit form of the modified dirac equation is rather simple in the low - energy approximation only , when the modification is caused by the additional left - handed neutrino energy in the form  ( [ eq : enulgen ] ) calculated in the local limit of the weak interaction . as it was mentioned above , for high neutrino energies the non - local weak contribution  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) growing linearly with the neutrino energy , \n appears to be essential . and \n even this non - local term  ( [ eq : w_nloc ] ) is nothing but the result of the expansion of the @xmath6-boson propagator over the parameter @xmath34 . \n it is obvious that such an expansion has a physical sence for the neutrino energies @xmath35 tev . \n so , if one pretends to describe the additional left - handed neutrino energy in matter for the neutrino energies much higher the threshold energy  ( [ eq : threshold ] ) , an exact calculation is required without expanding the @xmath6-boson propagator . in this case \n the modified dirac equation should take the form of the integro - differential equation . \n without such an analysis , speculations on exact solutions of the modified dirac equation in matter have no ground . \n * we have shown that an approach based on a subtle effect of the medium influence on the neutrino dispersion , when the much more significant influence of the same medium on the photon dispersion is ignored , has no physical sense . * with the photon dispersion taken into account , the threshold neutrino energy exists for the process @xmath18 , which is very large . \n * at ultra - high neutrino energies , the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma must be taken into account . \n there arises the window ( if exists ) in the neutrino energies for the process to be kinematically opened , @xmath36 . \n * without the non - local weak contribution into the additional neutrino energy in plasma , the dirac equation in medium for a neutrino is approximate by definition , and the term of an `` exact solution '' becomes dubious . \n we thank s.i . \n blinnikov , m.i . \n vysotsky , v.a . \n novikov , l.b . \n okun for useful discussion . \n we express our deep gratitude to the organizers of the seminar `` quarks-2008 '' for warm hospitality . \n the work was supported in part by the council on grants by the president of the russian federation for the support of young russian scientists and leading scientific schools of russian federation under the grant no . \n nsh-497.2008.2 , and by the russian foundation for basic research under the grant no .  07 -

{"ContextTokens": 2333, "GeneratedTokens": 223, "SynthesizedBody": "it is now relatively well - established that @xmath650% of the present - day stellar mass has been formed since z=1 . \n most of this stellar mass has been formed in intermediate - mass galaxies ( 3@xmath7 to 3@xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath6l@xmath9 galaxies ) , as a result of strong star formation episodes during which galaxies take the appearance of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , see @xcite ) . \n however , it is still unclear what physical processes have driven this evolution . to this respect , \n internal kinematics of distant galaxies is a powerful tracer of the major processes governing star - formation and galaxy evolution in the early universe such as merging , accretion , and feedback related to star - formation and agn . robustly measuring the internal kinematics of distant galaxies \n is thus crucial for understanding how galaxies formed and evolved . \n a large program at vlt entitled images ( intermediate mass galaxy evolution sequence ) is aiming to derive both resolved kinematics and integrated properties from vlt / giraffe and fors2 for galaxies selected in the chandra deep field ( cdfs ) , and to combine these observations with deep and high quality images from hst / acs as well as with deep mid - ir photometry from spitzer / mips . \n this large program has now reached about 2/3 of its completion , and recently , 39 additional galaxies observed with giraffe have been analyzed @xcite . \n combined with previous observations during the gto @xcite , it leads to a sample of 74 galaxies , which represents so far the largest existing sample of resolved kinematics for distant galaxies . because in images we have deliberately selected @xmath10@xmath11 galaxies ( i.e. , with stellar masses larger than 1.5@xmath210@xmath3m@xmath4 ) , \n we assume a similar limit for the combined sample . it let us with a sample of 63 galaxies which is well representative of the luminosity function at z=0.4 - 0.75 . \n notice that the combined sample includes galaxies from 4 independent fields of view @xcite and is then unaffected by field - to - field variations within poisson statistics . within this redshift range , \n giraffe is able to recover the kinematics of almost all galaxies with @xmath12}})\\ge15$] . \n at large distances the spatial resolution is not sufficient to resolve the central regions of the galaxies . \n it implies that the observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) of a rotational body is the convolution of the actual random motions with the rotation . for a rotationally supported galaxy \n , it unavoidably leads to a well defined peak in the centre ( see fig . \n 1 ) . we have developed a classification scheme which allows us to compare any dispersion map to what it could be if it was a rotational disk @xcite . \n discrepancy from a rotational body can be measured from differences in amplitude and in position of the @xmath13 peak between the pseudo rotational @xmath13 map and the observed one , which leads to a very robust diagnostic diagram for the 63 observed galaxies @xcite .    among the 63 galaxies of the representative sample , we find 20 rotating disks ( 32% ) , \n 16 rotating disks with perturbations ( 25% ) and 27 galaxies with complex kinematics ( 43% , see fig . 1 and @xcite ) . \n within this classification , perturbed rotations correspond to a discrepant @xmath13 peak from expectations for a pure rotation . \n the complex kinematics class corresponds to objects for which the large scale motions are not aligned to the optical major axis , and show @xmath13 map very discrepant from expectations for a rotation ( see fig . \n among these 63 galaxies , 52 have multi - band hst / acs imaging . \n neichel et al . \n ( in prep . ) have constructed a new procedure to classify the morphology of distant galaxies . \n this procedure relies on two important ingredients which are the used of color maps ( which helps to overcome limitations due to k - morphological corrections ) and the use of a visual decision tree . \n this last ingredient is particularly important , as they have shown that automatic methods can overestimate the fraction of spirals by a factor of @xmath62 . \n they find a relatively good agreement between the two classifications : most of rotating disks are classified as spirals , while most of galaxies having complex kinematics show a peculiar morphology . \n combining morphology with spacially resolved kinematics allows us to study distant galaxies in very fine details : for the first time , we have recently detected a minor merger with a mass ratio of @xmath61:18 in a z@xmath60.6 galaxy classified as a perturbed rotator @xcite ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n such processes , which are predicted to be much more numerous than major mergers by numerical models , could provide us with a very plausible mecanism for explaining the kinematics of perturbed rotators . \n let us now consider a representative sample of intermediate mass galaxies : at z=0.6 , 60% of galaxies have @xmath14)\\ge15$]@xcite . \n let us assume that quiescent ( @xmath14)<15$] ) galaxy are either rotationally or dispersion supported , thus minimising the fraction of galaxies with anomalous kinematics . \n then our results imply that 42@xmath157% of z=0.4 - 0.75 galaxies have anomalous kinematics , including 26@xmath157% possessing complex kinematics . because up to 97% of local intermediate mass galaxies are \n either e , s0 or spirals @xcite , it is likely that the fraction of anomalous kinematics is close to a few percents today . \n this leads to an extremely rapid evolution of kinematical properties of galaxies , with about 10 times more complex kinematics about 6 gyr ago . \n the observed evolution of the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) provides us with a strong and independent confirmation . \n it has been suggested that galaxies with non - relaxed kinematics ( pr and ck ) are responsible for the very large dispersions of the tfr at high redshift @xcite . \n this result is confirmed by puech et al . \n ( in prep ) using the new sample of 63 galaxies : all the dispersion of the distant tfr can be accounted for by galaxies having non - relaxed kinematics . \n so it is beyond doubt that kinematics is among the most rapidly evolving properties of galaxies . \n which physical process could explain such a dramatic evolution ? \n anomalous kinematics are linked with strong variations of the specific angular momentum consistent with a random walk evolution due to merging between galaxies , as predicted by the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation @xcite . indeed , during a merger , and especially a major merger , galaxies pass through various stages during which the disk may be destroyed , generating significant discrepancies to the general behaviour of isolated rotating disks . \n we do find a strong evolution of the galaxy kinematics since z=0.6 , with a significant fraction of galaxies with complex kinematics . \n observations presented here tell us that major mergers could have played an important role in shaping galaxies as we observe them today . \n indeed many estimates of the merger rate found that a typical intermediate mass galaxy should have experienced 0.5 to 0.75 major merger since z= 1 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and most of them since z=2 - 3 . \n a scenario in which merging is the dominant physical process explains many evolutionary features since z=1 , including the number density evolution of lirgs and the emergence of galaxies with complex morphologies and with blue cores at z@xmath16 0.4 @xcite . \n it is moreover particularly in agreement with the fact that the milky way has had an exceptionally quiet merger history @xcite . \n present -

{"ContextTokens": 3861, "GeneratedTokens": 93, "SynthesizedBody": "in hadron - hadron collisions , production rates of collimated sprays of hadrons , called jets , are sensitive to both the dynamics of the fundamental interaction and to the partonic structure of the initial - state hadrons . \n the latter is usually parameterized in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the hadrons . \n thus measurements of jet production properties can be used to test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as well as to constrain the pdfs . \n because jet production has the largest cross - section of any high @xmath1 process at a hadron collider , the study of jet production provides the highest energy reach for the experiment and a unique sensitivity to new physics . \n several jet measurements are now well established at the tevatron , including the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section and of the angular and invariant mass dependencies of dijet events  @xcite . \n these measurements provide important tests of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and are input to pdf calculations . \n measurements of multi - jet production take advantage of the fact that these processes have the same pdf sensitivity as dijet production , but are sensitive to processes to third order in the strong coupling constant @xmath2 . \n fundamental to the understanding of order @xmath3 processes is the three - jet cross - section , which we present as a function of the invariant mass of the three - jet system . \n studies dedicated to the dynamics of the interaction are preferably based on observables which are insensitive to the pdfs . \n such observables can be constructed as ratios of cross sections for which the pdf sensitivity cancels . in this note \n we report a measurement of @xmath4 , the ratio of the inclusive three - jet to the inclusive 2-jet cross - sections .    in this note \n we present several recent results for the production of multijet final states in @xmath5 collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96  tev . \n these measurements , which include the cross -

up and multiple @xmath5 interactions . \n the jes correction is determined using the @xmath1 imbalance in @xmath14 jet and dijet events . the additional energy from pile - up and multiple interaction \n is determined from a minimum bias sample . \n the jes corrections are of the order of 50% for a jet energy of 50 gev and 20% for a jet energy of 400 gev . however , for the 0.7 pb@xmath6 data sample used for the measurements presented in this talk , collected with the d  detector during 20042005 in run  ii of the fermilab tevatron collider , the uncertainty on the jes is very small , less than 2% over jet @xmath1 s from 60 to 300 gev .     the fractional uncertainty from the jet energy scale ( jes ) for jets of cone size @xmath15 and central pseudorapidity . ]    for the sake of brevity , the reader is directed to reference  @xcite for a discussion of the inclusive jet cross section measurement , and reference  @xcite for the details on the extraction of the strong coupling constant from the inclusive jet cross section . \n of the variables that fully specify the kinematics of dijet production in hadron collisions , the dijet invariant mass @xmath16 and rapidity difference @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath18 ) probe the features of lo @xmath19 processes , while measurements of the azimuthal opening angle @xmath20 and ratio of transverse momenta @xmath21 can be used to determine the effect of higher -

{"ContextTokens": 3618, "GeneratedTokens": 357, "SynthesizedBody": "ngc  4833 is a southern globular cluster lying near the galactic plane in the constellation musca . \n its variable stars have not been studied in detail for nearly 35 years since observations by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) . \n the first survey of variable stars in the cluster s vicinity was done by bailey ( 1924 ) who found two variables , both of which are likely not cluster members . later studies revealed a total of 16 variables in the vicinity of the cluster ( wright 1941 ; sawyer - hogg 1973 ) . among these \n were the two variables found by bailey with most of the remaining being cluster variables , known today as rr lyrae variables . \n using photographic plates demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) did b and v photometry of the cluster identifying 24 variables and determined accurate periods for 15 rr lyrae variables . \n they concluded that the cluster was oosterhoff type ii ( oosterhoff 1939 ) . \n the most recent study was melbourne et al . \n they investigated extinction near ngc  4833 and determined the positions of the rr lyrae variables on a color - magnitude diagram but did not do time - series photometry . \n ngc  4833 is 6.6 kpc from the sun , has a core radius of 1.0 , and a half light radius of 2.41 which make it a relatively easy target for searching for and investigating its variable stars ( harris 1996 ) . \n given the lack of recent detailed study of the variables in ngc  4833 we added the cluster to our continuing program to study in detail a number of southern globular star clusters ( conroy et al . \n 2012 , toddy et al . \n 2012 ) . with the combination of ccd images , an observation window spanning more than 4 months , and an image subtraction package developed by alard ( 2000 ) \n , we are able to detect , analyze variable stars , and produce unprecedented high - quality light curves and periods for each variable . in this study \n we present the preliminary results of our observations of ngc  4833 including a color - magnitude diagram , as well as a bailey diagram , complete light curves , and periods for 27 variables , with 10 of them being newly identified . \n images of ngc 4833 were obtained during 14 nights between 30 january and 25 june , 2011 , using the southeastern association for research in astronomy ( sara ) 0.6 meter telescope located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory . in all , nearly 1700 images were obtained in the v - band . also , multicolor sequences were done on 9 march , 1 , 3 , and 6 may , 2011 , as a vri sequence on 9 march , and a bvri sequence on 1 , 3 , and 6 may . \n an apogee alta e6 camera was used for the observations with a 1024@xmath01024 pixel kodak kaf1001e chip , a gain of 1.5 electron per adu count , and an rms noise of 8.9 electrons . \n we used 1@xmath01 binning resulting in an image scale of 0.61/px resulting in a 10@xmath010 arcmin@xmath1 field of view . on all nights of observation \n , 120 second exposures were taken using a bessel v filter . \n the exposure time allowed us to detect dimmer variables but caused many of the brighter stars in the field to be overexposed . \n typical seeing ranged between 1.2 and 1.7 in the v - band . \n all images were debiased , flat - fielded , dark subtracted , and cleaned of hot , cold , and bad pixels . \n images were then analyzed using the isis2.2 package ( alard & lupton 1998 , alard 2000 ) . \n the package works by convolving the reference image shown in figure 1 , composed of a combination of the highest quality images obtained , to the point spread function of each individual image , then subtracting each image from the reference image to determine if any change in intensity has occurred . \n a resulting variable image identifies possible variables and is shown in figure 2 . \n a more detailed discussion of the method and how we used it is given elsewhere in this volume by toddy et al . \n ( 2012 ) .    . \n note that brightest stars in the image are overexposed . ] \n due to the more than 4-month observation span , we were able to determine the periods of most of the variables with periods less than 1 day to an accuracy of @xmath2 days . \n those variables exhibiting the blahko effect were less accurate due to modulation of their light curves ( blahko 1907 , smith 2004 ) . \n demers & wehlau s ( 1977 ) variables were identified visually and astrometrically and then confirmed by comparing their periods with our own . \n several of the variables identified by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) were outside the field of view of our images thus were not be observed . \n these include their variables v1 , v2 , v8 and v10 . \n we were not able to produce time - series photometry of two other variables , v9 and v16 . \n though they were in our field of view they were overexposed giants . \n lrc rrab & 10 & 0.69591 + rrc & 7 & 0.39555 + rre & 2 & 0.30950 + eclipsing & 2 & 0.32431 + sx phe & 6 & 0.05847                table 1 summarizes the results of our study . in total we detected 27 variables with 10 of them being newly identified . of the variables that were in our field of view and listed by demers & welhau ( 1977 ) we were able to identify all but two . \n the two that we did not detect happened to be overexposed . of the total we detected 6 \n were newly discovered sx phoenicis variables , 19 rr lyrae variables , and 2 eclipsing variables . \n table 2 gives the properties of each of the variables . \n the sx phoenicis variables are characterized by short periods and relatively low amplitudes . \n the mean period of the sx phoenicis variables is 0.05847 days , with a minimum of 0.04425 days and a maximum of 0.07191 days along with v amplitudes ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 magnitudes . \n these amplitudes are only estimates given that many of the sx phoenicis variables appear to be modulated and blended with other stars . \n nv5 was detected by isis only on 5 april . \n the others were detected on all of the nights . \n all of the sx phoenicis stars were within the half - mass radius ( 2.4 ) of the cluster as listed by harris ( 1996 ) . \n the phased light curves for the sx phoenicis stars are shown in figure 3 .        of the rr lyrae variables identified in the cluster 10 were rrab variables , with a mean period of 0.69591 days , 7 were rrc variables , with a mean period of 0.39555 days , and variable v20 which may be a second overtone ( rre ) variable previously noted by demers & wehlau ( 1977 ) . but given v20 s modulated light curve it may be a type rrd double - mode variable ( alcock et al . \n 1996 , bono et al . \n our newly discovered variable stars include a w ursae majoris star ( period of 0.3629 days ) , an rrab star ( period of 0.8740 days ) , another second overtone ( rre ) variable ( period of 0.3179 days ) , and an algol type binary star ( period of 0.7231 days ) . \n in total we identified 10 new variables in the cluster . \n the phased light curves for these variables are shown in figure 4 . \n in addition to the ratio of rrab to rrc lyrae variables the bailey diagram presented in figure 5 shows the cluster is of the oosterhoff type ii cluster . in this diagram \n the fitting formulae are from zorotovic et al . \n figure 5 also shows the two outlying rre variables , indicated by the open triangles . \n color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) are useful in determining cluster membership . to verify cluster membership we produced a color - magnitude diagram for ngc 4833 shown in figure 6 with the various types of variable stars indicated . to construct this diagram we combined 165 v band images , with an exposure of 120 seconds , and 175 r band images , with an exposure of 45 seconds . \n the images were obtained as part of a bvri color sequence on 9 march , 1 , 3 , and 6 may , 2011 . \n daophot was used to determine v and r magnitudes of the stars ( stetson 1987 ) . in the cmd shown in figure \n 6 rrab and rrc variables are indicated by the red and blue colored points , respectively . \n rrc variables tend to lie on the warmer ( left ) side of the instability strip whereas rrab variables are to the cooler ( right ) of the instability strip . \n scatter in the variables is partly due to blending of the variables with other stars , our averaging of several hundred images before using daophot , and possible variable reddening in the direction of the cluster . \n we assumed fixed atmospheric extinction coefficients for each color and for all nights . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of the rr lyrae variables only one , v15 , appears to be a blend . \n v15 is shown in figure 6 as the hollow red square to the right of the instability strip . \n other than this errant variable the remainder appear near the instability strip . \n in addition to blending there is significant extinction across the cluster . \n the e(b -

{"ContextTokens": 3436, "GeneratedTokens": 267, "SynthesizedBody": "whether the first direct gravitational wave ( gw ) detection will be made during the forthcoming joint ligo - virgo @xcite run , or rather will be claimed by the next generation of interferometers , the intriguing era of gravitational wave astronomy is in any case expected to begin .    in this perspective , \n spherical resonant detectors , having the capability of locating on their own the gravitational wave source in the sky , may represent an important resource for this arising discipline . \n contrarily to an interferometer , a sphere is a multichannel detector capable in principle to determine all the four parameters characterizing a gw ( two angles for the arrival direction , and the amplitudes of the two polarizations ) ; in order to deal with this distinguishing feature , several data analysis issues must be however tackled ( see @xcite- @xcite for an incomplete but elucidating historical perspective ) .    in @xcite and \n @xcite a coherent burst search algorithm has been proposed , that fully exploits the multichannel capabilities of the sphere by transforming the detector s outputs into a five - dimensional time series corresponding to the spheroidal components of the gravitational wave . \n this time series is in turn processed by a coherent , wavelet - based module @xcite ( henceforth cws , as coherent waveburst for the sphere ) generating a list of candidate burst events endowed with all the relevant parameters ( arrival time , arrival direction , amplitude , etc ... ) and is also able , to some extent , to reject non - transverse excitations ( which are surely not due to gw s ) , thus reducing the false alarm rate by a factor of about 10 . \n the reason of using wavelets rather than the traditional matched filter(mf)-ing technique is two - fold . \n mf - based searches are computationally expensive , as they require the exploration of a parameter space which is made extremely large by the presence of several channels ( for example , the multichannel mf is direction dependent , differently from the traditional single channel one ) . \n moreover wavelet - based searches , contrarily to a mf one , do not require any detailed prior knowledge of a signal , a very welcome feature for an unmodeled burst search such as the one developed in @xcite . \n + on the other hand , as the use of the mf is known to give the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite , the wavelets flexibility has a cost in term of accuracy in the determination of the burst parameters .    to this respect , \n the present work can be considered as a natural evolution of @xcite in that it implements a multidimensional coherent mf as a follow - up of the method cited above . \n this hierarchical strategy is crucial in reducing the parameters space because for each trigger only a little region is explored around the values indicated by the cws module , thus making the whole procedure reasonably fast . \n the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ apip ] the whole pipeline is briefly described , showing in particular how the mf module is interfaced to the previous part of the analysis chain ; then in section [ resu ] the improved method is tested against the same mock data sets ( software injections of signals on a background endowed with both gaussian and non - gaussian noise , generated on the basis of a numerical simulation of the relevant components of the detector ) , thus showing the improvements obtained in the parameters estimation . \n finally , section [ conc ] contains our conclusions . \n the first part of the pipeline , which is exhaustively discussed in @xcite and @xcite , will be just briefly summarized here , leaving aside many technical details . \n the first step consists in converting the six transducers outputs @xmath4 into five channels corresponding to the 5 quadrupolar modes @xmath5 of the gw tensor @xmath6 : @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the components of the real spherical harmonics @xmath10 ( defined and normalized as in @xcite ) , @xmath11 denotes the cartesian component of the tensor spherical harmonics and @xmath12 is the versor of the arrival direction of the gw . \n this conversion allows to extract the information about the gw from the detector s outputs ( or , equivalently , to express its noisy content in term of its  gw - equivalent \" ) and is possible once a mathematical model for the detector is available . in the case at hand , \n the model consists of a set of coupled oscillators describing the dynamics of the relevant sphere vibrational modes , of the transducers , and of the electrical circuit that are at the core of the readout devices ( see @xcite for details ) . \n the next step is to combine the fourier transforms of the five @xmath5 channels into a single channel @xmath13 : @xmath14 this process is performed by extracting from the dataset the spectral density matrix , defined from @xmath15 and then by building the following quantity : @xmath16    this quantity is then fed into the cws algorithm , which is a modified version of the coherent waveburst algorithm developed for ligo ( @xcite-@xcite ) , that has been adapted to our computational needs ( a standard macpro machine with two 3ghz processors ) and to our detector configuration . \n this algorithm provides a list of triggers containing the various event features ( central time of events , amplitude , arrival direction , central spectral frequency and spectral frequency spread ) . \n the trigger list is finally further refined through an independent determination of the arrival direction ( the so - called determinant method ) , and a trigger is vetoed when the two reconstructed directions are not compatible . \n to summarize : @xmath17      if the time dependence , arrival direction and polarization of the gw signal were known , that is if the expression for the five functions @xmath18 were available , the optimal detection strategy would be to perform a multidimensional matched filter . as explained in @xcite , the multichannel mf consists in analyzing the following scalar channel : @xmath19 and is the strategy which gives the optimal snr @xmath20 for the given signal @xmath21 . \n the integrals are done on both positive and negative frequencies . however , in a real experimental situation @xmath21 is not known a priori and to employ efficiently a mf one should explore a huge number of points in a parameter space describing the temporal profile of the signal , as well as the arrival direction and polarization . thus the use of a mf in such a context is computationally very demanding .    the cws method exposed in the previous paragraph has been shown to find candidate events with a good efficiency / reliability ratio , without need to know the form of the signal . \n this allows to keep under control the computation time but of course it comes at a price for what concerns parameter estimation . \n the improvement we are introducing in this work consists in performing a multidimensional mf only in the time segments where candidates events have been selected by the cws , and to restrict the analysis to a small portion of parameter space centered around the parameters provided by the cws triggers .    specifically , we consider a two parameter family of sine - gaussian shapes to describe the time profile of the signal @xmath22 \n y_{m_n}^{(2)}(\\theta,\\phi)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] impinging from the generic direction characterized by polar angles @xmath23 . \n since we have verified that the unmodeled search alone already gives a good estimation of the frequency spread @xmath24 ( an estimation which is not improved by the mf procedure ) , we kept it as fixed , in such a way that , for each candidate event we are basically exploring a small portion of the 4-dimensional parameter space @xmath25 . \n such a space is explored through a maximum - seeking algorithm , which searches for the point characterized by the maximum snr . \n we maximized first on the arrival time , as the peak of the snr is very sharp against this parameter , then on the central frequency and finally over the two angles of the arrival direction together , keeping at each stage the other parameters fixed at the value indicated by the cws triggers . \n this is a simplified choice of course , with respect to building a full parameter template bank , for instance , but it allows to obtain good results while keeping a low computational burden \n .    once found , the maximum - snr point in the parameter space defines the improved parameters of the candidate event , and if they happen to be too much different from the ones given by the unmodeled search , the event is discarded as spurious . \n this means that the mf follow - up procedure , as well as improving the events parameters , acts as a further veto against non - gw triggers , i.e. against signals which are not compatible with the transverse - traceless nature of gw s . \n such false triggers can come from gaussian noise or from non - gaussian disturbancies . \n the cws method alone is already optimized to reduce the latter s , and we will show that the application of the mf follow - up improves the performance with respect to the rejection of false triggers due to gaussian noise . \n we have tested the mf method on the triggers obtained in @xcite , i.e. 50 gw - injections , ( 25 for each polarization ) for each of the four @xmath26 amplitudes : @xmath27 and also on an equal number of non - gw injections ( signals whose power has been distributed randomly among the five sphere channels ) with the same amplitude . \n the injected signals are sine - gaussian of the same type of the matching function given in ( [ singau ] ) , this allows us to assess the precision in parameter estimation irrespectively of a mismatch between the filter and the signal in the data . \n an eventual mismatch could of course worsen the estimations , but we do not investigate here on that .    for the sake of clarity , we have reported in table [ gwnongw ] the detection efficiency for both gw and non gw - injections obtained in @xcite ; these numbers , which show that the cws alone already reduces by a factor of 5 - 10 the number of non - gaussian false triggers , have not changed in the present analysis \n .    .detection efficiency for injected gw signals and non - gw disturbances . adapted from @xcite . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n matched filtering techniques are widely used in gravitational wave analysis . however \n they can have a high computational cost , because of the possibly large volume of parameter space required by a comprehensive search . \n the case of spherical detector is even worse as its multimode feature makes it highly sensitive to the arrival direction , adding the source position in the sky as further parameter . \n + here we have shown how , in the case of burst searches , combining an unmodeled search with a matched one can exploit the goodies of both while taming the baddies of both . \n the unmodeled makes no assumption on the type of signal , but gives a non - optimal estimation of the parameters of the burst events triggered . \n on the other hand the matched filtered search is optimal once the shape of the signal is known . here \n we use the output triggers of the unmodeled search to massively restrict the search in the parameter of the best matching template ; more specifically we used a 4-dimensional parameter space ( arrival time , central frequency and source angles in the sky ) to present an example of matched filtering search . \n our search is very much simplified with respect to a general one as the parameter space is not fully explored . \n + to make a comprehensive analysis one would need template banks and systematic scanning of the parameter space , but even with this primitive attempt we have shown how the first estimate made by the unmodeled search can be improved by a very light matched filter search . \n it is a pleasure to thank m. maggiore and m. pohl for useful discussions and encouragement . \n the work of fs is supported by the fond national suisse . \n 99        c.  z.  zhou and p.  f.  michelson , phys \n .  rev . \n d * 51 * ( 1995 ) 2517 . \n e.  coccia , j.  a.  lobo and j.  a.  ortega , phys . \n d * 52 * , 3735 ( 1995 ) . \n j.  a.  lobo and m.  a.  serrano , europhys . \n lett .   * 35 * , 253 ( 1996 ) . \n t.  r.  stevenson , phys . \n d * 56 * ( 1997 ) 564 . \n s.  m.  merkowitz and w.  w.  johnson , phys . \n d * 56 * ( 1997 ) 7513 [ arxiv : gr -

oppenheimer approximation . \n so far all precise theoretical predictions of ps@xmath2 properties have relied on variational calculations .    in the present paper \n we explore a different approach to computing the wave function and the binding energy of ps@xmath2 . \n we use dimensional scaling ( ds ) method , in which the dimensionality of space @xmath3 is a variable . \n we focus on the limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 . a precise result for @xmath6 \n may be obtained by interpolating between the two limits using perturbation theory in @xmath7 . \n the advantage of ds is that the two limits of the schrdinger equation often have relatively simple solutions . \n full inter -

periodic boundary conditions , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not yet been solved . \n we present a derivation of a one dimensional integral equation for the solution to this problem , analogous to the helium case treated by rosenthal @xcite . \n the time independent schrdinger equation for the relative motion of @xmath16 takes the dimensionless form @xmath17 -\\frac{1}{r_1}-\\frac{1}{r_2}+\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\psi = \\varepsilon\\psi , \\label{eq : schrodeqexplicit}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron -

{"ContextTokens": 2637, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "a recent frontier in physics is to investigate organic and living matter , trying to formulate models able to capture their main features . \n this investigation has the double mark of being in itself interesting due to the lack of knowledge in the subject and of exploiting wide potentialities in the production of a new generation of electronic devices . as a matter of fact \n , some specific tasks of sensing protein can be reproduced in artificial devices to improve their performances . \n it is the case of nano - biosensors which aim to mimic _ in vitro _ the peculiar sensing abilities shown _ in vivo _ by proteins and organic materials . \n accordingly , much attention has been devoted to transmembrane proteins ( tmps ) , which interface external and internal cell environments . \n specifically , tmps are proteins consisting of one or several helices crossing the cell membrane and able to modify their structure when capturing a specific molecule or a small protein ( ligand ) . among available experiments , here we report on those performed on two different seven - helix tmps , bacteriorhodopsin ( br ) and proteorhodopsin ( pr ) , proteins able to transform energy coming by light in energy useful for the cell survival . \n therefore , they appear very interesting to work out bio - solar - cells and/or bio - diodes . to this purpose , \n recent measurements on the electrical properties of br and pr have revealed the possibility to use them _ in vitro _ like organic transistors . in particular , they are almost insulators at the lowest values of the applied bias , and their conductance suddenly increases for orders of magnitude , above some threshold value where they enter a sharp super - ohmic regime . furthermore , in the presence of green light , i.e. after a conformational change , the conductance exhibits a further increase above the dark value , thus confirming the hypothesis of a structure - mediated charge transfer .    to provide a microscopic model of the main features described above \n , we developed a numerical approach based on the analogy between a single protein and an impedance network . \n the charge transport is obtained by introducing a procedure of stochastic changes of the network impedances . \n the investigations are performed on the br , whose current - voltage ( i - v ) responses were carried out on a wide range of applied voltages @xcite , then extended to pr @xcite , on which experiments are only at the preliminary stage of low applied bias . \n former experiments were carried out on br , probably the best known protein in the seven - helix tmp family . \n samples of br in its natural membrane were used in a metal - insulator - metal structure @xcite and their i - v characteristics measured in dark @xcite and also in green light @xcite . \n the samples exhibited a small conductivity ( less than 1 ps / cm ) at low applied field . \n this conductivity was found to increase as the protein sample is irradiated with green light and/or when the electrical field overcomes a critical value . in particular , green light produces a higher current with respect to dark conditions , as a consequence of the modification of the chromophore - opsin complex @xcite . \n the super - linear i - v characteristics point toward a tunneling charge - transfer mechanism @xcite . in particular , a transition between a direct tunneling ( dt ) regime and a fowler - nordheim ( fn ) tunneling regime is revealed ( see ) \n . first measurements of i - v characteristics in pr were reported in ref . \n the experiment was performed on a thin - film device with a contact distance of 50 @xmath0 , just about @xmath1 times longer than the br nanolayers used in the previous experiments @xcite . \n the film was obtained by dehydrating pr in a buffer solution . \n the protein activity after dehydration was tested by absorbtion measurements that confirmed the preservation of the structure and the function after the treatment . \n accordingly , the experiments performed on br and pr evidence the possibility to obtain , _ in vitro _ like so _ in vivo _ , a significant photocurrent , a result of great interest for optoelectronic applications .            following the indication of experiments @xcite , \n we assume that charge transfer through the amino acids of the single protein is the main mechanism of transport . \n therefore , a microscopic interpretation of experiments is given in terms of the single protein electrical properties , taken as intrinsic characteristics of the protein morphology . \n to this purpose we make use of the impedance network protein analogous ( inpa ) technique already detailed in @xcite . in short , each protein is associated with a topological network , consisting of nodes and links , as pictured in . \n each node corresponds to a single amino acid , and its position is taken as that of the related @xmath2 atom @xcite . \n each couple of nodes is connected with a link when their distance is less than an assigned interaction radius , @xmath3 ( usually in the range @xmath4  ) , so that the network captures the protein topology . \n the graph turns into an impedance network when an elemental impedance is associated with each link . in the present case of a static response \n only resistances are considered . \n accordingly , the elemental resistance between the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th nodes , say , @xmath7 is taken as @xcite : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , is the cross - sectional area between the spheres centered on the @xmath10 nodes , respectively , @xmath11 is the distance between these nodes , @xmath12 is the resistivity . by positioning the input and \n output electrical contacts on the first and last node , respectively , for a given applied bias the network is solved within a linear kirchhoff scheme . by construction , this network produces a parameter - dependent static i - v characteristic . to account for the super - linear current at increasing applied voltages , a tunneling mechanism of charge transfer \n is included by using a stochastic approach within a monte carlo scheme@xcite . in particular , \n the resistivity value of each link is chosen between a low value @xmath13 , taken to fit the current at the highest voltages , and a high value @xmath14 , which depends on the voltage drop between network nodes as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the maximum resistivity value taken to fit the i -

conductance , @xmath27 , is calculated over a large ensemble of configurations , and is taken as a measurable global - quantity and order parameter in recent investigations @xcite . as a further step , \n the conductance fluctuations which emerge as a result of the same numerical simulations are estimated . \n indeed , these fluctuations are essential to determine the average value of the global quantity @xmath28 since they are particularly high close to the transition between the dt and fn regimes , as generally expected near to a phase transition . \n indeed , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of these fluctuations , normalized to its first and second moment , is found to be well described by the generalized gumbel distribution , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a positive number , @xmath32 the variance , @xmath33 with @xmath34 . \n furthermore , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 indicating the gamma , digamma and trigamma function , respectively . finally , @xmath29 is a normalized pdf with zero mean and unitary variance ; it is a skewed function , recently used to describe finite - size systems in both critical and not critical conditions @xcite . \n the numerical value of the shaping parameter @xmath31 is related to the system internal dynamic @xcite . in the present case , the lack of a gaussian behaviour is due to the existence of a low and upper bound on the conductance values @xcite . \n the values of @xmath31 which , in a wide range of applied bias , better describe the pdfs for br and pr , are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( see ) . \n integer values of @xmath31 allow to interpret the @xmath29 as the distribution of the @xmath31-th minimum / maximum of the independent variables , i.e. @xmath39 should be correlated with the existence of a single dominant conductance value . otherwise , the interpretation of on integer @xmath31 value remains an open question . \n microscopic investigations of the i -

mass late - type donor transferring mass onto a neutron star at a rather high rate . \n the modulation arises from x - ray heating of the donor star , which also manifests as narrow emission lines of niii and ciii moving in phase with the donor star @xcite . \n @xcite obtained the period of @xmath0days quite remarkably by examining archival photographic plates from 1889 to 1974 . \n a sinusoidal modulation of full amplitude around 0.20.3mag was found in several independent datasets , with considerable scatter around the mean curve @xcite . \n while the long baseline of photographic observations defined the period to incredible precision , the sparse sampling left a plethora of aliases , and @xcite identified strong signals at one - day , one - month , and one - year aliases of their favored period . \n of these , the one - year alias has been by far the hardest to reject . \n several subsequent photometric studies reproduced the modulation , but none improved the ephemeris , or resolved the one - year alias issue @xcite    spectroscopic confirmation of this period was suggested by @xcite and @xcite , and demonstrated conclusively by @xcite , who found a period of @xmath1days , and again by @xcite . \n both of these works performed a period search on the data , but in both cases the frequency resolution was limited by only observing over a baseline of a week . \n other spectroscopic analyses of these and other data have also found variations at this period , @xcite , but no other groups have performed a rigorous independent period search . \n several groups also searched for the orbital period in x - ray data , with initially no success @xcite . \n the only positive detection of an orbital period in x - rays came from @xcite based on a multi - year _ \n rxte_/asm dataset . \n they did not find exactly the @xcite period , but instead the one - year alias ( 0.78893days ) with a modulation around 1% . \n given the intensive multi - year coverage of _ rxte _ this is surprising , since this dataset should not be susceptible to the one - year alias problem . \n @xcite therefore claimed that their period was the true orbital period and that @xcite had misidentified the alias . \n while this result was tantalizing , @xcite could not reproduce this period using a larger _ rxte _ dataset . \n they did , however , not use as sophisticated an analysis as @xcite , leaving open the possibility that the x - ray period could be real . \n surprisingly , then , fifty years after discovery of the prototypical lmxb sco  x-1 , there remain doubts about its most fundamental parameter , the orbital period . \n while the original optical ephemeris of @xcite has remained the standard reference for the 37years since its publication , it remains to be resolved whether this , or the x - ray period of @xcite , is the true orbital period . to attempt to resolve these questions , and update the ephemeris of sco  x-1 with modern data , we examine here archival photometry from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) \n this nine year dataset has both the long baseline to determine a precise period , and coverage of a large enough fraction of a year to finally break the one - year alias problem using optical data . \n the all sky automated survey ( asas ) monitored sco  x-1 from 2001 to 2009 @xcite . we note that while sco  x-1 was not included in the asas catalog of variable stars ( acvs ) its photometry is in the asas-3 photometric @xmath2 band catalog in two datasets , 1619551538.4 and 1619551538.5 . \n the sco x-1 datasets include 640 observations from 2001 january 22 to 2009 october 5 . with multiyear coverage spanning typically about 270days of the year , it is ideally suited for obtaining an updated ephemeris and breaking the one - year alias . \n we performed our analysis for a range of choices of data grades and apertures to optimize our filter criteria . for final analysis , we retained the 567 grade a or b observations , and used the smallest asas aperture . \n inclusion of grade c or worse data , or use of larger aperture data , significantly reduced the quality of the fits . \n to determine the orbital period we performed a sinuoidal fit to the data points . since the scatter around the model is dominated by intrinsic flickering rather than photometric uncertainties , we assigned a mean uncertainty of 0.30mag to each point to represent the flickering . \n this was chosen to produce a minimum @xmath3 equal to the number of degrees of freedom . \n we then evaluated sinusoidal fits over a range of trial periods . for each period the best - fitting mean magnitude , amplitude , and phasing were determined using the downhill simplex algorithm @xcite . \n we show the results in the vicinity of the disputed periods in fig . \n [ periodfig ] .     as a function of trial period for sinusoidal fits to asas data . \n we show the @xcite period of 0.787313days and the @xcite period of 0.78893days for comparison . \n we also show calculated one - year aliases of the preferred period at 0.78562 and 0.78901days . \n the @xcite period is strongly favored by the asas data . while some signal is seen at the alternative periods , all are rejected at greater than 5-@xmath4 confidence.,width=336 ]    we see that the @xcite period is reproduced exactly to within the limits of our frequency resolution . our formal best period is @xmath5days . \n the uncertainty quoted is a formal 1-@xmath4 error determined from the @xmath6 confidence range in period . \n we verified the uncertainty using the bootstrap method with 30 resamplings of the data . \n this gave a consistent 1-@xmath4 uncertainty ( @xmath7 ) . \n we also show the period of @xcite , and the one - year aliases with which they associated it . \n we find that none of these alternatives are consistent with the asas data , and all can be rejected at better than 5-@xmath4 confidence . \n we therefore can not directly improve on the period of @xcite using the asas data , which is not surprising as that used data drawn from nearly a hundred year baseline . \n we can , however , overcome the limitation of that dataset in its vulnerability to one - year aliases , as the asas data has much wider coverage within a year . \n using the same @xmath3 approach , we determine a mean time of minimum of @xmath8 . \n this corresponds to an offset of very close to 17057 cycles from the time of minimum of @xcite . \n if we project their time of minimum forwards we predict @xmath9 , with equal contributions to the uncertainty from their time of minimum ( quoted as 0.022 cycles ) and their period ( @xmath10days ) . \n our time of minimum is completely consistent with theirs ( a remarkable testament to the accuracy of their historical ephemeris ) , but at this point our modern measurement of the time is somewhat better constrained for use with modern data .    finally , we show in figure  [ lightcurvefig ] the asas lightcurve folded on our derived ephemeris , together with the best fitting sine wave . \n the mean @xmath2 band brightness is 12.63 , and the full - amplitude is 0.26mag , comparable to that found by @xcite and @xcite . \n we have established that in optical photometry the 0.787313day period produces a stable modulation over 120years of observation . \n the ephemeris of @xcite reliably and precisely predicts the time of minimum in the asas data , over 17,000 intervening cycles . \n it is hard to imagine any clock other than the orbital period providing this stability . \n this has to be the true orbital period . \n the question then arises as to what , if anything , @xcite detected . \n we of course should allow that it was a spurious detection , until it can be reproduced with data from the remainder of the _ rxte _ mission . \n @xcite failed to reproduce it , but also did not use all the techniques that @xcite used . associating it with an alias of the true orbital period seems unlikely , as _ \n rxte_/asm data on sco  x-1 are rather well sampled through the year ( just as asas data are ) \n .    one possible explanation might be if the x - ray signal came at the beat frequency between the orbital period and a superorbital period of around a year . \n many x - ray binaries have indeed shown super - orbital periods of tens to hundreds of days ( see e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , although typically all are shorter than a year . \n the only claim of such a long period in sco  x-1 , came from early _ \n rxte_/asm data , from which @xcite suggested a 37day period . \n this detection has not been sustained in subsequent data , and no super - orbital period was found by @xcite in _ swift_/bat data . on longer timescales , @xcite and @xcite both independently suggested a @xmath11year x - ray modulation is present in _ rxte_/asm data , although this is too long to account for the @xcite period . \n this explanation therefore seems unlikely , and it remains to be seen if the x - ray period can be reproduced from the full _ rxte _ mission - long dataset . \n we have analyzed asas data of sco  x-1 spanning nine years . \n we can confirm the period of @xcite , while rejecting its one - year aliases , and also the putative x - ray period of @xcite . \n our updated ephemeris is @xmath12 .", "StartTimeOffset": 610730627219, "RequestID": "5ac4bfba58654e028af36a547e7ac50c", "TotalTokens": 2671}

? ? \n * ) . in the ssc case , we find @xmath21 , @xmath22 g and a size of @xmath23 , which leads to an electron density @xmath24@xmath25 . \n these values for the electron density and the magnetic field are two - three orders of magnitude higher than the electron densities and magnetic fields in the inner accretion flow @xcite . \n the `` cooling break synchrotron '' model allows parameters more natural to the inner accretion flow . in this scenario \n the x - ray flare is also synchrotron radiation and there is a break in the synchrotron spectrum between ir and x - ray wavelengths due to the onset of dominant synchrotron cooling which causes a change in spectral index of @xmath26 . for the kinds of magnetic fields expected in the inner regions of the accretion flow of @xmath27 to @xmath28 g @xcite , x - ray emitting electrons \n cool fast on the dynamical timescale while nir - emitting electrons cool slowly , so a cooling break between these wavelengths is very natural . since both nir and x - ray are optically thin synchrotron , we can not obtain a constraint on the size of the flaring region as we did for the inverse compton scenarios , except by requiring the _ absence _ of an inverse compton contribution to the x - ray luminosity ( for reasonable parameters the inverse compton spectra are blue in the x - ray range , and if they contributed the x - ray spectral index would not be red as observed ) . in a companion paper , \n @xcite have shown the ic / ssc components do not contribute for reasonable sizes and electron densities . \n we have also carried out detailed numerical calculations which confirm the above constraints on the physical conditions in the region where the flare occurs @xcite . \n the constraints we have outlined are of course not valid if the true spectral index of the nir is @xmath29 rather than @xmath8 . \n however , models where the synchrotron peak occurs at frequencies @xmath30 are not within the 90% parameter confidence region when fitting our numerical models to the nir and x - ray data ( we fit the models and derived confidence regions using the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec ) . furthermore , blue indices ( @xmath8 ) for intermediate to bright emission from sgr a * are favoured not just by our observational constraint on the mir - nir spectral index , but by evidence from other observations as well @xcite . \n there is much still to learn from the spectacular multiwavelength observation of april 4 , 2007 . \n the simultaneous lightcurves show intriguing differences : the l-band lightcurve is broader ( has longer duration ) than the x - ray lightcurve , and it also has pronounced substructures while the x - ray lightcurve is comparatively smooth . \n these properties are not straightforward to understand in the context of any emission model . in the ssc scenario \n a shorter duration x - ray flare can arise naturally without changes in the magnetic field , due to the quadratic dependence of the ssc luminosity on the synchrotron luminosity , but there is no obvious solution to the substructure problem . for the cooling break synchrotron and the submm ic models fluctuations in magnetic field \n together with a general decrease in magnetic field during the flare could explain the substructure and duration problems , since in both cases the nir emission is dependent on the magnetic field while the x - ray emission is not . \n taking the spectral properties also into account , so far the cooling break synchrotron model appears to be the most promising model to explain the april 4 , 2007 flare . \n time dependent modeling of the lightcurves will give us further insights into the flare mechanism and the dynamics of their production . \n baganoff , f. k. et al . \n 2001 , nature , 413 , 45 dodds - eden , k. , et al . \n 2009 , , 698 , 676 doeleman , s.  s. , et al . \n 2008 , , 455 , 78 eckart , a. , et al . \n 2004 , , 427 , 1 eckart , a. et al . \n 2006 , , 455 , 1 eckart , a. , et al . \n 2009 , , 500 , 935 genzel , r. et al . \n 2003 , nature , 425 , 934 gillessen , s. , et al . \n 2006 , , 640 , l163 hornstein et al . \n 2007 , , 667 , 900 marrone , d. p. et al . \n 2008 , , 682 , 373 porquet , d. et al . \n 2003 , , 407 , l17 porquet , d. et al . \n 2008 , , 488 , 549 trap et al . \n 2010 , adv . \n space res . \n , 45 , 507 yusef - zadeh , f. , et al . \n 2006 , , 650 , 189 yusef - zadeh , f. et al . \n 2008 , , 682 , 361 yusef - zadeh , f. , et al . \n 2009 , , 706 , 348 yuan , f. , quataert , e. , & narayan , r.  2003 , , 598 , 301", "StartTimeOffset": 638876461988, "RequestID": "3a74733c6e9b4f34a6b16f2e6fec725c", "TotalTokens": 2765}

[ fig1 ] ) . \n in such a way we can reconstruct the direction , energy and x@xmath5 of the showers at the most extreme energies . \n the identification of the direction of arrival jointly with a proper energy reconstruction is mandatory for anisotropy studies , while the possibility to measure the longitudinal profile of the shower is needed to constrain the average mass at 10@xmath6 ev . \n another big advantage of this technique with respect to ground based detectors is the uniformity of the sky coverage : jem  euso at 400 km can orbit every 90 minutes the entire earth covering both hemispheres with good uniformity . \n the main scientific objectives of the project are : the study of the anisotropies at the extreme energies with unprecedented statistics , the identification of the sources ( and possibly the reconstruction of their spectra ) and the high statistics measurement of the trans  gzk spectrum @xcite . \n we define moreover several other exploratory objectives : the search of uhe neutrinos , the search of uhe gamma photons and the study of the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields through the measurement of the magnetic point spread function of a source . \n the nature of the detector allows also to study other phenomena like tles , lightnings , the airglow , auroras , meteors , space debris , bioluminescence in the oceans and to search ( or put limits on the flux of ) hypothetical phenomena like nuclearites . \n jem  euso is a refractor consisting of a system of 3 fresnel lenses focusing the light on the focal surface @xcite . \n the focal surface is made by @xmath2 5000 multi anode photomultipliers ( mapmt ) produced by hamamatsu ( r11265m64 ) capable of single photon counting with a double pulse resolution of the order of @xmath2 10

is making a photo detection module ( pdm ) . \n the electronics is modular in order to guarantee high redundancy and organized in several levels : the spaciroc asic for the front end electronics , an fpga for the pdm  level electronics , the cluster control board and the central cpu . \n the front end electronics counts the photoelectrons within a gate time unit ( gtu ) window of 2.5 microseconds \n . the trigger is organized hierarchically and has the challenging task to reduce the trigger rate from @xmath2 100 gb / s down to the 3 gb / day allowed by the telemetry , still keeping the physical events . \n the high complexity and risk of this mission demands the development of several pathfinders . \n we will present here all of them : euso  ta \n which is taking data at the black rock mesa ( brm ) site of the telescope array ( ta ) observatory , the euso  balloon ( operated by cnes ) which flew in august 2014 , euso  spb which is foreseen to fly in spring 2017 on a nasa super pressure balloon ( spb ) to detect crs and finally mini  euso , the first space prototype to be launched on the iss within 2017 , whose main goal is to measure the airglow and several atmospheric phenomena visible from space . to conclude \n , we will present the k  euso detector , which is capable of doing uhecr science from space and is foreseen to fly on the iss by the year 2020 . \n euso  ta is a pathfinder of the jem \n euso detector @xcite which is taking data at the brm site of the ta observatory in utah ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n this detector consists of two square fresnel lenses which measure @xmath2 1 m side and a single pdm of @xmath2 16 cm side . \n the detector is pointing to the sky , overlapping with the ta field of view . \n each of the 2304 pixels is covering @xmath2 0.18@xmath70.18 degrees@xmath8 . \n the elevation of the telescope can be changed from 0 to 25 degrees . \n the purpose of this pathfinder is the detection of crs in coincidence with ta . \n the trigger signal of ta is therefore used as an external trigger and the acquisition of a packet of 128 gtus is started in coincidence with the ta trigger . \n ta is detecting in this way several cr events ( one example in fig . \n [ fig4 ] ) . \n another purpose was the calibration of the detector , also relative to ta . \n we used the ta central laser facility ( clf ) and other dedicated mobile laser sources to test the technology with events reproducing the kinematics of cr events . \n the laser is shot up in the sky and the scattered light was detected by euso \n ta in such a way as to mimic the signal of a cosmic ray shower . \n we also used flashers , flat screens , leds to perform a complete characterization of the instrument . \n ev . the event is falling 2.6 km away and euso \n ta sees with magnified resolution a part of the shower.,width=245 ]    we also detected meteors , lightnings , planes and clouds and therefore we tested the detection and the analysis of such events for jem  euso . \n ta detector could be also used to develop the jem \n euso autonomous trigger . \n indeed euso \n ta data have been used offline to test and optimize the trigger algorithms . as a further step , \n the pdm board with the autonomous trigger was installed on the euso \n ta detector and the trigger has been tested online on laser events . \n the trigger performances are compliant with the expectations . \n euso  balloon is a cnes stratospheric balloon pathfinder of the jem \n euso mission , which flew on august 25@xmath9 2014 from timmins canada ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . \n the purpose of this pathfinder was to test the jem \n euso technology in space environment and to test the response of the detector with respect to several artificial cr events @xcite . \n the detector consisted of a system of two square , 1 m side fresnel lenses and of a single pdm . \n the flight lasted one night and has successfully proven the capability of the detector to operate in stratospheric conditions ( 38 km altitude ) . \n unexpectedly the detector landed in water also proving the water tightness of the instrument . \n the fov was 8 @xmath7 8 km@xmath8 and each single pixel covered a projected area 120 @xmath7 120 m@xmath8 on the ground . \n the balloon covered the distance of roughly 100 km passing over different landscapes including forest lakes , cities , clear and cloudy sky . \n 2014 . in the box : the integrated image of a laser shot together with the flasher and led.,width=321 ]    during the flight the balloon was followed at 3,000 m altitude by an helicopter which was equipped with a flasher , a led and a laser to generate artificial light events ( see one example in fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n we could therefore detect several hundreds artificial events which were used to test the electronics . \n we used such data to test the algorithms for the reconstruction of the direction of the laser events @xcite . \n the rms of the angular reconstruction was estimated in @xcite to be few degrees . a map of the background in the uv range has been produced and is shown in fig . \n thanks to the present study we could give a preliminary estimate ( except the direct airglow component ) of the uv background which will be seen by jem  euso on orbit both in clear sky and cloudy conditions .          in spring 2017 the euso  spb prototype will be launched from wanaka , new zealand @xcite . \n the detector will consist of a system of two fresnel lenses of 1 m side and one single pdm . \n the balloon flight will make use of a super pressure balloon ( spb ) , a new technology currently developed by nasa . \n the test flights performed by nasa in 2015 and 2016 achieved a 32 and 45 days duration . \n the detector is assembled and currently ( feb . \n 2017 ) in new zealand in the launch preparatory phase . \n the detector has now to be fully autonomous and must therefore be provided with solar panels , rechargeable batteries , antennas for data and command transfer . \n the main objective of euso \n spb is the autonomous detection of cr events for the first time from above using the fluorescence technique . \n the electronics is therefore equipped with a fully autonomous trigger which has been already tested on the ta site in october 2016 . \n we show in fig . \n [ fig9 ] the image of a laser shot which autonomously triggered euso \n the collaboration estimated the expected rate of cr to be of the order of few events during the entire flight . \n mini  euso will be launched in 2017 and consists of a system of circular fresnel lenses and one single pdm to be accommodated inside the iss @xcite . \n the detector will be placed in the russian segment of the iss behind a uv  transparent downward  looking window and will monitor the atmosphere from 400 km height in the same condition as jem  euso \n . the main objective of this prototype is the measurement of the atmospheric uv emission from space . \n given the small diameter of the lens ( 25 cm ) , no detection of crs can be expected . despite that , \n the collaboration plans to use artificial sources ( with a luminosity equivalent to a 10@xmath10 ev cr ) as in the balloon missions in order to mimic a cr signal . \n other targets of the missions are the study of tles , meteors and auroras . \n we see in fig . \n [ fig10 ] the image of a simulated meteor . an interesting application of this prototype is the detection of space debris during twilight , which will fly on a lower orbit with respect to the iss . \n k  euso is the first large size detector being developed in the framework of the jem  euso project @xcite . \n the optical design follows a so  called schmitt optics , namely a combination of a mirror and of a corrector lens . \n the detector is exploiting the experience gathered in the jem  euso and the klypve collaborations . \n the detector is planned to fly in the early 2020s and to be attached to the russian section of the iss . \n the detector will be the first one capable of doing full scale uhecr science from space through fluorescence . \n we see in fig . \n [ fig11 ] the comparison between the exposure curves of several existing and planned detectors compared to k  euso . the main goal of this detector is the study of both small and large scale anisotropies , in particular the investigation of the ta hot spot , and of the differences between north and south hemisphere , thanks to its roughly uniform full sky coverage . \n this represents a major issue and challenge of the current research in the field of uhecrs . \n we gave a brief introduction to the jem \n euso program . \n all the pathfinders were presented and for the already existing ones a brief summary of their main results has been given . \n the collaboration is on its path for the development of space  based uhecr detectors . \n the capability of the jem  euso electronics to trigger cr  like events has been proven together with the technological readiness of the detector . \n the triggered events are used to develop the reconstruction of their direction . \n the response of the jem \n euso detector with respect to the background is being studied . \n the instrument is being calibrated with respect to ground based observatories . within 2017 \n the collaboration will perform autonomous fluorescence cr detection from balloon and a complete mapping of the uv background from space . \n such achievements will be useful to build a detector capable of detecting cr from space . \n k  euso should mark the first significant step , providing for the first time a full  sky coverage with a single instrument , with auger  like statistics in the gzk energy range .", "StartTimeOffset":

{"ContextTokens": 2542, "GeneratedTokens": 82, "SynthesizedBody": "in this talk we consider a new mechanism for hard inclusive production , which violates the factorization theorem @xcite . \n the suggested mechanism is present in any central hard inclusive production , such as heavy higgs meson production and/or the high @xmath0 inclusive production of mini jets and jets . \n we illustrate this mechanism for the case of inclusive heavy higgs production in nucleon - deutron high energy scattering . \n the usual description of inclusive production of a higgs meson with mass @xmath1 in a nucleon - deutron interaction , is based on the factorization theorem @xcite , using which the cross section of interest is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the parton distribution within the deutron , and in the impulse approximation @xmath4 . \n @xmath5 denotes the cross section for higgs meson production in the parton - parton collision . \n the factorization theorem ( ft ) can be proven for the nucleon - deutron scattering using the agk cutting rules @xcite ( see ref . @xcite and references therein for detail discussion of the agk cutting rules in qcd ) . \n indeed , let us assume that the ft holds for nucleon - nucleon scattering . for nucleon - deutron scattering \n we have two contributions to the total cross section : the projectile nucleon interacts with one nucleon in the deutron ( impulse approximation ) and it interacts with both nucleons in the deutron ( glauber corrections ) . \n the first process obviously leads to the ft of eq.(1 ) , while for the second one we can use the agk cutting rules for the decomposition of the total cross section with respect to the multiplicity of produced particles . \n the relation between different contributions is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the amplitude of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . \n @xmath9 is the cross section of all processes where no particles were produced in the central rapidity region ( elastic scattering and single and double diffractive dissociation ) ; @xmath10 is the contribution to the total inelastic cross section , which has the same multiplicity distribution as in nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section , and @xmath11 is part of the total inelastic cross section for the nucleon - deutron scattering which describes the inelastic interaction of the projectile nucleon with two nucleons in the deutron . \n one can see that eq.(2 ) leads to the cancellation of the interaction with the two nucleon in the deutron for the inclusive cross section of the particle in the central rapidity region . \n indeed , @xmath9 does not contribute to this production while two other contributions cancels since in the subprocess described by @xmath11 there is two ways of the production of the particle of the interest . \n therefore , the inclusive production can be described in the impulse approximation for which the ft is valid by our assumption . \n the natural question arises : _ what is wrong in our above discussion_. \n let us start with the short answer to the formulated question : _ we missed the interference diagrams given in fig.1 _ and these diagrams give the new mechanism for centrally produced higgs meson ( or for any other  hard \" process . \n trying to describe what kind of processes we picture in fig.1 , one can see that fig.1a shows the process where the higgs , which is produced centrally , is separated by two large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) from the small final state multiplicities which occur on the edges of the rapidity plot . \n we define this process as a double pomeron exchange reaction , and denote its contribution as @xmath12 . \n the contribution of fig.1b is denoted by @xmath13 . \n this is a mixed diagram , where the higgs which is produced in a double pomeron process , is superimposed on a normal uniform rapidity distribution typical of an inelastic nucleon - nucleon reaction . \n finally , fig.1c describes higgs production as part of the nucleon - nucleon background to the rapidity distribution . \n we denote this contribution by @xmath14 . to obtain our final result we need to sum over all three of the above contributions , noting that these are not necessarily positive . \n the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) amplitude for higgs production via double pomeron exchange , has been calculated @xcite , to be @xmath15 @xmath16 is the the vertex of the hard parton - parton @xmath17 higgs process and @xmath18 is the pomeron exchange amplitude . \n the second ingredient in our calculation is the amplitude shown in fig.1c ( see also one of the amplitude in fig.1b ) . \n this amplitude has no analog in the case of a single nucleon - nucleon interaction , and it depicts the cut in the diagram shown in fig.1a . \n we note that this diagram is equal to @xmath19 , unlike the case for inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section where @xmath20 . \n the above result follows from the unitarity constraint @xcite .    recalling that the integration over the longitudinal components of the momentum carried by the pomeron in fig.1b results in a negative sign for the interference diagram ( see ref . \n @xcite for details ) , we can easily calculate all diagrams contributing to the inclusive higgs meson production . \n indeed , calculating @xmath12 , the sum of the diagrams in fig.1a , and using eq.(3 ) , one has    @xmath21    for the sum of diagrams in fig.1b we have @xmath22 finally , for @xmath14 , shown in fig.1c , we obtain @xmath23 the relation between the different contributions is @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    summing all contributions we obtain an additional term in the cross section \n compare to the one given in eq.(1 ) @xmath26    we would like to draw attention to the novel fact , that the contribution of the new mechanism is proportional to the real part of the amplitude . for a soft pomeron with @xmath27 , the contribution of eq.(8 ) vanishes , and we recover the factorization theorem @xcite , i.e. an exact cancellation of the diagrams shown in fig.1c . \n however , for the hard processes (  hard \" pomeron ) both theory and experiment lead to a steep behaviour of the cross section as a function of energy ( see ref . \n @xcite ) which results in considerable violation of the factorization theorem for totaly inclusive production . indeed , at high energy ( low @xmath28 ) \n @xmath29 is equal to @xmath30 in all available parametrization for the deep inelastic structure function @xmath31 at @xmath32 . \n to give a quantative measure of the effect of the nonfactorization we plot in fig.2 the ratio of the nonfactorized contribution ( see ref.@xcite for the formula of this contribution ) to the cross section from the factorization theorem of eq.(1 ) , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gluon density of the @xmath35-th hadron and @xmath36 is the unintegrated gluon density , which closely related to the gluon structure function , namely , @xmath37 . in fig.2 we took @xmath38 = 0 , where @xmath38 is rapidity of produced higgs meson . \n notice , that this ratio does not depend on the hard cross section , and as such is also applicable to any central production process , in particular , hard minijet and jet production . in evaluating eq.(10 ) \n we use @xcite the grv parametrization @xcite for the gluon density . \n we assume that @xmath39 ( see ref.@xcite ) . \n for the initial virtuality we take @xmath40 , as the grv parametrization is in agreement with the hera data on @xmath41 @xcite for all @xmath42 . \n one can see , that @xmath43 is quite big for low masses and decreases when m increases . \n for example , @xmath43 = 1.2 for @xmath44 . \n we do not expect the higgs meson mass to be that small , but our result is also applicable in the case of jet production where @xmath45 . \n accordingly , with such a value of @xmath43 we can expect minijet production ( jets with @xmath46 ) which can be responsible for the structure of the minimum bias events at the tevatron energy .    the value of @xmath43 is bigger for nucleus - nucleus interaction . to estimate this value \n we need to multiply eq.(10 ) by a factor of @xmath47 . using the simple relation @xmath48 \n , one has @xmath49 . \n therefore , for a gold - gold interaction we expect that @xmath43 is enhanced by factor 4 - 9 . \n our conclusion is very simple : _ the factorization theorem @xcite is only approximate _ and the violation of the ft can be rather big especially for heavy ion collisions and/or for hadron ones at the lhc energies . \n we firmly believe that the formal proof of the ft given in ref.@xcite should be reconsidered to find out the correct region of the applicability of this theorem .    99 e. gotsman , e. levin and u. maor : taup 2416/97 , hep -

kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite . \n it reads @xmath15 with @xmath16 all the correlators can then be expressed in terms of the solution of this equation . finally \n , the fourier transform of the dipole correlator @xmath17 is an ( all - twist ) unintegrated gluon density . \n it determines forward particle production @xcite , while more exclusive final states involve more complicated correlators . solving eq .   reveals the existence of an intrisic momentum scale in the nuclear wave function : the saturation scale @xmath18 which characterizes the transition from the dilute regime @xmath19 to saturation regime @xmath20    one of the most important progress is the recent calculation of the next - to - leading evolution equation @xcite . \n concerning how the running coupling should be included , two schemes have been proposed by balitsky ( b ) and kovchegov and weigert ( kw ) . \n the following substitution should be done in formula , with @xmath21 given in @xcite : @xmath22\\ ] ] @xmath23\\ .\\ ] ] at next - to - leading order , there remains a discrepancy between the linear part of the bk equation and the bfkl equation . \n running coupling corrections to particle production have also been investigated @xcite . \n another important recent theoretical development is the inclusion of pomeron loops in the evolution @xcite , and the derivation of potential consequences at very high energies @xcite . \n concerning phenomenology at present colliders , there was however no significant impact . \n forward particle production in pa collisions allows to investigate the non linear qcd dynamics of high - energy nuclei with a probe well understood in qcd . \n indeed , while such processes are probing small - momentum partons in the nuclear wavefunction , only high - momentum partons of the proton contribute to the scattering ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . \n the dilute hadron contributes via standard parton distribution functions while the cgc is described by its unintegrated gluon distribution . \n it was not obvious that the cgc picture , which requires small values of @xmath10 would be relevant at present energies . \n however , it has been the case for many observables in the context of hera @xcite and rhic @xcite . \n one of the most acclaimed successes is the prediction that the yield of high-@xmath1 particles at forward rapidities in d+au collisions is suppressed compared to a pp collisions , and should decrease when increasing the rapidity .    in fig.1 the @xmath26 @xmath1 spectra computed in the cgc approach @xcite \n is compared to rhic data , and the description of the slope is impressive . \n the need of k factors to describe the normalization could be expected since this is a leading - order based calculation . improving the calculation with the next - leading evolution \n has yet to be done . while the suppression was predicted in the cgc approach , other postdictions later offered alternative descriptions . \n the idea is that the value of @xmath0 probed in the deuteron is so high that large-@xmath0 effects could be responsible for the suppression @xcite . \n this would not happen in @xmath27 collisions at the lhc , with a smaller @xmath28    while the cgc framework was quite successful in describing single inclusive particle production at forward rapidities , the focus should now shift towards more exclusive observables like two - particle production @xmath29 in particular the correlations in azimuthal angle between the produced hadrons should be suppressed compared to pp collisions @xcite . by contrast with single particle production , in two - particle production \n the cgc can not be described only by its unintegrated gluon distribution , the so - called @xmath30-factorization framework is not applicable . \n this means that more tests could be done , probing the cgc structure deeper . \n the second d+au run at rhic gives the opportunity to carry out such measurements . \n mueller - navelet jets @xcite in hadron - hadron scattering are two jets produced in each of the forward directions . in the high - energy regime , \n in which the jets are separated by a large rapidity interval , this process is sensitive to the small-@xmath0 qcd evolution . \n an interesting observable is the azimuthal decorrelation of the jets as a function of their rapidity separation @xmath31 and of the ratio of their transverse momenta @xmath32 @xcite . \n predictions are shown in fig.2 , for tevatron and lhc kinematics , where @xmath33 is the relative azimuthal angle between the two jets . \n the curves are obtained in the linear regime , using next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) bfkl evolution . at higher energies \n , saturation effects will also be relevant @xcite . \n coming back to forward particle production in pa collisions , predictions for the process @xmath34 are shown in fig.3 , for rhic and the lhc @xcite . \n @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 are the transverse momenta and rapidities of the final state hadrons , and the azimuthal angle spectra are displayed . \n it is obtained that the perturbative back - to - back peak of the azimuthal angle distribution ( which is recovered for very large momenta ) is reduced by initial state saturation effects . as the momenta decrease closer to the saturation scale ( @xmath39 ) , the angular distribution broadens . \n but at rhic energies , saturation does not lead to a complete disappearance of the back - to - back peak . \n finally , predictions for the total charged - particle multiplicity in aa collisions at the lhc are shown in fig.4 . \n two approaches are compared : in the first , @xmath30-factorization is assumed but the evolution of the unintegrated gluon densities is accurately obtained from the next - leading bk equation @xcite ; in the second , the x evolution is only parametrized but multiple scatterings are correctly taken into account by solving classical yang - mills equation @xcite . while full next - leading treatment of both multiple scatterings and small-@xmath0 evolution is desirable , the numbers obtained are similar , which indicates that the uncertainties in both approaches are under control .", "StartTimeOffset": 678352525472, "RequestID": "caa56872aa5f4c2f853fa103aa75e61a", "TotalTokens": 2106}

low frequency ( ulf ) electromagnetic emissions have been observed prior to earthquakes @xcite , possibly resulting from electric currents flowing deep in the crust @xcite . \n low frequency fluctuations in the earth s magnetic field have been reported in the literature since at least 1635 @xcite . increased levels of magnetic fluctuations \n have been repeatedly observed prior to earthquakes since at least 1964 @xcite , but these transient phenomena have received relatively little attention and , as such , they are not yet fully understood \n .    observed pre - earthquake electromagnetic waves typically have frequencies between 0.01hz and 20hz , possibly owing to the fact that only low - frequency components may traverse tens of kilometers through the rock column . \n they have been independently observed prior to many earthquakes over the past 50 years @xcite . during the weeks leading up to the m=5.4 alum rock earthquake of oct . \n 30 , 2007 , a magnetometer located about 2 km from the epicenter recorded unusual non - alternating magnetic pulses , reaching amplitudes up to 30 nt @xcite . \n the incidence of these pulses increased as the day of the earthquake approached . \n a pair of magnetometer stations in peru recently recorded similar unipolar pulses prior to several medium - sized earthquakes , and triangulating the source of these pulses revealed the location of subsequent earthquake epicenters @xcite . \n the unipolar magnetic pulses observed prior to earthquakes have a characteristic shape similar to a gaussian that is attenuated over time . \n the unipolar nature of the magnetic pulses is somewhat unusual and bears resemblance to pulses produced by lightning and other electrical breakdown phenomena . \n however , the duration of many pre - earthquake pulses exceeds several seconds , much longer than any lightning strike . \n moreover , triangulation of such pulses near lima , peru revealed that strong pulses originated almost exclusively from locations within a few kilometers of future earthquake epicenters @xcite .    to model the electromagnetic phenomena associated with volumes of rock , we solve a three - dimensional drift - diffusion model of a semiconductor and calculate the magnetic fields induced by its electric currents . \n the model is seen to describe transient low - frequency unipolar magnetic pulses . \n we will show that unipolar pulses can emerge simply from the electrical drift and random diffusion of charge carriers in a semiconducting volume of rock . \n there are several reasons why this is a plausible mechanism for the observed pulses . \n large electrical currents are known to accompany earthquakes , occasionally so large that luminous effects known as earthquake lights@xcite become apparent . \n there is experimental evidence @xcite indicating that , during stressing , electrons and holes become activated in igneous rocks that subsequently behave as semiconductors . \n one proposed source of charge carriers in rock is the break - up of peroxy defects @xcite as a result of the increase in tectonic stresses . \n the oxygen sublattice of a wide variety of silicate minerals can form peroxy defects that act as sources of electron / hole pairs @xcite , causing these minerals to exhibit semiconductivity . once activated , highly mobile electronic charge carriers diffuse through the minerals . \n peroxy defects are point defects , typically introduced through the incorporation of @xmath0 into nominally anhydrous minerals that crystallize in @xmath0-laden magmas or recrystallize in high - temperature @xmath0-laden environments@xcite . \n the incorporation of @xmath0 into oxides and silicates leads to @xmath1 pairs that subsequently undergo redox conversion . \n the two @xmath2 of the @xmath1 pairs combine to form @xmath3 , and the @xmath4 ions bind to form a peroxy bond . \n the formation of these peroxy bonds has been extensively studied in laboratory experiments @xcite and treated by computational chemistry @xcite .    when peroxy bonds are energized via stresses in the rock or by heat \n , they may produce electron - hole pairs . \n the peroxy bond breaks , forming a transient state with two unpaired electrons . \n this is followed by a fully dissociated state in which a hole is free to move through the crystal structure . \n a neighboring oxygen atom donates an electron and becomes a hole , as its valence shell becomes deficient by one electron . \n the donated electron becomes trapped near the broken peroxy bond@xcite in a new state whose energy level is slightly below the upper edge of the valence band . in terms of the valence state , \n the neighboring oxygen atom , which was previously in an @xmath5 state , becomes @xmath6 . \n this oxygen anion in the 1- state is effectively a positive hole with an incomplete valence shell and could also be regarded as an unstable oxygen radical @xcite . \n holes are capable of propagating through the oxygen lattice , exchanging valence electrons by a phonon - assisted vacancy hopping mechanism @xcite . \n this process effectively constitutes a diffusion of @xmath6 holes through a lattice of @xmath5 atoms . \n the trapped electrons are immobile but participate through recombination and electrostatic interactions . \n the drift - diffusion equations are the most frequently used model for semiconductor physics , and perform well on scales greater than about 0.5 micrometers @xcite . \n they describe current in terms of charge carrier concentrations and an electrostatic field , and this determines the change in charge carrier concentrations via continuity of the current density . \n the drift - diffusion equations are : @xmath7    here , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are defined on a domain @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a subset of a 3-dimensional space . \n the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are concentrations of electron and hole charges , respectively , and @xmath12 is the charge of any dopant ions that are present . \n @xmath15 is the recombination / generation rate of electrons and holes . \n the third equation is poisson s law of electrostatics whose solution describes the electric potential @xmath11 . \n @xmath16 is the electric permittivity . \n the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mobilities of electrons and holes , respectively , ( not to be confused with the magnetic permeability @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding diffusion coefficients . in the particular instance of the model under consideration , \n @xmath17 and @xmath21 are approximately zero due to electrons becoming trapped in the valence band . \n maxwell s equations describe propagation at the speed of light , much faster than the charge carriers diffusing in a typical semiconductor . rather than modeling propagation on two very different time scales , we make use of the quasi - static ( magnetostatic ) approximation@xcite , assuming that currents do not alternate rapidly or approach the speed of light . \n specifically , the maxwell displacement current appearing in ampere s law is assumed to be negligible : @xmath23 . \n this assumption is implicit in the drift - diffusion model due to its use of poisson s equation for the static electrical potential . \n the electric current density @xmath24 acts as the source of a magnetic field . \n it may be expressed as the sum of a drift term , involving the electric field , and a diffusive term , involving the concentration gradient . \n the rate of change of the concentration then becomes a continuity equation that is a function of current density . explicitly separating the current and continuity equations facilitates coupling to the magnetic field . in this form , \n the current densities are : @xmath25    the continuity equations that describe the change in electron and hole concentrations are , then : @xmath26    the current densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are summed to obtain the total current density @xmath29 that acts as a source for the magnetic field . in a magnetostatic approximation , the solution to the magnetic field on a domain may be efficiently computed by solving a set of poisson equations for the magnetic vector potential . in this case , however , we calculate the field at an arbitrary point in space , which could be outside the domain . \n we apply the biot - savart law to obtain the magnetic field at the point @xmath30 : @xmath31    here , @xmath32 is the magnitude of the vector from @xmath30 to @xmath33 and @xmath19 is the magnetic permeability . \n the velocities of the holes are not sufficiently large for the lorentz force to be significantly influenced by magnetic fields so we do not conisder the effect of the magnetic field on the charge carriers . \n the drift - diffusion equations are solved by expressing the partial differential equations as a system of ordinary differential equations for the time derivatives @xmath34 and @xmath35 . a finite - difference approximation to this system \n is then integrated using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme ( rk4 ) . \n poisson s equation is solved separately at each timestep using successive over - relaxation@xcite ( sor ) with an adaptive relaxation parameter and open boundary conditions . for the other pdes , \n the dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are applied to the boundary of a grid of uniformly spaced points representing the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 coordinates over which functions are evaluated . \n all spatial partial derivatives ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) of the current and continuity equations are approximated using a fourth - order central difference approximation .    at each timestep , \n the electric potential is determined by solving poisson s equation , starting the sor iteration with the electric potential from the previous timestep . using the electric potential and the charge carrier concentrations , the components of the current vector fields @xmath27 and \n @xmath28 are evaluated . from @xmath27 and @xmath28 , \n the continuity equations are integrated , yielding the concentrations of the charge carriers at the next timestep . \n the magnetic field @xmath45 is evaluated by applying a discretized biot - savart law to the currents . \n @xmath45 is calculated at each timestep but since the result does not affect the dynamics , it may be evaluated at a single point . \n since holes are mobile and electrons are immobile , diffusion separates the two species , creating an electric current that acts as an electromagnet . the boundary of a region of activated charge behaves , essentially , like the p - n junction of a diode . \n since only holes may flow out of this volume , the initial current diffusing across the boundary is unidirectional , corresponding to forward bias in the diode . \n however , after a delay period during which recombination reduces the diffusive current , the diode switches to reverse bias . \n the p - n junction capacitance generates a reverse recovery current and potentially a reverse - bias electrical breakdown . \n this current of holes flows back into the source volume , producing a magnetic pulse that is opposite in polarity and potentially much stronger than the initial magnetic field . \n we use the semiconductor model to calculate an example of a unipolar magnetic pulse . \n the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are estimated based on the static properties of mgo@xcite ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and a temperature of @xmath48k . since electrons are trapped and immobile in broken peroxy bonds , @xmath17 and @xmath21 are set to @xmath49 . \n the mobility and diffusion constant of holes were roughly estimated based on experimental data from a haynes - shockley - style experiment whereby a rapid pressure impulse to the center of a gabbro tile injected holes that diffused and drifted away from their source . \n the parameters used are @xmath50 m@xmath51 ( vs)@xmath52 and @xmath53 m@xmath51 s@xmath52 , comparable to their values in pure undoped silicon . \n charge generation is not explicitly considered in this calculation , and a pre - existing excess concentration of @xmath54 c m@xmath55 of both electrons and holes exists as an initial condition . \n these dissociated charges are initially present only at points within a ball of radius @xmath56 m. their recombination rate is proportional to the product of electron and hole concentrations , @xmath57 . the attenuation of the magnetic field as it passes through the earth is not considered , nor are effects associated with the surface of the earth . \n calculated and observed magnetic pulses are illustrated in figure 1 . \n the first figure shows the value of the x - component of the magnetic field as a function of time , measured 10 km directly above the center of the simulated volume . \n the amplitude , frequency , and shape of the pulse are similar to pulses that have been observed before earthquakes . for comparison \n , the second figure shows several magnetic pulses observed prior to an earthquake near lima , peru . \n these pulses were measured over a period of several days by a pair of magnetometers approximately 25 km away , and the locations of their sources were triangulated . \n the sources were clustered within a few kilometers of the epicenter of an earthquake that occurred two weeks after the onset of the pulses @xcite . \n this analysis has been performed prior to several moderate earthquakes near lima , with similar results . \n when a volume of rock is stressed , excess holes and electrons are injected . \n the mobile holes begin to diffuse out of the source volume , while electrons are trapped within the source volume and undergo recombination with the holes that have not diffused out . \n the flux of holes leaving the source effectively creates a p - n diode : the source volume becomes an n - type semiconductor and the surrounding rock becomes p - type . \n a depletion region forms between the two layers of the p - n junction and the p - n double layer screens electric fields outside its immediate vicinity . \n after charge injection , a diffusive current of holes flows as a result of the concentration gradient across the source boundary . \n this corresponds to a forward bias state of the diode , dominated by diffusion capacitance rather than junction capacitance . \n this current creates a transient magnetic field . as the hole concentration gradient decreases , the diffusive current and the magnetic field decay . \n after holes have diffused outward , creating p - type and n - type regions , a junction capacitance results from layers of positive and negative charge separated by a depletion region at the junction . \n after a delay period , the diode effectively switches to a reverse bias state . \n electron - hole recombination consumes the holes remaining within the source volume , leaving mostly electrons inside . \n the junction capacitance causes a transient reverse recovery current , and , if the potential drop across the depletion region is sufficiently strong , reverse - bias electrical breakdown may occur . \n coulomb attraction pulls the holes back into the source volume , and this reverse current of holes can create transient magnetic pulses similar to those observed before earthquakes .    a distinctive form and the ability to pass through the earth at ultra - low frequencies make magnetic pulses a compelling tool for the observation of pre - seismic shifts in the stress level of rocks that are otherwise inaccessible due to depth . by triangulating the source of these magnetic pulses , the increased buildup of stress around future earthquake epicenters may be identified weeks in advance of seismicity . \n in addition to unipolar pulses , other types of electromagnetic precursors might be predicted from the semiconductor model . \n oscillatory ulf fields , for example , have been observed immediately preceding earthquake activity @xcite . \n the positive hole semiconductor theory modeled here seeks to unify a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena associated with seismic activity . \n the direct coupling of semiconductor drift - diffusion currents and electromagnetism produces a model consistent with observations of pre - seismic magnetic pulses . \n this suggests that pre - earthquake ulf activity may be the result of geophysical semiconductor processes . \n the authors would like to thank tom bleier and clark dunson of quakefinder for informative discussions . \n this research was funded in part by nasa earth surface and interior grant nnx12al71 g ( dr . john labrecque ) .              in this context \n , ultra - low refers to electromagnetic waves having frequencies from millihertz to a few hertz , in contrast to the international telecommunications union ( itu ) definition of ultra - low , which would correspond to waves having frequencies of 300hz-3khz .", "StartTimeOffset": 738140193096, "RequestID": "05087b6748c045c4bbe74dfdb33625ed", "TotalTokens": 4207}

however , without guidance end users can be overwhelmed by myriad choices . \n our aim in this article is to present a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm s performance in common scenarios ; while retaining the same basic game - theoretic model , we evaluate different variations of our procedure . \n first , we examine the performance of different utility functions , a similarity - based utility function  @xcite vs.  the use of a personalized modularity function  @xcite . \n then we compare different initialization approaches in which the following information is propagated : 1 ) no information ( * d - gts * ) ; 2 ) the union of the community membership information over all snapshots ( * d - gt * ) ; 3 ) community membership information from the previous snapshot ( * d - gtp * ) ; 4 ) ground truth information for a small seed set ( * d - gtg * ) . our game - theoretic model is robust to minor changes in the procedure and most variants outperform the benchmarks . \n our experiments were conducted on networks created from different dynamic processes : internet routers ( as - oregon graph , the as - internet routers graph ) , shifting organization structure ( enron email dataset ) , citation graphs from arxiv ( hep - ph ) , and player interactions in massively multiplayer online games ( travian messages , travian trades ) . \n results were compared against five other methods : labelrankt , ilcd , oslom , infomap and louvain in terms of normalized mutual information ( nmi ) , modularity , and the number of detected communities . \n the next section presents an over - view of related work on community detection in dynamic networks . \n section  [ sec : method ] describes our problem formulation and our proposed method ( * * d**ynamic * * g**ame * * t**heoretic community detection ) . experimental results are provided in section  [ sec : results ] , before we conclude the article ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) . \n the problem of community detection has been widely studied in the literature compared to the other research areas in the social networks  @xcite . in particular , in static networks \n , community detection has appeared in multiple disciplines including sociology and computer science . \n this has yielded a diverse set of approaches ranging from traditional network structure based algorithms  @xcite , optimization techniques  @xcite , label propagation  @xcite , propinquity  @xcite and information diffusion  @xcite . detecting community structure in dynamic networks , on the other hand , \n has attracted less research attention due to the complexity of the problem and dearth of good datasets . \n there are some community detection algorithms originally design - ed for static networks that continue to perform well in dynamic datasets . \n for instance , lancichinetti et al.s oslom ( order statistics local optimization method ) works on single snapshots but also benefits from information from previous network partitions . like d - gt , oslom s optimization procedure can be initialized with the partition from the previous snapshot ; it aims to optimize cluster significance with respect to a global null model  @xcite . \n we use this method as one of our benchmarks , along with two other static community detection algorithms , louvain @xcite and infomap  @xcite . \n these algorithms perform well on many static community detection problems and have the benefit of being fast to compute on a single network snapshot . \n other network properties have also been used to perform dynamic community detection ; for instance hui et al . \n @xcite proposed a distributed method for community detection in which modularity was used as a measure instead of the objective function . \n qca ( quick community adaptation ) is a modularity - based approach that focuses explicitly on the changes in the network structure , rather than recomputing community structure from scratch at each time step  @xcite . in this article , \n we evaluate the use of personal modularity as an alternative gain function to neighborhood similarity . \n some studies have focused on studying the evolution of communities over time . \n for instance , @xcite identified subsets of nodes ,  natural communities \" , that were stable to small perturbations of the input data . \n communities detected in later snapshots were matched to earlier snapshots using the natural community tree structure . \n palla et al . \n @xcite proposed an innovative method for detecting communities in dynamic networks based on the k - clique percolation technique ; in their approach , communities are defined as adjacent k - cliques , that share @xmath0 nodes .    machine learning has also been employed to model changes in community structure ; for instance , @xcite predict transitions in community structure by learning supervised machine learning classifiers . \n this requires data on past transitions to train the classifiers , which limits its applicability to certain datasets . @xcite \n adopt a data mining approach to detect clusters on time - evolving graphs ; community discovery and change detection are performed using the minimum description length ( mdl ) paradigm .    rather than independently detecting communities at each snapshot and matching them , another option is to make a local decision to add nodes to existing communities when new edges appear in the network . \n one of our benchmarks , ilcd ( intrinsic longitudinal community detection )  @xcite , updates the community structure of the network based on time - stamped sets of edges . \n nodes are added to communities if its mean number of second neighbors and robust second neighbors exceeds the current average for the community . however , \n this model is limited to certain types of network changes , and can not handle interconnected pairs of nodes being simultaneously added or the removal of edges . \n optimization can be used to identify minimum cost community assignments in dynamic graphs . \n facetnet @xcite is a framework for analyzing communities in dynamic networks based on an optimization of snapshot costs . \n it is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution ; however , its convergence speed is slow , and it needs to be initialized with the number of communities which is usually unknown in practice . @xcite modeled dynamic community detection as a multi - objective optimization problem . \n their approach is parameter free and uses evolutionary clustering to optimize a dual objective function . \n the first objective selects for highly modular structures at the current time step , and the second minimizes the differences between community structures in the current and previous time steps . \n d - gt also uses a stochastic optimization procedure , but all of the agents individually optimize their utilities based on local network information . \n the markov cluster algorithm ( mcl )  @xcite identifies graph clusters by computing the probabilities of random walks through the graph ; flow simulations are performed by alternating expansion ( matrix squaring ) with inflation operations ( hadamard powers ) . due to its mathematical simplicity , \n it is popular for community detection in many domains but is slow and often overestimates the number of communities in the dataset . \n regularized - mcl  @xcite is a variant of mcl that prevents overfitting by taking into account neighbor flows . \n it can also be used within a multi - level framework ( multi - level regularized mcl ) to speed up computation by executing a sequence of coarsening operations on the graph before executing r - mcl . \n labelrankt  @xcite , shares some similarities with the mcl techniques described above while improving upon them in several ways ; it is a label propagation approach in which the inflation operation is applied to the label distribution matrix rather than to the adjacency matrix . \n each node requires only local information during propagation making it more scalable than mcl and amenable to parallelization . \n due to labelrankt s strong performance and good implementation , it was selected as the best label propagation benchmark for our work .    our proposed method ( d - gt ) attempts to simulate the decision - making process of the individuals creating the communities , rather than focusing on statistical correlations between labels of neighboring nodes . \n we believe that exploiting game theory for dynamic community detection yields more realistic , fine - grained communities since intrinsically game theory is a good representation for expressing the behavior of individuals and strategic interactions among them  @xcite .    in previous work \n , we have demonstrated the success of game - theoretic approaches in static community detection across several domains , including detecting guilds in massively multiplayer online games  @xcite and predicting trust between users on e - commerce sites @xcite . \n many of these domains featured overlapping communities in static networks  @xcite ; however in this article the datasets are dynamic , but not overlapping . \n d - gt makes a hard assignment at the termination of the stochastic optimization procedure by selecting the community assignment with the highest utility function . in this article \n , we investigate the performance of different gain functions and initialization procedures , on a variety of evaluation metrics ( modularity , nmi , number of detected communities ) . \n the strength of the d - gt framework is its versatility ; our results show that substantial performance improvements can be achieved by customizing it for the problem at hand . \n first , we provide the formal definition of the problem and the notations used throughout the paper . given snapshots @xmath1 of a dynamic network and their corresponding underlying graphs @xmath2 , with @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 edges , where t=1, ... ,m , we aim to detect community structure @xmath5 of the network . \n table  [ tb : symb ] shows the symbols and definitions used throughout the paper . \n we leverage a dynamic agent - based model to detect communities by optimizing each user s utility through a stochastic search process  @xcite . in this article \n , we evaluate four different variants of the procedure : d - gt ( * * d**ynamic * * g**ame * * t**heoretic community detection ) , d - gtp ( * d - gt * with passing one * * p**revious snapshot ) d - gts ( * d - gt * with * * s**eparate runs ) and d - gtg ( * d - gt * with passing * * g**round truth ) . \n [ tb : symb ]    .definition of symbols . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tb : runtime ] shows the running time of all algorithms on our largest datasets , the as - internet dataset ( with the highest number of snapshots ) and hep - ph ( with the highest number of nodes ) . \n overall , the running times provided by all algorithms were quite reasonable , as there are 733 snapshots in the internet dataset and over 10,000 and 30,000 nodes in oregon and hep - ph respectively . \n infomap is the fastest algorithm on two datasets ( internet and hep - ph ) and performs almost as well as oslom on third one ( oregon ) . \n all of the algorithms are sufficiently fast to run on large datasets . \n this article analyzes the performance of our game theoretic community detection algorithm , d - gt , on dynamic social networks . \n these social networks are very common in massively multiplayer online games , such as travian , where players self - organize into rapidly changing guilds and alliances . \n we show that d - gt s initialization procedure in combination with the similarity gain function is very effective at recovering the true community structure of the network , both in terms of predicting the number of communities and the players community membership vectors . \n it outperforms other dynamic community detection methods including labelrankt , ilcd , and oslom . in cases where the communities of a small number of players ( e.g. the guild leadership ) \n is known d - gt can leverage the information to improve the nmi performance . \n when simply optimizing modularity , considering earlier community membership is less important and static community detection algorithms ( infomap and louvain ) perform well at this task , but all variants of d - gt offer competitive performance . \n one nice aspect of d - gt is that it is an easily extensible framework . in future work \n we plan to experiment with other utility functions , loss functions , and update rules ; for instance , q - learning could be used as the update rule for the agents instead of the community membership game . \n we also believe that it is feasible to reduce the runtime of d - gt by creating approximate versions of the gain function that can be calculated based on local edge updates . \n we would like to thank drs . \n nitin agarwal and rolf t.  wigand at university of arkansas for providing the travian dataset .", "StartTimeOffset": 749976360825, "RequestID": "34a2fcffd79e4c9189e03fc69d43697a", "TotalTokens": 3461}

particles which interact only weakly in the bulk can segregate and form two - dimensional clusters once they are captured by the interface ( see fig . \n [ fig : experiment ] ) . \n the appearance of additional interface induced features in the interaction between colloidal particles can be expected from analogous phenomena at interfaces of simple fluids  @xcite which , however , still pose unresolved challenges in understanding  @xcite . in liquid crystals the situation is even more complicated . \n the director deformations extend into the nematic phase , i.  e. , in addition to interfacial energies , the bulk elasticity contributes to the total free energy of the system . \n the effective surface tension ( provided it can be introduced in the first place ) depends on the orientation of the director , which in turn varies along the interface . \n the boundary conditions for the director at the particle surfaces give rise to topological defects accompanying the particles . in order to minimize the free energy associated with the director distortions as well as the free energy of the defect cores , the defects often merge with the isotropic phase  @xcite or with each other . \n the combination of the above - mentioned effects enriches the phenomena significantly but complicates their theoretical understanding enormously : expressions for the director field , the free energy , or force - distance profiles can hardly be obtained analytically . \n numerical calculations are also not straightforward because the interfacial width and the size of the defect cores are normally much smaller that the size of the colloidal particle , so that there are several rather different length - scales involved \n . therefore significant computational efforts involving finite - element methods with adaptive meshes are required to address even static problems  @xcite .    in the following \n we study the interaction of two long parallel cylindrical colloids trapped at a ( initially ) flat nematic - isotropic interface . \n we find that their effective interaction is rather complex : the force - distance profiles can exhibit jumps and hysteresis upon approach or separation . \n the particles can either repel or attract each other depending on the material parameters and the geometry . \n finally , we propose a simple effective pair potential which can be exploited to study clustering and self - organization of colloids at ni interfaces . \n two identical colloidal particles , each of which we take to be a long cylinder of radius @xmath1 with the symmetry axis parallel to the @xmath2 axis , are immersed into a nematic liquid crystal at a separation @xmath3 , see fig . \n [ fig : geometry ] . \n the nematic order parameter tensor at the boundaries is fixed in a such a way that without the colloids a flat nematic - isotropic interface is formed at @xmath4 . \n the order parameter at the top wall is fixed to zero ;

@xmath21 . \n we consider both rigid homeotropic and finite anchoring boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . in the latter case \n the surface free energy density is taken as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the anchoring coefficient and @xmath24 is the preferred tensor order parameter at the colloid surface with @xmath25 as the unit vector along the easy axis direction .    for the constants entering the free energy density ( eq . \n ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) ) we use typical values for a nematic compound 5cb  @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . \n the choices for @xmath12 will be given below . \n the nematic - isotropic transition temperature for 5cb is @xmath31 . at coexistence the nematic coherence length ( \n i.e. , the thickness of the nematic - isotropic interface ) is @xmath32 which sets the smallest length - scale of our description . \n the equilibrium distribution of the tensor order parameter @xmath33 is obtained by minimizing the free energy functional  ( [ eq : nem_free_en ] ) numerically using finite elements with adaptive meshing . \n the area @xmath34 is triangulated and the functions @xmath33 are linearly interpolated within each triangle . \n for this case we chose the anisotropy of the elastic constants as @xmath35 , favoring director alignment parallel to the ni interface and in the plane @xmath36 . \n we use rigid homeotropic boundary conditions at the colloidal surfaces . upon minimizing the free energy we have identified two stable orientational configurations . at sufficiently large separations \n @xmath3 both colloids are accompanied by a defect of strength @xmath37 ( fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](b ) ) . \n if the particles move closer , the two defects merge and form a single , but rather extended , defect positioned between the colloids ( fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](a ) ) . \n we have also observed three metastable configurations . \n here either one of the defects , fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](c ) , or even both defects , fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](d ) and ( e ) , merge with the isotropic phase : the system is trying to reduce its free energy by annihilating the defects . \n however , the interface has to bend and almost wrap the particles in order to reach the defects . \n this of course increases the interfacial energy , which is roughly proportional to the area of the interface . for small separations , among the metastable configurations only the one shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](c ) is possible : due to strong anchoring at the particle surfaces the nematic phase forms a bridge between the particles , preventing the isotropic phase from reaching also the second defect . for larger separations , \n the isotropic phase can extend partially around the colloids and merge with the second defect . \n this can occur asymmetrically , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](d ) , or symmetrically , see fig . \n [ fig : config_planar](e ) . \n the effective pair potential @xmath38 defined as the free energy per length of the colloidal particles is presented in fig .  [ fig : energy_planar ] . in all cases \n the particles repel each other . the branch of @xmath38 which corresponds to the _ stable _ configurations , reveals practically no breaks in slope , even though at @xmath39 the director field around the particles changes abruptly between the configurations ( a ) and ( b ) . \n however , if one of the metastable configurations is present in the system , transitions between different branches can occur giving rise to jumps and hysteresis in the force - distance curves upon particle approach / separation . \n the choice @xmath40 for the anisotropy of the elastic constants favors director alignment perpendicular to the ni interface in the plane @xmath36 . in this case \n we have found only two , stable configurations . \n the first one , containing a defect , is shown in fig . \n [ fig : config_hom](a ) \n . it occurs at small separations , where the nematic bridge between the particles forces the director to be parallel to the interface . \n the other configuration has no defects , because the nematic bridge with director orientation parallel to the interface disappears and the defect merges with the isotropic phase . \n the corresponding effective potential @xmath38 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_hom ] . as in the previous case , \n the particles repel each other at small separations where there are large director distortions in the inter - particle region . \n however , contrary to the case with planar anchoring , there is a strong attraction between the particles for @xmath41 , where the configuration with the defect is stable . \n the branch without the defect results in weak repulsion , as for planar anchoring . \n minimization of the free energy is a computationally expensive task , which can not be used , for example , to calculate the forces on the particles each time their positions are advanced using molecular dynamics or monte - carlo algorithms for their kinetics . \n use of effective potentials is a typical solution to this problem . in order to find such an appropriate potential \n we have calculated the free energy per unit length for particles of different radii , @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 . \n since colloids are rather small , the finite director anchoring at the particle surfaces has to be taken into account . \n we have used a value appropriate for 5cb on a polymer surface  @xcite , @xmath44 ; for this energy the dimensionless anchoring parameter @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath46 . \n minimization results for both planar and homeotropic anchoring of the director at the interface are shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . \n the strong repulsion close to contact ( @xmath47 ) has become smoother for planar and disappeared for homeotropic anchoring at the interface , due to the finite director anchoring at the colloid surfaces . \n it turns out that in both cases the following shape of the potential fits the numerical data very well : @xmath48 , & 0 \\le d \\le d_c \\\\ u(\\infty ) + u_0 \\bigl ( \\exp   \\left [ -\\alpha \\left ( { d}/{\\xi }   \\right)^{-\\beta } \\right ] - 1\\bigr ) , & d > \n d_c , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are ( positive ) fitting parameters . \n the first part of the potential ( @xmath50 ) describes a simple harmonic - type attraction between the particles , which we observed for the _ homeotropic _ anchoring ; for _ planar _ interfacial anchoring @xmath51 . in the case of homeotropic anchoring @xmath52 \n is a critical distance at which the defect annihilates ( see figs . \n [ fig : config_hom ] and [ fig : energy_hom ] ) . \n we have no analytical support for the functional form of the effective potential ( [ eq : fit ] ) . \n however , qualitatively , the effective interaction of the colloidal particles in a bulk nematic phase is known to exhibit a power - law decay at large distances  @xcite . in our case , \n the leading term of the expansion for @xmath53 is indeed @xmath54 . on the other hand , if two colloids are sufficientlly close , so that the regions where the _ order parameter _ changes from their surface to the bulk value start to overlap , and where the defects ( if present ) interact with each other and the particles  @xcite , the functional form of the potential changes . normally , the distortions of the order parameter relax exponentially ( similar to the variations of the order parameter through the nematic - isotropic interface ) resulting in an exponentially varying strength of the interaction . \n this is also captured qualitatively by the potential given in eq . \n ( [ eq : fit ] ) .    the fitting curves are also shown in fig . \n [ fig : energy_fit ] ( a ) and ( b ) . for planar anchoring @xmath55 ; for homeotropic anchoring @xmath56 , i.  e. , in both cases the interaction potential is long - ranged . in case of homeotropic anchoring there is a critical size of colloidal particles ( of the order of interfacial width ) below which the discontinuous structural transition between the configurations with and without the defect disappears . \n similar phenomena , named capillary bridging , can be observed in granular materials , liquid crystals , and binary mixtures  @xcite . in all cases , \n one of the phases ( otherwise metastable in the bulk ) condenses out and forms a bridge between the particles . \n this transition is discontinuous and ends in a critical point for small particle radii . in our case , the nematic phase located between the isotropic phase and the defect forms a bridge between the particles and results in their attraction . \n in conclusion , within the landau - de gennes formalism we have studied the effective pair interaction between two cylindrical parallel colloids trapped at the nematic - isotropic interface . \n this pairwise interparticle force depends sensitively on the radii of colloids , the orientation of the director at the ni interface , and the anchoring strength , i.e. , the nematic elasticity is an essential ingredient of the interaction . \n the formation or annihilation of defects influences the effective pair potential \n . it also changes the repulsive character of the interaction at large separations to an attractive one at intermediate or small separations . \n therefore , one should expect that many - body interactions are relevant to describe collective colloidal ordering at the interface . \n another implication of our work is that the interface is able to rearrange the nucleation centers of , for example , phase - separating polymer network and help to design composite materials of extraordinary properties .", "StartTimeOffset": 768473800465, "RequestID": "de67a8c0ba8f4954998e49e5f13e0867", "TotalTokens": 3938}

[ fig : sld - det - crosstalk](a ) ) was set up in the desy - ii testbeam for two short periods of time . from different orientations of the detector , either using the cherenkov drift section ( indicated in red ) or not ( beam incident on the area indicated in blue ) , the reflectivity of the aluminum channels was measured to be about 90% . as can be seen from fig . \n [ fig : sld -

based photomultiplier . \n however , results from these measurements are not discussed here . \n a component test stand is used to study different types of photodetectors . \n they are set up in a light - tight box and read out via a high resolution double range 12-bit vme charge - to - digital converter ( qdc ) , with either 200  fc or 25  fc per lsb ( least significant bit ) . \n a blue led ( @xmath7472  nm ) connected to a function generator is used to generate the light detected by the pd . before testing the linearity of the pds themselves , \n the differential and integral non - linearity ( dnl , inl ) of the qdc has also been measured . a ramp ( \n @xmath810  hz ) is used as input signal while the qdc is triggered by a short random gate of 50  ns duration . the probability for each transition to occur at a certain qdc code bin is measured and compared to an ideal distribution . if the qdc was ideal , a uniform distibution of code bins would be expected . the ratio between the measured and the ideal distribution is the code bin width , from which the dnl can be calculated as the deviation of the ideal code bin width of 1  lsb . the inl for a certain qdc code bin is then given by the sum of dnls up to this bin . \n both distributions are rather flat and a fit to the mid range of codes , from 200 to 800 qdc bins , gives an inl from 1 to 2 lsbs , corresponding to 0.1 - 0.2% of the full scale range . \n the most extensive linearity studies have been performed on 2x2 multianode photomultipliers ( mapm , hamamatsu r5900u - m4 ) . \n the spectrum of qdc counts is fitted by a modified poisson function to determine the number of incident photoelectrons . \n the ` true ' number of photoelectrons expected for a certain amount of light can not be determined since the relation between light yield and led bias voltage is not calibrated . \n however , the method used to measure the pd s inl is independent of the absolute scale of the led and only depends on the length of a rectangular pulse lighting the led . varying this pulse length ensures a linear variation of the amount of light on the photocathode of the pd . \n the pulse length is varied between 30  ns and 150  ns in steps of 5  ns . \n figure  [ fig : pd -

{"ContextTokens": 2909, "GeneratedTokens": 135, "SynthesizedBody": "nonlinear dynamics is a topic that not only cover all the disciplines , in both natural and social sciences , but also is now becoming part of introductory level undergraduate courses in sciences . searching for affordable , easy to setup , and reconfigurable classroom demonstrations that allow to investigate the physical and mathematical nature of nonlinear dynamical systems has been always a matter of interest for instructors . \n this paper describes a simple apparatus used to explore the behavior of one - dimensional chaotic maps , like the logistic map , when different initial conditions are chosen . \n the device consists of an inexpensive open - source microcontroller connected to an array of light emitting diodes ( leds ) , and programmed to iterate the logistic map in the one - dimensional interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n this interval is divided in ten equal parts and mapped one - to - one to a single led in the array . \n when the logistic map produces certain value after an iteration , the corresponding led lights up showing the value in the one dimensional domain approximately . \n after several iterations , it is possible to _ visualize _ the trajectory of the map by looking at the blinking leds sequence . \n sensitivity to initial conditions , density of periodic orbits , strange attractors , and bifurcations are visualized easily with this device . \n the logistic map is , perhaps , the simplest example of how a nonlinear dynamical equation can give rise to very complex , chaotic behavior . \n @xcite initially introduced as a mathematical model of population growth ,  @xcite it rapidly found applications in diverse areas like mathematical biology , biometry , demography , condense matter , econophysics , and computation . \n @xcite the logistic map function is defined as @xmath1 where the factor @xmath2 is a model - dependent parameter representing _ external _ conditions to the system , and @xmath3 is the population in the @xmath4th - period cycle , scaled so that its value fits in the interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n @xcite the function @xmath5 is called an _ iteration function _ because we may find the population fraction @xmath6 in the following period cycle by repeating the mathematical operations expressed in . \n @xcite it is also one - dimensional since there is only a single variable @xmath6 , and the resulting curve is a line . \n we show a photograph of the apparatus setup in fig . \n [ fig01 ] , and its schematics in fig . \n [ fig02 ] .    setup of the logistic map device . \n an array of ten leds are connected to the arduino microcontroller using the same number of @xmath7 resistors . ] \n circuit diagram of the ten leds array connected to the arduino . ] \n the apparatus uses an open - source arduino prototyping platform made up of an atmel avr processor ( microcontroller ) . \n it has 14 digital input / output pins , 6 analog inputs , a 16 mhz crystal oscillator , a usb connection , a power jack , an icsp header , and a reset button . \n @xcite arduino is a registered trademark  only the official boards are named `` arduino''so clones usually have names ending with `` duino . '' \n @xcite the arduino can be connected to a computer through the usb port and programmed using a language similar to c++ . \n the program is uploaded into the microcontroller using an integrated development environment ( ide ) . in the arduino world , programs are known as _ \n we connected an array of ten @xmath8 leds to the digital pins of the microcontroller using @xmath7 resistors ( or @xmath9 for dimmer leds ) . \n we also used a solderless breadboard to hook up all the electric components to the microcontroller . \n listing  [ list01 ] shows a simple program ( sketch ) used to operate the microcontroller , and _ visualize _ the logistic map by looking at the array of blinking leds . \n a glowing led represents an iteration of the one - dimensional map , and it is linked with a value in the interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n arduino programs require two mandatory functions : ` setup ( ) ` and ` loop ( ) ` . \n any variable or constant defined outside these two functions is considered to be _ \n global_. in the ` setup ( ) ` function , we tell the microcontroller that there are 10 leds connected to the digital pins and that they are intended to be turned on and off . in the ` loop ( ) ` function , the logistic map is iterated , and the visualization process takes place as we observe the leds turning on and off , one after another , following the evolution of the nonlinear system .    using the ` if ( ) ` and ` else ` control structures , we divide the interval @xmath0 $ ] in ten identical segments and associate an led to each one of them . \n for example , the first led from the left represents the first interval segment @xmath10 , the second led represents the segment @xmath11 , and so on . \n the last led represents the final segment @xmath12 $ ] . \n when the microcontroller iterates the logistic map , a value belonging to one of these ten intervals is returned , and the corresponding led turns on for 500 milliseconds . \n this process is repeated infinitely , so we can observe the _ orbit _ followed by the logistic map by watching at the blinking leds sequence . \n cobweb diagrams for the logistic map for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath13 . \n the @xmath14 line , @xmath15 , is used to find the fixed points and follow the iteration process . \n plots ( a ) and ( b ) show the presence of attractors at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . \n plot ( c ) displays a period doubling bifurcation , and ( d ) the onset of chaos . ] \n the initial conditions for the logistic map can be changed anytime and uploaded again into the microcontroller . \n thus , we can explore the behavior of the chaotic map when different values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath13 are chosen . \n it is amusing to study the bifurcations of the logistic map by looking at the blinking sequence of leds . \n we start with the parameter values @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . \n the led associated with the interval @xmath21 turns on first . \n as the iterations of the logistic map take place , we observe that the sequence of blinking leds moves toward the very first led , which is associated with the segment @xmath10 . \n the sequence ends up with this first led left on indefinitely . \n this evolution is shown in fig . \n [ fig03](a ) , the cobweb diagram of the logistic map for that selection of parameters . for this case \n , @xmath16 is an _ attractor _ , and the domain @xmath0 $ ] forms a _ basin of attraction_.    another example of an attractor happens when @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . \n we see that , after few iterations and blinking leds , there is only one led that remains on indefinitely . \n this led corresponds to the interval @xmath25 . in this case \n , we have a _ fixed point \n _ occurring at @xmath17 . as it is shown in fig . \n [ fig03](b ) , the orbit of the map follows a square spiral that converges into that fixed point . \n now , if @xmath26 and @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) , we can observe a 2-_period cycle _ ; the value of @xmath6 oscillates between 0.558 and 0.765 , and the two corresponding leds turn on and off intermittently . here , the fixed point @xmath28 becomes a _ \n repeller_. figure  [ fig03](c ) shows the periodic behavior of the logistic map for this set of parameters . \n unfortunately , higher periodicity ( like 4-period , 8-period cycles , or higher ) can not be observed clearly with this device because of the way the leds are mapped into the @xmath0 $ ] interval . \n more leds are required to improve the `` resolution '' of the device \n . however , the microcontroller has a limit of 13 digital pins , and other electric components ( like an extra microchip ) need to be incorporated into the circuit if we want more leds controlled by the device .    finally , when @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , chaos onsets.@xcite an `` apparently '' randomness of blinking leds is observed . \n after many iterations , there is no single led that remains on indefinitely , and no single led that has not been turned on at least once . \n the orbit of the logistic map covers all the domain of the interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n figure  [ fig03](d ) shows all points visited by the logistic map orbit after @xmath32 iterations .    .... \n // blinking logistic map      // \n choose the pin for each led    const int nbrleds   = 10 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3962, "GeneratedTokens": 147, "SynthesizedBody": "solute dispersion in porous media is of importance in many fields of science , such as chemistry , groundwater hydrology , oil recovery , etc . \n tracers , dissolved in a fluid flowing through a porous material , will experience dispersion in both the longitudinal ( downstream ) and transverse directions , due to thermal or fickian diffusion and the variability in both flow velocity and direction in the pores . \n tracers injected at one point ( e.g. , a leaking tank polluting groundwater ) will thus spread out into a plume .    over the past decades \n , many models have been proposed to model tracer transport . \n most models relate the dispersion coefficients to the flow velocity ( @xmath0 ) , a characteristic length scale ( the grain size or pore length @xmath1 ) , and the molecular diffusion coefficient ( @xmath2 ) via the dimensionless pclet number pe @xmath3 . due to the use of the microscale @xmath1 , the pclet number is a microscopic property . \n the most basic approach to computing the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration of tracers is provided by the advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) , using separate values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the dispersion coefficients in the longitudinal and transverse direction , respectively . \n to explain the apparently anomalous behavior of the dispersion coefficients observed in experiments , more sophisticated models have been developed , e.g. , flow through random capillaries  @xcite . \n the analysis of  @xcite provided an initial approach to evaluate the macroscopic effects of microscopic pore geometry by means of an averaging procedure . \n percolation theory and continuous time random walks allowed handling long range correlations  @xcite . \n a range of numerical methods have also been applied to the problem , such as network models in which pore connectivity plays an essential role ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n finally , full microscopic modeling of incompressible flow through porous materials has become feasible thanks to modern computing , and considerable successes have been obtained with this method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper \n we propose a new approach to understand the first - order relationship between dispersion and flow velocity ( and hence pclet number ) . \n it is based on a straightforward physical argument involving the competition of diffusion and advection in the pore channels , and leads to an accurate prediction of the observed behavior over the full relevant range of pclet numbers . \n the analysis also reveals the existence of a new material property related to the cited competition and the mesoscopic structure of pore geometry . \n consider the laminar flow of fluid through a regular or random homogeneous porous material . \n the flow is produced by a pressure difference ( head ) applied at opposite ends of the sample of porous material . \n this pressure difference induces a complex flow pattern inside the pores that can be computed exactly using the appropriate equations for an incompressible fluid , with appropriate boundary conditions , cf . \n @xcite .    due to the complexity of the pore structure , \n the flow lines go apart and come together again as they traverse the material , dictated by the pressure head and the pore structure , so that the dispersion of the longitudinal distance @xmath6 among different flow lines tends to grow linearly as a function of the mean longitudinal distance @xmath7 , taken in the direction of the negative pressure gradient . \n regardless of the complexity of the flow pattern inside the porous material , the incompressible flow at every point is linear in the applied pressure head , so the geometry of this flow pattern does not vary as the head is varied . \n this leads to what is known as ` mechanical ' dispersion , with a diffusion coefficient given by @xmath8 where the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath9 has been taken as a measure for the pressure head , and @xmath10 is a geometric proportionality constant . \n thus , the longitudinal dispersion @xmath4 is linear in the mean longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 . a similar argument \n can also be applied to the transverse dispersion , that is likewise linear in the flow velocity , but with a different ( smaller ) proportionality constant due to the significant geometrical angle between the direction of the mean pressure gradient and the direction of the transport : @xmath11 .    into this flow , \n tracers are injected . \n these tracers are not merely advected with the flow , but in addition are subject to random ( thermal ) brownian motion . at zero or very small flow , \n pure thermal diffusion will result , with diffusion coefficient @xmath12 . at large flow velocity , but still in the laminar flow regime , the thermal motion of the tracers can be neglected with respect to the advection , and nearly pure ` mechanical ' dispersion will result , @xmath13 or @xmath5 . \n we expect there to be an intermediate or transitional regime , in which global tracer dispersion should lie somewhere between the thermal and mechanical diffusion limits , but _ a priori _ it is not clear how exactly this dispersion scales with flow velocity .    following a tracer path through the pore channels of the porous material , there will be channels oriented at a small angle to the driving force , in which the mechanical dispersion will tend to dominate over thermal diffusion . \n other channels will be oriented nearly at right angles to the driving force , and there , thermal diffusion will tend to dominate over mechanical diffusion . \n thus , we propose modeling the mixed behavior in this intermediate regime by assuming that transport in each of the successive pore channels traversed by a tracer is dominated by one of the two mechanisms . \n in other words , we assume that a tracer alternately experiences thermal and mechanical diffusion . \n thus , the tracer experiences thermal diffusion for a fraction of time @xmath14 , with thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath15 . alternating with these phases of thermal diffusion \n , the tracer is advected by the flow for a fraction of time @xmath16 , during which it experiences a mechanical dispersion @xmath4 ( proportional to @xmath0 ) . therefore , the total dispersion of the longitudinal distance is the weighted sum of these two : @xmath17 so the net or total longitudinal diffusion is @xmath18 now , as the net longitudinal flow velocity @xmath0 increases , we make the essential assumption that the time fraction @xmath16 becomes progressively longer with respect to @xmath14 as @xmath0 increases . \n this is motivated as follows . as the drive is increased , transport in ever more pore channels \n becomes dominated by mechanical dispersion . \n so the time fraction ratio of mechanical to thermal dispersion a tracer experiences will be an increasing function of the velocity : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a critical velocity ( the velocity where mechanical diffusion starts to dominate globally over thermal diffusion ) . in the limit @xmath25 , one has @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in the limit @xmath28 \n , one has @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . \n both these limits agree with expectation . in the following \n , we will set @xmath31 for simplicity , but leave open the possibility that future studies may reveal more complex functional dependencies . \n to better understand the intermediate regime , we insert @xmath32 , and find @xmath33 which is recognized as a pad approximation . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) has _ \n asymptotic behavior . for @xmath34 , \n one has @xmath35 . for @xmath36 , \n one has @xmath37 . \n but there is also an intermediate regime where @xmath38 . \n this regime occurs for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . summarizing : @xmath41 the intermediate asymptote only appears in full when the two corresponding limits are sufficiently far apart , i.e. , when @xmath42 . \n physically , the left and right asymptotes correspond to the limits in which one of the transport mechanisms ( thermal diffusion and mechanical dispersion , respectively ) dominates . \n the intermediate regime arises when the strength of the mechanical dispersion increases simultaneously with the fraction of time @xmath43 that the tracer is experiencing mechanical dispersion as compared to thermal diffusion . \n experimental data are commonly expressed in terms of @xmath44 versus pe , where @xmath2 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and pe is the dimensionless pclet number . \n the above expressions can be recast in this dimensionless form by substituting @xmath45 and @xmath46 \\{pe , pe@xmath47}. thus , the dimensionless form of eq . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) is : @xmath48    to test the validity of eq . \n ( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) , we have fitted our expression to the numerical simulation data of @xcite and @xcite ( based on micro computer tomography ( ct ) scans of porous sandstone ) . due to the very low noise level of the numerical simulation , \n this test is probably more stringent than testing the model against data from laboratory experiments . \n the fits , shown in fig . \n [ ovaysi ] , are a very good match to the simulated data . \n note , in particular , that the intermediate region ( with logarithmic slope @xmath49 ) is reproduced in full detail . \n transverse dispersion is different from longitudinal dispersion in that the drive is not very efficient in the transverse direction . \n therefore , the transverse mechanical dispersion is not able to compete with thermal diffusion , and thermal diffusion can not be neglected along any part of the tracer trajectory . \n the drive , however , is only effective in pore channels directed at angles less than 90@xmath50 with respect to the mean flow vector , during a fraction of time @xmath16 . \n thus , we get @xmath51 which expresses that thermal diffusion is always operative in the transverse direction , while mechanical dispersion ( with characteristic diffusion coefficient @xmath5 ) is operative only in specific channels , i.e. , for a fraction of the total time . due to the relative inefficiency of the drive \n , this approach is expected to yield less precise results than eq . \n ( [ longitudinal ] ) , and minor corrections to this expression may be needed  @xcite . \n this is left to future work . \n following the same reasoning as before , we immediately find @xmath52    we have assumed that @xmath16 ( or @xmath24 ) has the same value here as with longitudinal dispersion , based on the assumption that the geometrical flow pattern is one and the same for longitudinal and transverse dispersion , although this is only strictly true in the limit of small thermal diffusion . \n the transverse dispersion has two extreme asymptotes that are equivalent to those of longitudinal dispersion , namely : for @xmath34 , one has @xmath53 , and for @xmath36 , one has @xmath54 . \n however , here there is no ` intermediate asymptote ' , but only a very gradual transition from one asymptote to the other , specified via the factor containing @xmath55 in eq . \n ( [ transverse ] ) . \n the transition between asymptotes occurs around @xmath56 .     in dimensionless form , eq . \n ( [ transverse ] ) becomes : @xmath57    a fit of the analytic expressions to an ample collection of measurement data is shown in fig . \n [ delgado ] . \n the figure contains data from 18 different experiments on longitudinal dispersion and 15 on transverse dispersion , spanning an ample range of the schmidt number , @xmath58  @xcite . \n the parameters @xmath59 , pe@xmath47 and @xmath60 were determined from a least - squares fit to the longitudinal dataset . for the transverse dataset , \n the parameters @xmath59 and pe@xmath47 were held fixed at these values , while only @xmath61 was varied . by making a joint fit to all data , \n the obtained parameters represent mean values over the various individual datasets . \n this procedure illustrates the generic dispersional behavior , covering a range of different materials . \n but much better results , with less scatter , are to be expected for fits to an individual dataset .    to illustrate the preceding remark , fig . \n [ carvalho ] shows an example of a fit to an individual longitudinal dispersion dataset . \n the fit is rather satisfactory . \n in previous work @xcite , the available experimental data were analyzed by subdividing the range of pe numbers into individual regimes and describing the dispersional behavior in each of these sections heuristically ( using , e.g. , power - law expressions  @xcite ) .    in fig . \n [ exponent ] we show ( top ) the typical shape of the analytical curves , eqs . \n ( [ longitudinal_dl ] ) and ( [ transverse_dl ] ) , with parameters similar to those used in the examples above ( @xmath62 , pe@xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) . \n the bottom panel in this figure shows the local power - law exponent , computed as @xmath66 the evolution of the local power - law exponent with pe number displays roughly the same behavior as the successive regimes described in @xcite . \n the intermediate regime does not develop fully as the condition @xmath67pe@xmath68 is only marginally fulfilled . thus , the intermediate power - law exponent for longitudinal dispersion only reaches a value of about 1.2 , instead of the maximum of 2 predicted by the model . \n this value ( 1.2 ) is consistent with the value cited in literature for the corresponding range of pe numbers  @xcite . \n in this work , we present a unified model for longitudinal and transverse tracer dispersion in laminar flow in porous media . based on a straightforward physical argument , an analytical expression is obtained that describes the observed behavior over the full available range of laminar flow velocities or pclet numbers .    in literature , it has been customary to use power - law scalings to describe the behavior of @xmath69 , each of which being valid only in a limited range of pe values  @xcite . \n the generic appearance of power - law scalings seemed to indicate that tracer dispersion in porous media was an anomalous transport process , characterized by fractional exponents  @xcite . \n however , in view of the present work , it seems that no anomalous transport mechanisms need be invoked to explain the observed behavior . \n this is a very satisfactory situation , at least for sandbox or glass bead experiments , in which the structure of the medium is not patently fractal . \n the present work has revealed the existence of two numbers that determine the dispersion curves : the critical velocity or pclet number ( @xmath24 or pe@xmath47 ) and @xmath70 . \n pe@xmath47 is a material property that depends on the pore geometry , so that different materials will have different pe@xmath47 values . \n the exploration of the dependence of pe@xmath47 on other material properties may provide further insight into its significance . \n it is of interest to note that we generally find that pe@xmath71 , rather than equal to one , as one might expect for the transition from dominant diffusive to dominant advective transport  @xcite . \n this indicates that the scale at which this transition occurs is larger ( by a factor pe@xmath47 ) than the grain or pore scale @xmath1 . \n also note that the family of three - parameter curves given by @xmath72 and @xmath10 may explain a significant part of the observed data spread mentioned in e.g.  @xcite . \n finally , the intermediate region and the maximum value of the local longitudinal power - law exponent depend exclusively on @xmath70 . \n the analysis we present is consistent with the idea , proposed also by other authors  @xcite , that the main effects of porosity on dispersion can be modelled using a single characteristic mesoscopic length scale ( pe@xmath73 ) , and that the details of the microscopic pore geometry and inertial effects only lead to corrections to this generic behavior . \n the present modeling approach allows determining this mesoscale from the dispersion data . the present work does not pretend to provide the same modeling precision as the empirical scalings provided in the ample literature , but merely to provide improved insight into the generic behavior of tracer dispersion in driven laminar flow through porous media \n this study was carried out within the framework of dgmk ( german society for petroleum and coal science and technology ) research

{"ContextTokens": 3716, "GeneratedTokens": 123, "SynthesizedBody": "silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) have excellent time and photon counting resolutions , among other qualities . \n however , crosstalk and afterpulsing seriously limit the performance of these photon detectors . \n these phenomena are the production of parasitic avalanches in either the pixel where a primary avalanche was triggered ( afterpulsing ) or a neighboring one ( crosstalk ) . \n their main effects are to increase both the count rate and the total charge collected for an input light pulse , e.g. , from a scintillator . \n the physical processes considered in our analysis are illustrated in figure [ fig : processes ] . in the first place , a charge carrier of a primary avalanche \n can be trapped in a crystal defect within the pixel , then when the avalanche has already been quenched , the carrier may be released triggering a new avalanche . \n we refer to this process as afterpulsing due to traps ( ap - traps ) and it has as many components as types of traps in the silicon lattice . in the second place , secondary photons of the primary avalanche may reach neighboring pixels triggering almost simultaneously other avalanches . \n this is the so - called optical crosstalk ( ct - opt ) . \n some sipms incorporate trenches filled with an optical absorber surrounding pixels to prevent this effect , but ct - opt can still be produced by photons reflected on the bottom surface of the detector . \n finally , minority carriers generated in the silicon substrate by secondary photons of the primary avalanche can diffuse back to either the primary pixel or to a neighboring one , contributing respectively to crosstalk ( ct - diff ) or afterpulsing ( ap - diff ) . \n the ct - diff is usually referred to as delayed crosstalk because of the relatively long diffusion times , in contrast to the ct - opt , which is also called prompt crosstalk . \n we presented in @xcite an experimental method and an analytical model to describe the ct - opt in a sipm fabricated by hamamatsu . in the present work \n , our study has been extended with new measurements for the same sipm as well as for a second sipm , also from hamamatsu . \n in addition , we have constructed a statistical model accounting for ap - traps , ct - diff and ap - diff , and preliminary measurements to validate it are shown . \n a similar analysis of afterpulsing and ct - diff in a stmicroelectronics sipm has recently been presented in @xcite . \n the experimental method has been described in detail in @xcite , and only an overview is given here . \n the setup consists of the sipm with the associated bias circuit , a fast amplifier , and a digital oscilloscope to register and store the signals for later analysis . \n two sipms from hamamatsu were tested : the s10362 - 11 - 100c ( the one previously used in @xcite ) and the s10362 - 33 - 100c . \n both detectors have a pixel pitch of 100  @xmath0 m and basically the same characteristics , but the first sipm has 100 pixels while the second one has 900 pixels . \n measurements were performed at dark conditions , that is , an only primary pixel is expected to be triggered at a time . \n so far , we have characterized the intrinsic crosstalk and afterpulsing ( i.e. , no scintillator was attached to the detector ) at room temperature . \n an algorithm has been developed to perform a detailed waveform analysis of the recorded signals . \n this dedicated software calculates numerically the deconvolution of the signal with a negative exponential function that describes the decay of pulses ( time constant of 23  ns for both detectors ) . this way , \n pulses are identified as distinct peaks in the deconvolved signal even if they overlap in the original signal . \n the position and height of the deconvolution peak provide us relative measures of the arrival time and amplitude of each pulse . \n the algorithm resolves and measures the parameters of pulses as close as 6  ns . \n in addition , events with two or more pulses with smaller time differences ( down to @xmath1  ns ) are identified by analyzing the shape and width at threshold level of the deconvolved signal . \n this allowed us to characterize separately the nearly instantaneous ct - opt and the other phenomena that result in delayed secondary pulses . \n a more precise measurement of the pulse amplitude is obtained as the pulse height with baseline substraction . to do that \n , the software performs an exponential extrapolation of the original signal in a small region prior to each pulse . \n the ct - opt gives rise to pulses with amplitudes two or more times higher than that corresponding to only one triggered pixel . \n the relative intensities of the pulse amplitude spectrum measured at dark conditions thus provides the probability distribution @xmath2 of the total number @xmath3 of simultaneously triggered pixels per primary avalanche , i.e. , @xmath4 ct - opt excitations . \n we produced this spectrum using the pulse height with baseline substraction to optimize the resolution in @xmath3 . \n in addition , quality cuts were applied to reject low - amplitude pulses due to pixels that were triggered while being recharged after the last avalanche breakdown . \n we presented in @xcite a statistical model based on the assumption that secondary photons can only reach a certain neighborhood of pixels around the primary one . \n cascades of ct - opt excitations propagating through the whole array of pixels were included , but taking into account that pixels that have already been triggered can not be triggered twice . \n the @xmath2 distribution was then calculated by identifying all the ct - opt `` histories '' that contribute to each probability considering four possible arrangements of neighbors : the 4 nearest neighbors , the 8 nearest neighbors , the 8 l - connected neighbors and all neighbors ( see @xcite for details ) . for simplicity \n , we assumed the same ct - opt probability for any neighbor and ignored the boundaries of the array of pixels for the calculations . \n analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the @xmath2 distribution were also obtained .    in figure \n [ fig : crosstalk ] , the model predictions for the four arrangements of neighbors are compared with the experimental probabilities obtained at a given bias voltage for both the s10362 - 11 - 100c detector ( top plot , taken from @xcite ) and the s10362 - 33 - 100c detector ( bottom plot ) . in particular , the probability ratio ( theoretical over experimental ) is represented versus @xmath3 from 1 to 5 , where the model predictions were normalized so that the first probability @xmath5 matches the experimental one , i.e. , their ratio is unity . \n the error bars of the remaining ratios were determined propagating the uncertainties of the experimental probabilities . \n the comparison includes two previous analytical models described in @xcite , where @xmath2 is assumed to follow a geometric or a borel distribution . \n as explained in @xcite , these two models can be regarded as limit situations of ours .     for optical crosstalk over the experimental ones measured at dark conditions and a given bias voltage . \n results for the two tested detectors are consistent with the hypothesis of the 4 nearest neighbors \n . see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for optical crosstalk over the experimental ones measured at dark conditions and a given bias voltage . \n results for the two tested detectors are consistent with the hypothesis of the 4 nearest neighbors . \n see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]     distribution for the s10362 -

11 - 100c detector as a function of the overall ct - opt probability , defined as @xmath6 . \n the overvoltage , i.e. , bias voltage minus breakdown voltage , at which measurements were performed is also indicated for each data point ( the overall ct - opt probability grows quadratically with overvoltage ) .    the comparisons shown in figures [ fig : crosstalk ] and [ fig : crosstalk_v ] reveal that the only model consistent with our experimental data is the one assuming that ct - opt solely takes place in the 4 nearest neighbors of each pixel . \n this is the case for both tested detectors , which have different array sizes . \n therefore , it can also be concluded that border effects are unimportant to describe ct - opt effects at these conditions . \n at dark conditions , the distribution of the pulse arrival time measured with respect to the previous pulse is a combination of the contributions of both uncorrelated dark noise and correlated secondary pulses ( i.e. , ap - traps , ap - diff and ct - diff ) . \n since we were interested in measuring the probability of secondary pulses per primary avalanche , we obtained this time distribution selecting pairs of pulses in which the first one ( the primary ) has an amplitude corresponding to one only triggered pixel , that is , without ct - opt . \n in addition , this first pulse of the pair was required to be at least 500  ns far from previous pulses to avoid mixing contributions of secondary pulses from different primaries . \n assuming that the total number of secondary pulses of each type per primary avalanche is poisson distributed , the above time distribution can be expressed as    @xmath7 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\left[r_{\\rm dc}+\\sum_i\\lambda_i\\cdot f_i(t)\\right]\\cdot{\\rm d}t\\ , , \\label{eq : afterpulsing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8  ns is the minimum time difference allowed between pulses due to analysis limitations , @xmath9 is the dark count rate , @xmath10 is the mean number of secondary pulses of type @xmath11 per primary avalanche , and @xmath12 is the corresponding normalized time distribution . \n the details of this model , in particular the parameterization of the @xmath12 functions , are still under progress and will be explained in a paper in preparation . \n only the general aspects are given below . \n the @xmath13 distribution for ap - traps was characterized by the product of three factors : a negative exponential distribution describing the release of trapped carriers ; the exponential pixel recharging after the primary avalanche , which is proportional to both the gain and the probability of the secondary avalanche ; and the @xmath14-dependent fraction of afterpulses ( of any type ) with amplitudes above the detection threshold applied in the analysis software . \n the last two factors , which are also applicable to the @xmath13 distribution for ap - diff , account for the steep break of the experimental time distribution between 20 and 30  ns ( see figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] ) and were determined from the time - amplitude information of afterpulses with short delay . \n a monte carlo simulation was carried out to describe the timing and relative contributions of the ap - diff and ct - diff effects ( bottom plot of figure [ fig : processes ] ) . \n values for the physical parameters related to the emission and absorption of secondary photons , the diffusion of minority carriers and the layer configuration of the chip were varied within a wide interval around typical data taken from the literature ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . \n preliminary simulation results showed that the transient time distribution can be properly described by the product of the exponential decay of the number of minority carriers due to recombination mechanisms and a negative power law . \n also , the relative contributions of ap - diff and ct - diff were found to be strongly dependent on the pixel pitch . \n for instance , for a very small pixel pitch of 10  @xmath0 m , the ap - diff component is negligible compared to the ct - diff one , while both components are significant for a pixel pitch of 100  @xmath0 m ( present case ) . \n a fit of our model to experimental data for the s10362 - 11 - 100c detector at an overvoltage of @xmath1  v is shown in figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] , where the contributions of the different types of secondary pulses and of dark counts are represented by thin lines . \n the corresponding accumulated contributions are also shown in the inset of the figure in a linear scale . \n this result corresponds to a given set of parameters assumed in the above simulation , which involves that the @xmath13 distributions and the relative contributions of ap - diff and ct - diff are fixed ( i.e. , only one @xmath15 parameter for both components is let free in the fit ) . in this case , \n two ap - traps components with different mean release time @xmath16 were necessary to describe the data : a fast component with @xmath17  ns and a slow one with @xmath18  ns . \n on the other hand , when letting all the parameters related to ap - diff and ct - diff free , good quality fits were also obtained even omitting any ap - traps component . \n similar results were obtained for the s10362 - 33 - 100c detector ( not shown here ) . \n we are making the simulation more realistic in order to be more restrictive on the fitting parameters . \n ns are also shown in the inset ( linear scale ) . ]    even though the number of ap components has not been determined yet , the sum of the @xmath15 parameters of all the ap components was found to be nearly independent of the assumptions made on the fit . \n the @xmath15 parameter associated to the ct - diff was roughly fit independent as well , because it is basically determined by data at @xmath19  ns , where ap contributions can be neglected . \n these @xmath15 parameters , i.e. , the one for the total contribution of afterpulsing and the one for ct - diff , are represented in figure [ fig : afterpulsing_v ] as a function of overvoltage , showing a pure quadratic behavior , as expected . \n parameters , but using the @xmath13 distributions determined in the fit shown in figure [ fig : afterpulsing ] at a given bias voltage . \n appropriate corrections were applied to account for the overvoltage dependence of the detection threshold effects on the afterpulsing measurements . ]    . \n the uncertainties are statistical only . ] \n we have developed an experimental method based on a waveform analysis to characterize the crosstalk and afterpulsing in sipms . \n results were obtained for the s10362 - 11 - 100c and s10362 - 33 - 100c detectors from hamamatsu at dark conditions and room temperature . \n measurements of optical crosstalk have been compared with an analytical model that we presented in a previous publication . \n our data for both detectors are consistent with the hypothesis that optical crosstalk is only possible between adjacent pixels .    a statistical model of afterpulsing and \n delayed crosstalk has been constructed including a detailed parameterization of the time distributions of the different types of secondary pulses . \n our preliminary results show a significant probability of afterpulsing in both detectors , although the characterization of its components is still under study . \n the delayed crosstalk was also found to be important , mostly at short time . \n these studies are being extended to characterize other sipms and for a larger variety of conditions . \n we intend to apply our models to describe crosstalk and afterpulsing effects on particular experimental cases . \n this work was supported by mineco ( fpa2012 -

{"ContextTokens": 2332, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , two sets of observations have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the interaction between agns and their host galaxies . \n these are observations of high  velocity wide  angle winds emanating from the vicinity of the smbh , which have been detected in a large fraction of agns ; and detection of kpc  scale quasi  spherical outflows in active galaxies , with enough power and mass flow to sweep their host galaxies clear of gas . \n these outflows have kinetic power equal to a few percent of the eddington luminosity of the central black hole and their momentum flow rate is approximately an order of magnitude greater than @xmath7 .    in this paper , we show how the two types of flows can be explained within the framework of agn wind feedback . \n radiation pressure from an accreting smbh expels gas in form of a wind from the nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , which then pushes the ambient gas in the host galaxy and produces an outflow . in recent work \n @xcite we have shown that large  scale energy  driven flows ( see section [ sec : outflow ] ) can indeed drive much of the interstellar gas out of a galaxy bulge on a dynamical timescale @xmath8  yr , leaving it red and dead . \n the remaining mass of the bulge is then similar to the value set by the observed black  hole \n mass relation ( e.g. * ?

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n observations of blueshifted x  ray iron absorption lines corresponding to velocities @xmath14 reveal that the majority of quasars produce such winds . \n the winds have momentum and energy rates @xmath15 \n it is clear that the wind has enough kinetic power to drive the observed large scale outflow , provided that it can efficiently transfer this power to the ism . in order for this to happen \n , two conditions must be satified . \n first , most of the sightlines from the smbh must be covered with diffuse medium . \n second , the wind can not cool efficiently . as the wind hits the ism , it shocks and heats to @xmath16 \n k. at this temperature , the most efficient cooling process is inverse compton scattering of the photons in the agn radiation field @xcite . \n the efficiency of this process drops with increasing shock radius , thus the cooling timescale increases as @xmath17 . \n since the outflow velocity does not depend strongly on radius @xcite , the flow timescale only increases as @xmath18 . \n therefore , there is a critical radius , @xmath19  kpc , within which the shock can be cooled efficiently , whereas outside most of its energy is retained and transferred to the outflow . \n the two cases are called momentum  driven and energy  driven flows , respectively ; their salient features are shown schematically in figure [ fig : outflow ] . \n an efficiently cooled shocked wind gas is compressed to high density and radiates away almost all of its original kinetic energy , retaining and communicating only its pressure , which is equal to the pre  shock ram pressure @xmath20 , to the host ism . \n for an isothermal ism density distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath21 and gas fraction @xmath22 ( the ratio of gas density to background potential density ) the behaviour of the flow depends on the black hole mass @xmath23 @xcite . for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the wind momentum is too weak to drive away \n the swept  up ism , and the flow stalls . for @xmath28 \n the wind drives the swept  up ism far from the nucleus , quenching its own gas supply and further accretion . \n therefore , @xmath29 represents an approximate upper limit to the smbh mass distribution ( see * ?

mentioned argument in favour of the absence of exponential sensitivity is that quantum mechanics is intrinsically linear , and , therefore , quantum amplitudes , which define all measurable properties , are not subject to nonlinear dynamics , which , in turn is required for the onset of classical chaos . moreover , in bound quantum systems , the discreteness of the energy spectrum makes the evolution of any observable periodic or quasi - periodic in contrast to the random behavior generated by the lyapunov instability in the classical domain . \n a related argument is that the heisenberg uncertainty relation does not allow one to define phase space trajectories , which , in turn , makes the notion of diverging phase space trajectories meaningless .    on the other hand \n , it is widely believed that the classical behavior should be restored from the quantum laws of motion in the limit of large quantum numbers . \n if a quantum system has a chaotic classical limit , and if its initial wave function is a very narrow wavepacket , then the subsequent evolution of this wavepacket should follow the classical trajectory for a finite time interval and hence exhibit hypersensitivity to the perturbations of initial conditions . \n the late - time recurrences exhibited by the wavefunction due to the discreteness of the energy levels do not contradict the possible initial instability . \n this is similar to the situation in a bounded classical chaotic system where the local lyapunov instability in the phase space does not prevent two initially diverging trajectories from coming arbitrary close to each other at a later time @xcite . for a macroscopic number of particles , astronomical time scales \n will not be sufficient to observe the above recurrences - quantum or classical . from a somewhat different perspective \n , it can also be argued that the linearity of quantum mechanics should suppress sensitivity to small perturbations only as much as the linearity of liouville s equation does for classical systems @xcite . \n more discussion of related issues can be found , for example , in ref . \n @xcite .    particularly difficult in the above respect \n are nonintegrable macroscopic systems of spins 1/2 , where macroscopic observables , such as the total magnetization , are expected to behave classically , but the individual microscopic constituents , i.e. spins 1/2 , are as far from the classical limit as a quantum system can only be . \n it is natural in the context of this difficulty to adopt the following approach . \n one first substitutes spins 1/2 with classical spins and identifies the signatures of microscopic chaos in the behaviour of a macroscopic observable of the resulting classical system . \n then one looks at the behavior of the same observable for the original spin-1/2 system to see whether it exhibits similar signature . \n the task of identifying macroscopic signatures of microscopic chaos even for purely classical systems has been a long - standing challenge for the statistical physics community . \n one prominent approach was to try to extract the value of kolmogorov - sinai entropy ( the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents of the system ) from the behaviour of a macroscopic observable @xcite . \n this effort did not bring a conclusive outcome , because the true value of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy for macroscopic systems is not accessible either numerically or experimentally@xcite . \n another approach was to look for the the exponential tails of relaxation functions@xcite and power spectra@xcite as signatures of microscopic chaos . \n it led to a number of experimentally verified predictions@xcite . \n however , the difficulty of this approach is that , even though the above tails are indeed generic for chaotic many - particle systems , no quantitative connection is known between the exponential decay constants of these tails and the primary characteristics of chaos , namely , lyapunov exponents of the system . \n recently , we were able to make progress on the above agenda by first investigating the lyapunov spectra of classical spin lattices@xcite and then identifying an experimentally feasible manipulation of a classical spin system that would be able to access system s largest lyapunov exponent@xcite . \n this manipulation is a weakly perturbed time reversal known in statistical physics as `` loschmidt echo '' @xcite and in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) as  magic echo\"@xcite . \n the outcome of our analysis was that loschmidt echoes in classical spin systems exhibit exponential sensitivity to small perturbations of perfect time reversal . \n the constant characterising this sensitivity is equal to twice the value of the largest lyapunov exponent of the system . at the same time \n , we have shown that the corresponding spin-1/2 systems are not exponentially sensitive to small perturbations even in the macroscopic limit , and , therefore , lyapunov exponents can not be defined for them . \n the above conclusions were supported by numerical simulations of loschmidt echoes for spin-1/2 and for classical spin systems . \n the question then arises how the transition from non - exponential to exponential sensitivity of loschmidt echoes proceeds . \n it is known@xcite that the classical limit of quantum spin systems can be obtained by increasing the quantum spin number with the proper normalization of spin operators . \n as far as the loschmidt echoes are concerned , our qualitative reasoning in ref . \n @xcite was that spin-1/2 systems are not exponentially sensitive to small perturbations , because one can not slightly perturb an individual spin projection : any small perturbation creates a superposition of completely unperturbed state and a strongly perturbed state where the spin projection changes by 1 , which means that the spin 1/2 flips entirely . from the above perspective \n , a larger quantum spin @xmath1 has @xmath2 possible values , which means that , if the spin projection is perturbed by 1 , then there is still a range of values for the difference between unperturbed and perturbed evolution to grow before reaching the maximum value of the order of @xmath3 . \n therefore , we expect that the range of nearly exponential sensitivity of loschmidt echoes for systems of macroscopic number of spins @xmath1 to be of the order of @xmath4 . \n the goal of the present article is to verify numerically the presence of the above nearly exponential growth numerically . \n ( 88 , 107 ) ( 3 , 55 ) ( 3 , 0 ) ( 2 , 50)(b ) ( 2 , 100)(a )    in the following , we compute loschmidt echoes for quantum ( @xmath5 ) and classical spin chains consisting of 6 spins with periodic boundary conditions . \n the spins interact with the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents either the quantum operator of the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) projection of a quantum spin on @xmath12 lattice site or the corresponding projection of a vector of length 1 representing a classical spin . \n we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the classical hamiltonian , while for the quantum hamiltonian we divide these values by the factor @xmath15 to match the characteristic timescale of the dynamics with the classical counterpart . \n our loschmidt echo manipulation is similar to nmr magic echo @xcite . \n the system is initially slightly polarized in the @xmath9-direction in the vicinity of the infinite temperature equilibrium and then allowed to evolve under the action of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for a certain time @xmath16 . at time @xmath16 , the sign of the hamiltonian is reversed , and the system evolves under the action of the reversed hamiltonian for another time interval @xmath16 . \n afterwards , the value of the total magnetization in the @xmath9- direction @xmath17 is registered .    in real experiments , \n the reversal of the sign of the hamiltonian is not perfect @xcite . in our simulations , we intentionally introduce violations of the perfect time reversal by two methods :    \\(a ) we apply small random rotations to the spins of the system at the moment of the hamiltonian reversal . specifically , each spin is rotated around the @xmath11-axis by an angle randomly selected from the interval @xmath18 $ ] . \n \\(b ) we add a small random - field perturbation @xmath19 to the hamiltonian @xmath20 during the backward evolution . \n the fields @xmath21 are randomly selected from the interval @xmath22 $ ] . \n we characterize the loschmidt echo response by function @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the averages computed with respect to the probability distributions or density matrices for the initial and the final states of the system respectively . \n it was shown in ref . \n @xcite that for sufficiently small perturbations in chaotic classical spin systems , there is a regime of exponential departure from the perfect time reversal : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system . the above regime sets in after time @xmath16 of the order of @xmath28 required to suppress contributions from smaller lyapunov exponents \n . the smallness of the initial perturbations should be such that @xmath29 in the regime exponential growth . \n eventually , as @xmath16 increases , the system leaves the regime of small perturbations and enters the saturation regime characterized by @xmath30 .    for quantum systems , \n the initial perturbation should be large enough to ( ideally ) make the overlap of perturbed and unperturbed wave functions equal to zero , but , at the same time , small enough to avoid entering the saturation regime immediately . \n the former restriction is of particular concern for finite - size numerical simulations : together with the latter one , it leaves a rather limited growth range for the regime @xmath29 . for macroscopic systems , \n the former restriction is consistent with virtually any physically realizable small perturbations of either external fields or the interaction hamiltonian . \n we computed @xmath31 for the ring of 6 classical spins and the ring of 6 quantum spins @xmath32 described above . in both cases , \n the initial nonequilibrium polarization along the @xmath9-axis was equal to 5% of the maximum polarization . for the classical system , we averaged over an ensemble of @xmath33 different initial conditions for both perturbations ( a ) and ( b ) . \n for the quantum system , it was sufficient , based on the recent results on quantum typicality@xcite , to use one initial quantum superposition state . \n the equations of motion in both the classical and the quantum cases are propagated numerically by a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm . in the classical case , \n @xmath34 was computed following the technique presented in ref.@xcite and was found to be equal to 0.28 . \n both the calculations of @xmath34 and the classical simulations of loschmidt echoes were done for zero total energy and zero total polarization along the @xmath11-axis . \n in fig . 1 , we present the evolution of @xmath35 for both the quantum and the classical spin systems for two types of perturbations ( a ) and ( b ) , together with the fit of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a fitting parameter , and @xmath34 is the directly computed lyapunov exponent . \n we observe that , in the quantum system , @xmath35 exhibits a region of nearly exponential growth by about a factor of 10 , which is consistent with our expectation that ( i ) this range exists , and ( ii ) the growth factor is limited by @xmath38 . \n we further observe that in the regime of nearly exponential growth for the spin-@xmath32 chain , the growth rate is consistent with the rate for the corresponding classical spin system , which is , in turn , equal to @xmath39 with accuracy of about 15 percent . \n ( this small discrepancy requires further investigation . )    for comparison , we include in fig . \n 1(a ) the loschmidt echo for a spin-1/2 chain . \n we define the term `` nearly exponential growth '' as the growth of @xmath35 that can be well fitted by an exponential function over at least a factor of 10 . \n with such a definition , the above chain of spins 1/2 exhibits no range of nearly exponential growth . \n the existence of the region of nearly exponential growth of @xmath35 for a large - spin quantum system indicates that the experiments to determine effective lyapunov exponents in materials with large quantum spins may be feasible . \n we have shown numerically , to as much extent as direct simulations allow , that systems of large quantum spins can produce signatures of exponential sensitivity to small perturbations similar to that of classical chaotic systems with positive lyapunov exponents . \n this result is consistent with the expectation that classical behavior is reproduced by increasing spin quantum number @xmath1 . \n it also indicates that , in solids containing large quantum spins , it is realistic to observe a behavior similar to chaotic lyapunov instabilities with the help of nmr or other experimental techniques . \n 29ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1038/29721 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1038/44762 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1142/s0217979204024689 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevlett.109.034101 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1103/physrevb.3.684 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop _ _ ,  vol . \n ( ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) link:\\doibase 10.1007/bf01646493 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 919243030021, "RequestID": "4e1d17547a284e4f8c8ff5bc04e4190a", "TotalTokens": 3785}

doped ws@xmath0 develops energetically inequivalent band edges at the k and k@xmath2 points , i.e. , spin - valley polarization . \n the advantage of doping the substrate instead of the electronically active material ( the material giving rise to the states close to the fermi energy ) is that impurity scattering is avoided . \n specifically , we replace one s atom in the @xmath6 supercell of ws@xmath0 with an f atom , corresponding to a doping concentration of 2% , in order to simulate the dilute doping limit . \n an earlier study has shown that substitutional f doping at the s site is possible in mos@xmath0 @xcite . \n we calculate the binding energies @xmath18 and obtain values of 4.3 ev for x = f and 6.1 ev for x = s , where @xmath19 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s vacancy , @xmath20 is the energy of an x atom , and @xmath21 is the energy of a relaxed ws@xmath0 monolayer with one s atom replaced by an x atom . \n since the binding energies of f and s are similar , it is likely that substitutional f doping at the s site is also possible in ws@xmath0 . \n experimental support for this conclusion comes from the realization of p doping in mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 @xcite and cl doping in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 @xcite . by comparing spin degenerate and polarized calculations for the doped supercell \n , we obtain an energy gain of 134 mev in the spin polarized case and a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 . \n next to the f atom the charge transfer from the three neighbouring w atoms is reduced from two electrons to one electron ( f@xmath23 state instead of s@xmath24 state ) . \n the remaining electron is located on one of the three w atoms and gives rise to the spatial distribution of spin density shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . \n we obtain a small f magnetic moment of 0.05 @xmath22 , which is also reflected by fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] .    . \n corresponding results for interaction with f -

doped ws@xmath0 smaller distances between the component materials , 3.06   and 2.79  , respectively , as compared to the case of pristine ws@xmath0 . \n this fact can be attributed to the additional magnetic coupling . \n a comparison of the interaction in the cases of pristine and f - doped ws@xmath0 is given in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] in terms of charge density difference plots . \n while the charge redistribution in the van der waals gap is only slightly modified after f doping , compare the top to the bottom row of fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] , the dopant atom is strongly affected , supporting the idea of magnetic coupling . \n we obtain still a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 , carried largely by one w atom . \n this atom realizes a larger distance ( 2.70  ) to the f atom than the other two neighbouring w atoms ( 2.30  ) , very similar to the situation without silicene / germanene . \n in addition , the f magnetic moment is reduced to @xmath27 @xmath22 . \n the band structure of silicene / germanene shows significant alterations in contact with f - doped ws@xmath0 , see fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] . without soc , \n the spin splitting in the valence band is enhanced to 36/91 mev and that in the conduction band to 25/9 mev . \n this fact is expected to simply reduce the band gaps , however , we observe in both cases the creation of an in - gap band just below the fermi energy . \n analysis of the orbital character of this band shows that it arises almost purely from the f impurity . \n for the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n the soc is neglected ( left ) or taken into account ( right ) . \n the f impurity band is shown in black color . \n , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +   for the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n the soc is neglected ( left ) or taken into account ( right ) . \n the f impurity band is shown in black color . \n , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    broken time - reversal symmetry due to the spin polarization in f - doped ws@xmath0 induces spin - valley polarization in silicene / germanene when the soc is taken into account , see fig . \n [ fig : fig5](b / d ) . \n specifically , the spin splitting in the valence / conduction band ( not counting the f impurity band ) is smaller / larger at the k than at the k@xmath2 point . for silicene \n we obtain values of 28 mev and 40 mev for the valence band and 27 and 24 mev for the conduction band , respectively . \n more importantly , valley polarization of 7 mev is created in the silicene valence band and one of 2 mev in the conduction band . for germanene these effects \n are enhanced , with spin splittings of 74 mev and 111 mev ( valence band ) as well as 4 mev and 5 mev ( conduction band ) at the k and k@xmath2 points , respectively . \n the valley polarization here amounts to 28 mev and 16 mev for the germanene valence and conduction bands , respectively , which opens a route to spin - valley polarization even at room temperature . in order to demonstrate that the k and k@xmath2 valleys are virtually not affected by the symmetry breaking in f - doped ws@xmath0 , \n as they belong almost purely to silicene / germanene , we show in fig . \n [ fig : fig6 ] for the silicene system the band structures of the 2 k and 2 k@xmath2 points not covered by fig . \n [ fig : fig5](a / b ) . \n we observe no lifting of the valley degeneracy in the case without soc and exactly the same valley structure as before in the case with soc . \n we also have checked that the spin hybridization at the valleys is negligible . moreover , while the f impurity band is located next to the fermi energy , the f states are spatially separated from the si / ge states and therefore do not limit exploitation of the spin - valley polarization .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that silicene and germanene in proximity to monolayer ws@xmath0 develop sizeable band gaps ( due to inversion symmetry breaking ) and spin splittings ( due to proximity soc ) . \n f doping of ws@xmath0 results in spin polarization with a total magnetic moment of 1 @xmath22 , since the charge transfer from the three neighbouring w atoms is reduced . \n the remaining spin polarized electron is largely located on one w atom . \n our main finding is that f -

0.1 dex ) that plague stellar chemical composition analyses ( asplund 2005 ) . \n solar analogs , which are g0-g5 dwarfs , and solar twins , stars almost identical to the sun ( cayrel de strobel 1996 ) , are important in this context , in particular solar twins , because due to their similarity to the sun a highly differential analysis will cancel most systematic errors .    thus , the first step in accurate comparisons of the sun to other stars is to find solar twins . \n after many years of intensive search ( see review by cayrel de strobel 1996 ) , porto de mello & da silva ( 1997 ) found the first solar twin , 18 sco [ hd 146233 ] , which is much closer to the sun than previous candidates like 16 cyg b [ hd 186427 ] ( see e.g. fig . 2 of melndez et al . 2006 ) . \n more recent surveys have largely increased the number of solar twins in the field ( melndez et al . \n 2006 ; melndez & ramrez 2007 ; takeda et al . 2007 ; \n melndez et al . \n 2009 ; ramrez et al . 2009 ) as well as in the open cluster m67 ( pasquini et al . \n the most productive survey at high resolution ( r @xmath3 60,000 - 110,000 ) is being undertaken by our group . \n most northern solar twin candidates were observed with the 2.7 m telescope at the mcdonald observatory , and complemented with data obtained at the keck observatory . \n the southern targets were observed using the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope at las campanas , complemented with recent ( august 2009 ) vlt observations .    our solar twin project started in 2002 , when only one solar twin was known . in order to improve our chances of finding solar twins , we first expanded the color - temperature relations of alonso et al . \n ( 1996 ) to other photometric systems ( melndez & ramrez 2003 ) , allowing us to use existing photometry in other systems ( e.g. geneva ) to select the best targets . \n we later improved the calibrations adding more stars and including new homogeneous systems like tycho ( @xmath4 ) and 2mass ( ramrez & melndez 2005 ) . \n although our first solar twin proposal in 2004 did not fly , the same year a more `` exciting '' proposal on li in halo stars was granted a few nights with keck . a small amount of that observing time was devoted to twin candidates , resulting in the discovery of the second solar twin ( hd 98618 ; melndez et al . 2006 ) and revealing that our temperature scale ( and that of alonso et al . \n 1996 ) , although precise , have probably a zero - point issue . \n our new selection of candidates from the hipparcos catalog took into account a preliminary zero - point offset , which has been recently confirmed by analyses of solar twins and used for improved temperature calibrations ( casagrande et al . \n 2009 ) . \n new solar twin proposals at mcdonald and magellan at las campanas ( through australian access ) during 2006 were successful . \n the first observing run at mcdonald in april 2007 allowed us to identify the best solar twin known to date , hip 56948 ( melndez & ramrez 2007 ) , which is not only very similar to the sun physically , but has also a low li abundance similar to solar . \n its status of best solar twin has been recently confirmed by takeda & tajitsu ( 2009 ) . on the other hand , \n the magellan observations at las campanas are opening new windows for astrophysics of the 0.01 dex level in chemical abundance accuracy . \n new observations taken recently at the vlt with uves and crires , promise to achieve even better precision ( 0.005 dex , @xmath31% ) , and to use solar twins to set tight constraints on li and be depletion in the sun ( e.g. do nascimento et al . \n 2009 ) .     of the sun and the mean values in the solar twins as a function of @xmath5 . \n the abundance pattern shows a break at @xmath5 @xmath6 k. the solid lines are fits to the abundance pattern , while the dashed lines represent the standard deviation from the fits . \n the low element - to - element scatter from the fits for the refractory ( @xmath7 dex ) and volatile ( @xmath8 dex ) elements confirms the high precision of our work . \n observational errors ( including errors in both the sun and solar twins ) are shown with dotted error bars , while the errors in the mean abundance of the solar twins are shown with solid error bars . , \n our observations taken with the mike spectrograph and the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope at las campanas , have definitely shown , for the first time , that the sun has a peculiar chemical composition ( melndez et al . \n 2009 ) . as can be seen in fig . \n 1 , the difference in chemical abundances between the sun and the mean value of the solar twins does not cluster around zero . \n instead , the abundance differences have a remarkable correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements ( lodders 2003 ) . \n this peculiarity has been recently verified by ramrez et al . \n ( 2009 ) using mcdonald observations .    a fascinating possibility to explain the chemical anomalies of the sun is that they are related to its properties as a host of terrestrial planets . \n a particularly striking circumstance is that the inner solar system planets and meteorites are enriched in refractories compared to volatiles ( e.g. alexander et al . \n 2001 ) , with a break at @xmath5 @xmath31200 k , identical to the break at @xmath5 @xmath31200 - 1250 k detected in the solar abundance pattern ( fig . \n 1 ) . the abundance pattern of meteorites is a mirror - image of the solar pattern relative to the solar twins . \n also , a radial gradient exists , with greater enhancement of refractories at smaller heliocentric distances ( palme 2000 ) . \n the break in the chemical abundance pattern at @xmath9 k ( fig . \n 1 ) , suggests that the volatiles retained their original abundances both in the sun and the solar twins . \n such temperatures are only encountered in the inner parts ( @xmath10 au ) of proto - planetary disks ( ciesla 2008 ) , which also suggests that the abundance pattern is related to the presence of terrestrial planets . \n furthermore , iron meteorites ( like those we see in museums around the world ) were probably formed in the terrestrial planet region and may be a remnant of earth forming material ( bottke et al . \n 2006 ) , hence being perhaps formed from the iron missing in the sun . \n the amount of dust - depleted gas required to explain the solar abundances is similar to the mass of refractories locked up in mercury , venus , earth and mars ( melndez et al . \n thus , it is tempting to speculate that the formation of the terrestrial planets might have given the sun its special surface composition . \n the disk masses during the t tauri phase are @xmath11 @xmath12 but larger values are possible , providing thus enough material to change the solar photospheric composition \n . however it may be a problem with time - scales since proto - planetary disks are observed to have typical life - times @xmath13 myr ( sicilia - aguilar et al . \n 2006 ) , but the deep solar convection zone at that time would have erased the planetary signatures , unless the proto - solar nebula was abnormally long lived so that the dust - depleted gas was accreted @xmath320 myr later when the solar convection zone was thin . \n another possibility is that the early sun was never fully convective , as shown by the dynamical star - formation calculations with a time - dependent convection treatment of @xcite and @xcite , making it easier to imprint the signatures of other earths ( nordlund 2009 ) . \n we have also analyzed a sample of 10 solar analogs from planet surveys , four having inner giant planets , while for the other six no planets have been detected yet . \n our analysis shows that all solar analogs with giant planets differ from the sun but closely resemble most solar twins . \n thus , the odd solar composition is not due to giant planets as such , but probably related to terrestrial planets . \n indeed , only two of the six solar analogs without close - in giant planets have abundances that differ significantly from the solar pattern . \n the fraction of stars with the solar pattern seems thus tentatively related to the presence of giant planets on close orbits : @xmath14% when having such planets and @xmath15% for solar - type stars in general , and @xmath350%-70% without close - in giant planets . \n although the statistics has to be improved considerably , the numbers are clearly tantalizing . \n although the samples are still relatively small , considering both the magellan ( melndez et al . 2009 ) and mcdonald ( ramrez et al . 2009 ) samples , we conclude that about 10 - 20% of stars _ physically _ similar to the sun have also _ chemical _ similarities to our sun and therefore they may be hosting terrestrial planets like our own earth .    a complete high precision spectroscopic survey of solar twins is urgently needed in order to know which stars may be the best candidates of hosting solar system twins and to improve the statistics on the fraction of stars hosting other earths and perhaps life .", "StartTimeOffset": 941309291945, "RequestID": "d4274aec0d8b4a40b76df92243d0129c", "TotalTokens": 2904}

selection of the corsika showers : the number of muons ( n@xmath2 ) measured by kascade - grande is used as discriminator for this purpose . \n 200 conex showers for proton and 100 for iron are simulated with qgsjet ii.03 and urqmd respectively for high and low energy interaction @xcite . the conex shower which can best reproduce the measured n@xmath2 \n is chosen and simulated with coreas . in this way a specific shower similar to what has been detected by kascade -

confirmed with the lopes measurements to be the best place for the primary energy analysis . \n the uncertainty for the energy reconstruction achieved is the combined energy resolution of both kascade and lopes . the value is around 26% , and it is comparable to the statistical uncertainty of the kascade experiment . \n one can conclude that the energy resolution of lopes seams to be better than 26% .    by using the updated coreas simulations , the systematic shift in the x@xmath0 reconstruction to smaller x@xmath0 values , typical of older analysis , \n is solved . \n the x@xmath0 obtained for the lopes measurements are now comparable with expectations . \n + moreover , an upper - limit precision of 96  g/@xmath16 is found with the lopes measurements , being the highest precision on x@xmath0 sensitivity to date achieved with the radio data . \n higher precision is predicted by the slope method applied on pure simulations for both the energy ( @xmath15 ) and the x@xmath0 reconstruction ( @xmath750  g/@xmath16 ) . \n it may be achieved by experiments with a lower noise background . + \n this is the case for aera ( auger engineering radio array ) @xcite , located at the pierre auger observatory , and tunka -

{"ContextTokens": 3730, "GeneratedTokens": 331, "SynthesizedBody": "recent years have witnessed exciting developments both in the observations and theoretical modelling of the abundance star to star variations within most of the well studied globular clusters ( gcs ) . in most gcscen , \n in which the heavy elements spread and the hr diagram morphologies clearly show that we are dealing with several stellar generations , enriched by the supernova ejecta . ] only the light elements that are susceptible to abundance changes from proton - capture reactions , such as the pp , cn , on , nena , and mgal cycles , exhibit star - to - star abundance variations , far in excess of the modest dispersion seen in halo field stars  see , e.g. , @xcite , kraft ( 1994 ) , sneden ( 1999 ) , @xcite . \n observations of these abundance spreads at the turnoff and among the subgiant stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) have shown that these anomalies must be attributed indeed to some process of self  enrichment occurring at the first stages of the life of the cluster . \n the massive agb envelopes are the ideal place to manifacture elements through nuclear reactions in which proton captures are involved , as , especially for low metallicity , they are subject to hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) : the convective envelope reaches the hydrogen burning shell , and the products of burning are convected to the surface of the star and are given back to the intracluster medium by means of the stellar wind and the planetary nebula ejection .    today , the most popular explanation of the observed chemical anomalies , first proposed by cottrell & dacosta ( 1981 ) and dantona \n , gratton & chieffi ( 1983 ) , and recently adapted , is that these winds , collected in the central regions of the cluster , initiate a second stage of more or less continuous star formation lasting not more than 200myr . \n this model , which we will now call the _ standard self enrichment scenario _ \n , received * an interesting hint * by the interpretation of some peculiar horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies in terms of helium enrichment of the gas from which a fraction of stars were born @xcite . \n the chemical anomalies are correlated with the hb morphology ( e.g. catelan & freitas pacheco 1995 ) , and high helium abundances ( which are also found in the envelopes of the massive agbs subject to hbb ) seem to be the best explanation for the hb blue tails and for the peculiar blue main sequences in @xmath2cen @xcite and in ngc2808 @xcite .    in spite of the appealing features of the standard self \n enrichment scenario , a quantitative reproduction of the observed abundance spreads mainly of the oxygen vs. sodium and of the aluminum versus magnesium anticorrelations , for which abundant data are given in the recent astronomical literature is not available @xcite . in the recent literature \n indeed it is stated that quantitative considerations reveal a number of serious problems and  the current theoretical yields and chemical evolution models do not favour the agb pollution scenario ( with intermediate - mass agbs ) as the mechanism responsible for star - to - star abundance variations in globular clusters \" @xcite or that  the notion that massive agb stars are the origin of the o  na abundance anticorrelation in gc giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study \" @xcite . \n most of these problems , however , are present in the computations which rest on mlt standard stellar models of low convective efficiency , due to which the hbb temperatures are not large enough to allow efficient on cycling . \n the recent models by @xcite , who indeed take care of developping an entire chemical evolution model , fail to reproduce the o \n na anticorrelation and most of the other chemical anomalies mainly due to this choice of convection modelling . by tradition \n , our group adopts the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model by @xcite , whose high efficiency allows strong on cycling . \n recently , @xcite have shown in detail that the modelization of the nuclear yields is enormously dependent on the efficiency of the adopted convection model and , indirectly , on the efficiency of mass loss . \n some problems of other modellers , e.g. the high increase in the cno total abundances , which _ is not _ found in the observations @xcite , is in fact due to the high number of third dredge up ( tdu ) episodes , due to the comparatively low luminosity of the models with respect to the luminosity of the fst models . in spite of this improvement , our most recent models @xcite reproduce in a satisfactory way the o  na anticorrelation only for a limited range of masses ( 3.5 - 4.5 ) , and are not consistent with the mg - al anticorrelation .    in this paper , we show that we can modify our models in order to solve these problems , and thus we are closer to the complete solution of this appealing conundrum . \n the guide - line of this study was to build agb stellar models whose ejecta are consistent with the chemistry of the most contaminated stars within gcs , i.e. : a ) strong enhancement of aluminum and fluorine ; b ) a positive yield of sodium ; c ) a large depletion of oxygen ; d ) a ( c+n+o ) sum increased by no more than a factor of @xmath3 . \n we show that the correlation of sodium with aluminum , and the anticorrelations of sodium versus oxygen and fluorine , can all be reproduced by assuming a modest extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope in addition to a very efficient convection model . \n we focus our attention on a typical massive agb model , of mass m=5 ; the adopted chemistry is ( z , y)=(0.001,0.24 ) . the complete description of the physics of the models is given in @xcite . \n the detailed study of the production of elements during the agb evolution requires computation of complete stellar models including nuclear processing by hbb , coupled with non  instantaneous mixing . \n we adopt a network of 30 isotopes from hydrogen to silicon . \n the standard cross sections adopted in the code are from @xcite . \n the abundances we adopt in the computation are solar scaled , due to the present limitation of opacities and equation of state in our code . actually , the @xmath4 elements in popii stars are enhanced by @xmath5 dex ( e.g. gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 ) , and the initial value of cno abundances affect the detailed nucleosynthesis . \n however we have made test models concerning the important oxygen abundance bahaviour , showing that the logarithmic decrease of oxygen abundance is roughly the same . \n consequently , if we had started , e.g. , from an oxygen overabundance of + 0.3dex , the final abundance would have been 0.3dex larger than that found in our model . \n convection is modelled according to the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) treatment by @xcite , which provides at the bottom of the convective envelopes temperature larger than the corresponding mlt models with @xmath6 @xcite .    the standard mass loss law adopted in our models ( e.g. * ? \n * ) is from @xcite , who modifies the reimer s formula in order to simulate the strong mass loss suffered by these stars as they climb along the agb . \n the @xmath7 parameter in this formulation is set to 0.02 . \n the strong depletion of oxygen needed to match the observed abundances of the bulk of the stars showing chemical anomalies in gcs ( @xmath8 dex ) requires very high temperatures at the base of the external envelope , that can be hardly achieved in the framework of the mlt modelling of convection ; the recent observations of giant stars in m4 @xcite , indicating a strong fluorine depletion ( @xmath9 dex ) , also point towards the same direction . \n the problem most difficult to overcome is that models depleting oxygen destroy sodium as well @xcite . \n when an efficient tdu is invoked , the sodium abundance can increase by even a factor of @xmath10 , that is at odds with the highest observed value in the m13 giants ( @xmath11 dex ) ; besides , in these same models the ( c+n+o ) sum would be much larger than observed . as discussed , the models by @xcite reproduced the oxygen depletion and sodium enhancement only for a small range of masses . \n in addition , the range of @xmath12 enhancement was a major problem of these models . \n we investigate now the effects that a small amount of extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope might have on the chemistry of the ejecta , by assuming that convective velocities decay exponentially inwards beyond the formal border fixed by the schwartzschild criterion . \n the difference between the present model and the model of the same mass presented in ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) is that the parameter @xmath13 connected with the extra - mixing is not set to zero , but is allowed to vary between @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the value used to simulate overshooting from the border of the convective core of intermediate mass stars during the phase of h - burning , that was calibrated in order to reproduce the observed main sequences of open clusters ( ventura et al . \n 1998 ) .    figs . \n [ ejecta1 ] and [ ejecta2 ] show the evolution ( in terms of variation with mass , that is obviously decreasing with time ) of the surface abundances of some key - elements of 5models calculated with different @xmath13 s . \n first , we note that large depletion of oxygen and fluorine can be easily achieved when the fst treatment is used for convection modelling . \n we also confirm , ( left panel of fig . \n [ ejecta1 ] , solid line ) that sodium can not be produced if a straight schwartzschild criterion is used to locate the base of the surface convection . \n conversely , if some extra - mixing is assumed , the surface sodium increases following each tp , due to the dredge - up of @xmath16 , later converted to @xmath17 ; this holds particularly during the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the surface convective region is decreased by mass loss . \n another bonus of these models is that the small total number of tps prevents from obtaining a final sodium abundance largely exceeding the initial value . \n [ ejecta1 ] ( right panel ) shows that the larger is @xmath13 the larger is the oxygen content of the ejecta , as this latter element can also be dredged - up following each tp if the base of the convective envelope penetrates deeply into the ashes of the former @xmath18 shell . \n we find that a value @xmath19 leads to ejecta whose chemical composition is both sodium rich ( @xmath20=+0.4 $ ] ) and oxygen poor ( @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] ) , and can thus take account of the observed anticorrelation sodium versus oxygen . \n the use of @xmath22 leads to a dredge - up parameter @xmath23 gradually increasing along the agb evolution , that reaches a maximum value of @xmath24 at the latest tps . \n * this , combined with the small number of tps in which tdu is achieved ( @xmath25 ) , makes the mass @xmath26 of the processed material to be @xmath27 ; we therefore expect a negligible effect on the s - process elements abundances . *    the left panel of fig . \n [ ejecta2 ] also shows that a strong depletion of fluorine is achieved in all cases ; the mass expelled by the @xmath22 model has @xmath28 \\sim -1.2 $ ] , a result that is in agreement with the analysis by smith et al . ( 2005 ) regarding the fluorine abundance variations in red giants of m4 ( see their fig.4 ) . \n the central panel shows that when using the higher limit of the nacre rates for @xmath29 and @xmath30 proton capture reactions it is also possible to achieve a strong @xmath12 production , ( @xmath31 = + 0.7 $ ] ) independently of @xmath13 ; this can not be obtained when we adopt the recommended nacre cross sections ( long - dashed line ) . finally , the right panel of fig . \n [ ejecta2 ] shows the evolution of the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , with respect to the initial value . \n we see that the model calculated with @xmath22 achieves a maximum final abundance increased by a factor of @xmath32 , and the average increase is @xmath33 , that is still consistent with the observations . \n * concerning the magnesium isotopic ratios , the ejecta of our model have @xmath34 and @xmath35 , both sensibly greater than the values ( @xmath36 ) observed by yong et al.(2005 ) in the most polluted stars of ngc6752 : we recall , however , that the theoretical estimate of relative abundances of the magnesium isotopes is affected by the uncertainties related to the cross section of the reactions of proton and @xmath4 captures by the heavy magnesium isotopes , and the @xmath4 captures by @xmath16 nuclei . * \n in this work we present results of detailed calculations focused on the agb phase of a typical intermediate mass star ( m@xmath37 ) of metallicity @xmath38 . \n our main finding is that when the fst model is used to deal with convective modelling , the use of a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the outer convective envelope leads to ejecta whose chemical composition reproduces simultaneously most of the chemical anomalies observed in gcs stars .      1 . \n oxygen and fluorine are strongly depleted : we find @xmath21=-0.55 $ ] and @xmath28=-1.2 $ ] . \n when the high nacre limit for the rates of the proton capture reactions by the heavy magnesium isotopes are used , aluminum can be easily manifactured : @xmath31=+0.7 $ ] . \n 3 .   a modest amount of extra - mixing at the base of the convective envelope ( @xmath22 , to be compared with the value @xmath15 that must be used in our models to increase the convective core extension during h - burning , to fit the observed open cluster main - sequences ) triggers some @xmath16 to be dredged - up following each tp ; when the pulse is extinguished , this fresh @xmath16 is converted in sodium , that in the latest evolutionary stages , when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is reduced by mass loss , can survive to proton fusion . \n the overall sodium content of the ejecta is @xmath39=+0.4 $ ] 4 . \n the total ( c+n+o ) abundance , due both to the small number of tps and to the modest efficiency of the tdu , is increase by only a factor of @xmath33 , that is also consistent with the observations . \n the present results give more robustness to the current interpretation that the chemical anomalies among gc stars result from star formation in the intracluster medium polluted by the ejecta of an early generation of massive agbs . \n ventura , p. , mazzitelli , i. & dantona , f.  2004 , proceedings of the joint discussion 04 of the xxiv iau general assembly , sydney , astrophysical impact of abundances in globular cluster stars , eds . f.dantona and g. da costa , mem.s.a.it .", "StartTimeOffset": 964717828020, "RequestID": "ae09941edc7f423ab68a101e735cdf6e", "TotalTokens": 4061}

mass star formation ( minier et al . \n 2003 , xu et al . \n 2008 ) and so are constrained to spiral arms and prominent features of galactic structure . \n we expect high densities of high - mass star formation at the origins of the spiral arms and the ends of the bar and the central velocity of 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission is typically within 3 km / s of the systemic velocity ( szymczak et al . \n , 2007 , pandian et al . 2009 ) . \n these factors combine to make these masers ideal tracers of the structure and dynamics of the milky way , in addition to their benefits to understanding the processes of high - mass star formation . \n the observations involved the initial blind survey with the parkes radio telescope using the purpose - built 7-beam receiver shown in figure 1 and covering a latitude range of @xmath02@xmath1 . \n these were followed by high - resolution observations with the australia telescope compact array in order to position ( to within 0.4 arcsec ) any new sources or sources without previous high - resolution positions . finally , all detections were re - observed with the parkes telescope again , at the precise positions , to obtain high signal  to  noise spectra ( termed ` mx ' observations ) . \n the main survey observations were made between 2006 january and 2007 december , whilst the mx observations were made between 2007 january and 2009 april . \n the techniques of the mmb survey are detailed in full by green et al . \n ( 2009a ) . \n the completion of the survey resulted in the detection of @xmath21000 galactic 6.7-ghz methanol masers and thus established an important legacy resource . \n the survey catalogue is being released sequentially , with the first region covering galactic longitudes 345@xmath1 to 6@xmath1(caswell et al . \n 2010 ) , the second galactic longitudes 6@xmath1 to 20@xmath1 ( green et al . \n 2010 ) , the third galactic longitudes 330@xmath1 to 345@xmath1 ( caswell et al . \n 2011 ) , and the fourth concludes the southern hemisphere portion of the catalogue , presenting detections within galactic longitudes 186@xmath1 and 330@xmath1 ( green et al . \n the last , more northerly region , galactic longitudes 20@xmath1 and 60@xmath1 , is currently in preparation . \n an online database has been set up at www.astromasers.org . \n follow - up observations of the 12.2-ghz methanol maser transition have been made and galactic longitudes 330@xmath1 to 10@xmath1 are presented in breen et al . \n ( 2012 ) and 186@xmath1 to 330@xmath1 in breen et al . \n ( in prep . ) . \n one of the first scientific results of the survey was from the completion of a blind survey of the small and large magellanic clouds ( observed during the non - galactic hours between the main survey observations ) . a new methanol and excited - state hydroxyl maser were discovered ( bringing the respective totals to four and two ) . \n comparison of the abundances of masers within the large magellanic cloud and the milky way shows maser populations are a factor of 10 - 50 times smaller in the large magellanic cloud . in more detail , \n the hydroxyl and water maser populations are about 10 times smaller than our galaxy and thus accounted for by the smaller star formation rate in the large magellanic cloud . in contrast methanol is underabundant by a factor of 50 , with the additional factor attributed to the lower metallicity of the magellanic clouds ( green et al . \n 2008 ) . \n the second result was a simple study of the 3-kpc arms , an inner structure of the galaxy , located between the galactic bars and the spiral arms . \n the near arm has long been known ( van woerden et al . 1957 ) but \n the far - side counterpart was only recently discovered ( dame & thaddeus 2008 ) . \n there has been a continuing question over the existence of star formation within these structures , although some evidence ( e.g. caswell and haynes , 1987 ) existed . \n however , both arms were shown by 6.7-ghz methanol maser detections to clearly exhibit high - mass star formation ( green et al . \n 2009b ) . \n following on from the previous result , 6.7-ghz methanol masers were shown to highlight regions of enhanced star formation indicating the starting points of the spiral arms and the interaction of the ( long , thin ) galactic bar ( green et al . \n furthermore masers also provide many candidates for tracing the full 3-kpc arm structure ( a continuous ellipse rather than separate near and far components ) . \n additionally , the 12.2-ghz methanol companions detected in the follow - up observations were found to have smaller velocity ranges and lower flux densities than their 6.7-ghz methanol counterparts ( breen et al . \n there was an 80% coincidence in velocity of the strongest maser features of the 6.7-ghz and 12.2-ghz transitions . \n the 12.2-ghz are associated with a later evolutionary stage and an increase in velocity range and luminosity with age was found for both transitions . \n a comparison of the sites of 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission with infrared emission as detected by the glimpse survey has been made , and found @xmath380% of the maser sites had associated infrared emission ( gallaway et al . in prep . ) . \n the bright and compact nature of the maser sources makes them ideal for astrometry with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . \n such measurements provide accurate distances ( @xmath010 micro arcsec parallaxes ) and full three - dimensional motion ( @xmath01 km / s ) . \n maser astrometry can provide valuable data for both the structure of our galaxy and its velocity field . \n the nrao very long baseline array , european vlbi network and japanese vlbi network are currently being used , with @xmath230 parallaxes now published , and southern hemisphere observations are underway with the long baseline array .    another area \n that this project has provided the foundation for is in the study of magnetic fields . \n although the 6.7-ghz methanol maser itself can not easily be used for measuring in situ magnetic fields , due to the molecule being non -

{"ContextTokens": 3754, "GeneratedTokens": 156, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of wealth and income distributions has a long history . \n pareto @xcite proposed in 1897 that wealth and income distributions obey universal power laws . \n subsequent studies have often disputed this conjecture ( see a systematic survey in the world bank research publication @xcite ) . \n mandelbrot @xcite proposed that the pareto law applies only asymptotically to the high ends of the distributions . \n many researchers tried to deduce the pareto law from a theory of stochastic processes . \n gibrat @xcite proposed in 1931 that income and wealth are governed by multiplicative random processes , which result in a log - normal distribution . \n these ideas were later followed , among many others , by montroll and shlesinger @xcite . however , already in 1945 kalecki @xcite pointed out that the log - normal distribution is not stationary , because its width increases in time . \n modern econophysicists @xcite also use various versions of multiplicative random processes in theoretical modeling of wealth and income distributions .    unfortunately , numerous recent papers on this subject do very little or no comparison at all with real statistical data , much of which is widely available these days on the internet . in order to fill this gap , we analyzed the data on income distribution in the united states ( us ) from the bureau of census and the internal revenue service ( irs ) in ref . \n we found that the individual income of about 95% of population is described by the exponential law . \n the exponential law , also known in physics as the boltzmann - gibbs distribution , is characteristic for a conserved variable , such as energy . in ref . \n @xcite , we argued that , because money ( cash ) is conserved , the probability distribution of money should be exponential . \n wealth can increase or decrease by itself , but money can only be transferred from one agent to another . \n so , wealth is not conserved , whereas money is . \n the difference is the same as the difference between unrealized and realized capital gains in stock market . \n unfortunately , we were not able to find data on the distribution of money . \n on the other hand , we found data on wealth distribution in the united kingdom ( uk ) , which are presented in this paper . also presented \n are the income distribution data for the uk and for the individual states of the usa . in all of these data , \n we find that the great majority of population is described by an exponential distribution , whereas the high - end tail follows a power law . \n in this section , we discuss the cumulative probability distribution of wealth @xmath0=(the number of people whose individual wealth is greater than @xmath1)/(the total number of people ) . \n a plot of @xmath2 vs.  @xmath1 is equivalent to a plot of person s rank in wealth vs. wealth , which is often used for top reach people @xcite . \n we will use the power law , @xmath3 , and the exponential law @xmath4 , to fit the data . \n these distributions are characterized by the exponent @xmath5 and the `` temperature '' @xmath6 . \n the corresponding probability densities , @xmath7 , also follow a power law or an exponential law . \n for the exponential law , it is also useful to define the temperatures @xmath8 ( also known as the median ) and @xmath9 using the bases of 1/2 and 1/10 : @xmath10 . \n the distribution of wealth is not easy to measure , because people do not report their total wealth routinely . \n however , when a person dies , all assets must be reported for the purpose of inheritance tax . using these data and an adjustment procedure , the british tax agency , the inland revenue ( ir ) , reconstructed wealth distribution of the whole uk population . in fig . \n [ fig : ukwealth ] , we present the 1996 data obtained from their web site @xcite . the left panel shows the cumulative probability as a function of the personal total net capital ( wealth ) , which is composed of assets ( cash , stocks , property , household goods , etc . ) and liabilities ( mortgages and other debts ) . \n the main panel illustrates in the log - log scale that above 100  k@xmath11 the data follow a power law with the exponent @xmath12 . \n the inset shows in the log - linear scale that below 100  k@xmath11 the data is very well fitted by an exponential distribution with the temperature @xmath13  k@xmath11 ( @xmath14  k@xmath11 and @xmath15  k@xmath11 ) . \n the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : ukwealth ] shows the so - called lorenz curve @xcite for wealth distribution . \n the horizontal and vertical coordinates are the cumulative population @xmath16 and the cumulative wealth @xmath17 : @xmath18 the points represent the actual data , whereas the solid line is calculated for a purely exponential distribution @xcite : @xmath19 one can see that the data systematically deviate from the exponential law because of the wealth concentrated in the power - law tail ; however , the deviation is not very big . \n the so - called gini coefficient @xcite , which measures the inequality of wealth distribution , has increased from 64% in 1984 to 68% in 1996 @xcite . \n this value is bigger than the gini coefficient 50% for a purely exponential distribution @xcite . \n the inequality of the us income distribution was also increasing during that time period @xcite . \n we obtained the data on the yearly income distribution in the uk for 1997/8 and 1998/9 from the web site of the ir @xcite . the data for 1994/5 , 1995/6 , and \n 1996/7 were taken from the annual abstract of statistics derived from the ir @xcite . \n the data for these 5 years are presented graphically in fig . \n [ fig : ukincome ] . in the upper inset of the left panel , \n the original raw data for the cumulative distribution are plotted in log - linear scale . for not too high incomes , \n the points form straight lines , which implies the exponential distribution @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for income ( revenue ) , and @xmath22 is the income `` temperature '' . however , the slopes of these lines are different for different years . \n the temperatures for the years 1994/5 , 1995/6 , 1996/7 , and 1997/8 differ from the temperature for 1998/9 , @xmath23  k@xmath11 ( @xmath24  k@xmath11 and @xmath25  k@xmath11 ) , by the factors 0.903 , 0.935 , 0.954 , and 0.943 . to compensate for this effect , \n we rescale the data . \n we divide the horizontal coordinates ( incomes ) of the data sets for different years by the quoted above factors and plot the results in log - log scale in the main panel and log - linear scale in the lower inset . \n we observe scaling : the collapse of points on a single curve . \n thus , the distributions @xmath26 for different years @xmath27 are described by a single function @xmath28 . \n the main panel shows that this scaling function @xmath29 follows a power law with the exponent @xmath30 - 2.3 at high incomes . \n the lower inset shows that @xmath29 has an exponential form for about 95% of individuals with lower incomes . \n these results qualitatively agree with a similar study by cranshaw @xcite . \n he proposed that the @xmath31 data for lower incomes are better fitted by the gamma distribution @xmath32 . for simplicity , we chose not to introduce the additional fitting parameter @xmath33 \n .    we must mention that the individuals with income below a certain threshold are not required to report to the ir . \n that is why the data in the lower inset do not extend to zero income . \n we extrapolate the straight line to zero income and take the intercept with the vertical axis as 100% of individuals . \n thus , we imply that the ir data does not account for about 25 - 27% of individuals with income below the threshold . \n the lorenz curve for the distribution of the uk income is shown in the right panel of fig . \n [ fig : ukincome ] . \n we treat the number of individuals below the income threshold and their total income as adjustable parameters , which are the horizontal and vertical offsets of the coordinates origin relative to the lowest known data point . \n these parameters are chosen to fit the lorenz curve for the exponential law ( [ eq : yx ] ) shown as the solid line . \n the fit is very good . \n the horizontal offsets are 28 - 34% , which is roughly consistent with the numbers quoted for the lower inset of the left panel . \n we obtained the data on distribution of the yearly individual income in 1998 for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia that constitute the usa from the web site of the irs @xcite . \n we plot the original raw data for the cumulative distribution of income in log - linear scale in the upper inset of the left panel of fig.[fig : usincome ] . \n the points spread significantly , particularly at higher incomes . for example , the fraction of individuals with income greater than 1  m$ varies by an order of magnitude between different states . however , after we rescale the data in the manner described in the preceding section , the points collapse on a single curve shown in log - log scale in the main panel and log - linear scale in the lower inset . \n the open circles represent the us average , obtained by treating the combined data for all states as a single set . \n we observe that the distribution of higher incomes approximately follows a power law with the exponent @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 variation includes 70% of all states . on the other hand , for about 95% of individuals with lower incomes , the distribution follows an exponential law with the average us temperature @xmath36  k$ ( @xmath37  k$ and @xmath38  k$ ) . \n the temperatures of the individual states differ from @xmath39 by the amounts shown in table [ table ] . \n for example , the temperature of connecticut ( ct ) is 1.25 times higher and the temperature of west virginia ( wv ) is 0.78 times lower than the average us temperature . \n @*17c@ ct & nj & ma & md & va & ca & ny & il & co & nh &    ak & dc & de & mi & wa & mn & ga + [ -0.5ex ]    25% & 24% & 14% & 14% & 9% & 9% & 7% & 6% & 6% & 5% &    5% & 5% & 4% & 4% & 2% & 1% & 0% + tx & ri & az & pa & fl & ks & or & hi & nv & nc &    wi & in & ut & mo & vt & tn & ne + -1% & -3% & -3% & -3% & -4% & -5% & -6% & -7% & -7% & -7% &    -8% & -8% & -9% & -9% & -9% & -11% & -12% + oh & la & al & sc & ia & wy & nm & ky & i d &    ok & me & mt & ar & sd & nd & ms & wv + -12% & -13% & -13% & -13% & -14% & -14% & -14% & -14% & -15% &    -16% & -16% & -19% & -19% & -20% & -20% & -21% & -22% +    [ table ]    the lorenz plot for all states is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : usincome ] together with the solid curve representing eq.([eq : yx ] ) . the majority of points are well clustered and are not too far from the solid curve . \n the exceptions are wyoming ( wy ) with much higher inequality and the washington state ( wa ) with noticeably lower inequality of income distribution . \n the average us data , shown by open circles , is consistent with our previous results @xcite . unlike in the uk case \n , we did not make any adjustment in the us case for individuals with income below the threshold , which appears to be sufficiently low . \n we found scaling in the cumulative probability distributions @xmath40 of individual income @xmath21 derived from the tax statistics for different years in the uk and for different states in the us . \n the distributions @xmath26 have the scaling form @xmath28 , where the scale @xmath41 ( the temperature ) varies from one data set @xmath27 to another , but the scaling function @xmath29 does not . \n the function @xmath29 has an exponential ( boltzmann - gibbs ) form at the low end , which covers about 95% of individuals . at the high end \n , it follows a power ( pareto ) law with the exponents about 2.1 for the uk and 1.7 for the us . \n wealth distribution in the uk also has a qualitatively similar shape with the exponent about 1.9 and the temperature @xmath42  k@xmath11 . \n some of the other values of the exponents found in literature are 1.5 proposed by pareto himself ( @xmath43 ) , 1.36 found by levy and solomon @xcite for the distribution of wealth in the forbes 400 list , and 2.05 found by souma @xcite for the high end of income distribution in japan . \n the latter study is similar to our work in the sense that it also uses tax statistics and explores the whole range of incomes , not just the high end . \n souma @xcite finds that the probability density @xmath31 at lower incomes follows a log - normal law with a maximum at a nonzero income . \n this is in contrast to our results , which suggest that the maximum of @xmath31 is at zero income . \n the disrepancy may be due to the high threshold for tax reporting in japan , which distorts the data at the low end . \n on the other hand , if the data is indeed valid , it may reflect the actual difference between the social stuctures of the us / uk and japan . \n the income temperature for the uk in 1998/9 was @xmath44  k@xmath11 and for the us in 1998 was @xmath36  k$. using the exchange rate as of december 31 , 1998 to convert pounds into dollars @xcite , we find that the uk temperature was @xmath45  k$ , which is 1.87 times lower than the us temperature . \n the difference in temperatures indicates nonequilibrium , which can be exploited to create a thermal machine @xcite . \n the gain ( profit ) produced by such a thermal machine is proportional to the difference in temperatures . in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics \n , money would flow from a high - temperature system to a low - temperature one . \n this may explain the huge trade deficit of the usa in global international trade with other , lower - temperature countries . \n the variation of temperatures between different states of the usa is shown in table [ table ] . \n we are grateful to ted cranshaw , who kindly sent us his unpublished study of income distribution in the uk @xcite and data @xcite , and bertrand roehner , who suggested to study income distributions in the states of the usa and sent us link @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1021816153763, "RequestID": "5eab123badcd4284898d640541a0a4f3", "TotalTokens": 3910}

tweedy & napiwotzki 1992 ) . \n since there was no plausible ionizing source in the sdss photometric catalogue , the apm sky survey catalogues were used for further investigation of potential ionizing sources of radiation . in a @xmath50 region centered on @xmath51 @xmath52 one bright candidate ionizing source stood out at @xmath53 @xmath54 j2000 ( epoch 1982 ) , with ukst plate magnitudes and colors of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see figure 4 ) . using the ukst plate as a reference frame the refined apm poss1 ( epoch 1952 ) position of this source is @xmath57 @xmath58 j2000 , giving a high proper motion of @xmath59 , @xmath60 . \n the color , magnitude and proper motion suggested the object was probably a hot wd at around @xmath61100 pc and a search , utilizing simbad , reveals the source is pg  1034 + 001 , a bright , @xmath62 ( landolt 1992 ) , do white dwarf . a very crude kinematic age of @xmath63yr , can be derived from the radius of the pn , @xmath64 at a distance of @xmath65150pc , and a typical expansion velocity of pn , @xmath66 . \n the wd is currently close to the center of the region over which detectable emission is present in the sdss spectra . \n the wd is also in close proximity , @xmath6115 , to the region showing the strongest [ ]  4959,5007 emission , however , the proper motion vector for the wd indicates a position for the wd to the east of the present location at the time the pn was formed . \n if the arc  like feature visible in figure 3 represents a shock , or a boundary , associated with material ejected at the time the pn was formed then a lower limit to the kinematic age for the pn can be estimated by extrapolating the motion of the white dwarf back to the origin of the radius of curvature of the arc . \n the resulting limit on the age , @xmath67yr is plausible but an understanding of the nature of the arc  like feature is necessary to validate the argument . \n an age of @xmath61100,000yr is consistent with all the evidence but measurement of the expansion velocity and a more complete mapping of the morphology of the emission will provide a much improved estimate . \n given that all observations are consistent with a pn nature for the newly discovered nebulosity , we designate it hewett  1 . the proximity of the do white dwarf pg  1034 + 001 ( wesemael , green , & liebert 1985 ) makes it probable that pg  1034 + 001 is responsible for the ionizing radiation . \n werner , dreizler , & wolff ( 1995 ) derived a spectroscopic distance for pg  1034 + 001 of @xmath68pc and confirmation of the association would make hewett  1 one of the closest pns known ( napiwotzki 2001 ) , the @xmath69 diameter corresponding to a physical size of @xmath70pc for the likely distance range of @xmath71pc . \n again , sh 2216 provides the current benchmark , with a trigonometric distance of @xmath72pc ( harris et al . \n 1997 ) and a physical size of @xmath73pc . \n a parallax determination for pg  1034 + 001 would establish whether hewett  1 is even closer .    notwithstanding targeted searches ( werner et al . \n 1997 ) , very few pns are known to be associated with non  da ( hydrogen poor ) white dwarfs . \n hewett  1 may be the first pn to be discovered associated with a do white dwarf , although pg  0108 + 101 ( reynolds et al . \n 1987 ) and pg  0109 + 111 ( werner et al . \n 1997 ) have candidate nebulae , neither detection is regarded as secure . since do white dwarfs are thought to evolve from pg  1159 stars ( see dreizler & werner 1996 , and references therein ) , it will be of interest to compare the properties of hewett  1 both to the pns associated with pg  1159 stars ( napiwotzki 1999 ) and theoretical models ( g ' orny & tylenda 2000 ) . the derivation of a reliable age for the pn associated with pg  1034 + 001 will be of particular interest for constraining the time scales associated with the late  stages of evolution of post - asymptotic giant branch stars and the origin of pg  1159 stars and helium  rich wds . \n eds is grateful for the hospitality of the ioa during his sabbatical visit and we thank alan mcconnachie for assisting with the int imaging observations . \n we are grateful to the anonymous referee who provided a detailed review of the original manuscript . \n this paper includes observations made with the isaac newton telescope , operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias . \n funding for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s . \n department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society . \n the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/.", "StartTimeOffset": 1045932635718, "RequestID": "46011beae7a24f32a404c875bce4eb9e", "TotalTokens": 4073}

nagashima et al . \n 2005 ; bower et al . \n 2006 , 2012 ; guo et al . \n 2011 ; wang , weinmann & neistein 2012 ; mutch , poole & croton 2013 ; puchwein & springel 2013 ; hopkins et al . \n these results imply that another physical effect may also be taking an important role to produce the observed flat faint end slopes .    for the massive end , \n a popular solution to suppress the formation of too massive galaxies is the feedback by active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , bower et al . \n 2006 ; croton et al . \n 2006 ; menci et al . \n 2008 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; guo et al . 2011 ) . \n the agn feedback can also explain the observed trends of the early appearance of massive and quiescent galaxies at high redshifts , and downsizing of star - forming galaxies from high to low redshifts , which are apparently in contradiction with the simple expectation in the @xmath1cdm universe ( e.g. , bower et al . \n 2006 ; somerville et al . \n 2008 ) . however , there are large uncertainties about the physics of agn feedback both in theoretically and observationally . \n the current success in explaining the observed trends by this process is based on rather phenomenological modelings including highly uncertain parameters , and further studies are required to confirm the quantitative influence of this process on galaxy evolution . \n therefore it is still worth to explore yet other physical effects working to shape galaxy lfs , which is the aim of this paper . \n it is reasonable to expect that such an effect would be manifested in the scaling laws about star formation efficiency . \n the relation between the surface densities of star formation rate ( sfr ) and gas ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) has been a subject of intensive research . \n it is popular to fit this relation by a power - law ( so - called kennicutt - schmidt law , kennicutt 1998 ) , but recent observations indicate a cut - off around the total ( i.e. , + h@xmath4 ) gas density of @xmath5 , under which sfr is suppressed and not well correlated with gas density . \n this threshold gas density for sfr can be interpreted as a result of less efficient formation of cold molecular gas under the threshold , while the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) from molecular gas is rather universal in many different environments ( wong & blitz 2002 ; kennicutt et al . \n 2007 ; bigiel et al . 2008 , 2010 ; leroy et al . 2008 \n ; blanc et al . 2009 ; heiderman et al . 2010 ; lada et al . \n 2010 , schruba et al . 2011 \n ; see kennicutt & evans 2012 and schruba 2013 for reviews ) . \n a likely physical origin of the suppression of h@xmath4 formation under the threshold is radiative feedback by uv photons produced by young massive stars ( schaye 2004 ; krumholz , mckee & tumlinson 2008 , 2009 ; mckee & krumholz 2010 ; hopkins et al . 2013 ) . \n the formation of h@xmath4 is driven by collisionally excited metal line cooling and molecule formation on dust grain surfaces , which should be balanced with molecule dissociations by uv photons and grain photoelectric heating , both of which are energetically supplied by uv radiation field . if a region in a galaxy is optically thick to uv radiation field by dust grains , self - shielding of uv radiation would accelerate h@xmath4 formation . \n this implies that the more fundamental threshold about star formation is not the total gas surface density but dust opacity . for a typical dust - to - gas ratio , \n the observationally indicated threshold in @xmath3 is close to the value at which the effective dust opacity @xmath6 becomes of order unity , where @xmath6 is averaged over wavelength with a weight of the heating radiation energy spectrum ( totani et al . \n 2011 ) . \n therefore it is physically reasonable to expect that a galaxy - scale mean value of @xmath6 has an important role in galaxy formation and evolution . \n a further observational support to this picture comes from infrared observations . \n the relations between dust temperature , galaxy size , and infrared luminosity of @xmath71,000 nearby star - forming galaxies indicate that almost all of them are in the optically thick regime , and the distribution of dust opacity estimated by gas - phase metal column density suddenly drops around @xmath8 , indicating less efficient formation of galaxies at @xmath9 ( totani et al . \n 2011 ) . \n the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the radiative feedback depend on dust opacity , on cosmological galaxy formation and evolution particularly about the shape of galaxy luminosity functions . \n the theory of structure formation in the universe predicts that the mean surface density @xmath10 of dark halos with mass @xmath11 and size @xmath12 nearly scales as @xmath13 , indicating higher gas surface density and dust opacity at higher redshifts in more massive objects , and hence more efficient star formation . \n this may have a favorable effect to explain observations , in a similar way to the feedbacks by supernovae and agns .    to investigate the effect quantitatively \n , we use a semi - analytic model ( sam ) of cosmological galaxy formation , _ the mitaka model _ ( ny04 ) . \n this is a model similar to general sams , in which formation and evolution of dark matter halos are solved analytically or calculated by n - body simulations , while complicated baryonic processes are treated phenomenologically ( for reviews , see baugh 2006 ; benson 2010 ) . in general \n , sams has many adjustable parameters and the effects of complicated physical processes on the lfs are degenerate ( e.g. , neistein & weinmann 2010 ) ; therefore a set of best - fit parameters may not be a quantitatively correct description of real galaxy formation . \n it should be noted that the most important aim of this work is to examine the qualitative effects of the new feedback on luminosity functions .    in most of the sams , \n the star formation rate is simply proportional to cold gas mass , and the star formation time scale is modeled as a simple function of the dynamical time scale of galaxy disks or dm halos ( e.g. , cole et al . \n 2000 ; ny04 ) . some models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; croton et al . \n 2006 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; lagos et al . 2011 ; wang et al . \n 2012 ) incorporated the threshold of gas surface density below which star formation activity is significantly suppressed . in the models of kauffmann ( 1996 ) , croton et al . \n ( 2006 ) , and lagos et al . \n ( 2011 ) , they introduced the threshold of gas surface density motivated by the toomre stability criterion on a galactic scale ( toomre 1964 ) . in this scenario the threshold of gas surface density increases with redshift , and hence the threshold effect should be systematically different in the cosmological context from the threshold by dust opacity considered in this paper . \n furthermore , some recent observations indicate that star formation are controlled by the physical state of local interstellar gas , rather than the dynamical state of an entire galaxy ( e.g. , leroy et al . \n 2008 ; lada et al . \n 2010 ) .    in other models , such as somerville et al . \n ( 2008 ) , a critical gas surface density threshold for star formation is introduced motivated from the observations of the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation ; however , to our knowledge there are no sams that consider a feedback depending on dust surface density rather than gas density . \n recently krumholz & dekel ( 2012 ) incorporated a star formation law which depends on gas surface density and gas metallicity , and discussed average evolution of typical galaxies without calculating detailed merger histories of dark halos . \n the relation between the luminosity function shapes and the dust opacity threshold of star formation has not yet been discussed in previous studies . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : \n model ] , we will describe our model particularly focusing on the modelings of star formation and feedback . \n in section [ sec : results ] , we show the results of our model , and section [ sec : gasmodel ] is devoted for discussion . we will summarize our work in section [ sec : summary ] . in this work , \n the cosmological parameters of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are adopted , and all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system .", "StartTimeOffset": 1070999047842, "RequestID": "ad2963d54ea14c0eb857741a94060925", "TotalTokens": 2806}
{"ContextTokens": 3117, "GeneratedTokens": 204, "SynthesizedBody": "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations , and vlbi surveys in particular , have contributed significantly to our understanding of active galaxies . \n for example , the discovery of superluminal motion in these systems provided the first clue that viewing angle was an important parameter in interpreting and eventually unifying different classes of active galaxies , including radio galaxies and quasars ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . \n more recently , vlbi has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary scenario wherein very young compact sources are the precursors of giant extended sources associated with radio galaxies ( taylor et al . \n numerous other advances are summarized in these proceedings .    at ghz frequencies , \n vlbi surveys usually target sources distributed across the sky . \n the sources are also often pre - selected to be strong ( @xmath0  mjy ) and to exhibit flat spectra ( e.g. , beasley et al.2002 ) . \n such samples are largely dominated by intrinsically luminous active galaxies at moderate redshifts @xmath1 . \n self - calibration techniques can be used for such bright sources so calibration overhead is minimal . \n but the observation time @xmath2 per source is reduced by needing to slew the array from source to source . \n also , most observers impose a typical image field of view ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4  milliarcseconds , ensuring that only one source is detected in any given observation time @xmath2 . \n such vlbi surveys are therefore slow and the biases introduced are substantial . \n recent attempts have been made to survey weaker ( @xmath5  mjy ) sources using phase referencing in the switching style . \n such vlbi surveys take advantage of the huge catalog of first sources now available at 1.4  ghz with a resolution of 5 ( white et al.1997 ) . \n these vlbi surveys are usually localized to a region subtending a few square degrees and including a strong phase calibrator close to weaker targets . \n example surveys are presented in these proceedings by gurvits et al . \n ( 2004 ) and by wrobel et al.(2004 ) . \n these surveys are both unbiased as no spectral pre - selection is made and efficient as they minimize array slewing . \n but phase referencing in the switching style causes substantial calibration overhead , leaving a typical observation time per source of @xmath6  minutes . for the weaker vlbi detections , the dynamic range can be 10 or less . for the stronger vlbi detections , \n the dynamic range is often limited by residual phase - referencing errors . \n these limitations mean that jets and other secondary features can easily be missed , making morphological classification difficult . \n although a @xmath7  milliarcseconds is required to accommodate first s astrometric accuracy , this is still small enough to ensure only one target per @xmath3 . \n moreover , the 10-millijy sources from first still involve essentially the same radio source populations that are targeted in the bright surveys ( ivezi et al . \n 2002 ) . \n indeed , at 1.4  ghz most sources slightly stronger than @xmath8  mjy are energized by active nuclei ( e.g. , condon et al . \n 2003 ) . what steps can be taken toward studying the more diverse sub - millijy population at resolutions of , say , 10  milliarcseconds ( 80  pc at @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 ) ? \n sources brighter than 0.1  millijy have an areal density of 0.2 per square arcminute , so about a dozen are expected within the primary beam of a 100-m class antenna . \n therefore , progress can be expected if two technical goals can be reached : achieve wider fields of view and lower detection thresholds , such that many sources can be observed simultaneously with the vlbi array .    for a connected array with short baselines , the @xmath3 is often set by the primary - beam response of the antennas in the array . for vlbi \n this is rarely the case . in vlbi \n , a more demanding limitation is set by the frequency and time sampling used during data correlation . \n this sampling must be fine enough to mitigate the effects of both bandwidth and time - average smearing in images . also , since preserving @xmath3 scales computationally with the square of the baseline length , generating wide - field vlbi images is often limited by the off - line computing resources available . \n this latter restriction has introduced a psychological barrier , which is that most vlbi observers over - average their data in both the time and frequency domains to make data sets more manageable . \n data - averaging collapses both the @xmath3 and the total information content , leaving us with the postage - stamp vlbi images with which we are all so familiar . \n the sub - millijy population in a region containing the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) was observed using the evn at 1.6  ghz , 25-milliarcsecond resolution , and 64-mhz bandwidth ( garrett et al.2001 ) . \n the observations spanned two 16-hour segments but phase referencing in the switching style left an observation time of only @xmath14  hours . \n a @xmath3 a few arcminutes in diameter was set by bandwidth and time - average smearing , and by the primary - beam responses of the largest antennas in the array . \n the evn clearly detected sources stronger than 210  microjy per beam ( 5@xmath15 ) in two of the five target patches imaged within the @xmath3 . \n one detection locates the active nucleus and an adjacent feature in an fr - i galaxy at @xmath16 , while the other detection is a candidate active nucleus embedded in an obscured starburst at @xmath17 . \n the observed rms noise levels were higher than the expected thermal levels , due to residual phase - calibration errors . \n we have improved upon the hdf - n survey with a vlbi observation in the noao botes field using the nrao vlba and gbt at 1.4  ghz and 64-mhz bandwidth ( garrett , wrobel , & morganti , in preparation ) . \n the vlba is described by napier et al . \n the observations spanned three 8-hour segments . \n phase referencing in the in - beam style led to an observation time @xmath18  hours . \n two correlation passes were made within the gbt primary beam of fwhm 8.6 , shown as the circle in the figure . \n the passes were centered on the in - beam calibrator and on a region with six faint wsrt targets ( de vries et al . \n 2002 , morganti & garrett 2002 ) . for each pass , a @xmath19 4 in diameter was preserved and the output data rate of 1  mbyte per second yielded a data set of size 60  gbytes . \n the data from the calibrator pass were edited , averaged , and calibrated , and its gain parameters applied to the target - pass data . \n the aips task imagr was used to make dirty images / beams from the target - pass data after editing and calibration . \n each dirty image subtended a square 6 on a side . for each target , three such dirty images were made from the three observation segments and then simply co - added . \n this was a slow computational task : about 8 hours were required to produce one dirty image / beam on a 2-ghz linux pc with dual processors . \n for the stronger sources , cleaned images were produced with aips task apcln by subtracting the dirty beam from the dirty image . \n visibility - based cleaning is currently prohibitively expensive in terms of computing requirements . \n three sources were detected within the gbt primary beam , at a resolution of 10  milliarcseconds and above the detection threshold of 63  microjy per beam ( 7@xmath15 ) . \n these detections include the 20-millijy calibrator and two sub - millijy sources . \n each detection is unresolved and has noao photometric data available ( januzzi & dey 1999 ) . the calibrator is a quasar . \n one sub - millijy detection locates the active nucleus with @xmath20  millijy within an fr - i galaxy with @xmath21  millijy . \n the other sub - millijy detection has @xmath20  millijy and recovers most of the @xmath22  millijy . \n this is a candidate active nucleus because , at the comological distance suggested by the host s blue drop - out , ( 1 ) the spectral luminosity is too high for prompt emission from a sn and ( 2 ) the wsrt photometry spanning 20 months shows no variability , arguing against emission from a grb afterglow . \n finally , the disk galaxy ngc5646 at @xmath23 with @xmath24  millijy was not detected at 10-milliarcsecond resolution ; its wsrt emission follows the optical isophotes and obeys the fir / radio correlation , suggesting a star formation origin .    by tapering the visibility data , portions of the vlba primary beam of fwhm 29 were imaged at poorer sensitivity and resolution to yield five further detections . \n these detections involve brighter radio sources probably hosted by active galaxies and quasars , but the available noao photometric data have not yet been analysed . \n the long - term goal for these new vlbi surveys is to constrain the contribution that active galaxies make to the faint radio source population in general , and the optically faint radio / sub - mm source population in particular ( garrett 2003 ) . to have an impact in this area , it is essential that many sources be surveyed over large regions with rms sensitivities of a few microjy . \n global vlbi arrays employing disk - based recordings should be able to achieve such sensitivities . \n the proposed pcint program at jive will enable output data rates as high as 160  mbytes per second , remarkably expanding the accessible @xmath3 . \n it will thus be possible to sample simultaneously the summed response of all milliarcsecond - scale emission within ( and beyond ) the primary - beam response . \n after some phase - referencing to improve the coherence time , simple self - calibration of most fields should be possible at frequencies of 1 - 3  ghz . \n access to grid - like computing resources may be the best way to analyse the enormous data sets generated . \n huge and unbiased vlbi surveys will be conducted , with the bulk of the targets being faint sources with flux densities of only a few tens of microjy . \n this work made use of images provided by the ndwfs , which is supported by noao . \n noao is operated by aura , inc . \n , under a cooperative agreement with the nsf . \n nrao is a facility of the nsf operated under cooperative agreement by aui . \n beasley , a.  j. , et al . \n 2002 , , 141 , 13 condon , j.  j. , et al . \n 2003 , , 125 , 2411 de vries , w.  h. , et al . \n 2002 , , 123 , 1784 garrett , m.  a. , et al . \n 2001 , , 366 , l5 garrett , m.  a. 2003 , new technologies in vlbi , ed .  y.  c. minh gurvits , l.  i. , et al . \n 2004 , this volume ivezi , z. et al . \n 2002 , , 124 , 2364 jannuzi , b.  t. , & dey , a. 1999 , in asp conf .  ser . \n 191 , photometric redshifts and high redshift galaxies , ed . \n r.  j. weymann et al . \n ( san francisco : asp ) , 111 morganti , r. , & garrett , m.  a. 2002 , astron newsletter , no . \n 17 + ( http://www.astron.nl/astron/newsletter/2002-1/ ) napier , p.  j. , et al . \n 1994 , proc . \n ieee , 82 , 658 taylor , g.  b. , et al . \n 2000 , , 541 , 112 urry , c.  m. , & padovani , p. 1995 \n , , 107 , 803 white , r.  l. , et al . \n 1997 , , 475 , 479 wrobel , j.  m. , et al . \n 2004 , this volume", "StartTimeOffset": 1092996692673, "RequestID": "2c91da6e50604393a3d461a1e3c40034", "TotalTokens": 3321}

28 kev ( feroci et al . 2001b ) . \n no gamma - ray counterpart was found for these events in the grbm , nor in _ ulysses _ or konus / wind . \n this is the first reported bursting activity from sgr 1900 + 14 since approximately two years .    at the time of the giant flare , as detected by the grbm , \n the wfc1 detected a large increase in the count rate for approximately 3 seconds after the grbm trigger . at this time \n the count rate was so high ( larger than 30,000 counts / s ) that it triggered the automatic turn off of the experiment . \n the april 18 2001 activity of sgr 1900 + 14 allowed us to activate our target of opportunity observation program with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfi , 0.1 - 300 kev ) . \n thanks to the remarkable effort by the mission scientist team , the mission planners team and our team , the first follow - up observation was started on april 18 at 15:10 ut , less than 8 hours after the event . \n this first observation ( feroci et al . \n 2001c ) was 28 hours long , for a net exposure time in the mecs instrument of 60 ks . \n a second pointing was carried out on april 29 at 20:20 ut , for a similar exposure time . \n the persistent x - ray counterpart of sgr 1900 + 14 was detected in both observations . \n the source emitted a large number of short x - ray bursts during the first observation , whereas in the second pointing only one burst was detected . \n the average spectrum during the first pointing , after removal of the bursts , can be fit with a power law with photon index 2.6@xmath00.1 and n@xmath8=(4.3@xmath00.3)@xmath9 @xmath2 . \n the persistent 2 - 10 kev flux showed a rapid decaying behaviour during our first pointing , going approximately from 3.5 to 2@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . using the x - ray flux in the same band provided by the chandra observation carried out on april 22 ( kouveliotou et al . \n 2001 ) , we obtain that the time behaviour of the x - ray flux can be described by a power law , with index @xmath4 - 0.6 . \n interestingly , studying the hardness ratio between the 1.6 - 4 kev and the 4 - 10 kev energy ranges , we find a clear correlation flux vs. hardness , indicating that the spectrum softens when the persistent flux decreases .    during our second observation the source appeared to have gone back to its quiescent status . \n removing the single burst that we observed , the 0.1 - 10 kev energy spectrum is best fit by the sum of an absorbed power law plus a blackbody with temperature @xmath40.5 kev . \n the 2 - 10 kev flux is consistent with the ` standard ' quiescent status , at @xmath41.1@xmath10 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( unabsorbed ) . in figure 1 \n we show the plot of the x - ray flux vs. time , including also the chandra point , that suggests that the source returned to its quiescent status in less than 3 days after the burst . \n we performed a period search in both nfi observations and found the expected 5.17-s periodicity in the 2 - 10 kev flux from the persistent source . in the first observation \n the best period was 5.17277 s , with a smooth sinusoidal profile . in the second pointing the period increased to 5.17298 s , without significant differences in the pulse profile . \n therefore , the period derivative between the two bepposax observation is about 2.3@xmath11 s s@xmath3 . \n the bepposax instrumentation observed the most interesting phases of the 2001 activation of sgr 1900 + 14 with a very complete set of observations . \n the grbm and wfc caught the second giant flare in the ( observed ) history of this source and its precursor x - ray activity . \n the nfi observed the afterglow of the persistent source after the flare , the bursting activity and its quenching , and the period history soon after the giant flare . \n the giant flare is rather unusual with respect to its two predecessors , the march 5 1979 event from sgr 0526 - 66 and the august 27 1998 flare from sgr 1900 + 14 ( e.g. , mazets et al . 1979 , hurley et al . 1999 , feroci et al . \n the most important differences in the april 18 are in the following aspects :    * the peak flux and fluence are more than one order of magnitude smaller * the duration is almost one order of magnitude shorter * there is no evidence for the first short and very hard pulse at the beginning of the event , implying that , contrary to the other two events , most likely there was no relativistic particle emission during this event . \n the nfi observation is the fastest pointing after a giant flare and provides a _ direct _ observation of a long - duration afterglow emission from an sgr after a giant flare . \n our result of an afterglow showing a power law decay , with index -0.6 , is similar to that obtained by woods et al . \n ( 2001 ) , who measured a decay index of -0.713@xmath00.025 after the august 27 event , based on the assumed constancy of the pulsed fraction . \n interestingly , ibrahim et al . \n ( 2001 ) found a similar decay law in the pulsating soft tail of the august 29 short burst . \n the spectral variability of the x - ray afterglow is also interesting . during our first observation , at high flux level , \n the source spectrum showed a softening , and an overall power law shape . in our second observation , at a flux typical of the quiescent state , we clearly detect the emergence of a kt=0.5 kev blackbody component , and an n@xmath8 smaller by about a factor of 2 . based on our observations , together with our analysis of the previous bepposax observations \n ( see also woods et al . 1999 , 2001 ) of this source in quiescence ( may 1997 and march / april 2000 ) and after the august 27 giant flare ( september 1998 ) , we can state that the blackbody component for this source is peculiar of its quiescent state . \n we warmly thank l. piro , g. gandolfi , l. salotti , m. capalbi , l. amati , the bepposax mission planners , the bepposax soc , occ and sdc for their personal efforts that allowed a fast repointing of the source after the flare , as well as a prompt analysis of the grbm , wfc and nfi data . \n feroci , m. , hurley , k. , duncan , r.c . , & thompson , c. , 2001a , , 549 , 1021 feroci , m. , mereghetti , s. , gandolfi , g. , piro , l. , & costa , e. 2001b , gcn circular 1055 feroci , m. , in t zand , j.j.m . , \n soffitta , p. , hurley , k. , frontera , f. , & mazets , e. 2001c , gcn circular 1060 guidorzi , c. , et al . \n 2001 , iau circular 7611 hurley , k. , et al . \n 1999 , , 397 , 41 ibrahim , a.i . , \n 2001 , , 558 , 237 kouveliotou , c. , et al . \n 2001 , gcn circular 1046 mazets , e. , et al . , 1979 , , 282 , 587 woods , p. , et al . 1999 , , 518 , l103 woods , p. , et al . 2001 , , 552 , 748", "StartTimeOffset": 1140823557435, "RequestID": "e4330bfe712b4972b9a028d3c6ae526c", "TotalTokens": 2943}
{"ContextTokens": 2771, "GeneratedTokens": 314, "SynthesizedBody": "surface diffusion is a very important process in many phenomena , in particular in crystal growth . \n that is why the diffusion of single adatoms on stepped metal surfaces has been recently widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically . \n energy barriers for the moves of an adatom on a surface with steps or islands are not easily accessible by experiment but for many elementary processes they can be calculated on microscopical level by molecular dynamics . \n the knowledge of the barriers can then be utilized in the construction of kinetic monte carlo models to study growth processes . \n the diffusion energy barriers have already been calculated for various metals and different surface orientations . \n for example , in the case of fcc ( 111 ) surface there are calculations for al @xcite , ag @xcite , au @xcite , cu @xcite , ni @xcite , pt @xcite , ir @xcite . in most of these studies \n the semi - empirical potentials were used due to their simplicity allowing a systematic study of numerous possible processes . \n comparable ab initio calculations demand much more computer power , therefore the number of investigated processes must considerably be reduced . \n although the recent first principles calculations @xcite indicates that in the case of pt(111 ) the semi - empirical potentials may be insufficient , in many other studies they lead to reasonable results and their application helped at least qualitative understand diffusion energetics and reveal new processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n in this paper we study diffusion on stepped rh(111 ) surface . \n the research was motivated by a recent stm experiment on unstable growth of rh(111 ) @xcite where a coarsening due to a step - edge barrier was observed over three orders of magnitude of deposited amount . \n more recent observation on pt(111 ) @xcite indicates almost no coarsening over the similar interval of deposited material . whereas the step - edge barriers on pt(111 ) surfaces were extensively studied ( see references in @xcite ) , results for rh(111 ) are not available . \n we present here a systematic study of energy barriers for inter - layer transport as well as for diffusion along the step edges . \n our simulations were done for finite atomic slabs with a free surface on the top , two atomic layers fixed on the bottom , and periodic boundary conditions in the two directions parallel to the surface . \n the slab representing the substrate of ( 111 ) surface was 11 layers thick with 448 atoms per layer . \n we used systems of approximately 5000 atoms consisting of 19 to 44 layers , with 110 to 240 atoms per layer for diffusion along channels on the vicinal surfaces ( 311 ) , ( 211 ) , ( 331 ) , ( 221 ) and ( 322 ) . \n the semi - empirical many - body rosato  guillope \n legrand ( rgl ) potential @xcite including interactions up to the fifth nearest neighbors @xcite was used . for computational details \n see @xcite . \n the energy barrier for a particular diffusion process was obtained by testing systematically various possible paths of an adatom . \n the path with the lowest diffusion barrier was chosen to be the optimum one , and the diffusion barrier , @xmath0 , was calculated as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the total energies of the system with the adatom at the saddle point and at the equilibrium adsorption site , respectively . \n we considered both the jump and exchange processes . \n the minimum energy path for jump diffusion was determined by moving an adatom in small steps between two equilibrium positions and by allowing the adatom to relax in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting two equilibrium positions . \n the rest of the atoms in the system were allowed to relax in all directions . \n the energy barrier for exchange process was determined by moving the edge atom , that should be replaced , in small steps toward its final position . \n this final position was one of neighboring equilibrium sites . \n the moving atom was allowed to relax in the plane perpendicular to the exchange direction at each step , whereas the other atoms , including the adatom , relaxed free in all directions . \n in our simulation we obtained the energy barrier @xmath4 ev for self - diffusion on the flat rh(111 ) surface , which is in good agreement with experiments . in the field - ion - microscope ( fim ) experiment @xcite the barrier @xmath5 ev was found and recently the value @xmath6 ev was obtained in the stm experiment @xcite from the temperature dependence of island density . \n the results of molecular statics calculations and experimental values are summarized in table 1 . \n we calculated also binding energy for the supported dimer . \n the value @xmath7  ev is in good agreement with @xmath8  ev obtained in the stm experiment @xcite . \n we studied the descent of an adatom to the lower terrace from both types of steps on the ( 111 ) surface , i.e. , step a with \\{100 } microfacet and step b with \\{111 } microfacet ( see fig . \n we performed calculations for several geometries : straight steps , steps with a kink , and also for a small island atoms . \n for all considered geometries we systematically investigated all possible adatom jumps and pair exchange processes . \n our results for straight steps and steps with a kink are summarized in table 2 . \n the energy barrier for a direct jump from the upper to the lower terrace is 0.73 ev for straight step a and 0.74 ev for straight step b. the presence of a kink decreases the barrier for the jump to @xmath9 ev on both steps . \n we can see that the energy barriers for the jumps are always larger than for the exchange which are and 0.39 ev for a and b step , respectively .    in more complex geometries the number of competing processes to be energetically compared increases , e.g. in the case of step b with a kink we consider four types of processes according to which step - edge - atom ( denoted by r1 , r2 , r3 , or r4 ) is pushed out ( see fig . \n we call them exchange next to corner , exchange over kink i , exchange over kink ii , and exchange next to kink , respectively . \n we consider all possible combinations of initial and final positions . \n for example , in the case of the exchange next to the corner there are three possible processes : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . in the process \n @xmath12 , e.g. , the adatom starts in the fcc site labeled by 3 and pushes out the edge atom r1 . \n two possible directions of moving for pushed atom r1 are shown schematically in fig . \n the lowest barrier for the inter - layer transport is the barrier for two exchange processes near the kink on the step b ( @xmath13 ev ) , i.e. the ehrlich - schwoebel barrier is only @xmath14 mev . \n the barriers for exchange processes on the step a are significantly higher . for a island , \n the minimal values were obtained for the exchange of the atom in the middle of the edge ( 0.43 ev for a - type edge and 0.24 ev for b - type edge ) . \n we found that for rh(111 ) similar as for pt(111 ) @xcite the barriers for the descent at a small island are significantly lower than for the descent at straight long steps . \n 3 shows the energy profile for the diffusion along two edges of a large island . \n the structure in the middle corresponds to a diffusion around the corner formed by two edges . \n the angle contained by the edges is 120@xmath15 . \n there is a small minimum just at the corner positions . \n the transport between two edges is asymmetric . \n we found that the diffusion along the straight step of type a is faster ( the barrier is 0.40 ev ) than along the step of type b ( the barrier is 0.81 ev ) . \n this could be attributed to a purely geometrical effect due to different local geometries along the steps . \n the adatom diffusing along the step b has to pass closer to the topmost atoms of the lower terrace than when it is diffusing along the step a ( see fig.1 ) . \n there are no available experimental data for diffusion along the steps on rh(111 ) surface . \n only one measurement on the ( 311 ) and ( 331 ) surface has been published @xcite . in order to have some comparison , we calculated the energy barriers for the diffusion along steps on vicinal surfaces with terraces : ( 211 ) , ( 311 ) - terraces with step edges of type a , and ( 332 ) , ( 221 ) and ( 331 ) - step edges of type b. results are summarized in table 3 . \n the vicinal surfaces are ordered according to the distance between terraces . \n we can see that there is a clear tendency with the decreasing distance between steps . in the case of a - step \n the barrier along the step is increasing with the step distance increasing , whereas for b - step it is decreasing . \n we obtained the barriers @xmath16  ev and @xmath17 ev for the diffusion along steps ( 311 ) and ( 331 ) surfaces , respectively . \n experimental results of fim measurements are the energy barriers @xmath18 ev and @xmath19 ev @xcite . \n there is qualitative agreement between experimental and calculated data : @xmath20 . \n using the rgl potential we calculated the energy barrier for self - diffusion on the flat rh(111 ) surface and binding energy of supported dimer which are in good agreement with the experimental data . with the same potential , we systematically studied energy barriers for the descent at straight as well as rough steps on rh(111 ) . \n we found that the lowest energy barriers for descent to the lower terrace is for the exchange process near a kink on step b. we also calculated barriers for the diffusion along step edges on rh(111 ) surface and along step edges on several vicinal surfaces . \n we found that the diffusion along step a is faster than along step b , which is in qualitative agreement with the fim experiment . \n we observed that these barriers are slightly affected by the step - step interaction . \n we expect that due to rather large barriers for the diffusion along steps , both steps will be rough during the growth at lower temperatures and the interlayer transport will prefer step b. at a higher temperature the diffusion along step a starts to be active and the descent on both steps will be possible . however , step b will remain rough and the descent on this step will be easier . in island growth \n this would imply that b - edges of an island will grow faster than a - edges , therefore , b - edges will become shorter . \n however , the number of kinks for the easy descent on a shorter b - edge will be lower . \n hence we expect that for a certain interval of temperatures the shape of the growing island will be asymmetric with longer a steps . \n this picture seems to be in agreement with the morphologies presented in @xcite . \n + * figure captions * +   + fig \n . 1 . two types of step edges , a and b , for a large island . \n solid line shows the diffusion path along the island edge . \n the atoms of different layers from the surface to the bulk are shown as large filled circles , large open circles , small open circles , and tiny open circles . \n [ fig : along ] +   + fig . \n 2 : different exchange processes near a kink site on step b on rh(111 ) surface . the edge atoms undergoing exchange diffusion ( r1, ... ,r4 ) and starting positions of an adatom ( 1, ... ,9 ) are shown . \n the four topmost atomic layers from the surface to the bulk are distinguished by different circle radii ( cf . \n +   + fig . \n 3 : dependence of the adatom energy for the path along the edge of a large island . \n the path is composed from three sections : along edge a , around the corner and along edge b. +", "StartTimeOffset": 1154390022666, "RequestID": "635fc9eebba8432cbbf058c0a1f7211b", "TotalTokens": 3085}

examine the usual uncertainty principle of heisenberg @xcite . \n these evidences have origin on the quantum fluctuation of the background spacetime metric and are related to the very nature of spacetime in quantum gravity era . the introduction of this idea has drown attention and many authors considered various problems in the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle ( see for instance @xcite ) . \n these investigations have revealed some new features of the very nature of spacetime : spacetime is not commutative at planck scale and it has a foam - like structure in this scale , it seems that gravity is not a fundamental interaction of the nature ( it may be induced by the residual effects of fundamental quantum fields on the vacuum , with the lagrangian playing the role of an elastic stress ) , constants of the nature are not really constant and the very notion of locality in position space representation breaks down in planck scale . \n therefore , it seems that a reformulation of quantum theory is required in order to incorporate gravitational effects in planck scale phenomena . \n these issues have been the topics of a wide range of researches in recent years .    in this paper , we consider the problem of a particle of mass @xmath0 that is bouncing vertically and elastically on a smooth reflecting floor in earth s gravitational field . \n we solve this problem in the presence of a minimal length within the gup framework . \n first , we give an overview to the gup formalism and in this way we obtain a generalized schrdinger equation . after studying this equation in the momentum space , we find the modified eigenstates and energy spectrum of this system . \n we compare the outcomes of our study with the results obtained from elementary quantum mechanics . \n a potential application of the present study in the spontaneous decay of an excited state for ultra cold neutrons bouncing above a perfect mirror in the earth s gravitational field is discussed finally . \n we note that modification to the decay rate due to existence of a minimal length studied here , becomes important at or above the planck energy . \n although this modification is too small to be measurable at present , we speculate on the possibility of extracting measurable predictions in the future . \n quantum mechanics with modification of the usual canonical commutation relations has been investigated intensively in the last few years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . such works which are motivated by several independent streamlines of investigations in string theory and quantum gravity , suggest the existence of a finite lower bound to the possible resolution @xmath1 of spacetime points . \n the following deformed commutation relation has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite @xmath2=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2),\\ ] ] and it was shown that it implies the existence of a minimal resolution length @xmath3 @xcite . \n this means that there is no possibility to measure coordinate @xmath4 with accuracy smaller than @xmath5 . \n since in the context of the string theory the minimum observable distance is the string length , we conclude that @xmath6 is proportional to this length . if we set @xmath7 , the usual heisenberg algebra is recovered . \n the use of the deformed commutation relation ( [ com ] ) brings new difficulties in solving the quantum problems . \n a part of difficulties is related to the break down of the notion of locality and position space representation in this framework @xcite . \n the above commutation relation results in the following uncertainty relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive quantities which depend on the expectation value of the position and the momentum operators . \n in fact , we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planck mass and @xmath13 is of the order of unity . \n we expect that these quantities are only relevant in the domain of the planck energy @xmath14 . \n therefore , in the low energy regime , the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are irrelevant and we recover the well -

position representation @xmath29 where the second term is due to the generalized commutation relation ( [ com ] ) . \n this equation is a @xmath30th - order differential equation which in principle admits @xmath30 independent solutions . \n therefore , solving this equation in @xmath20 space and separating the physical solutions is not an easy task . in the next section , \n for the case of a bouncing particle , we find the energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenstates up to the first order of the gup parameter . \n consider a particle of mass @xmath0 which is bouncing vertically and elastically on a reflecting hard floor so that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the acceleration in the earth s gravitational field . \n the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath33 which results in the following generalized schrdinger equation @xmath34 this equation , for @xmath7 is exactly solvable and the solutions can be written in the form of the airy functions . \n moreover , the energy eigenvalues are related to the zeros of the airy function . however \n , for @xmath35 , the situation is quite different . because , we need to solve a forth order differential equation and eliminate the unphysical solutions . on the other hand , because of the linear form of the potential , this equation can be cast into a first order differential equation in the momentum space . \n since the later form is much easier to handle , we define a new variable @xmath36 and rewrite above equation in the momentum space , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath39 and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath21 . \n it is straight forward to check that this equation admits the following solution @xmath40.\\ ] ] since @xmath9 is a small quantity , we can expand the above solution up to the first order of @xmath9 as @xmath41 now , using the fourier transform , we can find the solution in the position space up to a normalization factor @xmath42+\\frac{4}{15}\\beta m^2g\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left\\{4\\mbox{ai}\\left[\\alpha\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right]+ \\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left.\\mbox{ai}'\\left[\\alpha\\left(x-\\frac{e}{mg}\\right)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath20 . finally , \n since the potential is infinite for @xmath44 , we demand that the wave function should vanish at @xmath45 . \n this condition results in the quantization of the particle s energy , namely @xmath46=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to proceed further and for the sake of simplicity , let us work in the units of @xmath47 . in this set of units , \n the energy eigenvalues are the minus of the roots of the following algebraic equation @xmath48=0.\\ ] ] so , the energy eigenvalues will be quantized and result in the following eigenfunctions @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50s should satisfy eq . \n ( [ root ] ) . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows the resulting normalized ground state and first excited state eigenfunctions for @xmath51 . \n moreover , the calculated values of the energy eigenvalues for the first ten states are also shown in table [ tab1 ] . \n these results show that the presence of @xmath9 increases the energy levels in agreement with the functional form of @xmath52 . \n in other words , existence of a minimal length results in a positive shift in the energy levels of quantum bouncer . \n as a potential application of our analysis , we note that quantization of the energy of _ ultra cold neutrons _ bouncing above a mirror in the earth s gravitational field has been demonstrated in an experiment few years ago @xcite . \n this effect demonstrates quantum behavior of the gravitational field if we consider the spontaneous decay of an excited state in this experiment as a manifestation of the planck -

escud ( 1996 ) and paczyski ( 1996b ) , who in particular pointed out that astrometric cross section is much larger than photometric cross section . \n therefore , the masses of single high proper motion stars and brown dwarfs can be determined accurately by measuring the astrometric lensing effects of the distant stars . \n the purpose of this paper is to present in one place various suggestions made in the past for the application of @xmath3 micro - arcsecond astrometry to determine the masses of stars , brown dwarfs , and machos , whatever the machos might be . \n in addition , a new suggestion to use such astrometry to measure stellar radii and effective temperatures is also presented . \n typical angular separations of multiple images formed by microlensing within our galaxy or towards the magellanic clouds are @xmath3 mas ( paczyski 1996a , and references therein ) , so they will remain unresolved by the sim . however , the centroid of the combined image is expected to move around by @xmath3 mas , and this motion can be readily measured by the sim with a very high precision . \n the angular einstein ring radius of a point lens is given as @xmath8 ^{1/2 } =   0.902 ~ { \\rm mas } ~ \\left ( { m \\over m_{\\odot } } \\right ) ^{1/2 } \\left [ 10 ~ { \\rm kpc } \\times \\left ( { 1 \\over d_d }    -

arcseconds . \n the two micro images formed by the lens can not be resolved , but the light centroid is displaced with respect to the source position by the angle ( cf . \n g , novikov & polnarev 1995 , miyamoto & yoshi 1995 , walker 1995 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the source and the lens , and the lens is assumed to be dark . \n the maximum displacement is @xmath21    for @xmath22 the light centroid corresponds almost exactly to the position of the dominant image ( cf . \n paczyski 1996b ) . \n note , that if the lensing star is invisible , as assumed , then the source position can be measured with respect to any nearby star . \n in this section we present a few examples of the displacement trajectories to illustrate the principle of the phenomenon , and to demonstrate that the lens mass and parallax have distinct effects which should be readily measurable with the sim . \n let us consider a microlensing event with a time scale @xmath23 50 days and maximum magnification @xmath24 , which corresponds to the impact parameter @xmath25 . \n we adopt the source distance to be @xmath26 kpc , and consider three different cases of the lens distance : 10 , 30 , and 45 kpc , with identical lens mass of @xmath27 . \n the corresponding einstein ring radii are @xmath28 mas , respectively . finally , the relative proper motion is @xmath29 , for these three cases . \n for our example we adopt @xmath30 , which is reasonable for a star in the lmc , and we arbitrarily take @xmath31 , where ( @xmath32 ) are the ecliptic longitude and latitude , respectively . \n the relative parallax is equal @xmath33 mas for the three cases , respectively . finally , we chose the maximum magnification and the smallest angular separation between the lens and the source to be at the time when the star is at the largest angular separation from the sun . \n the three examples of astrometric effects of microlensing a star in the lmc are presented in figure 1 , which shows the relation between the displacements in the two ecliptic coordinates , ( @xmath32 ) . \n all lines in fig.1 begin 18 months before the maximum of photometric magnification , and they end 18 months after that maximum . both ends are close to @xmath34 . \n the largest curve corresponds to the lens distance @xmath35 kpc , the smallest to @xmath36 kpc . \n note , that the largest displacement is proportional to the einstein ring radius , with @xmath37 ( cf . \n the relative proper motion of the lens with respect to the star is given as the ratio : @xmath38 . \n the determination of the relative parallax requires model fitting , but this should be feasible . the dashed curve in figure 1 shows the displacement of the image centroid for the case when the lens is at @xmath35 kpc , but the earth orbital motion is artificially suppressed . \n the difference between the solid and the dashed lines is shown in figure 2 . \n this is the complicated effect of the earth motion , and its scale is such that the sim should be able to measure it readily . \n therefore , if the machos responsible for microlensing of the lmc stars are located in the galactic halo then their distances and masses will be determined with the sim astrometry . \n the masses and distances to the galactic bulge lenses will be even easier to measure as their parallaxes are relatively large . \n note , that @xmath39 astrometry will provide accurate astrometric determination of the macho mass , as shown with the scale of the figure 2 , however , a much lower precision of the roemer mission ( cf . \n g , novikov & polnarev 1995 ) , or of the gaia project ( lindegren & perryman 1996 ) will not provide a useful macho mass determination .    there is a region of parameter space in which the effects of acceleration in earth s orbital motion are too small for the sim to measure ( cf . \n boden et al . \n this includes very short events with @xmath40 year , and the case when the relative parallax @xmath16 is very small . \n so , if the lenses responsible for the lmc lensing are in the lmc itself ( sahu 1994 ) then the astrometric effects are so small ( cf . \n figure 1 ) that it will be impossible to determine their masses and distances accurately \n . however , it will be still possible to establish that they are close to the sources , i.e. within the lmc rather than in the galactic halo . \n all classical microlensing searches monitor millions of stars to detect a few events which come at random time . \n miralda - escud ( 1996 ) and paczyski ( 1995 , 1996b ) pointed out that there is a very different regime of microlensing when we begin not with the sources but with the lenses . \n this works best when the lenses are selected as stars with very large proper motions , indicating they are relatively nearby , and therefore their angular einstein ring radii are relatively large ( cf . equation 1 ) . \n the astrometric effects have a large effective cross - section . \n for example , the barnard s star ( van de kamp 1971 ) has a parallax of @xmath41 , and a proper motion of @xmath42 per year . if we adopt its mass to be @xmath43 , we obtain for its einstein ring radius @xmath44 a position of a distant background star passing by at an angular distance of @xmath45 is displaced by lensing by 100 @xmath46  a huge effect for the sim , which in this case could determine the mass of barnard s star with @xmath4 accuracy . \n the large proper motion combined with the large astrometric cross section implies that the useful background stars may be looked for in a large area in the sky . \n adoptic 3 years as a pessimistic life span for sim implies that the barnatd s star alone will cover an area @xmath47 in the sky . \n a lower limit to the number of lensing events for which the sim will be able to make accurate mass determination for the lenses can be obtained using hipparcos catalog ( perryman et al . \n there are 12,204 stars in the catalog with the distance less than 100 pc and proper motion @xmath13 larger than @xmath48 . \n their masses can be estimated with the mass - luminosity relation , and therefore the corresponding einstein ring radii can be calculated . adopting @xmath49 as the required astrometric displacement @xmath50 due to lensing , the minimum impact parameter @xmath20 can be calculated with eq . \n 5 . combining all these data it is possible to calculate the time scale for lensing event , @xmath51 , and the area of the sky swept by each star during a three year time interval : @xmath52 . \n the total area swept by all 12,204 stars is @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 of the whole sky . as stars within 100 pc \n are distributed isotropically in the sky , we may expect to find @xmath55 stars brighter than @xmath56 , mag and @xmath57 stars brighter than @xmath58 mag ( cf . \n table 4.2 of mihalas & binney 1983 ) in the total area swept by these stars during three years . a median time scale for the microlensing events , weighted by the area in the sky swept by the stars , turns out to be a convenient 7 months , with \n 80% of event time scales expected in the range 2 months - 2 years . for each of the events a @xmath59 astrometric accuracy implies 1% accurate mass determination . \n note , that in this case the lensing star is bright , and the lensed source is faint , but clearly resolved with the sim . \n the relative astrometry of the two stars will provide the relative proper motion @xmath60 , the relative parallax @xmath16 , and the einstein ring radius @xmath61 from the analysis of displacements @xmath50 as given with eq . \n ( 5 ) , which in this case refers to the dominant image of the source . \n the lens mass follows from eq . \n if the gravitational displacement requirement is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath62 , then the total area swept by the 12,204 high proper motion hipparcos stars in 3 years increases to @xmath63 , i.e. it is larger by a factor 3.3 compared to the previous case , and the number of possible events increases by the same factor . a median time scale increases to 1.6 years . \n this shows the importance of a precise astrometry : the higher the accuracy , the more lensing events can be used for accurate mass determination .    obviously , there are many more stars which are too faint to be in the hipparcos catalog , but which have large proper motion ( e.g. luyten 1976 ) , and will be suitable for accurate mass determination \n . it would be very interesting to have the entire sky searched for faint , ( 20th mag ) high proper motion ( @xmath64 1/year ) stars , as some of them may turn out to be brown dwarfs , the difference between a star and a brown dwarf is best established with an accurate mass determination , and this will be possible with the sim . \n when the angular impact parameter is smaller than the angular source radius then an accurate microlensing light curve can be used to obtain the ratio of the two angles . \n if the effective temperature of the source is estimated from its color and/or spectrum then its surface brightness can also be estimated ; combining this with the observed flux can be used to determine the source angular diameter , and the angular einstein ring radius . \n finally , the relative proper motion is obtained by dividing the einstein ring radius by the event time scale , hence the name : ` proper motion event ' ( cf . \n gould 1996 , and references therein ) . \n it may be useful to reverse this process as stellar effective temperatures are not known all that well . \n sim s astrometry of microlensing events will provide accurate measurements of the relative proper motions between the lens and the source . combining this with an accurate light curve of a ` proper motion event ' \n will give the angular stellar radius , which in turn will be used to determine the effective temperature of the lensed star . \n the first spectacular example of a microlensing event of this type was recently provided by the macho alert 95 - 30 ( alcock et al . \n the ratio of the angular impact parameter to the angular source radius was determined to be @xmath65 . \n had the einstein ring radius been measured with sim - like astrometry the angular diameter of the lensed star would have been known to @xmath4 accuracy , comparable to the best existing stellar measurements . of course , accurate astrometry was not available , and the source colors and spectra were used to estimate stellar radius , and the proper motion with a precision of only @xmath66 . \n the example of macho alert 95 - 30 demonstrates that the accuracy of stellar radii determination with @xmath67 astrometry of resolved microlensing events is comparable to that achieved with the best detached eclipsing binaries ( cf . \n andersen 1991 ) , or the best interferometric measurements ( shao & colavita 1992 ) . \n once the angular stellar radius is measured , the determination of the effective temperature is a standard procedure . \n a @xmath67 astrometry of microlensing events can be used to determine the lens masses and the source radii ( and hence their effective temperatures ) , but it requires target of opportunity mode of operation . in order to be useful the space interferometry mission ( allen , shao , & peterson 1997 , boden , shao & van buren 1997 ) would have to respond to ground based alerts within a few weeks .    the only way to measure masses of single objects with an accuracy of @xmath4 is with gravitational lensing . \n lensing events caused by nearby high proper motion stars passing within @xmath68 of distant background stars , can be predicted many years into the future , making it possible to prepare the sim s observing program ahead of time , with no need for the too operation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1218384360562, "RequestID": "7f44d8bafd644baf9d767d73e88de039", "TotalTokens": 4309}

15 mjy in the range @xmath28 to 10480 km s@xmath3 . \n the continuum flux density we find at 22 ghz is @xmath29 jy , corresponding to @xmath30 watt hz@xmath3 . \n we also reduced some archival data of earlier observations of mrk  348 taken between october 1997 and february 1998 and combined them into one data set ( fig . \n [ specall ] , bottom ) . in this spectrum \n the broad line is marginally detected with a flux density approximately three times lower than in the current observations . \n the smaller and variable baseline in these earlier observations made a reliable identification of this line impossible without _ a priori _ information . \n we have clearly discovered a new megamaser in mrk  348 . \n its luminosity is comparable to the emission from ngc  3079 which contains the second most luminous h@xmath0o maser after txs  2226 - 184 @xcite . \n the line width is among the broadest found for a megamaser , similar to the masers in txs  2226 - 184 and ngc  1052 . assuming the emission is associated with material close to the center this is the first spectroscopic evidence for molecular gas possibly obscuring the nucleus .    despite the bright radio continuum and the molecular maser line \n we have found no absorption lines from either nh@xmath5 or c@xmath5h@xmath0 . \n this is in line with the earlier non - detection of h i absorption @xcite . \n c@xmath5h@xmath0 is an organic ring molecule which is widespread in the galaxy and is associated with diffuse gas in the ism @xcite . \n it was also found in absorption against the nucleus of the radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite . from our non - detection \n we find a 1@xmath15 upper limit for the optical depth @xmath31 times the covering factor @xmath32 of @xmath33 . \n this is seven times smaller than the value found for centaurus a and might be related to the fact that we see mrk  348 almost face on .    on the other hand , with its type 2 agn , polarized broad emission - lines , and \n a nuclear dust lane seen , mrk  348 falls right into the roster of typical megamaser galaxies , where it is suggested that the masing material is part of the obscuring ` torus ' in the unified scheme of agn . \n the face - on orientation of mrk  348 then would suggest that the axis of this torus and the galaxy disk axis are severely misaligned .    in october 1997 \n february 1998 the flux density of the line was three times lower than it was in march 2000 . in the earlier survey by the maser line \n was not detected and given its line width and low flux density it would have resulted only in a broad feature at the @xmath34 level . \n linear interpolation with time of the continuum flux density given in suggests a continuum flux density for mrk  348 around 310 mjy in october 1997 at 15 ghz . \n the level we measure is roughly a factor of three higher  assuming a flat spectrum  and this increase in flux density is similar to the increase in flux density of the line . \n this could indicate a correlation between continuum and maser flux density , implying an unsaturated maser . with its current radio luminosity \n the galaxy is now the most radio luminous megamaser galaxy ever discovered . \n the response of the line to the continuum flare within about 2 years sets an upper limit to the distance of the masers from the nucleus of @xmath350.6 pc , which is of similar order as the size scale of the molecular disk found in ngc  4258 .    indeed , noted a certain excess of detected megamaser galaxies with large radio powers . \n mrk  348 certainly adds to this trend . \n the distribution of radio powers at 6 cm of the parent samples of agn selected by has a peak around @xmath36 watt / hz . if we add mrk  348 and more recently discovered megamasers @xcite and also complement the radio data in with more recent data from the nasa extragalactic database , we find that 12 out of 19 detected megamaser galaxies are at or above the peak in the distribution of radio power for galaxies without megamaser detections .    because of the possibly biased selection of the detected megamasers this is not highly significant . \n however , it highlights an apparently necessary prerequisite for megamaser emission , namely an agn with a compact radio core to provide seed photons . \n so far all detected megamasers have compact ( @xmath37 ) , mostly flat - spectrum , radio emission at a level of a few milli - jansky . in some cases , like mrk  348 @xcite , \n ngc  1052 @xcite , mrk  1210 @xcite , ngc  2639 @xcite , ngc  3079 @xcite , ngc  5793 @xcite , ngc  5506 @xcite , and possibly ngc  4945 @xcite the radio cores can even reach several tens to hundreds of milli - jansky \n .    while compact radio cores in seyfert and liner galaxies are not uncommon , only very few are so prominent as those in some of the radio - bright megamaser sources . \n we find that all megamasers mentioned above , i.e.  more than a third of known megamasers , have compact radio cores above a fiducial limit of 25 mjy at 5 ghz . on the other hand , in a survey of spiral galaxies find only 3 out of 54 galaxies ( 22 of which are seyfert galaxies ) with compact cores above 25 mjy at 5 ghz . \n similarly , in a survey of nearby agn find roughly 40% of seyfert and liner galaxies to contain compact flat - spectrum radio cores . \n however , only three out of 48 galaxies have flux densities @xmath3825 mjy . known megamasers therefore seem to prefer galaxies with relatively bright compact radio emission . \n mrk  348 currently has the brightest and most prominent radio core among megamaser galaxies . \n morphology , spectrum , and variability of the core are very similar to the radio core in iii  zw  2 which was the first seyfert galaxy discovered to contain a superluminal jet . \n this galaxy has a millimeter - peaked spectrum and a jet which shows a stop - and - go behavior indicative of a strong interaction with dense material on the sub - parsec scale @xcite . \n therefore speculate whether the bright inverted radio core in mrk  348 could be interpreted similarly to those in compact symmetric objects ( csos ) with a gigahertz - peaked - spectrum ( gps , see ) . in these galaxies \n bright hotspots are formed in a jet that terminates already on the parsec scale . in iii \n zw  2 and mrk  348 this seems to happen on even smaller scales , leading to higher peak frequencies and could be due to frustration of the jet by a molecular cloud or even a warped or misaligned torus .    since the masers in ngc  1052 , which have similar broad line widths as in mrk  348 , \n are found along the radio jet @xcite it should be checked whether in mrk  348 one has an analogous situation . \n one can speculate that in such a case the evolution of the radio flare and the evolution of the maser flare and its blue wing could be related , possibly providing a unique diagnostic tool to study jet - ism interactions .    in any case \n , with its bright radio core mrk  348 provides an ideal opportunity to observe the maser lines in this galaxy at high resolution with vlbi during this flare even though the lines still have a rather low flux . \n since radio and maser emission seem to be highly variable both should be monitored frequently . given that mrk  348 was not discovered in an earlier survey this finding also suggests that existing samples should be revisited to search for more flaring megamasers . \n we thank alan roy for helpful discussions . \n we are grateful to jim ulvestad for a prompt referee report and useful suggestions . \n this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by jpl , caltech , under contract with nasa .", "StartTimeOffset": 1265458613908, "RequestID": "8b99aa34502244bca83d692da5b4dfa2", "TotalTokens": 4167}
{"ContextTokens": 3282, "GeneratedTokens": 217, "SynthesizedBody": "the be / x - ray systems represent the largest sub - class of massive x - ray binaries . \n a survey of the literature reveals that of the 115 identified massive x - ray binary pulsar systems ( identified here means exhibiting a coherent x - ray pulse period ) , most of the systems fall within this be counterpart class of binary . \n the orbit of the be star and the compact object , presumably a neutron star , is generally wide and eccentric . \n x - ray outbursts are normally associated with the passage of the neutron star close to the circumstellar disk ( okazaki & negueruela 2001 ) . a review of such systems may be found in coe et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n the source that is the subject of this paper , the x - ray transient gro j100857 , was discovered on july 14 1993 by the batse experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ( stollberg et al . \n 1993 and wilson et al . \n the source was observed in the 20200 kev band , and was found to be pulsating at a period of 93.5s . \n its spectrum was observed to be consistent with optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with kt=25 kev . from these x - ray data \n it was concluded that the system was a massive binary system - a neutron star with either a be or supergiant primary . \n a full report of this discovery outburst was presented in shrader et al . \n ( 1999 ) . \n subsequently the optical counterpart was identified by coe et al , ( 1994 ) who showed it to be a v=15.3 ob star with a strong ir excess and strong balmer line emission . in this paper \n we present more than 10 years of optical monitoring of this counterpart , including a blue - end spectrum taken from the southern african large telescope ( salt ) , which enables refinement of the spectral class to much higher accuracy than previous published work . \n we also demonstrate how the optical characteristics correlate with the long - term x - ray ( rxte / asm data ) behaviour . \n this is supplemented by @xmath2-ray observations from integral , in particular , reporting the details of the june 2004 outburst from gro j100857 . \n h@xmath0 data have been collected over the last 13 years from a series of telescopes . the dates and properties of the h@xmath0 line \n are presented in table  [ tab : obs ] . in this table the following telescopes and configurations have been used :    * aat - 3.9 m telescope , aat ( australia ) , royal greenwhich observatory spectrograph ( rgos ) , 25 cm camera , 1200v grating and tek ( 1024x1024 ) ccd . \n the dispersion was 0.8 / pixel and the signal to noise ratio from the 600s exposure was @xmath340 . \n * saao -

law with a high energy cut - off and a thermal bremsstrahlung model . \n both models fit equally well and have a reduced chi - square of @xmath31 ; the details of the fit parameters are shown in table  [ tab : spectra ] . \n an attempt was made to introduce an absorption component to both , however the fit could not resonably constrain the parameter . \n consequently , an absorption component fixed to the anticipated galactic absorbing column density of @xmath31.5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 was added . \n the unfolded spectra with the high - energy cut - off power law model fitted is shown in figure  [ fig : intspec ] . \n the fluxes given by the spectral models were 5.7 @xmath4 10@xmath7 erg @xmath6 s@xmath8 in the 320 kev band and 4.1 @xmath4 10@xmath7 erg @xmath6 s@xmath8 in the 20100 kev band . \n taking these numbers combined with the source distance of 5kpc ( coe et al , 1994 ) produces a flux estimate of ( 12 ) @xmath4 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath8 . \n this value is in good agreement with the level of x - ray luminosity estimated from the small accretion - torque driven pulse period changes reported in section 4 . \n using the clear outburst profile presented in figure  [ fig : fold ] for the period 2001 - 2006 it is possible to determine an accurate ephemeris . \n we assume the binary period is 248.9d ( levine & corbet , 2006 ) and chose the highest bin in the figure to be defined as phase 0.0 . \n from this the following outburst ephemeris is determined :    @xmath10 = 50186@xmath14 + 248.9n    where the dates are in modified julian day format and n is the outburst number . \n if the time of outburst is compared to the predicted time of periastron determined from the pulse period variations ( see table 2 ) , it agrees within 1.5d for the mjd 49189 outburst , indicating no significant phase shift between these two events . \n if we use this rxte / asm ephemeris then we can determine that the phase of the two integral outbursts discussed here are 0.99 and 0.00 . \n furthermore , the phase of the peak of the 1993 batse outburst reported in shrader et al . \n ( 1999 ) is 0.01 . \n thus all three reported events fit very comfortably with the above ephemeris and hence are almost certainly type i outbursts . \n this is supported by comparing the phase of the peaks of outbursts as seen in the folded lightcurves from batse , rxte / asm and integral all of which seem to match very well . \n there is no evidence for the phase changes in outburst seen in exo 2030 + 375 and explained by wilson et al . \n ( 2002 ) as related to global one arm oscillations in the circumstellar disk . \n though there are changes in the disk , evidenced by the overall shape changes of the h@xmath0 profile seen in figure  [ fig : ha ] , they are obviously not great enough to result in such outburst phase shifting . \n figure  [ fig : ew2 ] shows the h@xmath0 equivalent width measurements over the last 13 years . although the h@xmath0 equivalent width is not a direct measurement of the size of the circumstellar disk the data in this figure can be used as an indicator of growth and decline in the disk . to this effect \n we interpret the significant decline in the h@xmath0 flux , followed by a strong recovery as a period of disc shrinking and regrowth . \n this idea is consistent with the lack of observed x - ray outbursts of gro  j1008@xmath1157 during 19962001 - see figure  [ fig : fold ] . \n another feature to take note of in figure  [ fig : ew2 ] is the maximum measured h@xmath0 equivalent width . \n reig , fabregat & coe ( 1997 ) show that this maximum h@xmath0 equivalent width is correlated with the orbital period in a be / x - ray binary and the observed correlation can be explained by a viscous circumstellar disk truncated by the resonant torque of the orbiting neutron star ( negueruela et al . , 2001 ) . \n the system under discussion here spends a large fraction of the observed timescale at an h@xmath0 equivalent width of close to @xmath12 , while undergoing type  i x - ray outbursts . \n this may suggest that the @xmath12  ew measurement describes the circumstellar disk at a size that puts it close to the @xmath13 point at periastron .    to estimate the size of the h@xmath0 emitting region of the circumstellar disk we make used of the peak separation measurements in table  1 and the relation from huang ( 1972 ) .    where @xmath14 is the disk radius , @xmath15 is the inclination and @xmath16 is the peak separation . \n the average of the three measurements taken while the system was in normal outburst was determined to be 236@xmath115 km / s and used in the following determination of the disk size .    from the blue spectrum \n we determine the spectral type of the optical counterpart of gro  j1008@xmath1157 to be b1 - b2 ve . from allen ( 1973 ) \n we estimate the mass and radius of such a star to be 15m@xmath17 and 7r@xmath17 respectively . \n then , using the measured values of @xmath18 and assuming that the be star disk is in the plane of the orbit we find an inclination angle of @xmath19 for the circumstellar disk of gro  j1008@xmath1157 . \n these stellar parameters give an estimated h@xmath0 disk size of 72r@xmath17 and a ratio of disk size to l@xmath20 point ( measured from the centre of the be star ) of r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.64    in comparison , if the data for 1997 are used with a @xmath23v of 350 km / s , then this results in a much smaller disk of the order of 33r@xmath17 in size . \n even the 72r@xmath17 is much smaller than the truncation radius predicted by the viscous disk theory for this be / x - ray binary by okazaki & negueruela ( 2001 ) . using slightly different stellar and orbital parameters \n those authors predict that the circumstellar disk of gro j1008 - 57 is most likely truncated at the 7:1 or 8:1 resonance radius . at such a radius \n the disk verges on the l@xmath20 point at periastron , thus explaining the frequently observed type i outbursts .    exploring the upper and lower limits of the disk size estimates presented in this work requires the identification of the major uncertainties affecting the results.the uncertainty in the spectral types introduces a range of possible masses for the be star of 10  18 m@xmath17 . using extreme upper limits for both the stellar mass and @xmath18 , with the lower limit on @xmath23v \n , we find that r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.86 . at the other end of the range we find r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.51 \n however , it is worth bearing in mind that , contrary to the assumption in most disk models , the be star disk is probably not isothermal . \n thus the physical size of the disk is not constrained to the h@xmath0 emitted size of the disk . \n for example , in the case of the isolated be star @xmath24 per the h@xmath0 disk size has been measured by direct interferometry to be around ten stellar radii ( quirrenbach et al . , 1997 ) , whereas similar radio observations ( dougherty & taylor 1992 ) suggest that material may be present as far away as hundreds and even thousands of stellar radii . \n so , in the case of gro j100857 the totality of the disk may extend beyond the radius measured here from the h@xmath0 data . \n this is indirectly confirmed by the very fact that we see regular x - ray outbursts , suggesting the disk material must , indeed , reach the l@xmath20 point . \n the study of pulse period changes in gro j100857 from the batse data have allowed a precise orbital determination . \n the orbital period found agrees , within errors , with that determined by levine & corbet ( 2006 ) from x - ray outburst cycles . \n these outbursts seem to be very reliable in nature , showing no variation with x - ray energy , nor are they correlated with the changes in the h@xmath0 profile , as was seen in the case of exo 2030 + 375 ( wilson et al , 2002 ) \n . however , the substantial changes in the h@xmath0 ew correlate nicely with the existence and changing levels of the x - ray outburst sizes . \n in addition , using the peak separation measured from the h@xmath0 profiles an indication was provided of the disk size which is in general agreement with the detailed models of okazaki & negueruela ( 2001 ) . \n the results are a direct confirmation of the value of multiwavelength observations of these complex systems . \n this paper uses observations made from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , and x - ray data provided by the asm / rxte team . \n vam acknowledges support from the south african nrf and the british council in the form of a salt / stobie studentship .", "StartTimeOffset": 1299987305682, "RequestID": "b8621f596c67415199fbff5d0e0bfa1e", "TotalTokens": 3499}

diagonal long - range order.@xcite it is worth mentioning that the estimation of both magnitudes is rather difficult using pimc since the temperature is very low and the signal is expected to be very small . \n zero - temperature properties of solid @xmath0he such as its equation of state , static structure factor or lindemann s ratio have been calculated using diffusion monte carlo ( dmc )  @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc).@xcite the results obtained show an excellent agreement with experimental data due to both the exactness of the method and the accuracy of the interatomic potential between helium atoms . \n however , these calculations use as importance sampling trial wave function a nosanow - jastrow ( nj ) model,@xcite which is not symmetric under the exchange of particles . \n this is not a drawback for calculations of the energy or the spatial structure since the exchange energy has been estimated to be negligible , about 3@xmath4k / atom,@xcite but the lack of a correct quantum symmetry does not allow for estimations of the one - body density matrix and the superfluid density . \n two different models have been proposed to overcome this limitation . \n the first one is inspired in the bloch function of band theory currently used for electrons ; it is effectively a symmetric trial wave function but has proven to be worse than the nj model at the variational level.@xcite the second one corresponds to the shadow wave function,@xcite which allows for a good variational description of the solid , but not yet implemented in a dmc calculation .    in the present work \n , we present a microscopic study by means of the dmc method of bulk @xmath0he immersed in a lattice of confining potentials . by increasing progressively the strength of these external potentials we can get relevant information on the interplay between localization and superfluidity . measuring the degree of localization through the lindemann s ratio @xmath5 \n one can compare the physics of this structured phase with the solid one . at the experimental value for @xmath5 near the melting point \n the present model shows a non -

the authors conjecture that this may be due to the presence of grain boundaries formed in the growth of the crystal and which affect the coherence in the superflow . regarding this issue , \n we have computed @xmath65 at higher density , @xmath66 , and external constraint yielding @xmath62 and @xmath67 at density @xmath68 . \n the pressure of bulk solid @xmath25he at density @xmath69 ( @xmath70 bars ) is still on the range of supersolid experiments . \n we find @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 for the dmc - nj simulation at @xmath74 ) . \n therefore , within the statistical uncertainties of the model we do not observe pressure dependence of @xmath65 in the range of pressures analyzed . \n we have studied the competing effects of localization and superfluidity of bulk @xmath0he immersed in a lattice of external confining potentials . \n the simulations have been carried out at zero temperature using the dmc method . from the curve @xmath75 , and using the experimental value of @xmath5 of solid @xmath0he we obtain an estimation of the superfluid fraction @xmath1 , a value significantly larger than the experimental measure ( @xmath76 ) . on top of the possible drawbacks of the localized model for describing the @xmath0he solid phase , \n there are two effects that could help to explain the difference between the experimental measure and the present prediction . \n they are , first , the temperature ( the simulation is at zero temperature ) , and second , the possible influence of impurities in the experiments . \n the latter can be specially relevant since , as commented by kim and chan,@xcite a crucial point to observe superfluidity is the as much as possible elimination of impurities in the sample . \n the influence on the superfluid signal of @xmath77he impurities and/or incommensurability can be also analyzed in the present framework . \n work is in progress along this direction .", "StartTimeOffset": 1316051130130, "RequestID": "f67c31b0f53246f99cad634c35e47593", "TotalTokens": 4031}

stokes processes in multilevel systems have been employed . \n proof of principle experiments for this type of laser cooling have been carried out with @xmath0 gas @xcite and a dye - solution @xcite . \n more recently , anti - stokes laser cooling has allowed for the laser cooling of solid state materials , as rare - earth doped glasses @xcite . \n cooling down to 150k starting from ambient temperature could be realized in such systems @xcite .    in our work \n , we are examining laser cooling of an alkali - noble buffer gas mixture at very high pressures typically around a few hundred bar by means of collisional redistribution . as with the cooling of solids \n , this method involves the cooling of macroscopic ensembles of matter . \n redistribution of atomic fluorescence is most widely known in the context of magnetooptic trapping of ultracold atoms , where this mechanism is a primary cause of trap loss processes @xcite . in the long investigated field of room - temperature atomic collisions , redistribution of fluorescence is a natural consequence of line - broadening effects from collisional aided excitation @xcite . in theoretical works , \n berman and stenholm proposed in 1978 laser cooling ( and heating ) based on the energy loss or gain during collisionally aided excitation of atoms @xcite . \n experiments that used alkali vapor and moderate buffer gas pressure below one atmosphere observed a heating for blue detuned radiation @xcite , but the cooling regime was never reached .    in our experiment laser cooling by collisional redistribution \n is investigated in a mixture of hot atomic rubidium vapor and several hundred bar of a buffer gas , where the collisionally broadened linewidth approaches the thermal energy @xmath1 in frequency units . \n a scheme of the described laser cooling approach is sketched in figure 1 , where the variation of the rubidium @xmath2 ground state and the @xmath3 excited state versus the distance from a noble gas perturber atom is indicated in a binary collision quasimolecular picture . during a collision between a rubidium and a noble gas atom , the rubidium electronic d - line transition can be transiently shifted into resonance with an otherwise far red detuned laser beam , which enables collisionally aided radiative excitation @xcite . to achieve cooling \n , we typically work with detunings of 10 - 20 nm to the red of an atomic resonance , where excitation is energetically only possible with the support of a collisional process , and the excitation rate is strongly dependent on the rate of collisions .        the duration of a collision and the excited state lifetime are clearly resolved ( @xmath4ps compared to 27ns ) , so after an excitation , spontaneous decay occurs most likely at larger distances between the collision partners and thus closer to the unpertubed atomic resonance frequency . on average \n the emitted photon is blue shifted relatively to the incident wavelength . \n the rubidium atoms undergo frequent cycles of collisionally aided excitation and spontaneous decay , and provided that the emitted photons can leave the sample , the collision partners loose kinetic energy and will be cooled . \n the typical energy that can be removed from the reservoir in a cooling cycle is of order @xmath5hz at t=500k , corresponding to a factor 20000 above the typical energy difference @xmath6 removed by a fluorescence photon in usual doppler cooling of dilute rubidium atomic gases .    experimentally , we have in earlier work demonstrated relative cooling of a rubidium - argon mixture by 66k and of a potassium - argon mixture by 132k , both with an argon buffer gas pressure near 200bar @xcite . the achieved cooling power approaches 100mw , and the achieved temperature drop is limited by the thermal conductivity of the gas . \n the partial pressure of the buffer gas exceeds that of the alkali vapor by five orders of magnitude , and correspondingly it are the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of the buffer gas that determine the induced temperature change and the temperature flow from a local heat sink in the gas . \n accordingly it is favourable to use a buffer gas with low thermal conductivity to achieve a large temperature gradient and a low local minimum temperature in the gas . on the other hand , for the purpose of actually transferring the cooling power to another cooling load which should not be directly exposed to the laser radiation , \n the exact opposite is a good choice . \n here we present experimental results where we used as buffer gas helium , the noble gas with the highest thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity . \n helium has in both parameters roughly an order of magnitude higher values than argon , the buffer gas used in our previously published results @xcite . \n the present paper describes spectroscopic measurements and initial redistribution cooling results using helium as a buffer gas . \n we are aware that the achieving of larger temperature drops in helium - based buffer gas systems will most likely require the use of thermally isolated all - sapphire cells . \n moreover , we review earlier experiments obtained with rubidium - argon buffer gas mixtures .    in the following \n , section2 describes the used experimental setup and measurements of the buffer gas broadened sample . \n further , section3 describes results on redistribution laser cooling and section4 gives conclusions . \n a scheme of the used experimental setup is shown in fig.2 , see @xcite for a detailed description . in brief , the present experiment is carried out in a high pressure steel chamber , where optical access is provided by two uncoated sapphire optical windows . \n after ultra - sound cleaning and bake - out , the cell is filled with rubidium metal ( 1 g ampules ) and helium or argon buffer gas . \n the cell is heated to typically 500k , which yields a vapor pressure limited rubidium partial pressure of @xmath41 mbar , corresponding to a number density of @xmath410@xmath7@xmath8 , and the used noble gas pressure is typically around 200bar . as primary laser source for spectroscopy and cooling \n we use a continuous - wave titanium - sapphire laser system of 3w output power near the wavelength of the rubidium d - lines .    for spectroscopic characterization of the pressure broadened sample , \n a confocal detection geometry is used ( see also @xcite ) , to suppress scattered incident laser radiation and selectively detect fluorescence from the cooling beam region . \n figure3a gives a typical pressure broadened spectrum . \n the plot shows the total detected fluorescence yield versus the incident laser frequency in a region around the rubidium d1- and d2-lines ( at 377thz and 384thz , corresponding to 795 nm and 780 nm respectively ) . \n the lineshape is asymmetric , with an increased absorption amplitude on the blue wing of the line for the here shown case of the use of helium as a buffer gas . the large pressure broadening enables to efficiently excite the rubidium atoms at the large detuning values of order @xmath9 ( corresponding to 23 nm at t=500k ) as typically used in the cooling experiment . \n figure 3b shows spectrally resolved fluorescence spectra for exciting laser frequencies of 360thz and 401thz , corresponding to a red and a blue detuning respectively . in both cases , \n the scattered fluorescence is efficiently redistributed towards the d - lines center . while for the former case the emitted fluorescence has ( in average ) higher photon energies than the incident radiation , \n which we expect to lead to cooling of the gas sample , in the latter case the emitted fluorescence has lower photon energies than the exciting optical beam , for which heating is expected . \n provided that no additional heating processes occur , we from energy conservation expect a cooling power in the sample of @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the incident laser power and @xmath12 the absorption probability in the gas for an incident laser frequency @xmath13 . \n further , @xmath14 is the centroid frequency of the emitted fluorescence . \n the frequency dependence of the optical density follows in lowest order the fluorescence spectrum shown in figure 3a and on resonance reaches a measured maximum value of about 4.5 . \n the expected cooling power , according to eq.1 , versus the laser frequency is shown by the connected red crosses in figure 5a . \n for a red detuning of the laser light of 10 - 20 nm from resonance the expected cooling power for the here investigated helium - rubidium gas mixture is in the order of 5 mw . \n this is significantly lower than in results obtained for the case of an argon buffer gas in earlier measurements of our group @xcite , for which the obtained cooling power was roughly an order of magnitude higher ( see connected red crosses in fig.5b ) at comparable laser power . besides of the lower rubidium vapor pressure for the shown data set \n , we also attribute this to the different quasi - molecular potentials of the rb - he and rb - ar pairs , which result in a lower absorption for far red detuned radiation for the rb - he case . \n to obtain evidence for an actual temperature change of the gas inside the cell , we use a thermal deflection spectroscopy technique @xcite , see fig.4 . \n the cooling laser beam induces a local temperature change in the gas , which in turn changes the refractive index of the gas . \n we detect this change of the refractive index profile with an off - resonant probe laser beam , in this case a helium - neon laser at 632 nm . the induced change of the refractive index @xmath15 versus temperature can be approximated as @xmath16        the deflection of the probe beam along the beam path is accordingly given by @xmath17 the cooling beam has a @xmath18 profile with beam radius @xmath19 and experiences an absorption coefficient @xmath20 . \n for a heat transport mainly in the radial direction ( we assume a long cell and that the beam focal radius is much smaller than the absorption length ) , and assuming that the cooling beam removes heat with a rate following its intensity distribution , the temperature distribution can be determined from the beam deflection using : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the transverse offset between cooling and probe laser beams . for the refractive index of the rb - he mixture at the 632 nm probe wavelength a value n@xmath41.0070(3 ) for helium at 200bar \n is used @xcite , where the quoted uncertainty is basically determined by the accuracy of the pressure measurement . \n the temperature gradient for the given situation can be modelled using from a heat transfer model @xcite . after a cooling time @xmath23 , \n the expected temperature gradient profile is @xmath24 . \n \\label{eq : four2}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the specific heat capacity , @xmath19 the beam radius ( 1 mm for both cooling and probe beam ) , @xmath26 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath27 is the cooling power . \n the connected blue crosses in figs.5a and 5b show the measured deflection angle for helium and argon buffer gas respectively as a function of the cooling - laser frequency . for red detuning \n the probe beam is deflected towards the cooling beam , which indicates cooling , while the probe beam is deflected away from the cooling beam when the gas is locally heated . with the thermal deflection technique for both measurements cooling \n is observed only when the laser frequency is detuned approximately 10thz lower than one would expect from the redistribution of the fluorescence . \n the reason for this can be residual heating , which could be due to a small quenching cross section of excited - state rubidium atoms under the here present high buffer gas pressure . \n direct measurement of the lifetime of the excited 5p rubidium levels under 200 bar helium buffer gas confirm the natural lifetime of 27ns within an experimental uncertainty of 5ns @xcite . \n the here observed shift could be explained by an average decrease of the excited state lifetime of the rubidium 5p state due to quenching by roughly 1ns . despite the use of high purity buffer gas ( we typically use helium and argon buffer gas of purity 6.0 ) \n , we can not exclude that residual impurities , for example by a small nitrogen admixture , result in a corresponding reduction of the lifetime due to the high number of collisions the rubidium atoms undergo , typically several 10000 within a natural lifetime . \n quantitative measurements of the obtained temperature profile induced by the cooling laser beam have been carried out for the case of the rubidium - argon mixture , see ref.@xcite . here \n the lateral offset between the cooling and the probe laser beam was scanned . \n the red dots fitted with the black line show corresponding deflection data , obtained in such a transversal scan , which is a measurement for the transverse temperature gradient . \n the blue line shown in the figure is the result of a numerical integration of the corresponding deflection data following eq.4 . \n the used parameters for this measurement were a cooling laser frequency of 365thz , 1 mm cooling and probe beam diameters respectively , and 90% optical absorption in the 1 cm long cell . \n the obtained temperature drop in the beam center is 66(13)k , which is attributed to be limited by thermal conductivity of the argon gas in the thermally not isolated cooling volume . \n the dashed blue line is the temperature profile obtained from a theoretical heat transport model from which a cooling power of 87(20)mw can be derived . \n we expect that the temperature drop can be increased by depositing the available cooling power into a smaller volume , as can be achieved with a gas of higher optical density . \n we have investigated collisional redistribution cooling in both rubidium - argon and rubidium - helium gas mixtures . the observed cooling performance is , due to both the smaller thermal conductivity of the argon buffer gas and a blue asymmetry of the spectra in the case of rubidium - helium pair , generally more favourable in case of the use of argon as a buffer gas , at least for the present experimental condition of a gas cooling within the laser focus alone . \n cooling limitations from the large thermal conductivity of the buffer gas can however be avoided , when cooling of the complete cell is achieved , which requires the use of all ( sapphire- ) glass cells to suppress heating from wall absorption of scattered fluorescent radiation . to avoid condensation of the alkali atoms at the cell walls at low temperatures , \n we have started to investigate mixtures of molecular gases , which can be gaseous at room temperatures , and noble gases . \n promising candidates for a molecular redistribution cooling ( besides the alkaline - earth monohydrides , for which doppler laser cooling has already been demonstrated @xcite , are e.g. ethylene or co@xmath28-gas . \n future applications of redistribution laser cooling can include the supercooling of gases below the homogeneous nucleation temperature @xcite and optical chillers @xcite . \n zander , c. and drexhage , k.  h. , `` cooling of a dye solution by anti -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                                 as indicated in table @xmath26 , the @xmath22 and @xmath21 values are different for each cavity type , which increase with increasing cavity type . for the @xmath19 cavity , \n the quality factor is equal to @xmath27 and for the @xmath20 is @xmath28 . also according to table @xmath26 , the resonance wavelength of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .    by applying a single mode optical field to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities \n , we can demonstrate that cavities resonate with @xmath31 degrees phase difference . normalized transmission spectrum profile for both of @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavity types are depicted in figure @xmath32 . according to the figure @xmath33 , it is observed that at wavelength @xmath34 , the transmitted electric field through @xmath19 cavity has a positive value while the transmitted electric field through @xmath20 cavity has a negative value . \n we employed this transmission characteristics of the cavities to propose ultra - fast all optical cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates . \n the resonant optical fields within the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities experience a @xmath35 radian phase difference by applying a gaussian pulse with @xmath34 central wavelength . \n the obtained phase difference can not be retained through propagation in @xmath9 due to the material impaction . \n then , the phase difference changes from @xmath35 radian to about @xmath36 ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) at the output . to compensate this phase difference reduction \n , we applied the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity with a @xmath2 radian extra phase . according to the observed gaussian output pulses \n , we can see that the proposed structure operate at very high speed ( @xmath13 ) as illustrated in figure @xmath39 . in figure @xmath33 \n , one can observe that the resonance wavelengthes of cavities blue shift by increasing the applied voltage . \n where , a wavelength tunable range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 has been achieved by the applied voltage increasing from @xmath42 to @xmath39 @xmath43 . \n figure @xmath44 shows the optical intensity of signals with and without the extra phase through the structure . \n figures @xmath45 and @xmath46 show evolution of the phase difference of cavities from @xmath31 to @xmath47 through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , for without the extra phase case . \n however , in the case of extra phase application ( @xmath50 ) , figures @xmath51 and @xmath52 illustrate the evolution of the optical fields amplitudes for the cavities through the structure in the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , as it is observed the phase difference evolution reach to @xmath53 in the output of structure . with comparing figures @xmath54 and @xmath55 one can demonstrate that @xmath31 @xmath38 phase difference can be obtained in output , which is useful for realization of the claimed tunable optical logic gate . \n to design a cnot optical logic gate , we used two @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities in @xmath0 with square lattice of air rods . \n we applied an input signal to the @xmath19 cavity with phase of @xmath56 as input for the cnot gate and another input signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity with input phase of @xmath57 as the control signal for the gate . \n where , the field amplitude of control and input signals are equal . when the control field is set in zero @xmath58 logic level , with no signal applied to the @xmath20 cavity , the input signal of the @xmath19 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable reduction in its amplitude , as depicted in figures @xmath59 within temporal range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 . however , when the control field is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the reached pulse to the output of the gate is inverted of the input signal as depicted in figures @xmath59 from @xmath63 to @xmath60 . \n briefly , one can claim that no variation in the signal pulse amplitude is produced without applying any control signal . \n however , by applying a control signal , a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the input and control signals , which results in a destructive interference at the output and disappearing of the output signal referred as the low @xmath58 logic level . as illustrated by figure @xmath64 , the input of @xmath19 cavity is considered as the input port and the input of @xmath20 cavity as the control input of the cnot gate . \n the central wavelength of the both input pulses was the same at @xmath34 . \n as explained in above , figures @xmath59 exhibits the cavities responses with gaussian input pulses application for performing all logical cases of the truth table for the cnot logic gate . as an alternative view \n , one can consider the performance of the illustrated structure as an xor gate , due to the wavelength and field amplitude sameness of the applied input and control signals . here \n , the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xor logic gate is calculated as @xmath5 .      in order to realize an xnor gate \n , we should utilize three input signals where each of them is applied for one of three cavities created in the @xmath0 . here , there are two @xmath19 cavities to apply the input signals of the logic gate and one @xmath20 cavity for applying the control signal . for the xnor gate , \n always , the control field is set in high @xmath62 logic level . \n when the input signals are set in low @xmath58 logic levels , without applying any input signal to any @xmath19 cavities , the applied control signal to the @xmath20 cavity propagates to the output without any considerable variation in its amplitude , as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within temporal range of @xmath66 to @xmath61 . \n however , when any of the input signals is set in the high @xmath62 logic level , the received pulse to the output of the gate becomes zero , as depicted in figures @xmath65 from @xmath67 to @xmath66 . as the last case , when both of the input signals are set in the high @xmath62 logic level , interference of them with the control field cause in emerging an output pulse in the high @xmath62 logic level as exhibited in figures @xmath65 within the range of @xmath63 to @xmath67 . \n as the same as xor , the evaluated least on to off logic - level contrast ratio for the xnor logic gate is obtained as @xmath68 . in this work , \n we have considered full width at half maximum ( @xmath69 ) of the applied gaussian signals equal with @xmath70 . \n where , we have calculated the bit rate limit of @xmath7 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 for temporal performance of the simulated logic gates . \n then the proposed gates could demonstrate acceptable response for the gaussian input pulses with @xmath69 value of @xmath76 , temporally . \n thus , it is reasonable that data flow in the proposed logic gates can be enhanced to ultrahigh rates of @xmath77 , approximately . in this section \n , we demonstrated the logic gates operation with minimum value of the applied voltage at the central wavelength of @xmath34 . according to the figure @xmath33 we simulated operation of the gates at both extreme wavelengths of the achieved @xmath78 tunable range . \n thus , the designed tunable logic gates based on the electro - optic property of the substrate material show suitable characteristics . also , we would mention that one can design optical tunable logic gates with employing only @xmath19 or @xmath20 cavities by applying different voltages for each of the cavities . \n the electro - optic property of the substrate material of the @xmath0 cavities is deployed in optical tunable cnot ( xor ) and xnor gates functions achievement . \n where , we applied gaussian pulse signals at the central wavelength of @xmath40 as input signals for @xmath19 and @xmath20 cavities . \n where , the resonance wavelength of the cavity can reduce from @xmath40 to @xmath41 by increasing the applied voltage to the each cavity . at any wavelength within the tunable range \n , a @xmath35 radian phase difference is produced between the cavities output signals . in summary , for retaining this phase difference at the output of the @xmath9 structure , as the logic gate output , we got need for an extra phase difference @xmath79 between input and control signals of the logic gate . also , by temporal simulation of the designed logic gates , we demonstrated an ultra - fast logic operation and show their high potential as an appropriate candidate for applications such as tunable optical integrated circuits and optical processors . \n akihiro , f. ; takasumi t. _ opt . \n exp . _ * 2014 * , _ 22 _ , 4466 -

liquid interface except for the works in which a neutron confinement cell is presented @xcite . \n in contrast to this approach , where a liquid is confined in a narrow gap , our setup combines a standard rheometer with neutron reflectometry . + neutron reflectometry is a well established tool to investigate surface anomalies . \n neutrons are particularly valuable for the study of solid - liquid interfaces , since they are highly penetrating for many engineering materials , allowing the investigation of buried interfaces . in addition \n , they are sensitive to light elements , like hydrogen . \n the fact that neutrons are scattered from the nuclei of atoms makes them sensitive to different isotopes , allowing contrast variation measurements , by replacing hydrogen with deuterium , for example . in this context \n one striking example where neutrons contributed heavily are density profiles of liquids close to the solid surface and more specific the discussion on whether a density depleted water layer may exist close to hydrophobic surfaces . \n it was shown that a density depleted layer may , if it exists at all , extend at maximum to a fraction of a nm at certain surfaces @xcite . such a depleted layer will influence the flow properties in the near surface region @xcite . \n + in order to get additional information on in -

liquid interface on length scales ranging from nm up to 100 @xmath1 m @xcite . \n the sample , pluronic f127 ( eo@xmath2-po@xmath3-eo@xmath2 ) , was obtained from basf wyandotte corp . \n ( new jersey , usa ) and used without further purification . \n the bulk properties are known in great detail @xcite . \n pluronics are linear polymers featuring a core of propyleneoxide ( po ) and two terminating ethyleneoxide ( eo ) branches and can self assemble in aqueous solutions @xcite . \n the resulting agreggations have a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell . at a critical micelle volume fraction \n the micelles crystallize . \n this shear induced crystallization has been observed experimentally by small angle scattering @xcite . \n close to a hydrophilic interface the micelles are adsorbed in layers from the liquid phase as the crystalization transition is approached @xcite . for our experiment , \n f127 was diluted to 20 % ( by weight ) in deuterated water and poured into the sample cell in the liquid phase to prevent shearing of the percolated phase before the measurement . + two functionalized single crystalline silicon ( 100 ) substrates ( 70  mm * 70  mm * 10  mm , optically polished , obtained from _ \n _ crystec__@xmath0 , germany ) were used for the experiments . in order to provide high surface energy , one of the two wafers \n was chemically cleaned in freshly prepared piranha solution [ ( 50/50 v / v h@xmath4so@xmath5(concentrated ) and h@xmath4o@xmath4(30  % aqueous ) corrosive . \n acid -

situ rheology have been performed on the liquids reflectometer at the oak ridge national laboratory ( oak ridge , tn , usa ) and the instrument figaro @xcite at the institute laue - langevin ( grenoble , france ) . \n both are time of flight instruments allowing one to probe a relatively large q - range for one incident angle at the same time , which is advantageous since part of the reflectivity and most of the bragg scattering resulting from the crystalline order in the polymer solution can be collected without changing the instrument settings . \n the data shown below in this manuscript were taken on figaro for two incident beam angles of 0.8@xmath8 and 1.4@xmath8 , taking data for 10 s and 60 s , respectively . \n the chopper speed was set to 1135 rpm with a phasing of 12.5@xmath8 , 21@xmath8 and 45@xmath8 for the second , third and fourth chopper . \n this settings result in a wavelength resolution of 7.0 % ( fwhm of the gaussian equivalent ) . \n the beam defining slits were set to a width and height of 40 mm and 0.338 mm for the source slit and 25 mm and 0.108 mm for the sample slit . a detailed description of the instrument figaro as well as the standard data reduction can be found in ref . \n figure [ fig : refl ] , left panel , depicts the neutron reflectivity of a 20 % solution of f127 in deuterated water taken on the reflectometer figaro at the ill , grenoble , france . \n neutron reflectivity of the sample measured in the crystalline phase ( left panel ) . \n the right panel depicts raw data taken on figaro with the scattered intensity plotted versus wavelength and scattering angle . ] \n the data are corrected for the the incident beam spectrum and the background is subtracted using the standard data processing software tool cosmos @xcite , available on the instrument . \n the reflectivity of both incident angles is shown after stitching them together . \n in addition to the region of total external reflection visible at small q values ( below 0.1 nm@xmath9 ) two bragg - reflections are found for data taken at 25 @xmath10 and with the sample in contact to the surface covered with ots . \n the first reflection is located at q=0.37 nm@xmath9 and corresponds to a d spacing of 16 nm . assuming a cubic close packing of the micelles at the interface @xcite the lattice parameter of the fcc structure is 29.5 nm and the two bragg reflections can be identified as ( 111 ) and ( 222 ) . \n a detailed discussion of the static arrangement of f127 micelles close to surfaces with different surface energies can be found in ref . \n @xcite . the right panel in figure [ fig : refl ] \n depicts the scattered intensity plotted versus wavelength and scattering angle , as collected on figaro . \n the intensity for an incident beam angle of 1.4@xmath8 is shown without any correction . \n the horizontal streak at 2.8@xmath8 marks the specular reflected intensity , which is shown corrected and extracted in the left panel . \n the high intensity at wavelength around 0.85 nm and a scattering angle of 2.8@xmath8 refers to the specular component of the ( 111 ) bragg reflection . \n the strong off - specular scattering , diagonal streak , confirms a highly correlated roughness in the micellar crystal . \n the weak diagonal streaks also visible in the intensity map are related to small angle scattering from the micellar crystal and are only visible since a relaxed resolution , divergence , is used on figaro parallel to the sample surface in order to gain in flux . for a more detailed discussion of the off - specular and gracing incidence small angle scattering from static micellar crystals we refer the reader to ref . \n in addition to the data taken with the sample in contact to the ots coated silicon wafer the read circles represent the reflectivity in contact with the piranha treated one . \n a huge difference in the intensity of the ( 111 ) bragg reflection is clearly visible . \n note , the measurement with the sample in contact to the piranha treated surface was taken for a shorter time resulting in worse statistics and representing the quality of data achievable in the measurement time specified above . in this article , we focus on the specular intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection for the sample exposed to an oscillatory shear force with a frequency of 1 hz and as a function of deformation or strain . \n the intensity , depicted in figure [ fig : osc ] , has been extracted from the detector pictures by integrating the scattered intensity in a certain solid angle and wavelength range , marked by the black box in figure [ fig : refl ] , right panel . \n + figure [ fig : osc ] depicts the result in a graph where the storage and loss modulus are plotted together with the peak intensity , top and bottom panel , respectively . \n three regions can be distinguished . at small \n strain values the storage modulus is larger than the loss modulus , implying a dominantly elastic behavior of the micellar crystal . in this region \n we find a much lower intensity of the ( 111 ) reflection with the sample in contact with the piranha treated silicon surface as compared to the oxide and ots covered surfaces . \n this fact indicates a surface induced ordering and is in line with previous studies @xcite . at strain values of about 1 % , \n the loss modulus starts increasing and the storage modulus starts slowly decreasing . at the same time , the intensity of the bragg reflection starts to increase for the piranha surface and to decrease for the other surface . above about 5 % deformation , the loss modulus becomes larger than the storage modulus . \n this indicates that the sample shows a more liquid - like behavior . \n at the same time the intensities of the bragg reflections remain unchanged , which can be explained by sliding of subsequent layers of micelles parallel to the solid surface . \n finally , at large deformations above 1000 % there is a difference in storage and loss modulus of more than one order of magnitude and the intensities of the bragg reflections at the different surfaces becomes almost the same . \n this indicates that for large stress values the influence of the interface on the local ordering becomes less important as compared to the influence of the shear forces . \n we note that the cone - plate distance is 0.1 mm in the center of the cone and the cone angle 1@xmath8 . comparing this to the penetration depth ( depth \n at which the neutron beam is attenuated to 1/e ) of the neutron beam which is on the order of some tens @xmath11 it is clear that the rheometer in this configuration is not sensitive to the surface induced changes revealed by neutron reflectivity . \n stress , storage and loss modulus plotted together with the intensity of the bragg reflection versus shear strain . ] \n our results demonstrate that close to the interface the anisotropy imposed by shear competes with that resulting from the presence of the solid boundary . \n the transition from elastic to viscous shear can be observed in the changes of the crystal bragg peak intensity . \n the technique presented in this manuscript opens new possibilities for the study of the near surface properties of complex liquids . by evaluating the full three dimensional data taken on time of flight instruments it is possible to retain the near surface structure in liquids spanning length scales from nm up to @xmath1 m with in - situ deformation . \n the authors acknowledge the help of r. campbell and c. halbert during the various neutron scattering experiments as well as the swedish research council ( travel grant no . : \n 90045401 and project grant : a0505501 ) and stint ( contract number : ig2011 -

[ \n cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     three of the sources have falling ( non - thermal , @xmath2 ) spectra . \n cgpse  165 is a likely extragalactic source . \n it is only slightly extended at 1420 mhz , has a non - thermal spectrum and has no associated infrared emission . \n particularly noteworthy though is the filamentary structure made up of cgpse 172 and 168 \n . both sections of this filament have falling spectrum between 408 and 1420 mhz . a combined flux density measurement yields a spectral index of @xmath3 . \n this steep , non - thermal , spectral index combined with the filamentary morphology seen at both 408 and 1420 mhz makes this object a strong candidate for a new galactic snr ( g151.2 + 2.85 ) . \n figure  [ fig : l112 ] shows the region near the cas  a snr . \n the region is rich in optical regions and has been interpreted as being the early stages of the formation of an ob association @xcite or even being part of a much larger complex of star - forming regions @xcite . \n some of the individual regions have been observed at radio wavelengths at higher resolution but the cgps data show all of the regions in context and are sensitive to the extensive extended emission . \n for example , the observations of sh-2  157 by @xcite and @xcite focus only on the region around cgpse 72 and 75 , while cgpse 73 , 74 , and 78 are probably also related . \n the vla survey of optically visible regions by @xcite does not include any of these regions presumably due to a combination of the angular size limit for survey targets ( @xmath5 arcmin ) and the difficulty of obtaining images close to the cas  a snr . \n while cas a itself was not imaged by the drao interferometer because its high brightness makes image calibration extremely difficult @xcite , the cgps image quality at 1420 mhz for the region close to cas a is extremely high . \n special data reduction techniques , described by @xcite , were used to minimize artifacts associated with the bright snr . \n in addition the field centres for the fields surrounding cas a were selected so that the snr was located in the first null of the primary beam of the drao interferometer at 1420 mhz @xcite . \n since the cgps observations were not directed only to the locations of the optical regions a new galactic snr , g113.0 + 0.2 ( cgpse  83 , 84 and 85 ) , was discovered at the high - longitude end of this complex @xcite . \n also cgpse 87 is a newly identified faint extended radio source . \n the combined infrared , line and high - resolution ( approximately 45 arcsec ) molecular line data also available for this area would make the reinvestigation of this region , in the context of it possibly being a forming ob association , particularly worthwhile . \n there are a large number of optical regions with sizes ranging from 0.2 degrees up to about 0.5 degrees located around @xmath6 ( see figure  [ fig : nvsscomp ] ) . \n the emission associated with these regions is encompassed by a very extended `` bowtie '' structure of which the southern portion is associated with the large optical region sh 2 - 230 . \n the region around cgpse  201 ( sh 2 - 235 ) has been studied in some detail @xcite owing to its compact nature , which facilitates interferometric observations , and the fact it contains a number of embedded infrared sources . \n the region around the bright source cgpse  200 ( sh 2 - 236 ) is probably worthy of a more detailed investigation beyond the existing studies which use this large as as tracer of the galactic velocity field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the filaments cgpse  192 , 193 , 195 and 196 are all apparently thermal emission . \n cgpse  195 has a rising spectrum between 408 and 1420 mhz and infrared ( _ iras _ ) images of this area clearly show associated infrared emission . \n cgpse  196 is associated with a small ridge of infrared emission which is originating from an embedded infrared source , _ iras _  05329 + 3628 within a distant molecular cloud @xcite . \n there is no obvious infrared emission associated with cgpse 192 and 193 , however , given the fact the filaments are not detected at 408 mhz , they are most likely thermal emission associated with sh 2 - 230 . \n the cgpse catalogue provides a summary of the extended radio emission sources detected in the second quadrant of the galaxy by the cgps at 1420 mhz and at arcminute - scale resolution . \n in addition to flux density measurements at both 1420 and 408 mhz , the catalogue contains positional information and cross - identifications with other major radio and optical catalogues . \n also included are mosaic codes for each source that will facilitate the retrieval of cgps data from the cadc . \n the catalogue includes a number of newly identified radio continuum sources including a new galactic snr g151.2 + 2.85 . \n it expands the coverage of previous catalogues of extended galactic radio sources to include essentially the entire second quadrant along the galactic plane , and corrects a number of misclassifications and inadvertent omissions of large sources from previous catalogues . \n for example , cgpse  34 and 37 ( da 558 and da 568 ) were not included in the @xcite catalogue , and objects like cgps  17 and 187 are now correctly classified as regions not snrs . \n the outer galaxy is an ideal region for the study of the structure of spiral arms and for the observation of the content of star - forming regions owing to the relative proximity of the sources of interest and limited confusion when compared with similar studies directed towards the inner galaxy . \n we have illustrated how the radio continuum data alone from the cgps can provide new synoptic views of star forming complexes and lead to the discovery of new sources . \n the entire cgps data set is a unique resource for the investigation of galactic structure and star formation and it is hoped that this catalogue will facilitate the use of the cgps data set by the wider astronomy community . \n j.p . contributed to this research as part of the freshman honors program at iowa state university . \n j.m . participated in this research through an undergraduate research opportunity funded by iowa state university . \n the dominion radio astrophysical observatory is operated by the national research council of canada . \n the canadian galactic plane survey is supported by a grant from natural science and engineering research council of canada . \n green d.a . , 2006 , a catalogue of galactic supernova remnants ( 2006 april version ) , astrophysics group , cavendish laboratory , cambridge , united kingdom ( available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/ )", "StartTimeOffset": 1404926540887, "RequestID": "bc2904441474435c8db1c1f021f8e965", "TotalTokens": 2179}

{"ContextTokens": 2991, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "pulsars are steep - spectrum radio sources , with a `` typical '' spectral index of @xmath3 ( lorimer et al . \n for this reason , most large - area pulsar surveys have been done at relatively low frequencies , @xmath4mhz . however , at low frequencies and low galactic latitudes the contribution from synchrotron radiation ( with spectral index @xmath5 ) dominates the system temperature of a radio telescope , greatly reducing the sensitivity to most pulsars .    to search for pulsars along the disk of the galaxy , one should therefore consider using a relatively high frequency , @xmath6mhz ( @xmath7 cm ) . to search for _ distant _ pulsars along the galactic plane , one \n is virtually compelled to use high frequencies , because multi - path propagation of radio pulses through the inhomogeneous interstellar medium results in broadening ( `` scattering '' ) of intrinsically sharp pulses ( see fig . \n this effect , greatly reducing the detectability of pulsars , varies with frequency approximately as @xmath8 ( cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ) . \n the obvious drawback of a survey at 1400mhz is that , in addition to the long individual integration times required to maintain high sensitivity due to the reduced pulsar fluxes , the number of independent telescope pointings needed increases as @xmath9 . \n llll & jodrell bank & parkes & parkes + latitude range , @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + longitude range , @xmath14 & @xmath15  @xmath16 & @xmath17  @xmath18 & @xmath19 \n @xmath20 + center frequency ( mhz ) & 1400 & 1520 & 1374 + number of beams & 1 & 1 & 13 + integration time ( min ) & 10 & 2.5 & 35 + sample interval ( ms ) & 2.0 & 1.2 & 0.25 + bandwidth ( mhz ) & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + @xmath24 ( jy ) & 60 & 70 & 36 + @xmath25 ( mjy ) & 1.2 & 1.0 & 0.15 + pulsars found / detected & 40/61 & 46/100 & 440+/630 + + reference & clifton et al . \n & johnston et al . & \n this work +    despite this hindrance there are very good reasons for wanting to search the galactic plane : young pulsars will naturally be found close to their places of birth , viz . the galactic disk . while relatively rare , they are interesting for a variety of reasons , including the study of pulsar \n supernova remnant interactions , and the preferential display of rotational `` glitches '' , and increased likelihood of emission at x- and @xmath26-ray energies , which are of interest for studies of the internal dynamics , and cooling and emission mechanisms of magnetized neutron stars , respectively . \n also , to obtain an unbiased picture of the intrinsic galactic distribution of pulsars , rather than just of the local population , one must penetrate deep into the galaxy , i.e. , use high frequencies . \n only two large - area pulsar surveys had been carried out at 20 cm prior to the one described here . \n the surveys of clifton et al . \n ( 1992 ) and johnston et al . \n ( 1992 ) in the 1980s ( see table  1 ) were very successful at finding many pulsars , preferentially young and relatively distant .    in early 1997 \n a 13-element receiver package with very good system noise characteristics was installed on the parkes telescope . \n developed for surveying hi in the local universe ( staveley - smith et al . \n 1996 ) , it is also ideally suited for pulsar searching . \n we began collecting data for the survey in august 1997 . \n receivers for each of 13 beams are sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations . \n signals from each polarization of each beam are detected in 96 filters , each 3mhz wide , upon which they are added in polarization pairs , high - pass filtered with a cutoff of 0.2hz , integrated for 0.25ms , and 1-bit sampled before being written to magnetic tape with relevant telescope information , for off - line processing . \n the sensitivity of the survey to long - period pulsars , about 0.15mjy , is a factor of seven better than the previous parkes 20 cm survey ( johnston et al . \n 1992 ) , and we are even more sensitive to short - period pulsars , owing to the faster sample interval and narrower filters used ( see table  1 ) . figure  1_a _ shows the calculated sensitivity of the survey . \n note that the figure does not take into account scattering : according to it a pulsar like the crab , with period 33ms , but located across the galaxy , with @xmath27@xmath2pc , will be detectable with a minimum flux density of about 0.6mjy . \n as figure  4_b _ shows , such a pulsar will most likely not be detectable as a pulsed source almost regardless of strength . \n the 13 beam patterns ( each subtending a @xmath28 diameter ) are not adjacent on the sky ; rather , one central beam ( with the best sensitivity ) is surrounded by a ring of six beams separated by two beams - widths , surrounded in turn by a second ring separated by a further two beam - widths . \n we collect data by interleaving pointings on a hexagonal grid , resulting in complete sky coverage with adjacent beams overlapping at half - power points . \n each pointing covers an area about 0.6deg@xmath29 , resulting in sky coverage at a rate of 1deg@xmath29/hr , and the total survey area requires about 2700 individual pointings .    as of september 1999 we have collected and analyzed about 1200 independent telescope pointings , some 700deg@xmath29 , or 45% of the total . \n data reduction takes place in workstations in a manner similar to previous surveys ( e.g. , manchester et al . \n 1996 ) . figure  1_b _ shows the search - code output for the discovery of a binary pulsar . to date we have discovered 440 new pulsars , and have re - detected 190 known pulsars . because of the long integrations , some binary pulsars ( in particular millisecond pulsars ) have signal - to - noise ratios reduced , owing to doppler - induced varying spin periods . \n we therefore complement our standard search analysis with `` acceleration search '' reduction , recently begun . \n while we have discovered 10 new pulsars for every 1% of the survey area searched so far , it should not be concluded that we will amass a total of 1000 new pulsars . \n we began by surveying the regions closest to the galactic plane , which are richest in pulsars . in figure  2_a \n _ we see that we have already searched essentially the entire @xmath30 region , with a new - pulsar density , averaged over the entire longitude range , of slightly over 1/deg@xmath29 . \n clearly the density of pulsars drops dramatically for @xmath31 , which comprises much of the region yet to be searched . \n conversely in figure  2_b _ we see that , as a function of longitude , the region we have preferentially searched so far ( @xmath32 ) has the lowest pulsar density . accounting for these selection effects in some detail , we predict that the number of new discoveries for the entire survey should be somewhat over 600 . another estimate is derived from the number of pulsars previously known in the overall search area , 255 , and the number of ( re-)detections : these would suggest an eventual total of @xmath33 new objects . \n in fact we expect a total of about 700 pulsars to be discovered , after accounting for some further selection effects ( e.g. , so far we have not been complete in confirming new pulsar candidates down to the sensitivity level implicit in the calculations underlying figure  1_a _ ) . \n we have therefore already detected about 2/3 of all pulsars we will discover . \n manchester et al . \n ( this volume ) describe in some detail what is already known about many of the new pulsars . \n figure  3_a _ shows the distribution of dm for the newly discovered pulsars , and for comparison also shows that for previously known pulsars . \n qualitatively the distribution is as expected : we find pulsars predominantly with large dm , since our survey is by far the most sensitive ever to distant pulsars along the galactic plane ; on the other hand we find very few `` nearby '' ( @xmath34@xmath2pc ) pulsars , in part because selection effects ( e.g. , scattering ) preventing the detection of such pulsars in past surveys were far less important than for high - dm pulsars . \n the median dm for the new pulsars is about 400@xmath2pc , and we also see that there is a marked decrease in the number of objects with @xmath35@xmath2pc , with a maximum of about 1300@xmath2pc . naturally it is more difficult to find such highly dispersed pulsars , both because of the attending level of scattering , and reduced flux density due to large distance . but \n as we can see from figure  4_a _ , we do not in any case expect large numbers of pulsars in the galaxy to have @xmath36@xmath2pc .    a comparison of the period distributions for newly discovered and previously known pulsars ( fig . \n 3_b _ ) yields some surprises . \n the most obvious discrepancy is that we have not discovered a significant number of short - period pulsars ( only one with @xmath37ms ) . \n the parkes 70 cm survey ( manchester et al . 1996 ) , with a long - period sensitivity of @xmath38mjy and poorer time- and frequency - resolution than the multibeam survey , yielded 17 millisecond pulsars . assuming a spectral index of @xmath39 , 3mjy at 70 cm are equivalent to 0.3mjy at 20 cm  i.e. \n , we should be more sensitive to millisecond pulsars than that survey . \n one can not reasonably appeal to hypothetical larger spectral indices : edwards et al . \n ( this volume ) report on the very successful use of the multibeam data - acquisition system for finding millisecond pulsars in a survey at intermediate galactic latitudes and with short integration times . \n it is conceivable that strong scattering prevents us from detecting many millisecond pulsars with @xmath40@xmath2pc ; in any case we are still investigating this dearth of millisecond pulsar discoveries . \n a second surprise concerns the discovery of relatively many pulsars with long periods , @xmath41s . \n this may be due to surveys with shorter integration times not collecting data for many such pulse periods , coupled with the prevalence of `` nulling '' pulsars among those with long periods ; and to the effectiveness with which much local radio - frequency interference gets `` dispersed away '' in our search for high - dm pulsars .    in figure  4_a \n _ we plot the positions of the pulsars detected in the multibeam survey projected onto the galactic plane , according to the distance model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) . \n two things are immediately apparent : the previously known re - detected pulsars are located relatively nearby ( @xmath42kpc ) , while many of the newly discovered pulsars are very distant , with many beyond the inner - most spiral arm ; and many of the newly discovered pulsars seem to be located along spiral arms , particularly the two inner - most ones . regarding this last point , we do expect pulsars to be correlated with spiral arm locations , but we should be careful to consider potential biases in the distance model that will place pulsars preferentially in regions of high electron density . \n the multibeam survey is being remarkably successful at uncovering very distant pulsars . \n the dm - distribution of these pulsars , @xmath43 , together with measured scattering parameters ( cf . \n 4_b _ ) , and eventually faraday - rotation parameters , probing the interstellar magnetic field , should give us a more unbiased picture of the galactic distribution of pulsars , and add considerably to our knowledge of the interstellar medium .", "StartTimeOffset": 1471386528857, "RequestID": "64a165c3df244747ad773c53e7675937", "TotalTokens": 3139}
{"ContextTokens": 3297, "GeneratedTokens": 260, "SynthesizedBody": "globular clusters are among the oldest objects in galaxies , and understanding the details of their formation and evolution can bring valuable insight into the early history of galaxies . \n one of the most interesting questions concerns the relation of globular clusters to the stellar halos of galaxies . at present \n , only a small fraction of halo stars are found in clusters . \n observations indicate however that the galactic halo has a clumpy structure ( majewski et al . \n 1996 , helmi et al . \n 1999 ) , and tidal streams surrounding globular clusters ( grillmair et al . \n 1995 , leon et al . \n 2000 ) have been detected . \n a significant fraction of the stellar halo might therefore have formed in compact stellar systems , although dwarf galaxies are also possible contributers . \n linked to this question is the determination of the initial mass function of globular clusters . \n the globular cluster system of the milky way as we observe it today is characterized by a gaussian distribution in absolute magnitudes , with mean @xmath2 and scatter @xmath3 ( harris 2000 ) . \n similar distributions have been found for old cluster systems in other galaxies ( kundu et al . \n in contrast , young massive clusters in interacting and starburst galaxies have power - law distributions over masses @xmath4 , with slopes close to @xmath5 ( whitmore & schweitzer 1995 , whitmore et al . \n if the globular cluster system of the milky way has started with such a mass - function , it contained many low - mass clusters which dissolve completely and cause a stronger enrichment of the stellar halo .    in this paper , we study cluster systems starting with gaussian or power - law mass - functions . \n we use analytic formulas for the lifetimes of star clusters and remove clusters with lifetimes smaller than a hubble time . the number and masses of surviving clusters \n are then compared with the milky way globular cluster system in order to determine the mass that must have been initially in the cluster system . \n this estimate is then compared with the mass of the stellar halo . \n the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we discuss the dissolution processes of globular clusters . \n section 3 describes the set - up of the cluster system and in section 4 we present the results . in section 5 \n we draw our conclusions . \n star clusters dissolve due to several processes : in the beginning the loss of gas out of which the cluster was formed and the mass - loss of individual cluster stars are most important . \n later clusters dissolve mainly due to two - body relaxation and disc or bulge shocks from the varying external tidal field . \n clusters are also affected by dynamical friction , which causes them to sink towards the galactic center where they are destroyed by the strong tidal field . \n we consider clusters moving in circular orbits and start our simulations after the initial gas is removed from the clusters and massive stars have gone supernova . \n hence , we are left with only two dissolution processes : two - body relaxation and dynamical friction . \n the lifetimes against two - body relaxation are obtained from a fit to the results of @xmath0-body simulations made by sverre aarseth and douglas heggie as part of the collaborative experiment ( heggie et al . \n they performed simulations of multi - mass , king @xmath6 clusters which moved on circular orbits through an external tidal field . \n figure 1 shows the half - mass times of their clusters as a function of the particle number @xmath0 . \n the best fit is obtained by @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( giersz & heggie 1996 ) . \n the lifetimes are obtained by assuming that they are twice as large as the half - mass times . \n we note that the lifetimes of clusters in external tidal fields increase more slowly with the particle number than their relaxation times . \n it has been shown ( fukushige & heggie 2000 , baumgardt 2001 ) that this is a consequence of the finite escape time of stars from such clusters . as a result , \n lifetimes of globular clusters are smaller than previously predicted .      according to binney & tremaine ( 1987 , eq .  7 - 26 ) \n , the time it takes for a cluster with mass @xmath9 and initial galactocentric distance @xmath10 to sink to the galactic center is given by    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the circular velocity of the galaxy and @xmath13 is of order 10 . \n the milky way is modeled as an isothermal sphere with circular velocity @xmath14 km / sec . \n we adopt an age of @xmath15 gyr for the age of the galactic globular cluster system . \n cluster masses either follow a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath16 and width @xmath17 , or a power - law @xmath18 with slope @xmath19 . if clusters are distributed according to a power - law , lower and upper limits of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are chosen for the cluster masses . \n the lower limit has no influence on the final mass - function , since clusters with @xmath22 dissolve at all galactocentric radii in less than a hubble time . \n we study the evolution of star clusters between galactocentric distances 1  kpc  @xmath23  40  kpc . at each @xmath24 \n , we simulate the evolution of 200.000 clusters . \n we first calculate their dynamical friction time @xmath25 according to eq .  2 , and remove clusters with @xmath26 . for the remaining clusters , \n we calculate their tidal radius from the cluster mass and the galactocentric distance . \n we assume that the density distribution of a cluster follows a king @xmath6 profile , in which case the ratio of the half - mass radius of a cluster to its tidal radius is given by @xmath27 . \n we can then calculate the crossing times @xmath28 and the dissolution times of the clusters according to eq .  1 . \n if the dissolution time is smaller than a hubble time , a cluster dissolves completely , otherwise the final mass of the cluster is calculated according to @xmath29 i.e.  we assume a constant mass - loss rate . \n fig .  2 shows the evolution of the mass - function of globular clusters at two galactocentric radii . \n a gaussian initial mass - function stays everywhere close to the initial distribution . in the inner parts , the mean mass increases slightly due to the efficient destruction of low - mass clusters . in the outer parts , the distribution changes very little since \n only few clusters are destroyed . \n a power - law distribution shows a stronger depletion of clusters . in the inner parts \n , it evolves into a distribution which is very similar to the one obtained from a gaussian initial mass - function . \n the two distributions differ mainly at large galactocentric radii , where the power - law distribution leads to a mass - function with lower mean mass . \n but even at large radii , the power - law distribution evolves into a bell - shaped curve . \n fig .  3 compares the mean cluster masses with the observations of milky way clusters . \n the properties of galactic globular clusters show no strong variation with galactocentric distance \n . the mean cluster mass might be slighter larger around @xmath30 kpc , but the differences are small . \n independent of the starting condition , the final cluster systems match the milky way clusters for @xmath31 kpc fairly well . \n hence , the initial state can not be decided from observations of the inner clusters . in the outer parts , \n a gaussian initial distribution is close to the observations while a power - law mass - function produces a cluster system which has too many low - mass clusters . \n this could change however if elliptic cluster orbits are considered , in which case clusters are destroyed more easily due to the varying tidal field . \n in addition , undiscovered low - mass clusters could exist in the galactic halo , causing the mean cluster mass to be lower than observed . \n the fraction of clusters that survive after 12 gyr and the mass lost from the globular cluster system depend on the radial distribution of clusters . \n the number of observed globular clusters decreases as @xmath32 , at least for @xmath33 kpc ( harris 2000 ) . \n if we adopt the same distribution for the initial cluster system , we find that for a gaussian mass - function , @xmath34 of globular clusters survive over the whole range of distances studied ( 1 - 40 kpc ) . \n they contain 36  % of the mass that was initially in the cluster system . \n the corresponding numbers for a power - law distribution are 8 % and 25 % respectively . \n as expected much fewer clusters survive \n . however , since most of the dissolving clusters are of low mass , the mass - loss rates differ not very much . as a lower limit instead of @xmath35 , would decrease the mass fraction surviving in clusters to 3/4 of its original value . ] \n according to the mcmaster - database of globular cluster parameters ( harris 1996 ) , the galactic globular cluster system contains 132 clusters between 1 and 40 kpc . \n these clusters have a total mass of @xmath36 . \n the initial mass in the cluster system was therefore of order 1 to @xmath37 . according to suntzeff \n et al .  ( 1991 ) , the mass of the stellar halo between 4 and 25 kpc is @xmath38 . assuming a @xmath39 density law for the halo stars , the halo mass between 1 and 40 kpc turns out to be @xmath40 , which is an order of magnitude more than the mass of the globular cluster system in this distance range . \n hence , the majority of halo stars was not born in clusters . \n the evolution of the galactic globular cluster system under the influence of two - body relaxation and dynamical friction was studied . \n it was found that a gaussian initial distribution fits the present day galactic globular cluster system very well . \n a power - law initial distribution can not be ruled out however since it gives a good fit to the observations in the inner parts . \n the differences in the outer parts could vanish if additional destruction mechanisms are considered . \n furthermore , our knowledge of remote halo clusters might not be complete . \n we can not constrain the fraction of stars born in low - mass clusters with @xmath22 , since low - mass clusters dissolve completely even at the largest distances studied .    depending on the initial mass - function , only between 5 % and 10 % of the halo stars \n were born in globular clusters . \n this value is smaller than the fraction of stars formed in young star clusters in starburst and interacting galaxies , which seems to be close to 20 % ( meurer et al . \n 1995 , zepf et al . \n some of these young clusters might however be unbound , or become unbound due to the mass - loss of individual cluster stars . \n this could bring both values into agreement . \n i thank douglas heggie for a careful reading of the paper and comments . \n is supported by pparc under grant 1998/00044 . \n baumgardt , h. 2001 , mnras , in press , astro - ph/00120330 binney , j. , tremaine , s. 1987 , galactic dynamics , princeton univ .  press , princeton fukushige , t. , heggie , d.  c. 2000 , mnras,318 , 753 giersz , m. , heggie , d.  c. 1996 , mnras , 279 , 1037 grillmair , c.  j. , freeman , k.  c. , irwin , m. , quinn , p.  j. 1995 , aj , 109 , 2553 harris , w.  e. 1996 , aj , 112 , 1487 harris , w.  e. 2000 , in globular cluster systems : lectures for the 1998 saas - fee advanced course on star clusters , in press heggie , d.  c.  et al . \n 1998 , in highlights of astronomy , vol . \n 11b , ed . \n j.  andersen , d.  reidel publ . \n dordrecht , p.  591 helmi , a. , white , s.  d.  m. , de zeeuw , p.  t. , zhao , h. 1999 , nature , 402 , 53 kundu , a.  et al . 1999 , \n apj , 513 , 733 leon , s. , meylan , g. , combes , f. 2000 , a&a , 359 , 907 majewski , s.  r. , munn , j.  a. , hawley , s.  l. 1996 , apj , 459 , l73 meurer , g.  r.  et al . \n 1995 , aj , 110 , 2665 suntzeff , n.b . , \n kinman , t.d . , kraft , r.p . \n 1991 , apj , 367 , 528 whitmore , b.  c. , schweizer , f. 1995 , aj , 109 , 960 whitmore , b.  c.  et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 1551 zepf , s.  e.  et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 752", "StartTimeOffset": 1481259066710, "RequestID": "cec58a3550e5480daa39b0287c312d81", "TotalTokens": 3557}
{"ContextTokens": 4082, "GeneratedTokens": 261, "SynthesizedBody": "cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy measurements provide a means of constraining various cosmological models . \n several groups have reported measuring cmbr anisotropies at 0.5 to 1(@xcite ) . however , disentangling the primodial fluctuatations from foreground sources is problematic even if the foreground is understood . \n the third flight of max made an observation in a medium constrast dust region near the star mu pegasi and measured anisotropy smaller than seen elsewhere in the same flight ( @xcite ) . in order to confirm this measurement \n , we returned to the mu pegasi region with an additional low frequency band centered at 3.5 @xmath0 . \n max is an off - axis gregorian telescope with a bolometric photometer mounted on an attitude - controlled balloon platform . \n the instrument has been described extensively elsewhere ( @xcite ) . \n the telescope has a 1  m off - axis parabolic primary with an elliptical secondary which sinusoidally chops the beam in azimuth at 5.4  hz with a peak - to - peak throw of 14 . \n the chopped signal is demodulated with a sine - wave lock - in reference . \n the underfilled optics provide a 05  fwhm beam . \n an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator cools the single - pixel , four - band photometer to 85  mk . \n the four frequency bands are centered at 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 with respective fractional bandwidths 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.4 , and 0.2 . to convert measured antenna temperature differences to 2.726  k thermodynamic temperature differences in each frequency band multiply by 1.62 , 2.50 , 6.66 , and 38.7 , respectively . \n the instrument was launched from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas at 1.16  ut june  20 , 1994 . \n we observed cmbr anisotropies in three sky regions near the stars hr5127 , phi herculis , and mu pegasi ( @xmath6  =  22@xmath7497 , @xmath8  =  2434 ) . \n tanaka et al . ( 1996 ) report on the observations at hr5127 and phi herculis \n . this paper concerns the mu pegasi scan .    we observe with a constant velocity scan in azimuth of @xmath94  relative to the pointing star . \n the left - hand lobe of the antenna pattern was coaligned with the field of view of our ccd cameras and centered on mu pegasi . \n gyroscope drift was taken out every 400 seconds . \n the relative offset between the center of the chop and the target star was 055 in azimuth .    during the mu pegasi scan ( 7.22  ut to 7.76  ut ) the gyro malfunctioned and moved the chop center with \n a trajectory tilted 10@xmath10 degrees from horizontal . \n the orientation of the gondola was still vertical . \n we verified the orientation and trajectory with the positions of stars in the ccd camera field of view . \n we did not observe in the same orientation as in max3 and we do not expect the morphology to be identical . \n the other max 5 observations displayed no significant tilt . \n we calibrated the instrument before and after the observation using a membrane transfer standard ( @xcite ) . \n we observed jupiter from 4.86  ut to 4.95  ut to measure the beam size and position and to confirm the membrane calibration . using the best - fit beam size and the membrane calibration , the derived temperature of jupiter agrees with griffin et al . \n ( 1986 ) to within 10% . \n we assume a 10% uncertainty in calibration . \n the calibration is such that a chopped beam centered between sky regions with temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 would yield @xmath13 in the absence of instrumental noise . \n anisotropy experiments are potentially susceptible to off - axis response to local sources , particularly the earth , the balloon , and the moon . \n the unchopped off - axis response in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is @xmath14 70  db below the on - axis response from 15  to 25  in elevation under the boresight . \n we have not made comparable measurements of the chopped sidelobe response in azimuth . \n mu pegasi was @xmath15 137  away from the moon during the observation . \n we remove transients due to cosmic rays using an algorithm described by @xcite . \n this procedure excludes approximately 18% of the data . \n we demodulate the detector output using the sinusoidal reference from the chopping secondary to produce antenna temperature differences @xmath16 on the sky . \n this produces a data set in phase and a data set 90  out of phase with the optical signal . \n the noise averaged over the observation gives respective cmbr sensitivities of 440 , 240 , 610 , and 5100 @xmath17 in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 bands . \n the averages of the measured instrumental offsets in antenna temperature were 0.6 , 0.15 , 1.4 , and 2.8  mk in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands . \n we attribute this to chopped emissivity differences on the primary mirror and chopped atmospheric emission . \n the offset drifts in the higher frequency bands with amplitudes of 0.7  mk and 1.0  mk in the 9 and 14 @xmath0 bands over a time scale of  3 minutes . \n comparison of the first and second halves of the scan shows that the signal is stable in the 3.5 , 6 , and 9 @xmath0 bands , but not so in the 14 @xmath0 band . \n the instability in the 14 @xmath0 band could be caused by sidelobe pickup or atmosphere . to increase the stability , \n we subtract an offset and gradient , as in a ground based observation , with a linear least squares fit to each pass going from -4  to + 4  or + 4  to -4 . \n each half scan takes 72  s.    for each observation we calculated the means and 1  @xmath18 uncertainty of the antenna temperature differences for 29 pixels separated by 17  on the sky . \n figure  [ mpant ] shows the antenna temperature differences as a function of scan angle for the mu pegasi scan . \n there is significant structure ( @xmath19  =  38 , 86 , 86 , 79 for 27 dof ) that is well correlated ( @xmath20 ) in all channels of the in - phase data . \n possible astrophysical sources for the signal in the mu pegasi scan are free - free or synchrotron radiation , interstellar dust ( isd ) emission , radio point sources , or cmbr . from the rising spectrum in @xmath21 in figure  [ mpant ] \n it is clear that cmbr , free - free or synchrotron radiation alone is not responsible for the signal . \n the latter two cases are also excluded by amplitude and morphology arguments . \n if we extrapolate the haslam 408 mhz map ( @xcite ) to our frequencies using @xmath22 for free - free emission and @xmath23 for synchrotron radiation and convolve with our chopped beam pattern , we find that the former produces @xmath24 of the signal in the 3.5  @xmath0 channel and the latter @xmath25 . \n furthermore , the morphology does not match that of the data . \n an automated point source search has yielded no candidates within 90  that could produce a signal greater than @xmath26 . \n previous experience in this region leads us to expect isd to be the main contributor to our high frequency signal . \n we convolved the iras 100  maps with our chopped beam pattern and produced simulated scans . \n we found the scale factors that minimized the reduced @xmath19 from 100  simulations to each data channel separately and then normalized them to the 3.5 @xmath0 band . \n the results are shown in table [ specfits ] . \n the best fit morphology and spectrum are superimposed over the data in figure  [ mpant ] . \n if we consider the 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands only , these scale factors indicate a warm dust spectrum @xmath27 , where @xmath2  =  1.3@xmath28 and t@xmath29  =  19@xmath30  k. this is consistent with our previous results ( @xcite ) . \n however , the rise in amplitude in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is not well explained by a warm dust or warm and cold dust model . \n there are two possible causes for the rise in amplitude in the lowest band . \n one is a high frequency leak in the filters . \n pre - flight systematic tests with a thick grill high pass filter showed that high frequency leakage above 20  was less than 0.8% of the total band response to a 300k blackbody chopped relative to a 77k blackbody . using measured filter transmittances and the amplitude of dust fluctuations in this sky region ( fischer et al . 1995 ) , we calculated that maximum modeled high frequency leakage of power from dust fluctuations contributes less than @xmath151% of the expected inband power from cmb fluctuations and less than 2% of the observed structure . \n another candidate is a correlated low frequency component .. however , our cross - correlation coefficient 3.5 @xmath31 which should be compared to @xmath32 for @xmath33 however , fits of two component models did not conclusively distinguish between the possibilities , such as cmbr + isd and hii + isd . \n we conclude the following about the foreground contaminant : the correlation between the 14 @xmath0 band and the other bands indicates a single foreground morphology . whatever the nature of the foreground , the relative amplitudes in the bands are given in table [ specfits ] column 2 . because of the excellent fit of the iras 100  maps to the 14 @xmath0 channel , \n we assume that the isd dominates over any other possible high frequency contaminant . \n we analyze the three channels most sensitive to cmbr , 3.5 , 6 and 9 @xmath0 for anisotropy in the presence of a single foreground morphology with the spectrum found above . \n we use maximum likelihood methods assuming uniform prior to set limits of the rms temperature fluctuation in the data , @xmath34 ( @xcite ) . \n the likelihood , l , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the data vector of all 29 bins and 3 channels and @xmath37 is the full covariance matrix for a flat band power spectrum . \n we marginalize the data to account for the best fit foreground spectrum given in table [ specfits ] and the offset and gradient removal ( @xcite ) . to do so \n , we construct a data vector and covariance matrix , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 account for both a single foreground spectrum and offset and gradient removal respectively . using @xmath42 and @xmath43 in equation ( [ likelihood ] ) \n yields an upper limit , @xmath44 23 @xmath45k ( 95% confidence level ) or @xmath46 . \n when max3 mu pegasi is analyzed in a fashion similar to this paper , we find @xmath47k ( 95% confidence level ) when marginalized for the dust model in @xcite . \n the two data sets are consistent with each other for similar analysis techniques . \n furthermore , the max5 mu pegasi upper limit is consistent with the result from hr5127 ( @xmath48 ) although roughly so with phi herculis ( @xmath49 ) which were also observed in that flight . \n we have presented new results from a search for cmbr anisotropy with high sensitivity at 05 angular scales near the star mu pegasi . \n free - free and synchrotron radiation are excluded as the main source of signal on amplitude and spectral arguments . \n there are no strong point sources in the field . \n the morphology of the observed structure is consistent with known interstellar dust but not the spectrum . \n the structure in the 6 , 9 and 14 @xmath0 channels is fit by a single dust model power law @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath52  k. we can not rule out the possibility that the structure is a correlated combination of dust and cmbr or dust and free - free radiation . \n linear combinations of the data independent of the best fit spectrum yield a @xmath53 . \n ( 95% confidence level ) the results are consistent with our previous observation in the region . \n these data are available from the authors . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation through the center for particle astrophysics ( cooperative agreement ast  91 -

{"ContextTokens": 2197, "GeneratedTokens": 333, "SynthesizedBody": "the capability of oscillations to probe the internal structure of stars is fully testified by solar studies . \n for this reason , pulsating stars , that are spread in the hr diagram , are expected to largely improve our knowledge of stellar evolution and physical assumptions in models . \n @xcite has shown that both radial and non - radial modes of pulsating stars are observationally distinguishable via the analysis of line profile variation ( lpv ) . from this pioneering work \n , there has been an increasing interest in lpv modeling driven by the improvement in resolution and efficiency of modern spectrographs : @xcite included the influence of stellar rotation , @xcite considered photospheric spots , @xcite performed a mode identification via the moments of the line profile or @xcite via the doppler imaging technique . \n @xcite noted that a pure kinematic approach is not enough for lpv modeling and that a realistic representation of the strength and broadening of spectral lines were necessary . \n they considered the atmosphere of a pulsating star as a perturbed status of the hydrostatic equilibrium and represented the temperature perturbation of atmospheric layers with a series expansion in terms of effective temperature and gravity . \n this operative method does not clearly represent the physics of @xmath0cep stars , pulsation modes do not change the energy production and the very small ( 1% ) stellar radius variation @xcite can not modify neither the effective temperature nor the surface gravity in an observable way . \n however along a pulsation cycle , the compression and expansion of photospheric layers change the dependence of temperature and pressure on optical depth and let the effective temperature appear variable , with the pulsation period , if determined in a limited spectral interval . \n a phenomenon indeed observed in some @xmath0 cephei stars by @xcite on the basis of a photometric approach . \n these authors derived a t@xmath1 variability up to 1000 k with the pulsation period , from geneva colours .    with the density and temperature , the variation of atomic level populations \n should also result in apparent surface gravity variations . \n in fact , there is an equivalence between stellar surface gravity and electron pressure in the framework of spectral line formation @xcite . \n a further contribution to the strength and profile of spectral lines comes from the microturbulence ( @xmath4 ) , that in principle could be modified along compression and expansion phases .    in this paper \n we analyse a set of time resolved spectra of @xmath0 cep (=  hd205021  =  hr8238 ) , which is generally accepted to be the proto - type of a class of hot pulsating stars , with the aim of ascertaining the apparent variability of the effective temperature , gravity and microturbulence with the pulsation period . \n these variations would strongly constrain any lpv method , as the one proposed by dupret and collaborators . \n .for each spectrum we report the heliocentric julian date , the radial velocity measured from the si iii triplet at 4550 , the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 determined through the h@xmath0 line . \n [ cols=\"^,>,^,^ \" , ]     the number and equivalent widths of the silicon lines in our spectra are not enough to measure the microturbulence . however , the siiii triplet at 4552 , 4567 and 4574 is very sensitive to this velocity field and rules out a microturbulence range larger than 1.0 km s@xmath5 . \n table[equiv ] shows that for the microturbulence variation deduced from nitrogen lines , the silicon triplet would present a 25% variability of equivalent widths much larger than the 7% observed ( fig.[var_ew ] ) . \n we conclude that the microturbulence variability determined from nitrogen lines is a local minimum of the previous @xmath9 function and we assume a constant value for this velocity equal to the one we obtained from the average spectrum : @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 . \n we find that the effective temperature and gravity of @xmath0cep are variable with the pulsation period ( tab . \n fig.[teff_var ] shows that t@xmath1 changes , almost sinusoidally from @xmath723700  k to 24400  k , in phase with the @xmath3 variability from 3.76 to 3.93 .    for a constant @xmath4 , \n the variability of equivalent widths with the pulsation period is also indicative of the temperature behaviour along a cycle . \n fig.[var_ew ] shows that n ii and si iii lines are in phase and that they change out of phase compared to o ii and si iv . \n we have computed the expected equivalent widths of the representative lines of fig.[var_ew ] for atmosphere models with 20000  @xmath10  30000 k , @xmath3 = 3.91 , @xmath4 = 8.1 km s@xmath5 and abundance listed in table 2 . \n it appears ( fig.[teff_var ] ) that the observed behaviour of these lines is due to a variation of the effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k. that is a result in agreement with @xcite who derived an effective temperature of 26000 k from the ratio of si iv and si iii line strength . \n the top panel of fig . \n [ teff_var ] shows the n ii abundance computed along the pulsational phase , considering the corresponding values of t@xmath1 and @xmath3 and keeping constant the value of @xmath4 ( 8.1 km s@xmath5 ) . \n this reflects the variations of the ionisation state of nitrogen . \n with the aim of determining the variations of the effective temperature , surface gravity and microturbulence velocity that occur in hot pulsating stars during the pulsational cycle , we performed time resolved r=20000 spectroscopic observations of the prototype @xmath0  cep along a complete period coverage . \n as a first step , we confirm the t@xmath1 and @xmath3 found in a previous paper by @xcite and we measure @xmath4=8.1@xmath20.9  km  s@xmath5 , from a sample of single lines of oii . with these values , the abundances resulted to be solar for nitrogen , oxygen , neon , aluminium , silicon and sulfur , while slight under - abundances have been inferred for carbon , magnesium and iron . \n we find that along a pulsation cycle , after a correction for the pulsational doppler shift , the h@xmath0 line profile changes are matched assuming a variability of the effective temperature in the range of 23700 to 24400 k and a variability of gravity in the range of 3.76 to 3.93 . \n the amplitude of @xmath11  0.08  dex measured in the gravity variation could lead the reader to the erroneous belief that it corresponds to a radius variation larger than the one computed by @xcite , via cinematic considerations . \n however , the variability of @xmath3 here determined for @xmath0  cep is not a consequence of changes in the surface gravity because of expansions and compressions of the star as a whole . \n we ascribed the @xmath3 variability to a change of the electron pressure @xcite induced by temperature , that modulates the ionisation state of metals . \n thus , it should not be linked directly to the radius of the star . \n metal lines are characterised by equivalent widths variable with the pulsation cycle . \n these are explained by a variable effective temperature between 25000 and 26000 k as a consequence of the changed ionisation state . \n it could be that the most extended formation region of the h@xmath0 line is at the origin of the lower temperature , in agreement with the 15% larger amplitude presented by the radial velocity measured through the h@xmath0 core .        as to the possibility that the microturbulence depends on the compression and expansion of the atmospheric layers \n , we find that it is constant within a 1.0 km  s@xmath5 . \n we conclude that pulsations modify the dependence of the temperature and pressure on the optical depth in the atmosphere of @xmath0  cep . \n this mimics a variability of the effective temperature and gravity when a small range of wavelengths is selected . \n we hope that this information can help in modeling the variability of spectral lines that is not only due to the pulsation velocity field @xcite .    along the expansion phase \n , the negative radial velocity is expected to increase up to a null value just in coincidence with the maximum of the stellar radius . at this phase of minimum compression \n , the photosphere is expected at the temperature minimum . \n differently , we observe a delay in the temperature minimum about one tenth of the pulsation period . according to @xcite , \n this extra -

see also luck et al 2003 ) . \n the former find a spread in [ fe / h ] of 0.4 dex , which they argue is real , the latter focus on investigating galactic abundance gradients ( @xmath10  dex / kpc ) . \n luck et al ( 1998 ) have measured the iron abundance of 16 cepheids in the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc and smc , respectively ) with the echelle spectrograph at the ctio 4 meter telescope . \n the relatively small size of the telescope forced them to choose only stars at the bright end of the period - luminosity relation , _ \n i.e. _ long periods , whereas the entire range needs to be sample in order to reach meaningful conclusions on the @xmath0 relation ( e.g. kennicut et al 1998 , caputo et al 2000 ) . \n as for the _ indirect measurements _ in external galaxies ( e.g. kochanek et al 1997 , kennicutt et al 1998 ) , which probe a broader range in metallicity than the one available in the galaxy , they find that metal - rich cepheids are _ \n brighter _ in @xmath5 and @xmath6 than metal - poor ones by @xmath11 to @xmath12 magnitudes per dex in metallicity . \n these results have been widely used in the literature , including in the final paper of the hst key project on @xmath1 ( freedman et al 2001 ) . \n with the scenario described above in mind , we have collected high quality spectra of an unprecedented dataset of 40 galactic , 22 lmc and 14 smc cepheids with the aim of measuring metallicity directly on a statistically significant sample of stars covering about one order of magnitude in chemical composition . \n the galactic stars were observed with feros at the eso 1.5 m telescope on la silla at a spectral resolution of 48,000 with a signal - to - noise ratio of about 70 to 150 . as for the spectra of the magellanic cloud objects \n , we used the uves spectrograph on the kueyen telescope on cerro paranal , yielding a resolution of 40,000 and signal - to - noise ratio of about 50 to 70 . \n deriving metallicities for cepheids is by no means a trivial task , but we have now carefully analyzed and derived [ fe / h ] for an initial subsample of 14 cepheids in the lmc , 12 in the smc and 6 in the galaxy . \n the data reduction procedures and analysis are described in detail in mottini et al ( 2003 ) . \n the main result from the subset analyzed so far is summarized in figure  1 . there , we plot the v - band residuals from the standard madore & freedman ( 1991 ) @xmath0 relation as a function of the iron abundance derived from feros and uves spectra . \n a positive magnitude difference here means that the star is fainter than the mean @xmath0 relation . for consistency with the adopted @xmath0 relation , \n the lmc is assumed to have a distance modulus of 18.50 . \n the smc is considered 0.44  mag more distant ( e.g. cioni et al 2000 ) and the distances to galactic stars were taken from fouqu et al ( 2003 ) , barnes et al ( 2003 ) and tammann et al ( 2003 ) . \n photometry and reddening are taken from laney & stobie ( 1994 ) . \n the data are binned in metallicity to reflect the typical observational error on our determination ( @xmath13  dex ) . \n the magellanic cloud cepheids populate the bins at lower metallicity , the higher [ fe / h ] one containing only galactic stars . \n the median magnitude residual in each bin is plotted as a square and the rms and error on the median are shown as boxes and errorbars , respectively . \n the magnitude difference plotted on the ordinates can be directly compared to the _ `` c '' _ quantity computed by fiorentino et al ( 2002 ) . \n this is the correction to be applied to the distance modulus derived using a universal , metallicity independent @xmath0 relation to take into account the influence of metallicity as derived from their non - linear pulsation models . \n the agreement between our data and the predictions by fiorentino et al ( 2002 ) , indicating a strong dependence of the @xmath0 relation on metallicity , is tantalizing , even though the errorbars are still somewhat large . as it can be seen , the error on the inferred distance can be as large as 10% if the effect of metallicity is neglected .", "StartTimeOffset": 1525303870426, "RequestID": "0940a0b6e64948c39ea88add32ab689a", "TotalTokens": 2121}
{"ContextTokens": 2324, "GeneratedTokens": 350, "SynthesizedBody": "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , in which a `` pump '' field of laser light can allow a weaker `` signal '' field to propagate through an otherwise opaque atomic gas , has been inspiring a number of applications based on the underlying coherent interaction of laser light with atomic media . \n these include nonlinear optics at low light levels @xcite and ultra - sensitive magnetic field measurements @xcite .    of particular interest \n has been the recent observation of ultra - slow light ( usl ) @xcite in atomic gases , at group velocities on the order of 10  m / s , due to a steep linear dispersion in the index of refraction associated with the narrow eit feature . \n this could allow for controllable true - time delay devices for classical light pulses , with applications in fiber - optic telecommunications @xcite and radar signal processing @xcite . \n later extensions of the technique to stored light @xcite ( for several milliseconds ) has also raised the possibility of quantum memory devices @xcite . \n while the narrow frequency feature ( below the natural linewidth and doppler width ) of eit is one of its attractive features for precision applications @xcite , this has drawbacks in regards to delay and storage applications . \n optical communications and radar processing typically desire @xmath4  ghz bandwidth . \n similarly , single photon sources and other tools of potential quantum information technologies may emit photons over a broad band . in usl experiments to date \n , the width of eit transparency window is much narrower . \n eit and usl work best when the atom can be well described with a @xmath5 energy level structure . \n the signal field is near - resonant with a stable state ( which we label @xmath6 ) and a radiatively decaying excited state ( @xmath7 ) . \n the pump field is resonant with another stable state @xmath8 and the common excited level @xmath7 . \n we consider two energy level schemes in @xmath0rb , shown in fig.[fig : diagram](a ) . \n the schemes are labeled `` a '' ( dashed , blue arrows ) and `` b '' ( solid , red arrows ) . \n the transparency and slow , distortion - free propagation of the signal pulse that we desire occur only when the frequency difference of the two lasers @xmath9 matches the energy level difference between levels @xmath6 and @xmath8 to within the narrow eit width . \n frequency components of the signal outside this width are strongly absorbed and distorted . \n this width is directly proportional to the pump power and practical limits on the pump power ( @xmath10  mw/@xmath11 ) limit it to @xmath1  mhz . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     because of the extremely strong dependence of @xmath12 with power we found numerically that one always benefits from using smaller @xmath13 , so this parameter should be chosen to be the smallest reasonable value over which the beam can be easily focused . \n though too small a value @xmath13 would lead to a higher loss from @xmath14 this problem is almost always dominated by the diffusion in the magnetic field gradient and so is not a big consideration . \n similarly , in choosing @xmath15 we found that the gain in transparency from higher intensities tended to outweigh the gain one got from lower slopes . \n figure  [ fig : parameterdrift](b ) shows the maximum delay - bandwidth product versus @xmath16 , but keeping the pump power constant and adjusting the interaction with @xmath15 such that the bandwidth @xmath17  mhz was also kept constant . indeed one sees that one gains by using steeper gradients over smaller areas . \n ultimately , the slope @xmath16 that can be used in practice will be determined by the manner in which the magnetic field gradient and signal dispersion can be generated .    in the calculations in figs . \n [ fig : wideband ] and [ fig : parameterdrift](a - b ) we chose pressures @xmath18  torr and 25  torr for schemes a and b , respectively . numerically these were found to be about optimal . in fig . \n [ fig : parameterdrift ] we plot the dependence of the of the maximum delay - bandwidth on the pressure for several cases . in scheme \n a , the optimal pressures are larger than in the homogenous case due to increased importance of reducing diffusion in the magnetic field gradient . interestingly , even in scheme b , higher pressures eventually reduce the performance . \n this can be understood from the factor @xmath19 in the analytic estimate for @xmath12 above . \n the physical origin of this factor is the fact that the eit width @xmath20 decreases with @xmath21 and therefore makes the resonance more sensitive to the averaging over nearby magnetic fields eq . \n ( [ eq : rhodiffint ] ) . \n we plot the dependence on pressure for two different gradients in each scheme . while the optimal pressures are slightly different , the dependence on pressure is rather weak and so a sensitive parameter search versus @xmath22 should not be required . \n we have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis of eit resonances , and the resulting pulse propagation characteristics , in @xmath0rb vapors , including effects of couplings to additional levels in the hyperfine structure and a buffer gas . \n we then calculated the delays , transmissions , and bandwidths for propagation of light tuned to these resonances . \n we analyzed two particular @xmath5 level schemes ( diagrammed in fig . \n [ fig : diagram ] ) and found that scheme b was far superior , in terms of achievable delays and delay - bandwidth products , due to the lack of coupling to additional levels . despite its poorer performance , scheme a still provides reasonable performance and may be desirable since it is much easier to initialize , simply with optical pumping . \n importantly , we found the eit resonance could be shifted over a wide range of frequencies by applying a homogeneous magnetic field , and that the resonance characteristics were quite insensitive to this field over range of about 500  mhz . \n this analysis serves as a useful model to study eit in conventional slow light , and also as a basis for study of our channelization architecture . \n we then presented a model to analyze the effect of an inhomogenous magnetic field , which causes a strong variation of the eit resonance frequency in the transverse direction . \n this was then applied to analyze the performance of our proposed channelization architecture for wide - band slow light , where a signal pulse is spatially dispersed according to frequency and an inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied in a such a way that the eit resonance frequency matches this dispersion . \n we found that by choosing the magnetic field gradient so the change in the two - photon resonance is slightly mismatched from the transverse dispersion of the signal , one could achieve eit and slow light conditions over a much larger bandwidth than with conventional slow light . \n this is essential for applications in many signal processing applications . \n we found that the diffusion of atoms in the field tended to reduce the delay - bandwidth products with bandwidth . in scheme b , \n this architecture should allow a delay - bandwidth greater than unity up to bandwidths of about @xmath2  mhz , where delays are @xmath3  ns ( see fig .  [ \n fig : pulsedrift ] ) . \n furthermore , we note either the pump field power or the magnetic field gradient can be used to control @xmath23 and thus the delay , making it a controllable time delay system . \n the buffer gas is important in reducing the diffusion of atoms from into regions of widely varying magnetic field and so higher buffer gas pressures are generally desirable for higher magnetic field gradients . \n however , we also found that higher pressures narrow the eit feature and can therefore increase the sensitivity of the dispersive slope and absorption profile to magnetic field gradients . \n balancing these two considerations leads to an optimal pressure , which we found this optimum to be near @xmath2410  torr for scheme a and @xmath25  torr for scheme b , for reasonable parameters . \n this optimal pressure was not very sensitive to the exact value of the gradient and other parameters . \n we also found that one generally benefited from tight focusing and high magnetic gradients .    in future work , it will be useful to consider the effects of atomic diffusion at a more microscopic level . \n in particular , it has been found that the model used here for diffusion out of the interaction region may overestimate the loss in real systems due to the fact that atoms can diffuse back into the interaction region @xcite . additionally , \n dynamical jumps of velocity of individual rubidium atoms upon collisions with the buffer gas has also been found to be an important consideration @xcite . \n finally , for implementation of this system , work is also needed to develop optimal methods for transversely dispersing the signal field and producing large linear magnetic field gradients . \n the role played by the differential phase shift in this system is interesting in its own right and merits further investigation . \n it is not entirely clear that the pulse will not be significantly more slowed than our analysis here shows , due to subtleties with the transverse dispersion of the signal . \n perhaps the signal dispersion or magnetic field could be engineered in such a way that the group velocity is governed by the _ local _ ( and much larger ) @xmath26 , rather than @xmath23 , allowing much larger delays . \n furthermore , it may be possible to combine this method with aspects of previous light storage experiments @xcite to significantly increase the delay times . \n the authors wish to thank irina novikova , mikhail lukin , and fredrik fatemi for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported by the office of naval research and the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) slow light program . \n rotondaro and g. p. perram , `` collisional broadening and shift of the rubidium @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines ( @xmath30 ) by rare gases , @xmath31 , '' \n _ j. quant . \n radiat . transfer _ * 57 * pp . \n 497507 , 1997 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1547995262423, "RequestID": "70b7112c48c7486d879c694ae449344b", "TotalTokens": 2674}
{"ContextTokens": 3895, "GeneratedTokens": 211, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation and evolution of a very low  mass binary system consisting of a neutron star ( millisecond pulsar ) and a 0.1 @xmath2 companion is not yet well understood . \n one of the main observational features of these systems is that they are eclipsing . \n one interesting eclipsing binary system , psr b174424a , is in the globular cluster terzan 5 . \n the neutron star is an 11.56 ms pulsar in a 1.8 h orbit with a low  mass companion ( lyne et al . \n the duration of the eclipse in this system is very variable and is never less than one  third of the orbital period . \n lyne et al.(1990 ) estimated that the energy flux from the pulsar at the companion surface ( isotropic radiation is assumed ) is @xmath3 2@xmath4 erg s@xmath5@xmath6 which is near the critical value when the irradiation may influence the structure of a low  mass star ( podsiadlowski 1991 ) . however , this value is at least a factor of 15 less than for another eclipsing millisecond binary pulsar system psr b1957 + 20 ( fruchter et al . \n this small irradiative flux value and great variations in duration of the eclipse lead lyne et al . \n ( 1990 ) to the conclusion that in this system roche lobe overflow may occur . \n recent long  term timing observations of the eclipsing binary pulsar psr b174424a at the vla and green bank , show that the orbital period of psr b174424a has decreased , with a time \n scale of only @xmath7@xmath0200 myr . \n this is five times faster than if the orbital period decay is driven only by the gravitational wave radiation ( nice et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the key question of interest is : how did this system evolve ?    in this short note we show that the new observational data for the orbital period decay of psr b174424a may give us a unique opportunity to test the magnetic braking mechanism if the observed orbital period decay is secular . \n more than twenty years ago it was realized that to produce short orbital period low \n mass binary systems ( cataclysmic variables and low  mass x  ray binaries  lmxb ) it is necessary to include two mechanisms for orbital angular momentum losses : gravitational wave radiation and/or magnetic braking . low \n mass unevolved stars ( main  sequence stars ) will fill their roche  lobe only for orbital periods less than 12 hours and the mass transfer due to gravitational wave radiation mechanism never exceeds @xmath8/yr . \n this produces an x  ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg / s . \n observations , however , show that many lmxbs in this orbital period range have x  ray luminosities that are one or two orders of magnitude higher .    to explain this discrepancy verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) introduced additional orbital angular momentum loss by magnetic braking which was able to drive a much higher mass  transfer rate . in view of these much higher mass transfer rates \n the companion will be driven out of thermal equilibrium . \n however magnetic braking will not work forever . \n as soon as the companion mass has decreased to m @xmath10 0.3 @xmath2 ( fully convective star ) an orbital period near the 3 hours , the rate of angular momentum loss by magnetic braking is expected to either vanish or to drop considerably ( spruit & ritter 1983 ) , causing the mass  loss rate to drop , and the secondary star subsequently relaxes to its thermal equlibrium state . \n the stellar radius decreases and the star detaches from its roche lobe . during the detached phase , orbital angular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation will continue , and when the orbital period has been reduced to 2 hours , the companion ( of mass @xmath00.3 @xmath2 ) again fills its roche lobe . \n this is the so \n called standard cataclysmic variable ( cv ) evolutionary scenario .    in 1985 \n tutukov et al . discussed what will happen with a low  mass binary if the star filling its roche lobe is a slightly evolved star ( so  called `` turn  off main  sequence star '' ) . in this scenario \n the binary evolves towards very short orbital periods . due to the chemical composition gradient , \n the secondary star does not become fully convective when its mass has reduced to 0.3@xmath11 and magnetic braking does not vanish . between orbital periods of two to three hours , the mass transfer rate is very low , and apparently during this time the system may be in the `` propeller '' stage ( ergma & sarna 1996 ) . according to the standard cv evolutionary picture , \n the magnetic braking mechanism vanishes near an orbital period of 3 hours . \n however in the latter scenario , it will also work for smaller values of the orbital periods . \n the evolutionary sequences for the secondary star in a low  mass binary were computed using a standard one  dimensional stellar evolution code based on a henyey  type code developed by paczyski ( 1970 ) and adapted to low \n mass main  sequence stars . for more detail about the computer program see muslimov & sarna ( 1993 ) and sarna & de greve ( 1994 , 1996 ) . \n we compute the loss of orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation using the formula presented by landau & lifshitz ( 1971 ) . \n @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the primary mass , secondary mass , total mass and orbital period of the system . \n we assume that the companion is being spun down by the magnetic braking and its spin and orbital rotation are synchronized at the cost of orbital angular momentum loss . \n we adopt the standard formula ( see mestel 1968 , mestel & spruit 1987 ) for the rate of orbital angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking of the companion .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the radius of gyration of the secondary star , @xmath18 = 0.1 . \n this formula contains a poorly known parameter @xmath1 ( @xmath0 0.71.8 ) characterizing the effectiveness of the dynamo action in the stellar convection zone ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) . to take account of the angular momentum loss that accompanies mass loss during the `` propeller phase '' \n , we use a formula based on that used to calculate angular momentum loss via a stellar wind ( paczyski , 1967 , sarna & de greve , 1994 )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21(@xmath220 ) is the mass  loss rate from the secondary star ; @xmath23(@xmath240 ) is the accretion rate on to the neutron star , @xmath25(@xmath220 ) is the rate of the total mass loss from the system ; @xmath26 is the ratio of the mass ejected by the neutron star to that accreted by the neutron star and @xmath27 is defined as the effectiveness of angular momentum loss during mass transfer ( sarna & de greve , 1994,1996 ) . \n we consider the following model ( similar scenarios have been discussed by shaham & tavani 1991 , kluniak et al . 1992 and ergma & sarna 1996 ) for the psr b174424a system . the progenitor of this system is a low  mass ( @xmath311.5@xmath2 ) star + old neutron star . \n the secondary star fills its roche lobe , as a `` turn  off main  sequence star '' . at the beginning , \n the mass transfer rate proceeds on a thermal time  scale and the neutron star will spin up to a millisecond period . after that , the mass transfer rate drops and the system enters the `` propeller stage '' and the pulsar spins down . \n

fig . \n 1 ( a , b , c ) the mass  loss rate versus orbital period is presented for the following cases : ( a ) sequence ( i ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 , ( b ) sequence ( i ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=1 , ( c ) sequence ( ii ) , @xmath26=@xmath27=1 . at first , the mass exchange rate is rather high ( proceeds on the thermal time  scale of the secondary star ) and during this phase , the old neutron star will spin  up . \n latter @xmath25 decreases and near an orbital period of @xmath0 24 hours , the mass accretion rate has its minimum value . depending on the value of the surface magnetic field strength , the system may or may not be in the `` propeller phase '' . \n how does the value of @xmath1 influence the orbital evolution of the binary system ? \n for example for sequence ( a ) and for @xmath1= 1.8 , the final orbital period is larger than the initial and for @xmath1 = 1.0 a short period binary system with low \n mass helium white dwarf and millisecond pulsar is formed ( @xmath33 13 hours ) . only for @xmath1 @xmath3 1 \n does the system evolve towards very short orbital periods ( fig.1 ) .    in fig . \n 2 , a , b , c the variation of @xmath34 versus orbital period is shown for the same cases as presented in fig . \n 1 a , b , c. as is clearly seen in this figure , orbital period changes depend on the value of @xmath1 . in table 1 we present @xmath35 and orbital period decay time \n scale @xmath36=@xmath37 values for various @xmath1 when the orbital period is equal to 1.8 hours . the evolutionary time \n scale obtained by nice at al . \n ( 2000 ) is 200 myr . from table 1 \n we can see that a @xmath1 close to 1 agrees well with the observed value for psr 174424a.the calculated mass of the secondary @xmath0 0.15 @xmath2 near a period 1.8 h also agrees well with the observed value ( lyne et al . \n if the observed orbital period decay is secular and our suggestion is correct that the orbital evolution of psr 174424a is driven by magnetic braking then this may be the first case when the orbital period decay by a magnetic braking mechanism has been measured . according to our model calculations the best fit to the observed orbital period decay \n is obtained when @xmath1 is near to one . which means that the value proposed by smith ( 1979 ) @xmath1=1.78 underestimates , that and proposed by skumanich ( 1972 ) @xmath1=0.73 sligtly , overestimates the magnetic braking efficiency . \n ee thanks dr.b . stappers for useful comments and in improving the text of the paper . \n also we thank dr.d.nice for providing us results of observations before

{"ContextTokens": 3430, "GeneratedTokens": 147, "SynthesizedBody": "during the last years , many systems have been analyzed from the perspective of graph theory @xcite . \n it turns out that seemingly diverse systems such as the internet , the world wide web ( www ) , metabolic and protein interaction networks and food webs , to mention a few examples , share many topological properties @xcite . among these properties , \n the fact that one can go from one node ( or element ) of the network to another node passing by just a few others is perhaps the most popular property , known as `` six degrees of separation '' or small - world ( sw ) property @xcite . \n the sw feature has been shown to improve the performance of many dynamical processes as compared to regular lattices ; a direct consequence of the existence of key shortcuts that speed up the communication between otherwise distant nodes and of the shorter path length among any two nodes on the net @xcite . \n however , it has also been recognized that there are at least two types of networks fulfilling the sw property but radically different as soon as dynamical processes are ran on top of them . \n the first type can be called `` exponential networks '' since the probability of finding a node with connectivity ( or degree ) @xmath0 different from the average connectivity @xmath1 decays exponentially fast for large @xmath0 @xcite . \n the second kind of networks comprises those referred to as `` scale - free '' ( sf ) networks @xcite . \n for these networks , the probability that a given node is connected to @xmath0 other nodes follows a power - law of the form @xmath2 , with the remarkable feature that @xmath3 for most real - world networks @xcite . \n the heterogeneity of the connectivity distribution in scale - free networks greatly impacts the dynamics of processes that they support . \n one of the most remarkable examples is that an epidemic disease will pervade in an infinite - size sf network regardless of its spreading rate @xcite . \n the change in the behavior of the processes is so radical in this case that it has been claimed that the standard epidemiological framework should be carefully revisited . \n this might be bad news for epidemiologists , and those fighting natural and computer viruses . \n on the other hand , in a number of important technological and commercial applications , it is desirable to spread the `` epidemic '' as fast and as efficient as possible , not to prevent it from spreading . \n important examples of such applications are epidemic ( or rumor - based ) protocols for data dissemination and resource discovery on the internet @xcite , and marketing campaigns using rumor - like strategies ( viral marketing ) . \n the above applications , and their dynamics , have passed almost unnoticed @xcite to the physics community working on complex networks despite the fact that they have been extensively studied by computer scientists and sociologists @xcite . \n the problem here consists of designing an epidemic ( or rumor - mongering ) algorithm in such a way that the dissemination of data or information from any node of a network reaches the largest possible number of remaining nodes . \n note that in this case , in contrast to epidemic modeling , one is free to design the rules of epidemic infection in order to reach the desired result , instead of having to model an existing process . \n furthermore , in a number of applications , such as peer - to - peer file sharing systems @xcite built on top of the internet and grid computing @xcite , the connectivity distribution of the nodes can also be changed in order to maximize the performance of such protocols .    in this paper \n we study in detail the dynamics of a generic rumor model @xcite on complex scale - free topologies through analytic and numerical studies , and investigate the impact of the interaction rules on the efficiency and reliability of the rumor process . \n we first solve the model analytically for the case of exponential networks in the infinite time limit and then introduce a stochastic approach to deal with the numerical solution of the mean - field rate equations characterizing the system s dynamics . \n the method @xcite is used to obtain accurate results for several quantities when the topology of random sf networks is taken into account , without using large and expensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . \n section ii is devoted to introducing the rumor model and to derive the mean - field rate equations used throughout the paper . in section \n iii we deal with the stochastic approach , and compare its performance with analytical and mc calculations in homogeneous systems . we extend the method to the case of power - law distributed networks and present the results obtained for this kind of networks in section iv and v. finally , the paper is rounded off in the last section , where conclusions are given . \n the rumor model is defined as follows . \n each of the @xmath4 elements of the network can be in three different states . \n following the original terminology and the epidemiological literature @xcite , these three classes correspond to ignorant , spreader and stifler nodes . \n ignorants are those individuals who have not heard the rumor and hence they are susceptible to be informed . \n the second class comprises active individuals that are spreading the rumor . \n finally , stiflers are those who know the rumor but that are no longer spreading it . \n the spreading process evolves by directed contacts of the spreaders with others in the population . \n when a spreader meets an ignorant the last one turns into a new spreader with probability @xmath5 . \n the decay of the spreading process may be due to a mechanism of `` forgetting '' or because spreaders learn that the rumor has lost its `` news value '' . \n we assume this latter hypothesis as the most plausible so that the contacting spreaders become stiflers with probability @xmath6 if they encounter another spreader or a stifler . \n note that as we are designing our rumor strategy in such a way that the fraction of the population which ultimately learns the rumor be the maximum possible , we have assumed that contacts of the type spreader - spreader are directed , that is , only the contacting individual loses the interest in propagating the rumor further . \n therefore , there is no double transition to the stifler class .    in a homogeneous system , \n the original rumor model due to daley and kendall @xcite can be described in terms of the densities of ignorants , spreaders , and stiflers , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , as a function of time . besides , we have the normalization condition , @xmath10 in order to obtain an analytical insight and a way to later test our numerical approach , we first study the rumor model on top of exponentially distributed networks . \n these include models of random graphs as well as the watts and strogatz ( ws ) small - world model @xcite . \n this model produces a network made up of @xmath4 nodes with at least @xmath11 links to other nodes . \n the resulting connectivity distribution in the random graph limit of the model @xcite takes the form @xmath12 which gives an average connectivity @xmath13 . \n hence , the probability that a node has a degree @xmath14 decays exponentially fast and the network can be regarded as homogeneous . \n the mean - field rate equations for the evolution of the three densities satisfy the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath15 , \\label{eq3}\\\\   \\frac{d r(t)}{d t } & = & \\alpha { \\langle k \\rangle}s(t ) [ s(t)+r(t ) ] , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial conditions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the above equations state that the density of spreaders increases at a rate proportional to the spreading rate @xmath5 , the average number of contacts of each individual @xmath1 and to the densities of ignorant and spreader individuals , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively \n . on the other hand , the annihilation mechanism considers that spreaders decay into the stifler class at a rate @xmath19 times the density of spreaders and of non - ignorant individuals @xmath20 . \n the system of differential equations  ( [ eq2]-[eq4 ] ) can be analytically solved in the infinite time limit when @xmath21 . using equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) , we have that @xmath22 . introducing the new variable @xmath23 we obtain the transcendental equation \n , @xmath24    equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) always admits the trivial solution @xmath25 , but at the same time it also has another physically relevant solution _ for all _ values of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n this can be easily appreciated since the condition , @xmath26 reduces to @xmath27 . \n that is , there is no `` rumor threshold '' contrary to the case of epidemic spreading @xcite . \n this strikingly different behavior does not come from any difference in the growth mechanism of @xmath8 @xmath28the two are actually the same@xmath28 , but from the disparate rules for the decay of the spreading process . \n on the other hand , this result also points out that a mathematical model for the spreading of rumors can be constructed in many different ways . \n the results of this paper , however , indicate that the presence of spreader annihilation terms due to spreader - spreader and spreader - stifler interactions is very relevant for practical implementations @xcite . \n we shall come back to this point later on . \n recently @xcite , we have introduced a numerical technique @xcite to deal with the mean - field rate equations appearing in epidemic - like models . \n it solves the differential equations by calculating the passage probabilities for the different transitions . \n the main advantage of this method , as compared to mc simulations , is its modest memory and cpu time requirements for large system sizes . besides \n , we do not have to generate any network . \n instead , we produce a sequence of integers distributed according to the desired connectivity distribution @xmath29 . \n the numerical procedure here proceeds as follows . at each time step until the end of the rumor spreading process , the following steps are performed :    .density of stiflers at the end of the rumor spreading process . \n results are shown for 5 different values of @xmath6 for each method considered . \n monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were performed in a ws network with @xmath30 and @xmath31 nodes . \n the same system size was used in the stochastic numerical approach ( sna ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figs . \n [ figure4 ] and  [ figure5 ] we have represented the time ( in units of @xmath32 ) profiles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for each decay term and several values of @xmath6 . from the figures , \n it is clear that while the final density of stiflers increases when modifying the original decay rules , the time needed to reach such high levels of reliability also increases . \n this is due to the fact that the tails of the densities of spreaders decay more slowly than before . in particular , it is noticeable that when only spreader - spreader interactions are taken into account in the decay mechanism , the lifetime of the propagation process is more than two times longer than for the other two settings . \n this means that this implementation is not very suitable for practical applications as the costs associated to the process rise as well . on the other hand \n , the performance of the spreader - stifler setting seems to depend on the value of @xmath6 in such a way that it is more efficient at both the reliability level and time consumption for a large @xmath6 , but not in the middle region of the parameter space . in summary \n , the present results support that the original model works quite well under any condition , while other variants can be considered depending on the value of @xmath6 used and the type of applications they are designed for . \n in this paper , we have analyzed the spreading dynamics of rumor models in complex heterogeneous networks . \n we have first introduced a useful stochastic method that allows us to obtain meaningful time profiles for the quantities characterizing the propagation process . \n the method is based on the numerical solution of the mean - field rate equations describing the model , and contrary to monte carlo simulations , there is no need of generating explicitly the network . \n this allows to save memory and a fast exploration of the whole evolution diagram of the process . \n the kind of processes studied here are of great practical importance since epidemic data dissemination might become the standard practice in multiple technological applications . \n the results show that there is a fragile balance between different levels of reliability and the costs ( in terms of time ) associated to them . in this sense , \n our study may open new paths in the use of rumor - mongering process for replicated database maintenance , reliable group communication and peer to peer networks @xcite . \n besides , as shown here , the behavior and features of the different algorithms one may implement are not trivial and depend on the type of mechanisms used for both the creation and the annihilation terms . \n it is worth noting here that we have studied the simplest possible set of rumor algorithms , but other ingredients such as memory must be incorporated in more elaborated models @xcite .    of further interest \n would be a more careful exploration of the possibility of using dynamical shortcuts for a more efficient spreading of the updates . \n our results suggest that it would be more economic to start from hubs and then kill off the updating process when a given level of reliability is reached than starting at random and letting the process dies out by itself . \n preliminary studies of more elaborated models aimed at implementing a practical protocol confirm our results @xcite . \n this feature is specially relevant for the understanding and modeling of social phenomena such as the spreading of new ideas or the design of efficient marketing campaigns . \n we would like to thank a.  vespignani for many useful discussions and comments . \n y.  m.  thanks m.  vzquez - prada for helpful comments and the hospitality of bt exact , u.k . where parts of this work were carried out . \n y.  m.  acknowledges financial support from the secretara de estado de educacin y universidades ( spain , sb2000 - 0357 ) . this work has been partially supported by the spanish dgicyt project bfm2002 - 01798 . \n a. j. demers , d. h. greene , c. hauser , w. irish , and j. larson , _ epidemic algorithms for replicated database maintenance_. in proc . of the sixth annual acm symposium on principles of distributed computing , vancouver , canada , 1987 \n .                            note that for the @xmath35 variant , the initial conditions should include the existence of at least one stifler . \n this has been taken into account by randomly selecting a node among all the remaining ignorants . \n hence the initial conditions are now @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1579498480946, "RequestID": "01afb236ab5f49539066f8f9232bfed6", "TotalTokens": 3577}
{"ContextTokens": 1507, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "in a neutrino point source analysis one focuses on obtaining the best angular resolution by observing muon tracks inside the detector volume . \n the expected signal stems from charged - current interactions of muon neutrinos and a small fraction of tau neutrinos . \n the background consists primarily of high energy muons , produced in the atmosphere in extended air showers , with a much lower but irreducible contribution of atmospheric neutrinos from the same interactions . in icecube \n [ ] , cherenkov light from these events is detected in digital optical modules , with 60 of these arranged vertically on a string . \n a total of 80 strings will be installed until 2011 , situated at a depth of 1.45 to 2.45  km inside the glacial ice at the geographic south pole . a standard method to suppress atmospheric muons , reaching the detector from above , \n is a cut on the reconstructed track direction at the horizon , which allows icecube to cover only the northern hemisphere , as presented in [ ] . inside the earth , \n the neutrino -

line filter stream provided an all - sky muon track sample with a rate of @xmath0 hz , and elaborate direction reconstructions were performed off - line . \n down - going events with declinations smaller than @xmath1 were rejected due the small interaction volume above the detector leading to very low signal expectations . \n the steeply rising muon background above the horizon is dominated by multiple muons forming so - called bundles . to separate them from neutrino - induced single muon tracks , \n a selection cut based on the resolution of individual photon pulses in an optical module was applied . \n the threshold values were a function of the reconstructed zenith angle and energy for each event . \n employing parameters depending on the quality of the fitted track , similar to those in [ ] , the background was reduced further . by systematically testing combinations of threshold values in dependence of zenith angle \n , these cuts were optimized for the best sensitivity considering two template spectra , a standard @xmath2 and a harder @xmath3 power law of the neutrino energy @xmath4 . \n + the resulting sample is composed of 1877 events between @xmath1 and @xmath5 . \n simulations show that the down - going events from the southern hemisphere are dominated by atmospheric muons , while the up - going tracks are mainly induced by atmospheric neutrinos . \n related to zenith dependent signal and background expectations , the cuts allow for an excess of events in the region just above the horizon . the neutrino signal efficiency , as estimated from simulations , improves with energy and effectively defines a threshold rising from the tev regime in the northern hemisphere to pev energies in the south . compared to previous point source analyses in icecube  [ ] , \n an improved direction reconstruction was used . \n it is a likelihood algorithm that uses not only the timing information of the first pulse in each optical module , but also the total charge to account for the probability of multiple photoelectrons from individually scattered photons . \n this is particularly important for neutrino energies above 100 tev , where photons from secondaries produced along the muon track are an important addition to the light yield . \n the median angular resolution for the final event selection is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) under the assumption of an @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) spectrum . \n we performed a binned scan of the entire sky map and also tested a list of pre -

by agn , m87 and centaurus a , and the center of our galaxy , sgr a*. no significant excess above background was found for any of these candidates . \n the upward fluctuation with the highest significance occurs for pks 1622 -

@xcite ) with the phot task of apphot were chosen to emulate @xcite , including the criterion @xmath3 @xmath4 2.0 . \n this allows populations of old , metal poor globular clusters ( @xmath3 @xmath5 1 ) akin to those observed in the galaxy @xcite , as well as metal - rich clusters with @xmath3 @xmath4 1.5 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n this also allows solar metallicity globular clusters with @xmath3 @xmath5 1.21.3 ( lee , lee , & gibson 2002 ) . \n the tail regions were defined in @xmath0- band , gaussian - smoothed images as contours set to one count above the average background , corresponding to 24.3  25.7 mag arcsec@xmath6 in @xmath0 . \n central galaxies , where present in the images , were excluded based on where their radial brightness profiles indicated anti - truncated disk debris @xcite . \n our detections are 50% complete to @xmath7 25.7 , and k - s tests indicate that in - tail sources are not likely drawn from the same population as the out - of - tail sources ( p @xmath4 0.1 in most cases ) . \n figure 2 shows an image of a representative system , ngc 2992 , with in - tail cluster candidates indicated with circles and squares for out - of - tail objects meeting the same selection criteria . a color - magnitude diagram for the in - tail objects \n is also presented , with photometric model tracks of 10@xmath8 , 10@xmath9 , and 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 simple stellar populations with instantaneous - burst star formation rates @xcite overlaid . \n although two photometric bands are insufficient to draw robust conclusions on individual masses and mass functions , rough estimates and limits can be made . in all systems , \n v@xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate that the most massive clusters are @xmath5 10@xmath8 m@xmath11 . \n we do not find clusters in our sample with masses @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath11 .    by counting the number of in - tail cluster candidates per unit area of the tail , and subtracting the number of sources found with the same selection criteria outside the tail per unit area of non - tail wfpc2 regions \n , we find a cluster candidate surface density for each system . \n figure 3 compares our results to those of @xcite , given an additional m@xmath2 @xmath4 -8.5 ( johnson - cousins system ) cutoff . \n on the surface , our results are compatible with @xcite who find similar values , though we contend that accounting for rapid cluster fading with age by extending the limit to fainter magnitudes and improving upon background subtraction reveals clusters in every star - forming tail ( mullan et al . , in preparation ) . \n also provided is a typical statistical diagnostic for the cluster populations , a plot of the brightest m@xmath16vs . \n the logarithm of the number of clusters detected for each system . \n the slope of this correlation , -2.50 @xmath17 -0.05 , is similar to the -2.3 @xmath17 0.2 value found for other extragalactic environments @xcite . \n @xcite suggests that this statistical size - of - sample effect can be produced from a schechter cimf with a exponential slope of -2 and cutoff ( m@xmath18 ) mass of @xmath19 2.1 @xmath20 10@xmath9 m@xmath11 , given cluster disruption mechanisms from gas expulsion , relaxation , stellar evolution , and the external environment ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . in many cases such as ngc 6872e and am 1054 - 325w , the profusion of sources between 10@xmath9  10@xmath8 m@xmath11 may indicate higher star formation efficiencies from high gmc compression by a turbulent ism @xcite or through a similar magnetohydrodynamic effect @xcite in these  ideal \" star - forming tails . \n this may also affect the luminosity function , whose luminosity - dependent logarithmic slope of -2.5 as sampled in this v@xmath12 range ( see the contribution by gieles ; @xcite ) may change with the altered cimf . \n but without any clusters of mass 10@xmath15 m@xmath11 , the star formation efficiencies in these tails may not be as high as in the antennae , m82 , ngc 1316 , ngc 7252 , or arp 220 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n preliminary evidence suggests that star cluster populations are governed by similar luminosity and initial mass functions as their cousins in field galaxies . \n our set of 17 tails show a maximum cluster mass of @xmath510@xmath8 m@xmath11 , while the brightest m@xmath21 vs.  log n plot is consistent with both mass - dependent and mass - independent prescriptions of cluster disruption (  infant mortality \" ) , with subsequent dissolution from 2-body relaxation and stellar evolution for clusters drawn from a schechter cimf . \n such a cimf , if it had a higher cutoff mass , would imply higher star formation efficiencies , aided by turbulent pressure in the tidal tails . \n future work will address these areas through further analysis of the color , magnitude , and size distributions of these clusters , as well as the kinematics and ism composition of their surrounding environments .", "StartTimeOffset": 1641194649771, "RequestID": "52e30a0759e345778eb3ef1d45021ea6", "TotalTokens": 2045}

dynamics of electrical potential difference between blobs and current for direct current potential applied in a range of 2  v to 15  v was measured in 6 experiments for each value of potential difference applied . \n resistance of two agar blobs colonised by physarum and connected with each other by a silver wire exhibits quasi - chaotic oscillations ( fig .  [ exampleresistance]a ) with a wide range of dominating frequencies ( fig . \n [ fftsamples]a ) . \n when a physarum propagates from one agar blob to another blob it connects two blobs with a single protoplasmic tube ( fig . \n [ scheme]b ) . \n average resistance of a 10  mm protoplasmic tube is 3  mohm , standard deviation 0.715  mohm . \n resistance of the protoplasmic tube exhibits oscillatory behaviour ( fig . \n [ exampleresistance]bc ) with highly pronounced dominating frequency ( fig . \n [ fftsamples]bc ) . \n average dominating frequency is 0.0137606  hz , median dominating frequency is 0.0126953  hz , standard deviation is 0.0033492429  hz . the resistance oscillations have average amplitude 0.59  mohm , standard deviation 0.256  mohm ;

average 95  sec over four above sets of data  @xcite . \n cytoplasmic flow in tubes reverses with period 54  sec  @xcite . \n further experiments might deal with establishing an exact link between oscillations of a protoplasmic tube s resistance and peristaltic oscillations of the tube  @xcite . \n frequency of electrical potential oscillations of physarum can be modified by tactile  @xcite and chemical  @xcite stimuli , by coloured illumination of a protoplasmic tube  @xcite , and by loading physarum with functional nano - particles  @xcite . \n the correlation between resistance frequency and frequency of electrical potential oscillations allows to speculate that frequency of resistance oscillation can be also tuned by chemical , optical and tactile control inputs . \n thus , we believe the physarum electrical oscillator is _ adjustable_. \n applicability of physarum oscillators in conventional electronic circuits is limited to none . \n physarum oscillators produce a very low frequency waveforms and therefore can only be used in computing devices where speed of information processing is not critical . \n thus a potential application domain of physarum oscillators is in self - growing biological computing devices and hybrid bio - silicon devices , and amorphous bio - inspired robots  @xcite . \n another promising application would be in disposable bio - sensors and bio - circuits : living physarum oscillator can produce stable waveforms for up to 5 - 7 days ; such time frame is sufficient to make reliable measurements and to perform non - time consuming computations . \n a single protoplasmic tube of an acellular slime mould _ p. polycephalum _ can be employed as a living electronic oscillator which produces stable , accurate , and , in principle , adjustable waveforms . \n this is because the tube exhibits periodic peristaltic contractions which lead to oscillations of the tube s resistance . \n de lacy costello b. , adamatzky a. assessing the chemotaxis behavior of _ physarum polycephalum _ to a range of simple volatile organic chemicals . \n communicative & integrative biology 6:5 , e25030 ;

ray observations of hot subdwarfs are useful because they provide a way to study the relatively weak winds of these low - mass stars ( see * ? ? ? \n * for a review ) . \n x - rays from  were discovered with an  observation carried out in 2011 @xcite . \n the spectrum was fit by the sum of a blackbody with temperature kt=45@xmath1010 ev plus a faint power -

resolution optical spectroscopy did not reveal radial velocity variations @xcite . \n this means that either the orbital plane has a very small inclination and/or the orbital period is of the order of months , or that  is indeed a single star and the reported signal was spurious . \n here we report the results of a longer follow - up  observation of  that we obtained in order to clarify the origin of its x - ray emission . \n statistics vs. trial period for the 2016 observation of . \n the dashed line indicates the period detected in the 2011 data . \n , width=264 ] \n was observed with the  satellite for 72 ks on 2016 february 1st . \n the three ccd cameras of the epic instrument were operated in imaging mode with a time resolution of 73 ms for the pn camera @xcite and of 0.9 s for the two mos cameras @xcite . \n the medium thickness filter was used for all cameras . \n the data were processed with sas v15 . \n we used only single- and double - pixel events for the pn ( pattern @xmath15 4 ) and single- and multiple - pixel events for the mos ( pattern @xmath15 12 ) .    for the timing analysis \n , we extracted the source counts from a circle of radius 15@xmath16 and converted their arrival times to the solar system barycenter . \n we used only the events in the energy range from 0.15 to 2 kev , as it was done for the 2011 data by @xcite . \n this resulted in 1519 pn counts and 485 mos counts . \n we estimate that the background contributes about 22% and 17% of these counts , respectively .    in order to take into account a possible spin - up or spin - down of the source during the @xmath74.5 years between the two  observations with plausible values of @xmath17 s s@xmath1 , we considered possible periods in the range from 19.1 to 19.2 s ( the value measured in 2011 was p@xmath18=19.156@xmath100.001 s ) . using the sum of the pn and mos counts \n , we found a maximum value of the z@xmath19 statistics @xcite of 8.74 , for a period p=19.174 s ( see fig . \n [ fig - z2 ] ) . \n however , the corresponding probability of chance occurrence , taking into account the number of sampled periods , is too large to claim a significant detection .    through monte carlo simulations we found that a sinusoidal modulation with pulsed fraction of 33% , as found in the 2011 data , has a probability of 99.9% of being detected at a significance above 5@xmath14 in an observation with the same duration and counting statistics as the 2016 one . \n the corresponding probability for a pulsed fraction of 25% ( the lower bound of the 2@xmath14 uncertainty of the 2011 value ) is 84% . \n therefore , the lack of a detection in the new data strongly suggest that either the pulsations in  disappeared ( i.e. the pulsed fraction decreased making them undetectable ) or the peak at 19.2 s appearing in the 2011 periodogram was caused by a statistical fluctuation .    for the spectral analysis we used circular extraction regions with radii of 20@xmath16 for the source and 50@xmath16 for the background . \n time intervals of high background were excluded . \n we merged the spectra from the three cameras into a single epic spectrum and produced the appropriate response matrix using the task multixmmselect . \n following exactly the same procedures , we extracted also the epic spectrum of  from the 2011 data , which we reprocessed using sas v15 . \n the effective exposure times of the 2016 and 2011 spectra are 48 ks and 28 ks , respectively . by comparing the two spectra we found no evidence that the flux or spectral shape changed between the two observations . \n therefore , we performed the spectral analysis by jointly fitting the 2011 and 2016 data in the 0.2 - 2 kev energy range using the xspec software . \n simple models ( power law , blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) modified by interstellar absorption could not fit the data ( values of reduced @xmath202.5 ) . \n thermal plasma emission models , with abundances fixed at solar values @xcite were also rejected , but they could give satisfactory fits if some of the abundances were let free to vary . \n for simplicity , and considering that the quality of the data does not allow us to constrain a large number of spectral parameters , we considered only a single - temperature plasma described by the apec model . \n we found strong evidence for an overabundance of c and ne , the latter being required to fit the significant excess of emission visible in the spectra at @xmath70.9 kev . \n the derived c and ne abundances were found to depend on that of he , which was however poorly constrained by the x - ray data . \n therefore , considering that  is an extreme he - rich star , we fixed the abundance of this element to a mass fraction of x@xmath21=0.99 . in this case \n we obtained a good fit with temperature kt=0.22 kev , absorption n@xmath22 @xmath23 , and solar abundances relative to hydrogen for all the other elements ( see fig . \n [ fig - sp ] and model a in table  [ tab1 ] ) . from optical studies we know , however , that also other elements are overabundant in this star . \n indeed , an equally good fit was obtained with the abundances of he , c , n , \n si and fe fixed at the values of @xcite , but also in this case an overabundance of ne was required ( model b in table  [ tab1 ] ) . \n the two models result in slightly different values of the unabsorbed flux , both of a few @xmath24 erg @xmath23 s@xmath1 ( 0.2 -

? ? * and references therein ) . \n an empirical correlation has been found between the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of early type stars : @xmath30 @xcite . \n the x - ray luminosity we derived for   corresponds to a value of @xmath31 , fully consistent with the observed dispersion around the above average relation . \n it is thus natural to ascribe the x - rays observed in  to the same , or similar , processes that are at work in the stellar winds of massive early type stars . \n there is in fact evidence from uv and optical spectroscopy that , despite its low luminosity compared to normal o - type stars , has a stellar wind . \n the inferred mass - loss rate is @xmath32=3@xmath33 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite , in good agreement with the predictions of the most recent theoretical models of radiatively - driven winds in low luminosity hot stars @xcite .    in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] we plot the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of the five sdo stars that have been detected in the x - ray range . for comparison , \n the values for a sample of normal o stars seen in the rosat all sky survey @xcite are also shown in the figure . \n @xcite is another single , he - rich star very similar to  for what concerns its optical spectrum , composition and mass - loss properties @xcite . \n these two stars lie very close in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane . \n the same is true for the spectroscopic binary , which is in a 1.55 day orbit with a neutron star or white dwarf companion @xcite . for this star we plot in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] the x - ray luminosity observed when the compact companion is eclipsed by the sdo star and likely due to wind emission ; out of the eclipse the luminosity is a factor ten higher and pulsations at 13.2 s are observed . \n the x - ray spectra of these three stars are similar , except for the presence of a harder component in  which might be related to its binary nature . \n the two other sdo stars plotted in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] ( feige 34 and ; @xcite ) are less luminous and their faint x - ray emission has not been studied in detail . \n it is however remarkable that they lie on the extrapolation of the average l@xmath2-l@xmath36 relation observed at higher luminosity . \n the temperature found in the spectral fits of  is in the lower range of the values seen in the sample of o - type stars observed with the  epic instrument , when a single - temperature plasma is sufficient to describe their low resolution x - ray spectra @xcite . \n this might be related to the weaker wind of  compared to that of normal o - type stars . \n it is also interesting to note that the weak - wind o - type dwarf @xmath37 col ( hd 38666 ) , with a mass - loss rate @xmath32 = 10@xmath38 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite similar to that of , has an x - ray emitting wind with higher temperature ( kt@xmath70.4 kev , @xcite ) , despite its lower wind velocity ( v@xmath39=1,200 km s@xmath1 wrt v@xmath39=2,000 km s@xmath1 , @xcite ) . \n however , we caution that the temperatures derived from low - resolution spectroscopy of faint x - ray sources , such as the hot subdwarfs discussed here , might be affected by the uncertainties in the element abundances . \n instruments with large collecting area and high spectral resolution are needed to address these issues in more detail and fully exploit the study of subdwarfs in the context of a more general understanding of stellar wind in hot stars . \n this work , supported through financial contributions from the agreement asi / inaf i/037/12/0 and from prin inaf 2014 , is based on data from observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) . \n pe acknowledges funding in the framework of the nwo vidi award a.2320.0076 .                    , u. , geier , s. , irrgang , a. , et  al . \n 2014 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 481 , 6th meeting on hot subdwarf stars and related objects , ed . \n v.  van grootel , e.  green , g.  fontaine , & s.  charpinet , 307", "StartTimeOffset": 1658450586443, "RequestID": "29b5ac65113f44c9a0f582d6655b16d7", "TotalTokens": 3808}
{"ContextTokens": 3835, "GeneratedTokens": 289, "SynthesizedBody": "radon is considered to be the second most important cause of lung cancer after smoking @xcite . inhaled radon - daughters deposit in the respiratory system and most of the alpha - particles emitted by them hit the surrounding epithelial cells . \n previous studies proved that the spatial distribution of deposited radioactive particles is highly inhomogeneous in the central airways @xcite , @xcite , where radon induced malignancies predominate @xcite . \n therefore , it is quite important to determine what consequences this heterogeneity has and how cancer risk depends on the amount of inhaled radon progenies . the objective of this research is to investigate these questions applying numerical modeling techniques . \n the elaborated computational modeling efforts consist of three major steps . \n firstly , a 3d numerical epithelium model and a suitable microdosimetric model have been developed for the quantification of cellular hit numbers and doses . \n the next step is preparing a radiation biological carcinogenesis model , which connects biological responses to the computed microdosimetric data . \n finally , this model can be applied for a given deposition distribution computed by computational fluid and particle dynamics approaches . \n brick shaped epithelium model has been elaborated taking into account the experimental data about the average volumes , frequencies @xcite and depth distributions @xcite of the six epithelial cell types in the bronchial epithelium . \n the height of the fragments is 57.8  , while its area is equal to the area of individual numerical grid elements to be modeled constructing the airway geometry . \n the cells in the model are brick - shaped and placed in three layers : basal cells can be found at bottom , goblet and ciliated cells are placed in the upper region , other secretory and preciliated cells are located either in the upper or in the middle layer , while intermediate cells are situated either in the middle or in the bottom part of the epithelium model . there is no gap between the cells . \n the model of the epithelium is covered with a 5-micrometer - thick mucus layer .    in the microdosimetric model , \n the dose - contributions of beta- and gamma - radiation are neglected , i.e. only the alpha - particles are considered . \n the path of alpha particles is supposed to be straight . \n the deposited energy along a given track length and the range is determined by the utilization of the stopping and range of ions in mattersoftware @xcite . \n the energy lost in the airway lumen is considered by the application of the model presented in a previous work @xcite . calculating the intersection of brick - shaped cells and the tracks of alpha - particles , \n cellular hit numbers can be determined . \n in addition , knowing the alpha - energies at the boundaries of the cells , cellular absorbed energies and doses can be computed .    for the assessment of biological effects , a revised version of the so - called initiation - promotion model \n @xcite has been applied . \n this model supposes that carcinogenesis consists of two stochastic steps . \n the first one is called initiation , which means transformation in this model . \n initiation frequency ( @xmath0 ) is directly proportional to cellular absorbed dose ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2    according to the model , the second and final stochastic step towards cancer is promotion , which means the division of an initiated cell . in the bronchial epithelium , basal and goblet cells are thaught to be able to divide @xcite , therefore initiation and promotion frequencies are computed only for these two cell types .    supposing that cell death forces other cells to divide , promotion probability ( @xmath3 ) will be directly proportional to mitotic rate , which consists of two terms in the model . the normal mitotic rate is constant ( @xmath4 ) , while the forced mitotic rate is directly proportional to the number of cells died ( @xmath5 ) and inversely proportional to the number of cells capable of dividing ( @xmath6 ) :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 ( 1 @xmath9 ) is constant . \n the number of cells died in the individual grid elements is assessed by the expected value of cells killed utilizing the individual cell surviving probabilities ( @xmath10 ) , which decreases exponentially with the increase of absorbed dose    @xmath11    where @xmath12 ( 1.67 @xmath13 ) is constant . \n the probability that a given cell takes both stochastic steps are computed as the product of initiation frequency , promotion probability , and naturally , cell surviving probability , because only living cells are able to be initiated and promoted . \n presuming that the value of this probability is low , the probability that at least one cell capable of dividing in a given surface element of the airway geometry takes the above two steps ( @xmath14 ) can be expressed by ( 4 ) :    @xmath15        the deposition distribution is determined by computational fluid and particle dynamics approaches . for the computations , \n the airway geometry composed of five bifurcation units was discretised by the construction of an inhomogeneous , unstructured numerical mesh @xcite . \n air and particle flow describing equations were solved by finite volume methods . \n one way coupling has been assumed between the air and the radioactive particles . \n this presumes that particle trajectories are influenced by the airstreams , but the airflow is independent of the particles . \n inhaled particles were tracked until they left the targeted airways or deposited on the airway walls . since a viscous mucus layer is covering the bronchial airways , particle - wall impaction can be considered as inelastic . \n the multitude of these impaction points forms the deposition pattern . \n primary deposition patterns can be modified by the clearance mechanisms , especially mucociliary clearance . \n however , clearance mechanisms were not considered in this study . \n the microdosimetric and biological quantities are computed for epithelium model fragments with the same size as the individual elements ( grid cells ) of the mesh . then quantities characteristic for the whole geometry \n are calculated by the summation or averaging of quantities computed for the individual grid elements . \n for example , the right side of relation ( 4 ) has been computed for each grid cell of the geometry and summed up , so as to obtain a quantity directly proportional to cancer risk . \n the deposition distribution in the bronchial airway model demonstrated in figure [ fig:01 ] corresponds to 500 inhalations , 50 millions inhaled and 500  thousands deposited particles in the geometry during 23 minutes of work in the new mexico uranium mine , which is equivalent to 0.0129  wlm . \n the geometry model consists of 162  thousands surface units ( or grid elements ) , mean area of which is 62500   with about 3300 epithelial cells . \n the biological responses in the different surface units are presumed to be independent . \n the cellular hit - distributions are plotted in figure  [ fig:02 ] for basal and goblet cells . \n most cells receive no hit , while some cells can suffer tens of hits . \n obviously , basal cells are hit less frequently than goblet cells , since as compared to goblet cells , they are more deeply embedded in the epithelium . \n importantly , the average hit number over all the cell types is 0.0079 , more than three thousands times less than the maximum number of hits . in terms of percentages , \n 98.4% of goblet cells receive no hit , 1.4 suffer single hits , while 0.2% are hit multiple times . \n regarding basal cells , 99.9% percentage of them are not hit , however , there are cells receiving multiple hits , as well . \n figure [ fig:03 ] presents the distributions of absorbed doses at cellular level for cells hit . \n doses are determined independently of the calculation of cellular hit numbers . \n the cellular absorbed doses vary in a wide range between 0  and 1.5  gy . \n interestingly , there are several cells , which absorb more than 1  gy dose during the 23-minute - long exposure , while almost 99.3% of all the cells receive no hits and therefore absorb no dose . \n the mean cellular dose of basal cells is 0.15  mgy , while that of goblet cells is 0.86  mgy for exposure characterized by 0.0129  wlm . \n the average cellular dose over all cells is approximately 0.5  mgy , what means that tissue dose is also of this order of magnitude , while some cells and some clusters of cells absorb thousand times higher doses . \n the fractions of surviving cells have also been computed in each grid element , so the distribution of surviving fractions is obtained . in figure \n [ fig:04 ] , the number of surface units characterized by a given surviving fraction is depicted . \n the lowest surviving fraction in one grid element is 45% in case of goblet cells and 84% in case of basal cells . \n it is worth to mention that these low surviving ratios in a grid element are the result of only 23 minutes of radon exposure corresponding to 0.0129  wlm . on the other hand , surviving ratios lower than 99% are quite rare regarding the whole ( five bifurcation unit ) airway geometry model . \n the spatial inhomogeneity of surviving fractions implies high spatial differences in the local probabilities of carcinogenesis . by the application of the model , the probability that at least one epithelial cell in the airway model takes \n both stochastic steps towards cancer can be computed . \n let this probability be called risk . computing the probabilities that at least one cell will be initiated and promoted in a given surface unit , the contribution to the risk of that grid element can be determined . \n as it is expected , the risk defined above originates only from a restricted area of the model geometry . \n figure [ fig:05 ] demonstrates how large ratio of grid elements is responsible for a given proportion of risk at the 23 minutes exposure in the mine . \n as it is demonstrated , risk originates from hardly more than 1% of all the grid elements and approximately 0.1% of the surface of the airways provides 60% of the whole risk computed by summing the result of relation  [ eq:04 ] calculated for the individual grid elements . \n finally , some computations have been done to study , how the risk depends on the total burden . \n the number of deposited radon - progenies has been multiplied by whole numbers from 2 to 6 modeling the radiation burden during 46 , 69 , 92 , 115 and 138 minutes of work in the new mexico uranium mine . in this range , the surviving fractions decrease linearly by the macroscopic radiation burden . in case of goblet cells , obviously \n , this decrease is much higher , than in case of basal cells . \n the ratio of dead cells seems to be very small in both cases ( 0.60% in case of goblet and 0.09% in case of basal cells ) . \n however , if there were no radon - inhalation , only 0.13% of all the cells would die during 138 minutes . \n this value is computed by the normal mitotic rate ( 1/30 @xmath9 ) and the stem cell ratio among all cells . \n the effect in cell killing , therefore , is quite significant , even in case of the whole geometry , data of which are plotted in figure [ fig:06 ] . \n the exact value of risk can not be determined because of the unknown proportion factor in relation ( 1 ) , however the shape of the risk curve can be presented as the function of macroscopic radiation burden . \n figure [ fig:07 ] demonstrates that risk in the modeled airways starts to increase non - linearly . \n this relationship differs from the functions applied for initiation , promotion and survival  ( see relations 1 - 3 ) , because tissue response to radiation is the superposition of these effects . \n in case of radon inhalation , the cellular hit and absorbed dose distributions are very inhomogeneous within the central airways . \n there is three orders of magnitude difference between cellular and tissue doses in case of a 23-minute - long radon exposure in the mine , what means that the spatial heterogeneities should not be neglected in risk - assessment . \n the spatial distribution of surviving fractions in grid elements proves that not only single cells , but also cell clusters receive high radiation burdens . \n therefore , in some parts of the central airways very high cell death frequencies can be observed even in case of the applied 23-minute - long exposure in the new mexico uranium mine corresponding to 0.0129  wlm . \n these very high cell death frequencies supports the idea that processes governing lung cancer formation induced by radon - daughters may differ significantly from carcinogenesis caused by other types of exposure . in accordance with histological studies @xcite , \n the results demonstrate that cancer formation probability is much higher in some regions of the central airways than in other parts of it . \n importantly , risk seems to depend non - linearly on macroscopic radiation dose differing from the functions applied for initiation and promotion , which represent a radiation effect on individual cells and a radiation effect interpretable only on tissue fragments ( interacting cells ) . \n this simple model demonstrates , that the interaction between radiation effects on different organizational levels may strongly influence the radiation response of the organism . \n noteworthy , important effects such as dose - rate - effect and non - targeted effects are not considered in this study , therefore the computed values of biological quantities are quite uncertain . \n united states environmental protection agency ( 2003 ) assessment of risks from radon in homes , _ epa publications _ , 402-r-03 -

{"ContextTokens": 2193, "GeneratedTokens": 143, "SynthesizedBody": "the formation of colour - electric flux tubes provides an intuitive physical picture for permanent confinement of quarks within hadrons . \n moreover , this picture seems to be realized within qcd , as has widely been observed in lattice simulations . \n the mechanism leading to flux tube formation , however , is still subject to analytical and numerical investigations . \n the shortcoming of the corresponding lattice calculations , however , is the fact that regarding sufficiently long flux tubes , i.  e.  large lattice sizes , becomes a numerically very difficult task . a simpler gauge theory which also exhibits confinement is @xmath0 \n ; it can be used as a prototype for investigating the formation of flux tubes . \n furthermore , it was realized many years ago @xcite that one can perform a duality transformation of the path integral in compact abelian gauge theories . in this way a new partition function is obtained which can be regarded as a limit of the dual non - compact abelian higgs model @xcite . \n besides this fact , the dually transformed theory can be used as a very efficient tool for the calculation of expectation values in the presence of external charges @xcite . \n the numerical advantages of such dual flux tube simulations also hold for the more general case of dual higgs models .    in this \n talk we review the results obtained in dually transformed @xmath0 lattice gauge theory and present some first calculations in the dual abelian higgs model . \n we will focus on one of the key questions within the dual superconductor picture , namely whether the confinement vacuum corresponds to a type - i or a type - ii superconductor , and we will investigate the role of quantum fluctuations of the dual degrees of freedom . \n the expectation value of a physical observable like the electric field or the magnetic current in the presence of external sources ( represented by polyakov loops ) can be rewritten as averaging over the dual degrees of freedom , as has been shown in previous work @xcite . \n the dual representation of the polyakov loops can be interpreted as a dual dirac sheet connecting the electric charges . \n this dual formulation opens the possibility for very accurate numerical calculations for several reasons : contrary to standard lattice simulations , the confinement phase is the weakly coupled one in the dual theory , therefore there are less quantum fluctuations . even more important is the fact that it is not necessary to project the charge \n anticharge state out of the vacuum : on a lattice of same size charge pairs with arbitrary distance can be simulated with equal accuracy , and increasing the time extent of the loops ( i.  e.  of the lattice ) does not influence the quality of the result , either . \n further advantages are the implementation of doubly charged flux tubes @xcite by double dirac strings which also yields results of equal accuracy , and the extension to periodically closed flux tubes . \n these `` torelons '' are free of end effects and allow for a more reliable calculation of pure flux tube properties like the string tension . \n an interesting physical task is the testing of the validity of a dual london equation for @xmath0 flux tubes @xcite . in the dual formulation \n we were able to investigate rather long flux tube lengths up to 20 lattice spacings . \n our results @xcite showed that the agreement between the @xmath0 data and the predictions of a classical model of maxwell and london equations are very good for small charge distances , but there is absolutely no agreement at large distances ( @xmath1 lattice spacings ) . \n a possible interpretation within the dual superconductor picture is that the confining @xmath0 behaves as an effective type - i superconductor , rather than an extreme type - ii as an exact validity of the dual london equation would suggest . \n in fact we got support for this conjecture also from a completely independent investigation : simulating doubly charged flux tubes . \n we found @xcite that in four - dimensional @xmath0 there is an attractive interaction between flux tubes for the coupling @xmath2 approaching the phase transition . \n thus one might look at @xmath0 lattice gauge theory from two points of view : from a `` microscopical '' it can be regarded as a double limit of a dual higgs model with both vanishing london penetration length and vanishing coherence length . from a `` macroscopical '' point of view it looks like a classical dual type - i superconductor . \n this peculiarity is related to the fluctuations in the dual theory : the observed attraction between flux tubes was shown to be a purely `` quantum - mechanical '' effect of the dually transformed @xmath0 theory @xcite . \n the action of the full abelian higgs model including a dual dirac string ( denoted with @xmath3 ) can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dual gauge field and @xmath6 the dual higgs field , located on the sites of the dual lattice . \n @xmath7 is the symmetry - breaking higgs potential with its minimum at @xmath8 . for the squared covariant derivative of the higgs \n current the compact formulation has been chosen , because this allows for fluctuations of the fluxoid string @xcite . in the classical model @xmath9 \n is the squared london penetration depth , and @xmath10 the squared coherence length . \n the double limit @xmath11 , @xmath12 exactly corresponds to the dually transformed @xmath0 theory discussed in the last section . \n if we compare this model to the parameters of dual qcd @xcite after an abelian ansatz , we find the correspondence @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( chromo-)magnetic coupling , @xmath15 the location of the minimum and @xmath16 the strength of the corresponding continuum higgs potential , and @xmath17 is the lattice spacing . \n these parameters can be chosen to reproduce very well the infrared behaviour of qcd . \n the classical flux tube solutions of the higgs model on sufficiently fine lattices give very good agreement with corresponding continuum calculations @xcite . \n it is now an interesting question how quantum and string fluctuations ( of the fluxoid string ) do effect the physical quantities , e.  g.  the string tension . \n for the set of parameters which yields the desired classical solution , the system is not in the higgs phase any more on a reasonably fine lattice , if fluctuations are turned on . \n for this reason we introduce a `` quantum scale '' @xmath18 , by substituting @xmath19 in the path integral by @xmath20 , which allows for a smooth interpolation between the classical limit ( @xmath21 ) and an ordinary simulation ( @xmath22 ) . \n the changing of the string tension as a function of @xmath18 is depicted in fig . \n [ sigma_n ] for two cases : considering only quantum fluctuations but keeping the physical fluxoid string fixed , and also considering string fluctuations , which leads to an increase of the energy per length ( until the system undergoes a phase transition to the coulomb phase ) . \n ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 40,160)(0,0)@xmath23    physical arguments suggest that the dual superconductor should be approximately at the borderline between type - i and type - ii . \n this is fulfilled for the chosen classical solution . \n investigating the influence of fluctuations on an effective landau - ginzburg parameter ( defined by the ratio of the individual contributions to the string tension ) showed us that the system is pushed towards type - i behaviour by fluctuations . \n by dual simulations of flux tubes one can address a lot of interesting questions concerning the confinement mechanism . \n here we focussed on the discussion whether the confinement vacuum is a dual type - i or type - ii superconductor , and on the meaning of fluctuations in dual theories . \n similarly to the behaviour of @xmath0 in the vicinity of the phase transition , these fluctuations can produce an effective type - i superconductor also in the full abelian higgs model .    of course \n , it is another interesting question , which set of ( bare ) parameters has to be used to describe the same physics as with the classical solution of the abelian higgs model . \n for this task , however , it will be necessary to improve the control over string fluctuations in our simulations . \n this work was supported by the fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung , project no . \n p12495-tph .    1 cm t.  banks , r.  myerson , j.  kogut ,  129 ( 1977 ) 493 . \n j.  frhlich , p.  a.  marchetti , _ europhys . \n _ 2 ( 1986 ) 933 . \n m.  zach , m.  faber , p.  skala ,  57 ( 1998 ) 123 . \n m.  zach , m.  faber , p.  skala ,  ( 1998 ) , in press , + 9709017 . \n v.  singh , r.  w.  haymaker , d.  a.  browne ,  47 ( 1993 ) 1715 . for \n a review see e.g. m.  baker , j.  s.  ball , f.  zachariasen ,  41 + ( 1990 ) 2612 . \n m.  baker , n.  brambilla , h.  g.  dosch , a.  vairo ,  58 ( 1998 ) + 034010 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1684368271878, "RequestID": "0fcc1de6d2534a84a29416585b2f0ed7", "TotalTokens": 2336}
{"ContextTokens": 2010, "GeneratedTokens": 222, "SynthesizedBody": "the main title of this paper is , apart from the term multiplex , literally identical to a forney , gallager and co - workers paper issued more than one decade ago [ for et al . \n 84 ] , which analyzed the benefits of coded - modulation techniques . \n the large success achieved by ungerboeck s coded - modulation came from the way of introducing redundancy in the encoder [ ung 82 ] . in classical channel coding , \n redundant signals are appended to information symbols in a way somewhat analogous to time division multiplex tdm ( envelope interleaving ) . \n it was believed that introducing error - control ability would increase bandwidth . \n an efficient way of introducing such an ability without sacrificing rate nor requiring more bandwidth consists in adding redundancy by an alphabet expansion . \n this technique is particularly suitable for channel in the narrow -

field fourier transforms ( ffft ) . \n this paper shows that the bandwidth compactness factor relatively to tdm depends on the length @xmath6 , the alphabet extension . \n +   + another point to mention is that the superiority of digital mux regarding analogic mux is essentially due to the low complexity of tdm . \n the majority of today multiplex systems follows plesiocrhonous ( pdh ) or synchronous ( sdh ) hierarchy . besides presenting higher spectral efficiency ( bits / s / hz ) than classical mux \n , the new cdm schemes here introduced are based on fast transforms so they also seem to be attractive from the implementation viewpoint . \n although most mux systems today be intended to optical fiber which are not yet bandlimited channels , multiplex has also been adopted on satellite channels . \n probably applications of such multiplex will be on transponders and specially on cellular communications . \n cable television ( catv ) can also have benefit by using such a technique . \n digital multiplex normally alludes time division multiplex ( tdm ) . \n however , it also can be achieved by coding division multiplex ( cdm ) . \n the cdm has recently been focus of interest , specially after the is-154 standardization of the cdma system for cellular telephone . in this section \n we introduce a new class of mux schemes based upon finite - field transforms which can be implemented by fast transform algorithms . \n _ classical multiplex increases simultaneously the transmission rate and the bandwidth by the same factor _ , keeping thus the spectral efficiency unchanged . in order to achieve ( slight ) better spectral efficiencies , \n classical cdma uses waveforms presenting a non zero but residual correlation . \n +   + given a signal @xmath7 over a finite field gf(@xmath1 ) we deal with the galois domain considering the spectrum @xmath8 over an extension field gf(@xmath0 ) which corresponds to the finite field transform ( galois transform ) [ bla 79 , cam et al . \n +   + as an alternative and attractive implementation , the multiplex is carried out by a finite field transform ( ffft / ffht ) and the demux corresponds exactly to a inverse finite - field transform of length @xmath9 . \n each symbol on the ground field gf(@xmath1 ) have duration @xmath10 seconds . \n an @xmath3-user mux can be designed on the extension field gf(@xmath0 ) where @xmath9 . for the sake of simplicity , we begin with @xmath6=1 and consider a ( @xmath11)-channel mux as follows . \n typically , we can consider gf(3 ) corresponding to alternate mark inversion ami signaling .        a ( @xmath11)-cd consider digital carrier sequences per channel as versions of cas function over the galois ( complex ) field gi(@xmath1 ) . the cas ( cos and sin ) function is defined in terms of finite field trigonometric functions [ cam et al . \n 98 ] , @xmath14 . \n +   + carrier 0 : + @xmath15 + carrier 1 : + @xmath16 + ... + carrier @xmath17 : + @xmath18 + ... + carrier @xmath19 : + @xmath20 . \n +   + the cyclic digital carrier has the same duration @xmath10 of a input modulation symbol , so that it carries @xmath3 slots per data symbol . \n the interval of each cas - symbol is @xmath21 and therefore the bandwidth expansion factor by multiplexing @xmath3 channels may be roughly @xmath3 , the same result as fdm and tdm / pam . + a first scheme of the multiplex is showed : the output corresponds exactly to the galois - hartley transform of the `` users''-vector @xmath22 . \n + therefore , it contains all the information of the channels . \n each coefficient @xmath23 of the spectrum has duration @xmath21 . \n these carriers can also be viewed as spreading waveforms . \n an @xmath3-user mux has @xmath3 spreading sequences , one per channel . \n the requirements to achieve welch s lower bound according to massey and mittelholzer [ mas - mit 91 ] are hold by @xmath24 sequences . \n the matrix @xmath25 $ ] presents both orthogonal rows and columns and have the same energy. +   + a naive example is present in order to illustrate such an approach . \n a 4-channel mux over gf(5 ) can be easily implemented @xmath26 . \n it is straightforward to see that such signal are not fdmed nor tdmed . \n hlio magalhes de oliveira was born in arcoverde , pernambuco , brazil , in 1959 . \n he received both the b.sc . and \n degrees in electrical engineering from universidade federal de pernambuco ( ufpe ) , recife , pernambuco , in 1989 and 1983 , respectively . \n then he joined the staff of the same university as a lecturer . in 1992 \n he earned the docteur de l__cole nationale suprieure des tlcommunications _ _ degree , in paris . he is currently with the statistics departement of ufpe \n de oliveira was appointed as honored professor by fivety electrical engineering undergratuate classes and chosen as the godfather of sixteen engineering graduation . \n his publications are available at arxiv . \n research current interests include : applied statistics , communications theory , applied information theory , signal analysis , and wavelets .", "StartTimeOffset": 1700615693924, "RequestID": "4614b05868484319be6a97b86a1ac7b1", "TotalTokens": 2232}

ray superwind @xcite . \n one of the most notable features of the starburst is the super star clusters ( sscs ) near the center of the galaxy @xcite . \n they are some of the nearest and earliest - known examples of young , massive , compact star clusters . \n these sscs , which may evolve into clusters resembling present - day globulars @xcite , have been found in all types of starburst environments , from dwarf irregulars to galaxy mergers . \n we obtained spectra and images of the sscs in ngc  1569 on january 17 , 2000 ut using the near -

rayet stars known to be present there @xcite . \n thus the spectrum of ssc a can not be explained with a single simple stellar population according to current population synthesis models . \n cluster c2 , on the other hand , shows both br@xmath6 and hei in absorption , which may be due to a much older population dominated by a stars and red giants .     and \n he emission , while c2 shows both of these in absorption . \n ( * b * ) _ h_-band spectra of sscs a and b with slopes removed , compared with the spectrum of a k1.5 ib supergiant @xcite . note the correspondence of features between star and cluster spectra , and the richness of _ h _ band ]    optimally extracted _ \n h_-band spectra of sscs a and b are shown in fig . \n [ spectra]b , together with the spectrum of a k1.5 ib supergiant from the kpno stellar atlases @xcite . \n a comparison of the star and cluster spectra reveals that most of the features in the cluster spectra are real , not noise , and that _ \n photospheric spectra are remarkably rich in strong metallic and molecular features . \n only the co bands stand out in the _ k_-band spectra , while many metal features in _ h _ band are as strong as the second overtone co bands . \n most of the features in _ \n band are blends of lines from co , oh , and metals such as fe , si , al , and mg . \n the most massive , evolved members of a single - aged stellar population tend to dominate its integrated light . \n thus the simplest approach to interpreting the integrated light may be to ask , what is the dominant spectral type of the cluster ? \n we attempt to characterize a cluster by an effective spectral type by fitting its _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra to a grid of nextgen model atmospheres @xcite , in order to determine an effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity for each object . \n the nextgen atmospheres were available for spherically symmetric giant stars with a range in t@xmath2 of 3000  k to 6800  k , a range in @xmath7 of 0.0 to 3.5 , and metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath8 0.0 ( solar ) , @xmath90.3 , @xmath90.5 , and @xmath90.7 . \n we first test the utility of this procedure by fitting the model atmospheres to an empirical spectrum of a star of known spectral type to evaluate the precision and accuracy with which it selects the atmospheric parameters . \n [ chi2]a shows the resulting @xmath10 contours for a fit to a solar - metallicity k1.5  ib spectrum . \n the resulting parameters , t@xmath11  k and @xmath12 , are a good match to those of the star . both _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra were required in order to remove degeneracies in the fits . \n contours for fit of nextgen models for : ( * a * ) spectrum of a k1.5 ib star ; ( * b * ) ssc  b ; ( * c * ) ssc  a. white filled contour indicates 1  sigma confidence level , and line contours represent 90 , 95 , and 99% confidence limits . \n best - fit parameters for ssc b imply an effective spectral type for the cluster light of k0 supergiant . \n best - fit parameters for ssc a imply an effective spectral type for the cluster light of g5 supergiant with @xmath13 . \n the temperature and range of @xmath7 are consistent with a mixed population of stars , either two short bursts or an extended epoch of star formation ]    next we fit the nextgen atmospheres at metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ( which is closest to that of ngc  1569 , [ fe / h ] @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite ) to the _ h _ + _ k _ spectra of the brightest _ \n k_-band cluster , ssc b. the resulting @xmath10 contours in fig . \n [ chi2]b have the same shape as those found for the star in fig . \n [ chi2]a , indicating that the light of cluster b is heavily dominated by stars with a very narrow range in spectral type . \n the effective spectral type for ssc b is that of a k0 supergiant , with t@xmath11  k and @xmath17 .    for the double cluster , ssc a , the @xmath10 contours are less tightly constrained in the fit parameters than for ssc b. fig . \n [ chi2]c shows them to be centered at a hotter t@xmath18  k and larger range of @xmath19 , typical for stars of types g5 i and g5 iii . \n it is unlikely , however , that such stars dominate the cluster s emission , since optical / uv evidence indicates that hot blue wolf - rayet stars are present together with the red evolved stars creating the strong infrared co bands . \n thus the inferred effective spectral type determined from the stellar atmospheres may simply result from the superposition of the two distinct populations . \n since a cluster consists of stars with a range of stellar masses , luminosities , and temperatures , it is more informative to model the integrated population directly than to focus on its effective spectral type . \n thus we employ the technique of population synthesis to calculate the distribution of stars in the h - r diagram of a cluster as a function of time . \n we then calculate the integrated spectrum of the cluster by adding the appropriate numbers of stellar spectra  either empirical spectra or model atmospheres .      all models in this paper \n were constructed using the updated evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 @xcite . \n the code incorporates the most recent stellar evolutionary tracks from the geneva group at metallicities ranging from very metal - poor , to twice solar metallicity @xcite , and it has been updated to allow the use of isochrone synthesis . \n starburst99 is a particular set of synthesis models which are optimized to reproduce properties of galaxies with active star formation , so it puts most of the emphasis on early evolutionary phases . \n later phases , like agb stars or white dwarfs , are covered only crudely or not at all . \n origlia et al . \n @xcite show that low - metallicity tracks do not reproduce the co 1.62  @xmath5 m and co 2.29  @xmath5 m indices of young lmc clusters \n . however , if the fraction of time spent as a rsg during the core - helium phase is forced to at least 50% , and if the rsg temperature is maintained to less than 4000  k , the models agree well with the observations . \n our modeling technique was modified according to this prescription ( leitherer , private communication , 2000 ) .    in order to generate model cluster spectra \n , we combine the starburst99 models with the empirical libraries of stellar spectra obtained at kitt peak by wallace & hinkle @xcite and meyer et  al . \n for a given cluster population , we add up the spectra of component stars , and include nebular continuum emission ( but not the recombination lines ) based on the number of ionizing photons predicted for the cluster . thus we generate a time series of model cluster spectra such as that shown in fig . \n [ mod]a for a 10@xmath20  m@xmath21 cluster with salpeter imf ranging from 0.1 to 100  m@xmath21 . for the first few myr , \n nebular emission powered by the hottest stars dilutes the photospheric emission from the cluster , but by an age of 67  myr , the most massive stars have evolved off of the main sequence to become red supergiants , whose spectra are marked by deep co bands .    finally , we can place observed cluster spectra in an evolutionary sequence by fitting them to the model sequences . \n figure  [ mod]b displays the _ h_-band spectra of sscs a and b together with the three model cluster spectra ( 15 , 18 , and 21 myr ) which most closely resemble the observations . note the correspondence between features and the decrease in their strength with time . since the models are for solar metallicity clusters , they presumably have stronger metal features at a given age than expected for a lower - metallicity cluster . \n thus the age estimates we derive from these models will be too large during this epoch of the cluster s evolution . \n we have presented new high - quality near - infrared spectra of several of the sscs in the nearby irregular starburst , ngc  1569 , and demonstrated the utility of the rich _ h_-band spectral region for modeling stellar populations . we found that combining _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra removed some of the degeneracy in fitting just one band to model spectra . \n we used population synthesis models together with model stellar atmospheres and empirical stellar spectra to fit for the effective spectral type of a cluster , and to generate sequences of synthetic cluster spectra to help determine the ages of observed clusters . \n since the empirical libraries are only complete for solar metallicity , we are constructing models that use model atmospheres at lower metallicities that are more appropriate for systems like ngc  1569 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1735809387525, "RequestID": "93cd94f38e4c4d3b80684798021b5370", "TotalTokens": 3125}

van alphen effect , which is limited to low temperatures , and therefore can not be utilized for the study of certain paramagnetic materials , for example cr , since the nel temperature of cr is @xmath5k @xcite . \n for this reason , numerous acar investigations , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite have been performed on paramagnetic cr . \n studying the fermiology of the paramagnetic phase of cr would allow to gain insight to the driving mechanism of the anti - ferromagnetic ordering of cr below @xmath5k , since a nesting feature of the fermi surface gives a possible explanation . \n however , several 2d - acar investigations performed in the paramagnetic @xcite phase of cr revealed significant discrepancies between the measured and the calculated two - photon - momentum distribution , which can not be explained in terms of an unexpected topology of the fermi surface . these discrepancies are most probably due to @xmath6-@xmath7-correlations and/or many - body effects not accounted for by theory . \n recently , an experimental approach to this problem , the utilisation of a state - dependent enhancement has been presented in@xcite . with this method the enhancement is directly obtained by fitting the contribution of the individual bands to the data . \n this way , the fermi surface nesting vector was deduced via the computation of the static susceptibility from the fitted lmto calculations . in our study \n we focussed on the differences in the fermi surface topology between paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic cr . \n therefore , 2d - acar measurements at different temperatures have been performed . \n the 2d - acar spectrometer consists of two main components , the source - sample chamber including the sample environment , and the detector assembly consisting of two anger - type gamma cameras , which were obtained from the positron group of bristol university . \n the anger cameras are positioned symmetrically at a distance of @xmath8 m to the source - sample chamber . \n the munich 2d -

points appear to be occupied in the anti - ferromagnetic phase ( high symmetry points of the brillouin zones of both phases , _ simple cubic _ for the anti - ferromagnetic phase and _ bcc _ for the paramagnetic phase are indicated in figures 15 ) . \n this picture changes when the sample temperature is increased above the nel temperature ( see figure [ fig:318 ] ) . \n a small difference in temperature drives the sample into the paramagnetic state and yields a drastic change in the lcw - folded data . \n the n - hole pockets become more pronounced , which can be seen comparing cuts along @xmath17-n-@xmath17 for both phases ( see figure [ fig : cut1 ] ) . furthermore \n , the electron pocket structure at the x - points connecting the n - points is smaller than in the anti - ferromagnetic phase . \n generally , the agreement of our measurement with previous 2d - acar measurements ( see ref.@xcite ) on paramagnetic cr is considerable . \n however , the discrepancies between our data and the sprkkr calculations are quite substantial . \n this has also been reported from different laboratories @xcite . \n the relative intensities in the calculation for the occupied and the unoccupied states can not be reproduced in the lcw - folded data ( see figure [ fig : rech ] ) . \n the experimental resolution of our spectrometer lies between @xmath20mrad and @xmath21mrad @xcite , which is only slightly less than the extent of the n - point features in our data . \n however , the changes in the lcw - folded data when the sample is driven over the magnetic phase transition can not be attributed to resolution effects , since a temperature increase of @xmath22k results in a degradation of the overall resolution of less than @xmath23mrad . \n + during data analysis the lcw - folding was applied to the isotropic data , which was obtained by azimuthal averaging of the original data . \n the isotropic data does not contain the full information on the fermi surface topology . with the isotropic data alone features at the x - point , similar to those described above , can be produced by the lcw - folding , as can be seen in figure [ fig : cut ] . \n + a possible explanation would be that the positron annihilation with a high lying flat band close to the fermi energy is strongly enhanced . \n also it has to be considered the application of the lcw - theorem is only valid if the positron wave function can be characterized as a plane wave , which is not true if strong correlation effects are present , like it is the case for cr @xcite . \n + to summarize , we were able to reproduce the results from previous measurements@xcite we also could show , that the 2d - acar spectrum is drastically different in the anti - ferromagnetic and in the paramagnetic phase . however , the interpretation of our data with respect to the calculation remains an unsolved challenge . \n cut through the lcw - folded data along @xmath24 ( p@xmath25 ) in comparison with the same cut for a lcw - folding of the isotropic data . \n the position of high symmetry points is indicated . ] \n for the interpretation of the 2d - acar data of cr a solid understanding of the enhancement is needed . \n we plan on recording multiple 2d - acar projections of cr in the paramagnetic phase in order to perform a full 3d reconstruction of the momentum density , respective measurements are under way . this way \n , we hope to get a better grasp of the enhancement in cr and with that gain insight to the electronic structure . \n this project is funded by the deutsche forschungsgesellschaft ( dfg ) within the transregional collaborative research center trr 80 `` from electronic correlations to functionality '' . \n 9 steinitz m o 1986 _ j. magn . \n magn . mater . _ \n * 60 * 137 -

{"ContextTokens": 1579, "GeneratedTokens": 259, "SynthesizedBody": "because essentially all known protostellar or pre - main sequence objects show evidence of winds , jets , or outflows , the current thinking is concentrated on a picture of simultaneous infall and outflow , in which infall and accretion occur towards the protostellar equatorial regions , and a wind breaks out along the poles ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n yet early thinking on the stages of young stellar evolution identified a phase in which infall directly strikes the protostellar surface , with no outflow present @xcite . \n no clear examples are known of such protostars . in this contribution \n i consider limits on the timescale for purely - accreting objects in the context of the standard model of inside - out collapse from a molecular cloud core . \n the mathematical formulation is a generalization of @xcite , dropping the assumptions of normal force balance and quasi - stationarity to permit full time - dependence and dynamical expansion ( or collapse ) . \n the inside - out collapse of a singular , isothermal sphere yields a mass accretion rate @xmath4 at the center @xcite . here \n @xmath2 is the isothermal sound speed in the cloud core . at the origin \n is a protostar whose mass grows linearly in time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the time since the start of collapse . in the presence of initial , solid - body rotation , \n the infall is distorted , and accretion occurs preferentially onto the circumstellar disk @xcite . \n the natural length scale of the distortion is the centrifugal radius @xmath7 , which grows as @xmath8 . \n i turn on a wind at the stellar surface , of radius @xmath9 , and numerically determine whether it can halt infall and escape . at early times , \n @xmath10 and the accretion is nearly isotropic , making breakout of the wind difficult . at late times , \n when @xmath11 , escape becomes easy along the poles .    for simplicity , the wind is assumed isotropic and of constant speed @xmath1 , and mass - loss rate @xmath0 . \n the wind and infall collide supersonically , and a shocked shell forms . \n low speeds imply rapid cooling and a geometrically thin shell . \n the dynamics of such time - dependent , thin shells has been discussed in detail by @xcite . \n i include the inputs of mass and momentum from infall , the wind , and the gravitational force due to the protostar . \n for a given evolutionary time and ratio @xmath12 , i determine the minimum wind speed necessary to break out of the infalling flow . \n figure  [ fig : riseandfall ] shows an example calculation of a shell that fails to escape and falls back to the star . in this case , a modest increase in wind speed dramatically changes the outcome , permitting breakout of the shell from the infall region . \n i solved the problem in dimensionless form , which reduces the parameter space from six ( @xmath13 ) to three dimensions ( nondimensional time @xmath14 , wind speed @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) . as a result \n , the parameter space has been fully explored . \n figure  [ fig : nofit ] shows the critical wind speed for breakout . when the wind ram pressure exceeds the infall ram pressure at the stellar surface , the wind may initially push the shell upwards . \n but if the wind speed is less than the critical speed , the shell stalls and falls back . \n this is the trapped wind stage . in figure \n [ fig : nonsteady ] , its duration is the time between the dashed ( ram pressure balance ) curve and the solid one ( critical wind speed ) for a given ratio @xmath17 . \n the results of figures  [ fig : nofit ] and  [ fig : nonsteady ] may be easily scaled to apply to _ anisotropic _ winds , by comparing to an equivalent , isotropic wind having the same mass and momentum loss rates along the z - axis . \n indeed , at early times , the evolution is primarily determined by the momentum loss rate of the wind in this direction . at late times , it is the wind speed rather than momentum loss rate that determines breakout . \n it is hoped that these semi - analytic results will inspire more detailed exploration of this problem with fully radiative hydrodynamic simulations . \n the existing literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) on this is not immediately comparable because they have used a different density law which is self - similar , unlike that of cassen & moosman . \n moreover , i argue that initial conditions with wind velocity much greater than the critical velocity are unphysical , as such a strong wind would have broken out at an earlier time , unless the wind itself evolves strongly with time . \n strong collimation of wind by anisotropic infall is not seen in the current calculations , although further exploration of this issue is forthcoming . \n i note that numerical simulations demonstrating strong collimation due to the circumstellar density asymmetry ( e.g.  @xcite ) have assumed a much more asymmetric density field than that used here . \n i am grateful to the observatoire de la cte dazur for a henri poincar fellowship and to the dpartement fresnel , umrs 5528 for hosting my postdoctoral stay in france . \n i also thank conacyt / mxico for financial support and s.stahler for encouragement in this work . \n andr , p. , ward -

{"ContextTokens": 2935, "GeneratedTokens": 100, "SynthesizedBody": "during latest decades , we have seen large numbers of publications on the use of pareto - lev and other heavy - tailed distributions in finance ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references there ) . one of the key authors that initiated this , was mandelbrot . \n he mentioned that gaussian distribution can not provide a solid explanation for observed large amount of ` outliers ' - in other words , the number of observations for which absolute value of deviation from empirical mean is bigger than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is empirical variance . \n aparently , mandelbrot considered stable distributions as a unique alternative to gaussian family basing on the fact of classical limit theorem for independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables , or , equivalently , on stability property . in the remainder of this paper \n , we show that stable distributions can not explain such a large number of outliers either . \n the connection to classical limit theorem for a non - random number of random summands seems to be questionable . \n a more natural perspective comes from the use of limit theorem for a random number of random variables . \n in this section we look at the probability of observing outliers in the case of distributions belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable distribution . \n specifically , suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d . \n random variables . \n denote by @xmath3 their empirical mean and empirical variance correspondingly . \n let @xmath4 be a fixed number . \n we are interested in the following probability @xmath5 our aim here is to prove the following theorem . \n [ th1 ] suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d . \n random variables belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index of stability @xmath6 . \n then @xmath7    since @xmath8 belong to the domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index @xmath9 , it is also true that @xmath10 belong to the domain of attraction of one -

compact support , the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) has a positive limit as @xmath19 . \n indeed , if the second moment is finite then both @xmath28 and @xmath29 have finite limits @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) converges to @xmath32 as @xmath19 because of non - compactness of support of the distribution . \n therefore , it is clear that the explanation of presence a large number of outliers can not be provided by the heaviness of the tails . \n although the results of section [ s2 ] show that asymptotically the probability of presence of a large number of outliers is negligible , we may still have doubts for not too large samples . \n however , the samples in practice are not too small . \n so , basing on actual observed data , we can consider the sample size @xmath33 of order @xmath34 as typical one . \n we simulated @xmath35 samples of size @xmath33 ( @xmath33 is growing from 1,000 to 25,000 with step 2,000 ) and calculated the estimate of probability @xmath36 given by ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath37 . \n the behavior of this probability as a function of @xmath33 is reflected on figure [ fig1 ] . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution . \n we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath38-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller that for gaussian case starting at about @xmath39 . \n therefore , we can not expect many outliers for such stable distribution for typical sample size .     for @xmath37 . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line -

to standard gaussian distribution . \n we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller than that for gaussian case starting from about @xmath42 . \n the decrease of @xmath36 for the case @xmath37 is much slower . \n for example , @xmath43 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution . \n in this situation , we can not say that stable distribution provides less outliers that gaussian law . \n but will the corresponding number of outliers be sufficient for the predicted figures to be in agreement with observed data ? \n unfortunately , there are only a few papers giving observed number of outliers , that is an estimate of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 . some data of this kind may be found in @xcite , table 3 . \n corresponding estimates for probabilities @xmath45 given there vary from 0.009 to 0.013 . for symmetric stable distribution with @xmath46 , this probability is @xmath43 . \n we see that it is too small to explain the number of outliers in table 3 from @xcite . \n let us note that similar simulations for different values of parameters and sample size are given in @xcite . \n we shall not discuss them here .     for @xmath40 . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath41 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution ] \n lately , _ tempered stable distributions _ have been growing increasingly popular . \n the idea of such distribution lies in altering the tails of stable laws by exponential tails starting from a certain point of distribution s support . of course \n , the probability @xmath36 in this case will not converge to zero anymore . \n however , one may expect that this probability will be small if the point of the tails alteration is far from the origin , since tempered distribution will be close to stable in this case . \n simulations support this opinion . \n let us consider only the case of symmetric tempered stable distributions having characteristic functions @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    on figure [ fig2a ] , plot of limit probability @xmath51 \n is given for the distribution ( [ eqa ] ) as a function of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . \n this plot shows that the probabilities are too small to explain the presence of large number of outliers .     as a function of parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ] \n here we discuss a way of constructing from a distribution another one having a higher probability to observe outliers . \n we call this procedure `` put tail down '' . \n let @xmath56 be a probability distribution function of random variable @xmath57 having finite second moment @xmath58 and such that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . take a parameter @xmath61 and \n fix it . define a new function @xmath62 where @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . \n it is clear that @xmath67 is probability distribution function for any @xmath61 . \n of course , @xmath68 also has finite second moment @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . \n however , @xmath71 . \n let @xmath72 be a random variable with probability distribution function @xmath68 . \n then @xmath73 denoting @xmath74 rewrite previous equality in the form @xmath75 for @xmath72 to have more outliers than @xmath57 it is sufficient that @xmath76 there are many cases in which inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is true for sufficiently large values of @xmath77 . \n let us mention two of them .    1 \n .   random variable @xmath57 has exponential tail . \n more precisely , @xmath78 for some positive constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \n in this case , inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent for sufficiently large @xmath77 to @xmath81 which is obviously true for large @xmath77 . \n 2 .   @xmath82 has power tail , that is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 in view of existence of finite second moment . \n simple calculations show that ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent as @xmath85 to @xmath86 the last inequality is true for @xmath87 . \n let us note that the function @xmath68 has a jump at zero . \n however , one can obtain similar effect without such jump by using a smoothing procedure , that is by approximating @xmath68 by smooth functions . \n `` put tail down '' procedure allows us to obtain more outliers in view of two its elements . \n first element consists in changing the tail by smaller , but proportional to previous with coefficient @xmath88 . \n the second element consist in moving a part of mass into origin ( or into a small neighborhood of it ) , which reduces the variance . \n one of the arguments used to support the use of stable distributions in finance is that the observations may be considered as sums of a large number of random variables . \n however , to have the convergence to stable distribution , the summands themselves must have heavy tails , which seems to be unnatural . \n moreover , as we saw in sections [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] , the probability to observe large number of outliers is not in agreement with real data . \n however , alternatives to gaussian distribution are not restricted by stable distributions only . \n there are limit laws for the sums of i.i.d . \n random variables for _ random number of summands_. the theory of such limit distributions has been developed by robbins , dobrushin , gnedenko and others . \n the description of this theory can be found in the book @xcite . \n for some new results , see @xcite . as shown in these publications , the sums of a random number of i.i.d . \n random variables converges to so - called @xmath89-normal distribution . \n the form of this distribution depends on the law for number of summands . in the case of geometric distribution for the number of summands the limit law is laplace distribution instead of gaussian . for the case of \n transformed negative binomial distribution for the number of summands the role of gaussian law is played by symmetric gamma distribution . \n many other examples are given in @xcite . \n all such distributions have finite second moment . \n for many of them , the probability ( [ eq2 ] ) is essentially higher than for gaussian law . \n for example , laplace distribution gives the limit value of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 equal to @xmath90 , versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution . \n our suggestion is that such distributions are good alternatives to gaussian and stable laws .", "StartTimeOffset": 1799930380011, "RequestID": "34955d34324c497095c2a0d4e85f462d", "TotalTokens": 3035}

performance - computing architectures , since laplacians can be readily computed on computational fluid dynamics meshes . \n higher order harmonic green s function expansions can be generated using this method . \n boundary values can now be computed effectively along an arbitrarily chosen z - axis @xmath34 and at values chosen to lie within the outer - most extent of a chosen volumetric region @xmath35 . \n physical solution of the interior inhomogeneous problem can be obtained by proper boundary value treatment as described above . \n accelerations can be obtained from the potential by performing a precise numerical gradient . in the case of cylindrical and spherical coordinates \n , the three dimensional poisson solve can be further facilitated through the use of a discrete azimuthal fourier transform . \n this decouples the three dimensional poisson problem into a set of decoupled 2d problems that can be solved with second order accurate finite differencing using either direct or iterative methods . \n using highly compact representations of infinite domain green s functions , solutions to the linear partial differential equations of mathematical physics can be more easily obtained . in this paper , and in recent papers , we treat the green s function for the laplace equation . here \n we have extended this result to the three dimensional biharmonic and higher harmonic equations . \n further variants are possible for the 3d helmholtz , wave , and diffusion equations . in the future \n , we intend to investigate and more precisely describe these new green s function expansions . many areas of theoretical physics will benefit greatly from precise numerical implementations of these compact expansions . \n azimuthal fourier identities for potentials such as coulomb ( @xmath36 ) or yukawa ( @xmath37 ) lead to new classical and quantum energy theorems . \n these allow for rapid and precise evaluation of the coulomb or yukawa direct and exchange interactions ( cohl et al . \n classical yukawa eigenfunctions are obtained through transcendental function identification of the lamb - sommerfeld integral ( see magnus et al . 1966 ) . in quantum physics \n this is accomplished through the use of the azimuthal selection rule for the self - energies , namely for the direct and exchange hamiltonian elements only the @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms survive respectively . \n the application of the selection rule allows for exact evaluation of the hamiltonian matrix elements for two - electron interactions in atomic physics , molecular physics , condensed matter physics , physical chemistry , and biology . \n two - electron interactions are critically important in obtaining opacities and correct equations of state in astrophysically dense atomic and molecular fluid media . \n magnetohydrodynamic problems can now be easily handled with heine expansions for the green s functions of potential theory . by expressing the equations of fluid dynamics of a compressible media in terms of a velocity potential and a vector poisson equation \n , one may compute precise velocity boundary values in vortex and shock flow regions ( lamb 1932 ) by solving the appropriate poisson problem . \n radiation transport , and classical and quantum scattering , will be greatly facilitated through compact poisson formulations of the green s function for the 3d diffusion and helmholtz equations . \n precise coulomb and yukawa energies in the nuclear hamiltonian allow for a higher degree of precision in obtaining nuclear structure . \n the ultimate resolution of these analytical investigations will be efficient algorithmic implementations of these new schemes . \n we propose these methods to the three dimensional star community in hope that you may continue to enjoy significantly improved economical and precise boundary values for studies of analytical and numerical three dimensional stellar astrophysics . \n i would like to thank ernie kalnins , department of mathematics , university of waikato , new zealand , for pointing out the integration formula for legendre functions . \n i would also like to thank volker oberacker , department of physics and astronomy , vanderbilt university , for pointing out the green s function for the axisymmetric biharmonic equation in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind . \n i especially wish to thank dr . \n rau , department of physics and astronomy , louisiana state university , for many helpful comments and suggestions . \n i would also like to express my gratitude to everyone i had the honor of meeting at the 3d stars workshop , the scientific organizing committee and great appreciation to the editors of this proceedings , rob cavallo , stefan keller , and sylvain turcotte . \n i would also like to thank richard ward , david dearborn , john castor , john bradley , kem cook , douglas peters , pete eltgroth , and peter eggleton . \n this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s . \n department of energy , national nuclear security administration by the university of california , lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no . w-7405-eng-48 . \n the unit order negative one half degree legendre function of the second kind can be expressed as", "StartTimeOffset": 1830042436994, "RequestID": "99f3ab70f41f4364b2798e29b6235c87", "TotalTokens": 2386}
{"ContextTokens": 3333, "GeneratedTokens": 199, "SynthesizedBody": "that early - type galaxies form a well - defined color magnitude relation ( cmr ) was first recognized by @xcite . \n extensive studies by @xcite and @xcite compared the cmr of nine galaxy clusters and of field galaxies . \n they found them to be astonishingly similar . in combination with other studies comparing the cmr for e and s0 , within clusters , groups and the field @xcite a high degree of universality \n was shown for the relation . \n the cmr is typically explained by an increase of mean stellar metallicity with increasing galaxy mass as the dominant effect . \n the common underlying idea is that more massive galaxies have deeper potential wells , which can retain metal - enriched stellar ejecta more effectively and subsequently recycle the enriched gas into new stars . \n another factor could be a variable integrated galactic initial mass function , with more massive stars in more massive galaxies , and thus a more substantial enrichment ( e.g.  ) . \n an alternative explanation was given with a change of the mean age ( see e.g. @xcite , and some observational support for it in @xcite ) . \n the question of which explanation to favor is not totally settled yet due to the ambiguity introduced by the age - metallicity degeneracy . but \n data from clusters at higher redshift show that the cmr is in place ever since , favoring the mass - metallicity relation to be the dominant effect .    from early on \n , it was discussed whether the universality of the cmr also holds over the whole range of galaxy masses , i.e.  whether dwarf and giant early - type galaxies follow the same cmr . \n studies of different clusters show consistency with one common cmr for dwarfs and giants , albeit with a significant increase in the scatter at low luminosities ( @xcite for coma , @xcite for perseus , @xcite and for fornax , @xcite for antlia and for hydra i ) . \n more explicitely , @xcite stated that there is a common linear relation . \n but his fig . \n 3 might hint at a change of slope from high to low luminosities , similar to what @xcite suggested . \n interestingly , visual examination of the diagrams presented by most of the above - mentioned studies indicates consistency also with a change of slope \n yet linear relations were fitted in most cases ( see , however , @xcite ; see sect . \n 5 ) . in this letter \n we revisit the question of the universality of the cmr for dwarfs and giants . \n the sample is based on the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; @xcite ) . \n all early - type galaxies therein with a certain cluster member status and @xmath4 mag are taken into account , which is the same magnitude limit up to which the vcc was found to be complete . \n this translates into @xmath5 mag with our adopted distance modulus of m - m=31.09 mag ( d=16.5 mpc , @xcite ) . \n we treat uncertain classifications as in @xcite and exclude possible irregulars . \n seven further galaxies are exluded due to their low @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release five ( dr5 ) @xcite covers all but six early - type dwarf galaxies of the vcc . since the quality of sky level subtraction of the sdss pipeline is insufficient , we use sky - subtracted images as provided by @xcite , based on a careful subtraction method . \n the images were flux - calibrated and corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .    for each galaxy , we determined a \n petrosian semimajor axis \" ( @xcite , hereafter petrosian sma , @xmath9 ) , i.e. , we use ellipses instead of circles in the calculation of the petrosian radius ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the total flux in the @xmath10-band was measured within @xmath11 , yielding a value for the half - light semimajor axis , @xmath12 . \n this petrosian aperture still misses some flux , which is of particular relevance for the giant galaxies @xcite . \n the brightness and the half - light sma were corrected for this missing flux according to @xcite . \n axial ratio and position angle were then determined through an isophotal fit at @xmath13 . \n colors were measured within the elliptical @xmath10-band half - light aperture for each filter . \n errors were estimated from the @xmath6 and calibration uncertainties ( which we estimate to have a _ relative _ effect of 0.1 mag in each band , which is smaller than the absolute values given by sdss ) , as described in @xcite . \n our data constitute a very homogeneous set of measurements for galaxies in one cluster , obtained and reduced with the same instrument , setup , and software . \n from the five sdss filter bands we choose four representative colors : @xmath0 , mostly sensitive to age ; @xmath1 with the highest @xmath6 ; @xmath2 with the longest wavelength baseline at good @xmath6 ; and @xmath3 , mostly sensitive to metallicity . \n first of all , the impression one can get by examining just the _ black points _ in fig .  1 is that there is not one common linear relation from the faint to the bright galaxies . in all colors \n the overall shape appears more like `` s '' shaped . \n the brightest ( @xmath14 ) galaxies have almost constant color , i.e.  no correlation between color and brightness ; the very brightest galaxies show a larger scatter . \n these were reported before to be _ morphologically _ different from the other galaxies in more detailed studies of the inner light profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the remaining galaxies several descriptions seem to be plausible , ranging from just an offset between two relations with similar slopes up to a curved relation .    with the non - linear shape , it seems not very favorable to fit a straight line . \n this would not describe the data well , and there is no theoretical prediction what other function is expected . \n so at first , we want to make the overall shape more clearly visible , using continous , overlapping magnitude bins , in which mean and scatter are calculated . in fig . \n 1 these derived relations are shown with grey lines . \n the first impression is confirmed : one common linear relation for dwarfs and giants can not be seen . \n moreover , the white histograms showing the galaxy distributions in the bins are clearly peaked towards the bright and the faint end , while they are rather flat at intermediate luminosity . \n if the notion of two separate relations with an overlap is correct , this should become evident through an increased scatter about the relation around the intersection , relative to the photometric error . \n therefore we calculate the rms of the scatter around the mean in running bins ( clipping one time at 3@xmath15 ) and divide it by the rms of the photometric errors @xmath16 with color @xmath17 and mean color @xmath18 , averaging over the galaxies in the respective bin . here \n we exclude des with blue cores , since they are known to have different colors @xcite \n . this rms - ratio should be one if the scatter is only due to the measurement errors and larger than one if there is an intrinsic scatter . in fig .  1 we show the cmrs along with the rms - ratio @xmath19 .    indeed , the rms - ratio is enhanced between @xmath20 , indicating an intrinsically increased scatter , which could in principle be explained by a transition between two separate relations . \n but the change is steady . \n thus also alternative explanations , such as a more varied star formation history with decreasing galaxy mass , seem plausible  although the decrease in the scatter for the faintest dwarfs would still need to be explained .    one can argue about the significance of the rms - ratio increase for the brightest galaxies , since it is just a handful of them  nevertheless , this larger scatter might be related to the absence of a well - defined cmr at the brightest magnitudes . \n the numerical galaxy catalog of @xcite is based on a high resolution @xmath21-body simulation in a @xmath22cdm universe @xcite . \n the dark - halo merger trees of the @xmath21-body simulation are taken as input for a semi - analytical model ( sam ) of galaxy formation ( here a modified version of the mitaka model , @xcite ) . \n the sam models physical processes of galaxy formation and evolution such as gas radiative cooling , star formation , heating by supernova explosions ( supernova feedback ) , mergers of galaxies , population synthesis , and extinction by internal dust and intervening hi clouds . \n in particular , the model takes into account the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal after gas - rich mergers ( also for cases intermediate between a purely baryonic cloud and a baryonic cloud fully supported by surrounding dark matter as in ) . \n the gravitational well is shallower for the dwarf galaxies and thus they suffer a more substantial gas loss than giants . \n this process is not only important for the galaxy sizes , but also for their metal enrichment histories .    in the comparison of the cmr of the virgo galaxies with the sam ( fig . \n 2 ) , the shapes of the distributions are fairly similar , and the model cmr is indeed not well represented by a linear relation . in @xcite we presented an analogous comparison for the scaling relation of radius and brightness and found that the model qualitatively agrees with distribution of the galaxies in that diagram . both the cmr and the relation between size and brightness do not show a linear , nor one common behaviour for dwarfs and giants . \n nevertheless , in the framework of the sam both can be explained by the same physical processes , which govern @xmath22cdm structure formation , and thus both can be of cosmological origin ( see also @xcite ) .    beside the good agreement in the overall shape , an offset is observed . \n this offset could partly be due to uncertainties of the adopted synthetic stellar population model . \n vs. @xmath23 ( for which no transformations are needed ) the observed galaxies lie bluewards of the model ones with an smaller absolute offset than in @xmath24 vs. @xmath25 , but the scatter of the observed galaxies is larger due to the lower @xmath6 in the @xmath8-band . ] \n furthermore , the relative number of bright galaxies exceeds the observed one and the luminosity function is clearly different , which could possibly be explained with model input physics . \n in the literature , there is no consistent view of commonness or distinctness of the color magnitude relation of dwarf and giant early - type galaxies . \n some studies find a linear relation over the whole range of brightness , others find a change of slope . \n we studied the cmr of virgo cluster early - type galaxies , based on the wealth of sdss imaging data in multiple filter bands . \n our main result is that the dwarfs and giants do not follow one common _ linear _ relation . \n the appearance in the different colors , from @xmath0 to @xmath3 , is very similar , suggesting that age and metallicity go hand in hand : the cmr at shorter wavelengths is more sensitive to changes in age , while it is more sensitive to changes in metallicity at longer wavelengths . \n recent studies indeed claim that a combination of the effects of age , metallicity and also @xmath26-enhancement shape the cmr @xcite . \n the most direct comparison with other data is possible with @xcite , who studied early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the acs virgo cluster survey . in their fig . \n 123 they show the cmr in @xmath27 , using smaller apertures for the color measurements . \n for comparison we repeat the plot and indicate galaxies common to both samples with black dots in the symbols ( fig .  3 ) . \n we also show their fits ( to their data ) : two linear fits to a brighter and fainter subsample and one parabola for the whole sample . \n while a qualitatively good agreement is found , the small offset to bluer colors of our data is likely explained by a combination of the effect of different apertures , the atmosphere , and different physical filters . while we agree with @xcite that the cmr is not linear over the whole range , the faint dwarfs in our sample , which they do not reach ( cf . \n 3 ) , do not lie on the extrapolation of their parabolic fit , but rather define an overall `` s''-like shape . \n furthermore , some of the galaxies that might drag their cmr to the blue side , at their faint end , display blue cores from recent star formation activity @xcite , which we excluded . \n we found an increase of the scatter about the cmr at intermediate brightness , visible in fig .  1 through a broadening of the color distributions within the respective magnitude bins . \n this confirms the result that dwarfs and giants do _ not _ share one common _ linear _ cmr . for the brighter and fainter galaxies \n the scatter is closer to the photometric errors . \n @xcite concluded that the cmr is a result of two more fundamental relations : the faber - jackson relation and a relation between color and velocity dispersion . \n given the slope change of the faber - jackson relation from giants to dwarfs a change of slope of the cmr would actually be expected . \n it is important to emphasize that the curved shape of the cmr , and the possible existence of two adjacent relations does _ not _ necessarily imply different formation scenarios of dwarfs and giants . \n this is in accordance with previous claims of no distinction between them ( ) . instead , from the good qualitative agreement of the observed cmr shape with a semi - analytic model , \n we conclude that a common origin within the framework of @xmath22cdm structure formation appears plausible for both giant _ and _ dwarf early types . \n a more detailed multiparameter comparison of dwarfs and giants will be communicated in a forthcoming paper . \n we thank masahiro nagashima for helpful advice , and the referee for useful comments . we are supported within the framework of the excellence initiative by the german research foundation ( dfg ) through the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics ( grant number gsc 129/1 ) . \n the study is based on sdss ( http://www.sdss.org/ ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1843819260382, "RequestID": "64f7907b2ac249e5a0019ce97db2bce1", "TotalTokens": 3532}
{"ContextTokens": 3512, "GeneratedTokens": 166, "SynthesizedBody": "the aim of this study is to analyze the structure of the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid ( within a depth of a few tens of lennard jones units ) . \n our lennard jones liquid may be compared to a model of glass for which the glass transition would have been obtained instantaneously from the liquid . \n different studies deal with the analysis of glass surface.they mainly concern the chemical nature of the surface . in the case of silicate and silica glasses , \n there are different numerical models , see for that the following references @xcite ; these previous references studied the structure , attack of water and the presence of free oxygen atoms on the surface of silicate glasses ( with dangling bonds , as there are lacking hydrogens ) as well as the variation of composition at the surface . \n but very few numerical study of the surface of simple models of liquids or glasses have been made up to now @xcite . \n stallons and iglesia @xcite studied the free surface of a simple model of silica glass using the stillinger weber potential and found that the surface of their glasses was less dense than the bulk . \n we deal here with the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid . here \n the action of the atmosphere and the presence or not of dangling bonds have not been studied . \n we are interested in the change in the structure of the free surface of a simple model of frozen liquid ( lennard jones liquid ) without any external action , only the fact that there are no periodic boundary conditions in one direction : the free surface . after obtaining the lennard jones structure with a free surface by classical molecular dynamics computation \n , we analyzed the free surface structure with the calculations of structure factors corresponding to different depths within the sample . \n this analysis is completed by the computation of the density as a function of depth within the sample and by computation during melting , of the spatial correlation function in the bulk and at the surface .    the computational method used for the sample preparation as for the calculation of the structure factor curves \n are presented in section ii . \n section iii shows the results which are discussed . and \n finally , section iv is the conclusion . \n we used the classical molecular dynamics to compute a lennard jones liquid . \n the potential was a lennard jones 6:12 potential cut at a distance 2.5 lennard jones units . \n we began the simulation with a fcc structure which was melt in 2.5@xmath0 ( 250 molecular dynamics - md- steps ) . \n this is the time needed to obtain total melting ( i.e. no further melting ) . \n the computation was done out of equilibrium : i.e. due to the free surface we could not impose a nvt or npt equilibrium during melting . \n we chose an instantaneous cooling ( in 1 md step ) in order to prevent the sample from shearing phenomena which would rearrange the structure even at its surface . \n thus our sample is just a frozen lennard jones liquid . \n the sample has periodic boundary conditions in all directions except on two free surfaces on the bottom and on the top of it . as the aim of this study is the analysis of the free surface of lennard jones frozen liquids , we had to add these two free surfaces surrounded by vacuum . \n the initial box ( not taking into account the boundary conditions ) has a dimension of @xmath1 lennard jones ( lj ) units corresponding to 320000 lj particles .    in order to analyze only the action of the free surface on the corresponding structure factors \n , we had to cut the initial box containing the lj frozen liquid into two , according to its depth . \n unless , there would be action of the two free surfaces on the bottom and on the top of the simulated lj frozen liquid , and the resulting structure factor curves would be to difficult to analyze . \n furthermore it would not be a physical model of the surface of frozen liquids . \n the fact that we have a free surface before having melt and frozen the sample allows us to obtain a free relaxed surface on the top of the bulk of the lennard jones frozen liquid . \n we used a similar calculation as in reference @xcite to obtain the structure factor the difference is that the domain of computation is limited by the upper surface surrounded by vacuum and a given depth within the numerical sample . \n indeed , the wave vector may be written : @xmath2 the calculation of the structure factor curves is the following : @xmath3\\exp i { \\bf q}. { \\bf r}| ^2\\ ] ] where @xmath4 comes from the replacement of the integral by discrete sum over the lj particles , @xmath5 is the scattering volume ( in order to normalize all different results depending on the analyzed depth ) . \n @xmath6 is the concentration of the sample which we have calculated as function of the depth of the sample . \n this last feature ensures that @xmath7 tends to zero when @xmath8 tends to zero . \n then we introduce a double sum to expand the square , and , assuming isotropy in the plane ( but not in the depth of the sample ) , we average over all directions of @xmath8 to get : @xmath9+c^2 ) x \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 then , transforming the double sum into a sum over all possible values for the distance @xmath11 and separating the @xmath12 contribution from the others , we obtain : @xmath13 ) \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the mean number of lj particles at a distance @xmath11 of a given lj particle ( pair correlation function ) and where @xmath15 is the same quantity for a density equal to 1 . \n figure 1 exhibits the typical structure factor for different depths in lj units . at this scale \n it is not possible to make any difference between the curves . anyway , let us remark that the curves are typical of a glassy material with several peaks . \n the first peak located at approximately at @xmath16 i.e. at a distance equal approximately to 3 lj units . \n this result shows that there is , in our lennard jones frozen liquid , a short range order up to 3 lj units . \n however , the intensities of the structure factors have been normalized by the analyzed volume ( see section ii.b for details concerning this normalization ) . \n this last feature explains that we have no vertical shift for different structure factors . \n figure 2 presents a zoom of the previous curves ( figure 1 ) for @xmath17 lj units@xmath18 . \n one may see that there is a difference for the curve corresponding to a depth of 5 lj units compared to the others . \n figure 3 is also a zoom of the curves presented in figure 1 but for a different location than figure 2 , here @xmath19 lj units@xmath18 . \n one may see again that the curve corresponding to the depth equal to 5 lj units is different from the others .    finally , and in order to be able to understand our computed structure factor curves we plotted the number of lj particles as a function of the depth from the free surface of the sample ( see figure 4 ) . \n the numerical simulation box begins at height @xmath20 lj units but as explained in section ii , we cut the sample into two , so the bottom of the sample corresponds to @xmath21 lj units and the free surface of the sample to @xmath22 lj units . \n figure 5 exhibits the distribution of the lj particles whose center of mass is contained in the slice for @xmath23 . \n this may be compared to figure 6 which is the distribution of the centers of mass of the lj particles for @xmath24 , i.e. for the same width following @xmath25 . \n the fact that there are zones without particles in figure 6 is explained by the width of the analyzed slice : it is less than 1 lj unit . in figure 5 , the void zones are much larger , as expected from the variation of the number of particles presented in figure 4 . \n what can be observed is that distribution is rather homogeneous . in order to go further in this analysis , we computed the two points correlation function : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of particles in the slice and @xmath28 is the number of particles at distance @xmath11 from another particle . \n we computed the evolution of this two points correlation function as a function of computation times of the sample structure , during melting . \n we chose a depth of this slice equal to 0.3 because it corresponds to the depth where the surface has a lower density . \n although the depth of the slice is only 0.3 lj particles , we chose the slices at the surface and in the bulk so that we get half of a fcc elementary cell in the slice at the beginning of computation \n . figures 7-a ( left and right ) are the correlation functions at the beginning of computation ( for the fcc structure ) at the very surface and in the bulk . \n one may see a peaked distribution function . \n this is due to the crystalline structure of the fcc initial distribution . \n fig.7-b,7-c and 7d correspond respectively to 100 md time steps , 200 md time steps and 250 md time steps ( corresponding to the frozen liquid ) . \n we can observe that the right and left figures 7 are very similar and we will discuss the small differences between bulk and surface later in the discussion.the correlation function ( for times t=100 md and 200 md time steps ) becomes similar to a random packing except that there are one peak at a distance equal to 1 lj units . \n this means that there is short range correlation during melting and that aggregates most likely remain during melting . \n this peak almost disappears when the liquid is frozen for 250 md time steps . \n fig.7d shows that there is no more a short range correlation and that the lj particles are more equally distributed over the slice .    and \n finally , figure 8 is the plot of the number of particles per lj unit volume for a slice of depth 0.3 lj units at the very surface and in the bulk . \n we observed that the density of our lj frozen liquid near the surface is lower only at the very surface for a depth included between @xmath29 lj units . \n there is an increasing density for @xmath30 lj units and this is much less than the correlation length of about 3 lj units ( see above ) \n . therefore the mean density for a depth of @xmath31 lj units is lower than for larger depths for which the low density of the free surface is negligible by averaging the density over the volume . \n this explains that we have no differences between the structure factors for lower depths , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 lj units and very small differences for @xmath34 lj units . \n we cut the sample in the @xmath35 direction and checked that the density did not vary at @xmath36 and at @xmath37 compared to the bulk . \n to better understand the origin of these small differences it is interesting to compare the evolution of the density at the very surface and in the bulk during melting . \n the evolution of the density within the bulk and at the very surface , represented in figure 8 , shows that there is not a large difference between the two curves . \n this means that the lj particles belonging to the surface have sufficient connections with other particles in the bulk and within the surface to prevent them to lower the density at the very surface and to prevent them from evaporation . \n one can observe that in the bulk , the density decreases during the first md computation steps and remains constant for all others computation times . on the other hand \n , there is another lowering of density of the upper surface during the last freezing step . \n considering now the two points correlation function , and comparing the left curves of figure 7 ( at the very surface ) and right curves ( in the bulk ) , we can observe a few differences . \n first in figure 7b , there are regular oscillations for 100md time steps in the figure corresponding to the bulk , indicating that correlations between particles in the bulk remains on a larger time scale than at the very surface ; these last disappear for 200 md time . in figure 7d \n , one can observe that at the end of melting , there are more particles at shorter distances in the bulk than at the very surface . \n this is well evidenced in figures 5 and 6 . \n using data of figures 5 and 6 , we computed the mean distance between the particles eliminating the void zones ( i.e. : distances larger than 1.5 ) . \n we obtained almost the same mean distance for the bulk and for the surface of about 1.1 lj unit . \n the particles stop to move during melting when they reach a mean distance between particle of 1.1 lj unit which is the maximum of the attractive part of the lj potential ( if we eliminate the void zones ) . \n this means that the arrangement of particles are almost the same than in the bulk , but that there is a kind of `` roughness '' at the very surface due to large void zones . \n we can say that the free surface of a lj frozen liquid has also surface defects ( i.e. the surface is less dense as shown in figure 4 and as deduced from figures 2 and 3 ) . \n there are some larger `` voids '' at the very surface and a few particles rising above the mean surface . but \n these effects concern only the region very next to the surface ( for a depth lower than 1 lj unit ) . \n the effect of the free surface induce changes in the structure only for the first lj particles layer . \n moreover , the bulk conserves aggregates during melting while the surface loses this order more rapidly ( in figure 7 , the peak at abscissa 1 is smaller for the surface for 100md and 200md than for the bulk ) .    as a conclusion \n , the shape of the lj potential leads to a surface where the density is of course lower because of contact with vacuum . \n the surface has a structure of homogeneously distributed particles which interaction is the largest attractive possible with the lj potential surrounded by void zones : the surface is rough . \n we computed the structure factors as a function of the depth near the surface of a lennard jones frozen liquid . \n the results are that very close to the surface the density of the numerical frozen liquid is lower . \n this is compared with the analysis of the density as a function of depth into the numerical frozen liquid and explains the shift toward lower @xmath38 of the structure factor curves for lower depths . \n our lennard jones frozen liquid is less dense near its surface which means that the set up of the sample itself , i.e. with a free surface leads to a rearrangement of the lj particles without any external action ( like the attack of water on real glasses ) . \n the interesting conclusion of our work is that even in a lennard jones frozen liquid ( i.e. without any action of water : presence of atmosphere or without any presence of dangling bonds ) the density and structure modification induced by the free surface only concern a very small depth of the sample ( smaller than 1 lj unit ) . during melting in the lj fcc then lj liquid , the lj particle rearrange to become very rapidly a quasi two dimensional amorphous material on the surface .", "StartTimeOffset": 1850844014077, "RequestID": "f228e245d66346f5941744a36dd5678e", "TotalTokens": 3678}

{"ContextTokens": 3383, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "dust is common in high redshift ( @xmath0=46 ) quasars ( omont et al . 2001 , priddey & mcmahon 2001 ) , apparently implying that dust is widespread by this epoch . \n this presents a puzzle : how can so much dust be formed in the short time available ? \n wmap cosmology ( spergel et al . 2003 ) puts the age of the universe at z=6 to be only 0.95  gyr , and the age of first reionization ( and so the first stars ) at an age of @xmath10.2  gyr ( z@xmath120 ) . in our galaxy \n the primary source of dust lies in the winds of red giant stars , specifically asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . \n only stars with masses greater than 2  @xmath2 can reach the agb in the less than @xmath11  gyr available . \n another source of dust is thus required . \n normally this extra source is taken to be type  1 ( massive star ) supernovae . \n recent scuba results ( dunne et al . 2003 ) show that the 300  year old type  1 supernova remnant ( snr ) cas  a is rich in dust , lending credence to this picture . \n however , the possible destruction of snr formed dust in their shocks may not be fully resovled . here \n we point out another , seemingly inevitable , path for dust formation up to at least z=6 : _ quasar winds_.    the fate of outflowing broad emission line ( bel ) quasar gas constantly being ejected from quasars had previously not been considered . \n we examined that fate ( elvis , marengo & karovska 2002 ) in a manner that applies to any model in which the bel clouds move outward . \n we find that dust creation is a natural consequence . \n outflowing winds of highly ionized material are common in quasars [ see arav , shlosman & weymann ( eds ) 1997 ] . \n the gas emitting the prominent broad emission lines ( bels ) may well participate in these winds . \n the bels , which produce e.g. ly@xmath3 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , civ , nv ( e.g. krolik 1999 ) are doppler broadened to a few percent of the speed of light ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 ) . \n the gas producing these lines lies at temperatures of 10@xmath7  k and at the strikingly high densities of 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9  @xmath10 ( osterbrock 1989 ) . \n these densities are comparable to chromospheric values ( allen 1975 , korista 1999 ) . \n the kinematics of this bel gas - infalling , bound , or outflowing - is not well established ( peterson 1997 ) . moreover , \n the issue of how to prevent this high density gas from dispersing has been problematic . \n pressure confinement by a hotter surrounding medium would seem straightforward and a 2-phase medium is even predicted for gas irradiated by a hard quasar - like continuum ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) . \n however this model appeared to suffer unsurmountable problems ( mathews 1986 ) . \n most obviously the any bel ` clouds ' would be ripped apart by shear forces in less than one orbital time . as a result \n this model was abandoned . \n a bel wind has advantages . \n elvis ( 2000 ) showed how such a wind can include the bel gas as a cool phase in pressure equilibrium the warmer ( 10@xmath11  k ) wind medium . with this model \n a large number of other puzzling features of quasar phenomenology seem to fall into place . \n a wind in which both bel gas and the hotter confining gas are co - moving solves the cloud survival problem , and if the wind is non - spherical also solves the problem of the confining medium being thomson thick , which can not be the case as rapid x - ray variability is essentially universal in agns . \n but a wind requires us to ask what happens to the gas as it flows outward . in any outflow model with the bel region initially in pressure equilibrium with a surrounding warmer medium , the divergence of the outflowing warm wind ( even if only at the sound speed of the warm confining medium , @xmath1100  km  s@xmath6 ) will rapidly take the system out of pressure balance . \n the bel clouds will then begin to expand , limited by their sound speed ( initially @xmath110  km  s@xmath6 ) , and will cool to below 1000  k , at which temperatures dust will form _ if _ the pressure is still sufficiently high . could quasar bel gas then be the source of quasar dust at high redshift ? \n a full treatment of dust formation requires coupling the dust forming medium hydrodynamics with the full set of dust condensation chemistry equations ( sedlmayr 1997 ) . \n such an exercise is limited by our knowledge of the highly non - linear dust condensation chemical paths , and by the uncertainties related to the role of non - equilibrium chemistry . \n we therefore use a simple comparison between agn and cool star atmospheres , to derive reasonable estimates for the conditions of dust formation in the bel clouds .    the general scenario for dust formation \n is based on the concept of the `` dust formation window '' . \n effective dust condensation seems to take place whenever a chemically enriched medium has a sufficiently low temperature , and a large enough density , to allow dust grain condensation . \n the amount of dust produced , the chemical composition and the final size of the grains , depend on the length of time over which the conditions remain favorable . \n figure  1 shows the dust formation window in pressure - temperature space , for the chemical species that lead to the formation of dust in an o - rich cool star circumstellar envelope . \n the thin solid lines mark the phase transition region below which the most important dust precursor molecules are formed . \n the hatched area is the dust forming region in the circumstellar envelope of a cool giant star . \n the region is limited on the right by the thermodynamical path of a static outflowing wind typical for an agb star . \n the left side is obtained by increasing the maximum pressure in the envelope by a factor 100 , as during the propagation of pulsational shocks in the atmospheres of long period variables . \n dust formation in the envelopes of evolved giants occurs in the region between the two tracks , below the phase transition lines for each chemical species . \n a closely similar diagram can be drawn for c - rich gas . \n figure  1 shows adiabats for bel gas , assuming @xmath12 . \n clearly they pass through the dust formation window for plausible initial densities . \n the bel gas enters the dust formation window after expanding by a factor of three . \n this process resembles that which makes smoke in terrestrial settings . \n quasars are then dusty because they themselves create dust which , since carbon may be overabundant in quasars , may resemble soot . \n hence we called them ` smoking quasars ' . \n if quasar winds are driven by line radiation then the characteristic instability of such winds suggests that shocks may be common . in stars with ` p  cygni ' profiles ( ob stars and wolf - rayet stars ) such winds produce highly velocity - structured opacity ( e.g. stahl et al . \n , 1993 , owocki 2001 ) . \n quasars show similar structures ( turnshek 1988 ) , and are suggested by hydrodynamic modeling ( proga 2001 ) . in agb star \n winds these intermittent pressure enhancements boost dust production ( figure  1 ) , starting a nonlinear `` avalanche '' effect , as observed in miras and other long period variables ( hffner 1999 ) . \n this suggests that pressure fluctuations could greatly enhance the quasar dust creation rate . \n can the dust survive the radiation field from the quasar bh ? \n surprisingly a quasar wind provides a _ more benign _ environment for dust than an agb star wind , despite the quasar luminosity being much higher than the @xmath13  l@xmath14 luminosity of a typical giant star . \n the large flux of energetic photons from the quasar continuum might have overheated the newborn dust grains above their sublimation temperature , delaying the occurence of dust condensation , perhaps until it becomes impossible due to the ever decreasing gas density . \n however , due to the much larger geometrical dilution in quasars , the radiative flux reaching the bel clouds interior is actually lower than the stellar flux in the dust forming region of the giant s wind . for a quasar of luminosity @xmath15 \n erg s@xmath6 the flux density 3  pc from the quasar center is @xmath16  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath6 . \n this is at least one order of magnitude less than the @xmath18  erg  @xmath17  s@xmath6 in the stellar case . \n so the dust formation window of the bel clouds is determined by the polytropic expansion of the clouds gas , as we have assumed , and not by radiative transfer , as in the case of circumstellar envelopes ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) . \n other destruction mechanisms , such as dust sputtering by electrons and ions , or chemical sputtering , are not very effective at the rather low ( @xmath19  k ) kinetic temperature of the cloud medium . \n kinetic sputtering by the surrounding medium becomes effective ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) only for @xmath20  k. by the time the bel clouds start forming dust , they will be surrounded by a warm medium having a temperature @xmath21  k , which is already low enough to prevent their immediate destruction by sputtering . \n the total amount of dust that is formed , however , depends on the time spent by the clouds in the region favorable to grain condensation and growth . \n this is given by the cloud expansion time - scale @xmath22  yr , where @xmath23  km s@xmath6 is the initial sound speed of the cloud and @xmath24  cm ( peterson 1997 ) their initial average size . \n this timescale is comparable with the time spent by circumstellar grains in the region where dust growth is most active , suggesting that the efficiency in dust production of bel region and late type giant winds may be similar . \n the most luminous quasars , in which the highest dust masses are found ( omont et al . \n 2001 ) , have luminosities over 10@xmath25erg  s@xmath6 and so may have mass loss rates @xmath2610  m@xmath27  yr@xmath6 . \n assuming the same dust fraction as in agb stars gives @xmath110@xmath28  m@xmath27 of dust over a nominal 10@xmath29  yr lifetime . \n this approaches the amounts detected but is still short by about an order - of - magnitude . \n however , super - solar abundances are common in high redshift quasars , certainly in carbon ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) , providing a higher density of raw material for the formation of precursor molecules . \n dust condensation is highly nonlinear ( frenklach & feigelson 1989 ) , the amount of dust formed in any particular quasar is hard to predict , but the dependence on abundance is likely to be an @xmath30 process initially , allowing for more dust to be produced than in our simple estimate . as a result \n the infrared emission of quasars may not require the normally assumed large associated burst of star formation ( sanders et al . 1988 ) . \n quasar winds provide an economical explanation for high z dust . \n dust at z@xmath14 is observed primarily from observations of quasars and of sub - mm sources . \n if dust is everywhere and quasars illuminate this pre - existing dust then the total dust mass at z=4 is large . \n if the only dust at high z is manufactured in quasars , then far less dust is implied than if quasars simply illuminate pre - existing dust , which would then need to be distributed among all high  z galaxies , active or not . \n the metals in the dust must , of course , have been created by an earlier generation of massive stars , that go supernova quickly . to establish high quasar bel abundances , \n the star formation must be local to the quasar nucleus , again suggesting a more limited amount of high z star formation . \n high  z counterparts to sub - mm scuba sources seem to imply enormous starbursts , but conclusively distinguishing between a starburst and a quasar as the root power source heating the dust seen by scuba is extraordinarily difficult , leaving open the quasar option .    in this picture dust can be formed as soon as quasars form . \n quasar winds ( @xmath311000  km  s@xmath6 ) readily exceed the escape velocity from a galaxy ( v@xmath32200  km  s@xmath6 ) , or even a rich cluster of galaxies ( v@xmath321000  km  s@xmath6 ) . hence the dust they produce will be ejected into the intergalactic medium . \n dust is an important catalyst of star formation , as dust provides both shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation and an efficient cooling path for the surrounding medium . \n the early creation of dust by quasars may then be important for seeding star formation at slightly later times . \n in summary , dust will inevitably be created from the free expansion of quasar broad emission line clouds in an outflowing wind . \n the association of dust with quasars is not then _ necessarily _ linked with intense star formation around quasars , but may be a consequence of the quasar activity itself . \n the creation of dust in quasar winds may solve the puzzle of where the very first dust comes from , and in doing so suggests an unexpected role for quasars in cosmology .", "StartTimeOffset": 1870335412006, "RequestID": "6ed9d943a6f042a8aa37b9d57cb71f54", "TotalTokens": 3520}

like ( see figure [ fig : photo ] ) and we refer to it as a `` lake star '' . \n these compelling features have been described qualitatively a number of times ( e.g.  @xcite ) but work on the formation process itself has been solely heuristic . \n knight  @xcite outlines a number of the physical ideas relevant to the process , but does not translate them into a predictive framework to model field observations . \n knight s main idea is that locations with faster flow rates melt preferentially , leading to even faster flow rates and therefore to an instability that results in fingers . \n this idea has features that resemble those of many other instabilities such as , for example , those observed during the growth of binary alloys @xcite , in flow of water through a rigid hot porous media @xcite , or in more complex geomorphological settings @xcite , and we structure our model accordingly .    katsaros  @xcite and woodcock  @xcite attribute the holes from which the stars emanate and the patterns themselves to thermal convection patterns within the lake , but do not measure or calculate their nature . \n however , often the holes do not exhibit a characteristic distance between them but rather form from protrusions ( e.g. sticks that poke through the ice surface )  @xcite and stars follow thereby ruling out a convective mechanism as being necessary to explain the phenomena . \n the paucity of literature on this topic provides little more than speculation regarding the puncturing mechanism but lake stars are observed in all of these circumstances . \n therefore , while hole formation is necessary for lake star formation , its origin does not control the mechanism of pattern formation , which is the focus of the present work . \n the water level in the hole is higher than that in the wet snow  slush \n layer @xcite and hence we treat this warm waterc . ] region as having a constant height above the ice or equivalently a constant pressure head , which drives flow of water through the slush layer , which we treat as a darcy flow of water at @xmath0c . \n we model the temperature field within the liquid region with an advection - diffusion equation and impose an appropriate ( _ stefan _ ) condition for energy conservation at the water - slush interface . \n the water is everywhere incompressible . \n finally , the model is closed with an outer boundary condition at which the pressure head is assumed known . \n although we lack _ in - situ _ pressure measurements , circular water - saturated regions ( a few meters in radius ) are observed around the lake stars . \n hence , we assume that the differential pressure head falls to zero somewhere in the vicinity of this circular boundary . \n the actual boundary at which the differential pressure head is zero is not likely to be completely uniform ( as in figure 4 of knight  @xcite ) but treating it as uniform is a good approximation in the linear regime of our analysis . \n finally , we treat the flow as two - dimensional . \n thus , although the water in direct contact with ice must be at @xmath0c , we consider the depth - averaged temperature , which is above freezing . additionally , the decreasing pressure head in the radial direction must be accompanied by a corresponding drop in water level . \n therefore , although the driving force is more accurately described as deriving from an axisymmetric gravity current , the front whose stability we assess is controlled by the same essential physical processes that we model herein . \n our analysis could be extended to account for these three - dimensional effects . \n the system is characterized by the temperature @xmath1 , a darcy fluid velocity @xmath2 , pressure @xmath3 , and an evolving liquid - slush interface @xmath4 . \n the liquid properties are @xmath5 ( thermal diffusivity ) , @xmath6 ( specific heat at constant pressure ) and @xmath7 ( dynamic viscosity ) and the slush properties are @xmath8 ( permeability ) , @xmath9 ( solid fraction ) and @xmath10 ( latent heat ) . \n we non - dimensionalized the equations of motion by scaling the length , temperature , pressure and velocity with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . \n thus , our model consists of the following system of dimensionless equations :    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    with boundary conditions    @xmath18    and @xmath19 where ( [ temp1n ] ) describes the temperature evolution in the liquid , ( [ pres2n ] ) and ( [ continuityn ] ) describe mass conservation with a darcy flow ( [ darcyn ] ) in the slush , ( [ stefann ] ) is the stefan condition , and ( [ temp_bcn ] ) and ( [ pres_bcn ] ) are the temperature and pressure boundary conditions , respectively ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] ) . \n note that ( [ pres1n ] ) and ( [ continuityn ] ) can both be satisfied since the liquid region has an effectively infinite permeability . \n the dimensionless parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the system are given by @xmath22 which describe an inverse peclet number and a stefan number respectively . because the liquid must be less than or equal to @xmath23c \n , we make the conservative estimates that @xmath24c , @xmath25 , and use the fact that @xmath26c from which we see @xmath27 . using @xmath28 , and the field observations of knight  @xcite to constrain @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath31 ) , we find that @xmath32 . \n we therefore employ the quasi - stationary ( @xmath33 ) and large peclet number ( @xmath34 ) approximations , and hence equations ( [ temp1n ] ) - ( [ pres_bcn ] ) are easily solved for a purely radial flow with cylindrical symmetry ( no @xmath35 dependence ) and circular liquid - slush interface . \n this ( boundary layer ) solution is    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where equation ( [ bla ] ) has an approximate implicit solution for @xmath40 given by @xmath41    we perform a linear stability analysis around this quasi - steady cylindrically symmetrical flow . \n proceeding in the usual way , we allow for scaled perturbations in @xmath42 and @xmath4 with scaled wavenumber @xmath43 , non - dimensional growth rate @xmath44 , and amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . keeping only terms linear in @xmath20 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 , we solve ( [ pres2n ] ) subject to ( [ pres_bcn ] ) , substitute into ( [ u_matchn ] ) and satisfy ( [ continuityn ] ) and ( [ temp1n ] ) . \n this gives the non - dimensional growth rate ( @xmath44 ) as a function of scaled wave number ( @xmath48 ) :    @xmath49    equation ( [ stability ] ) can be approximated in @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 . \n the stability curve ( [ stability ] ) and the approximation ( [ stability_2 ] ) are plotted in figure [ fig : stability_curve ] . \n the essential features of ( [ stability ] ) are a maximum in the range @xmath53 , zero growth rate at @xmath54 and a linear increase in stability with @xmath48 for large @xmath48 . \n the long - wavelength cut - off is typical of systems with a peclet number , here with the added effect of latent heat embodied in the stefan number . \n this demonstrates the competition between the advection and diffusion of heat and momentum ( in a harmonic pressure field ) ; the former driving the instability and the latter limiting its extent . \n the maximum growth rate occurs at approximately @xmath55 with ( non - dimensional ) growth rate @xmath56    translating ( [ stability_kap ] ) and ( [ stability_sap ] ) back into dimensional quantities , we find that the most unstable mode has angular size given by @xmath57 and has growth rate given by @xmath58 \n field observations of lake stars can not be _ controlled_. a reasonable estmate for @xmath11 is the radius of the wetted ( snow ) region around the lake stars , and observations  @xcite bound the value as @xmath59 . \n this is simply because if there were significant excess pressure at this point then the wetting front would have advanced further . \n however , it is also possible that the effective value of @xmath11 , say @xmath60 , is less than this either because the wetted radius is smaller earlier in the star formation process or because the ambient pressure level is reached at smaller radii . here , we take @xmath40 to be the radius of the roughly circular liquid - filled region at the center of the lake star ( @xmath61 ) as the best approximation during the initial stages of star formation ( see figure [ fig : obs_schem ] ) . \n field observations show that @xmath62 ,  @xcite and hence @xmath63 . \n we note that equations ( [ stability_deg ] ) and ( [ stability_ap ] ) are more sensitive to @xmath64 than @xmath40 or @xmath11 independently may also be interpreted as the radius of the lake star ( @xmath65 ) . \n field observations show @xmath66  @xcite and hence @xmath67 . ] . with this interpretation of @xmath11 \n we find a reasonable estimate of @xmath29 as @xmath68 . \n using these parameter values , the most unstable mode should have wavelength between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . letting the number of branches \n be @xmath71 , then @xmath72 and we clearly encompass the observed values for lake stars ( @xmath73 ) , but note that values ( @xmath74 ) are never seen in the field .    despite the dearth of field observations , \n many qualitative features embolden our interpretation . \n for example , the stars with larger values of @xmath75 have a larger number of branches . \n moreover , for any value of @xmath75 , our analysis predicts an increase in @xmath76 with @xmath11 and @xmath29 . \n indeed , @xmath29 increases with @xmath13 ( higher water height within the slush layer ) and @xmath8 ( less well - packed snow ) . \n therefore , we ascribe some of the variability among field observations to variations in these quantities ( which have not been measured in the field ) and the remainder to nonlinear effects . because the dendritic arms are observed long after onset and are far from small perturbations to a radially symmetric pattern , as one might see in the initial stages of the saffman - taylor instability , the process involves non - linear cooperative phenomena . \n hence , our model should only approximately agree with observations . although a rigorous non - linear analysis of the long term star evolution process ( e.g.  @xcite ) may more closely mirror field observations , the present state of the latter does not warrant that level of detail . instead , we examine the model physics through simple proof of concept experimentation described presently . \n a 30 cm diameter circular plate is maintained below freezing ( @xmath77c ) , and on top of this we place a 0.5 to 1 cm deep layer of slush through which we flow @xmath78c water . \n given the technical difficulties associated with its production , the grain size , and hence the permeability , of the slush layer , is not a controlled variable . \n this fact influences our results quantitatively . in fourteen runs we varied the initial size of the water - filled central hole ( @xmath40 ) , that of the circular slush layer ( @xmath11 ) , and the flow rate ( @xmath79 ) , which determines @xmath29 . \n the flow rate is adjusted manually so that the water level ( @xmath80 ) in the central hole remains constant . ) . \n it is significantly more difficult to prepare a uniform permeability sample with a circular hole initially present ; these runs are therefore more difficult to interpret . ] fingering is observed in every experimental run and \n hence we conclude that fingers are a robust feature of the system \n . two distinct types of fingering are observed : small - scale fingering ( see figure [ fig : fingers ] ) that forms early in an experimental run , and larger channel - like fingers ( see figure [ fig : channels ] ) that are ubiquitous at later times and often extend from the central hole to the outer edge of the slush . \n since the channel - like fingers provide a direct path for water to flow , effectively _ shorting _ darcy flow within the slush , their subsequent dynamics are not directly analogous to those in natural lake stars . \n however , in _ all _ runs , the initial small - scale fingers have the characteristics of lake stars and hence we focus upon them . we note that because the larger channel - like fingers emerge out of small - scale fingers , they likely represent the non - linear growth of the linear modes of instability , a topic left for future study . \n finally , we measure the distance between fingers ( @xmath81 ) , so that for each experiment we can calculate @xmath82 , @xmath83 , from equation ( [ stability_deg ] ) , and @xmath84 , and we can thereby compare experiment , theory and field observations .    in figure [ \n fig : comp ] we plot @xmath85 versus @xmath86 for the various field observations for which we have estimates of parameters , the laboratory experiments described above , and the model [ equation ( [ stability_deg ] ) ] . \n there is a large amount of scatter in both the experimental and observational data and the data does not lie on the one - to - one curve predicted by the model . \n however , the experiments are meant to demonstrate the features of the model predictions , and the results have the correct qualitative trend ( having a best - fit slope of 0.34 ) \n . we also attempt to find trends in the experimental data not represented by the model by comparing @xmath87 vs. various combinations of control parameters ( @xmath88 ) including @xmath11 , @xmath40 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . \n for all plots of @xmath93 vs. @xmath94 , our model predicts a zero slope ( and y - intercept of 1 ) . a non - random dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath94 would point to failure of some part of our model . \n thus , to test the validity of our model , we perform significance tests on all non - flagged data with the null hypothesis being a non - zero slope . in all cases , \n the null hypothesis is accepted ( not rejected ) at the 95% confidence level . \n thus , although the agreement is far from perfect , the simple model captures all of the significant trends in the experimental data . \n by generalizing and quantifying the heuristic ideas of knight  @xcite , we have constructed a theory that is able to explain the radiating finger - like patterns on lake ice that we call lake stars . \n the model yields a prediction for the wavelength of the most unstable mode as a function of various physical parameters that agrees with field observations . \n proof of concept experiments revealed the robustness of the fingering pattern , and to leading order the results also agree with the model . \n there is substantial scatter in the data , and the overall comparison between field observations , model and experiment demonstrates the need for a comprehensive measurement program and a fully nonlinear theory which will yield better quantitative comparisons . \n however , the general predictions of our theory capture the leading order features of the system . \n we thank k. bradley and j. a. whitehead for laboratory and facilities support . \n this research , which began at the geophysical fluid dynamics summer program at the woods hole oceanographic institution , was partially funded by national science foundation ( nsf ) grant oce0325296 , nsf graduate fellowship ( vct ) , nsf grant opp0440841 ( jsw ) , and department of energy grant de -

{"ContextTokens": 3144, "GeneratedTokens": 175, "SynthesizedBody": "a major source of strong gravitational wave ( gw ) signals for the future space - based gw detector lisa @xcite will be the inspiral and ring - down of merging supermassive black - holes ( smbhs ) at cosmological distances ( e.g @xcite . ) the primary sensitive frequency band for lisa is 0.00010.1hz and the most abundant smbh mergers in this range will have component masses in the @xmath2 range . \n inspirals can potentially be seen for smbh systems with masses up to a few @xmath3 , although at greater masses than this the frequency at which they reach their last stable orbit and merge will be outside the sensitive lisa band ( i.e. @xmath4hz . ) more massive systems up to a few @xmath5 merge before they enter the lisa frequency band , but are observable in their ring - down phase @xcite , with characteristic frequency given by @xmath6hz ( where @xmath7 is the post - coalescence black - hole mass . ) such systems will potentially be observed at signal - to - noise ratios of hundreds to thousands allowing their waveform to be precisely parameterised . \n estimates of event rates vary greatly between authors ( see @xcite for a summary of estimates ) , but could range from tens to thousands of events over a range of distances and signal - to - noise ratios .    with pulsar timing there is another method to observe low frequency gws . \n this requires stable millisecond pulsars with low intrinsic noise and very accurate pulsar timing models @xcite to produce timing residuals that could contain a gw signal . \n current experiments ( e.g. the parkes pulsar timing array - ppta @xcite ) , with sample rates of order two weeks or so , are sensitive to gws with frequencies @xmath8hz \n . however , in the future with the square kilometre array ( ska ) daily sampling may be possible giving an upper limit on frequencies of @xmath9hz . for the higher mass smbh systems ( @xmath10 ) these frequencies \n would have been swept through thousands of years prior to the final stage inspiral observed by lisa , but pulsars , at distances of several kiloparsecs and therefore affected by the past gw signal from when the pulsar s pulses were emitted , may contain signals at these low frequencies . \n this suggests that there may be some overlap or complementarity between the two types of observation which could be exploited to gain the maximum astrophysical information . \n the ideas presented here can be compared to previous work @xcite in which upper limits on potential nearby smbh binaries were placed using pulsar timing . in those studies assumptions about the sources , \n based on some , maybe speculative , observational evidence were used to constrain the system models and produce upper limits on the system parameters . here \n we suggest using lisa observations as the constraint on the models with which we search in pulsar timing data . \n the non - observation of inspirals in both lisa and pulsar timing from known recently merged galaxies would place limits on smbh systems at different stages of the binary evolution or with different mass ranges . \n many pulsars are very precise clocks . \n the residuals in their timing , after the removal of an observationally - fitted model of the pulsar s phase evolution , are a potential probe of the low frequency gw spectrum @xcite . \n residuals contain noise from signal processing and the intrinsic instability of the pulsar . \n the ppta @xcite aims to time tens of the most stable pulsars with precisions of around 100ns . in the future with the ska it may be possible to time thousands of millisecond pulsars , some of which with a precision of @xmath11ns @xcite \n there have already been efforts to search for a gw background @xcite , and individual systems @xcite , of smbh inspirals in existing pulsar timing data . \n pulsar timing residuals contain two components of a gravitational wave signal : the part passing the earth ( which will be correlated between all pulsar observations ) ; and the part passing the pulsar as it emitted the pulses now being observed . \n the residual amplitude from the signal will depend on ( other than the intrinsic gw strain ) the angular separation between the gw source and the pulsar , with sources along the pulsar line - of - sight producing no residual . \n the timing residual amplitude will also increase with the source period . \n an example of the pre - fit timing residuals that would remain in the timing of a perfectly modeled pulsar @xmath12kpc away , due to the inspiral of two @xmath13 smbhs , can be seen in figure  [ fig : exampleresidual ] . \n kpc , with an angular separation between the source and the pulsar of @xmath14rads , caused by the coalescence of two @xmath13 black holes at a distance of 1gpc.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the low frequency component of the residual from the signal passing the pulsar can easily be distinguished from the high frequency component as the signal passes the earth . \n pulsar timing residuals observed before the smbh merger is seen in lisa would contain both components of the signal , although the high frequency component would likely be too high to be observed , but pulsar observations after the event is seen in lisa would only contain the low frequency ( i.e. at the pulsar ) component . \n lisa is expected to be launched within the next 1015 years , with a similar timescale to the proposed development of the ska , meaning there could be overlap between their operation . on these timescales \n the pulsar community hope to be timing many pulsars with @xmath15ns ( or less ) precision . however , overlap between these two experiments is not necessary for complementarity to exist between lisa and pulsar timing , as archive pulsar timing data could be looked at once lisa observations have been made , or vice versa . \n thus even current pulsar timing data sets could be useful , and would indeed give a longer time baseline of data to study in the future . \n first we will discuss a toy model showing one way in which lisa observations and pulsar timing could be complementary under a set of extremely optimistic assumptions : a method of pulsar distance determination . \n this application is more for use as a way of opening up discussion into other areas of complementarity than for its real world applicability . \n for the high signal - to - noise ratio inspirals seen with lisa the parameters describing the signal , including the source sky location , can be very well constrained . \n consequently the equivalent waveform present in the pulsar timing data can be approximated such that the only unknown is the distance to the pulsar . \n this provides a way of obtaining pulsar distances , for the stable millisecond pulsars used in gw searches at least , independently of the galactic electron density distribution model @xcite used in dispersion measure distance estimates , which can have large uncertainties @xcite . \n however , for such pulsars high precision measurements of parallax or the orbital period derivative have , and will in the future , be used to give extremely precise distance measurements with errors of order @xmath16 ( see e.g. @xcite . ) here we will see if our method can be competitive with these other methods . \n we create five years of data prior to a lisa observed merger , consisting of 500 equally spaced observations , containing a signal from a simulated system of two black holes with redshifted masses of @xmath17 at @xmath18 . \n this kind of system would be just within the lisa sensitive band before merger . \n we consider a pulsar with an angular separation of @xmath19 from the smbh binary , at a distance of @xmath12kpc , and , to estimate the limiting potential of this method , firstly subject to a highly _ _ \n un__realistic timing residual noise of around 0.02ns ( note that expected residuals will be of order 10100ns . ) in this case the pulsar distance can be determined to about 12% accuracy ( see figure  [ fig : distanceestimate ] . \n ) however , if the residual noise becomes just a few times larger the distance estimation will substantially degrade . \n black holes at @xmath18 and gaussian white noise with standard deviations of 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 and 0.08ns.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to obtain pulsar distances with a few percent error ( e.g. comparable to those in @xcite ) , using the potentially obtainable timing residuals of 100ns ( with the ppta ) up to 10ns @xcite would require the smbh system to be @xmath20 and @xmath21mpc away respectively . \n such high mass ( @xmath22 ) inspirals within these distance ranges are extremely rare ( see @xcite for predictions of event rates ) and lower mass systems would need to be even closer to give decent pulsar distance estimates . from this study \n it can be seen that the orbital period derivative and parallax methods show far better promise as a realisable and accurate pulsar distance measurement than our method . \n the ring - down of the smbh formed after mergers offers a better lisa detection rate for high mass systems ( greater than a few @xmath23 ) , due to their higher signal frequency and visibility to larger distances @xcite \n . however , lisa will be unable to obtain information about the inspiral phase for these systems . \n pulsar timing observations might , then , provide an opportunity to probe this unseen inspiral stage of the merger . \n some constraints on the system parameter space and the time of coalescence seen by lisa will yield a trigger with which to search in pulsar timing data . \n current pulsar distance estimates could be used to aid the search . \n unfortunately the ring - down does not provide information on the source s sky position making the parameter space more complicated , although there may be other electromagnetic counterparts to the signal that could give the source position . \n preliminary work suggests that to see any of the smbh ring - downs that occur at a reasonable rate within the lisa band ( i.e. are at cosmological distances ) , would be impossible with any single pulsar observations using current and projected achievable timing residuals . \n however , if we consider the fact that observations of multiple pulsars will be made ( potentially hundreds to thousands of separate objects with the ska ) then a global fit using data from them all will help dig into the noise and could reveal a signal . \n multiple pulsar observations could also be used to estimate the source position . \n this work will be discussed more thoroughly in a future paper . \n with the advent of dedicated pulsar timing of the most stable pulsars direct gw detection via measurements of their timing residuals may soon be possible . \n there are certain events which could overlap between being observed in the planned space - based gw detector lisa ( or even more distant future space - based detectors ) and the pulsar timing data . \n we have suggested some ways in which such measurements could be complementary and reveal astrophysics that would be more difficult , or unobtainable , with one alone . using current , and \n near term projected , pulsar timing accuracies , the measurement of pulsar distances as described above would require a very serendipitous event . \n the reconstruction of the inspiral , for events only observed as ring -

{"ContextTokens": 3952, "GeneratedTokens": 124, "SynthesizedBody": "bloch oscillating transistor ( bot ) was initially conceived as a quasiparticle to n cooper pairs converter in which the current gain @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 @xcite . \n however , it was soon realized that incoherent tunneling plays a crucial role and coherent bloch oscillations were impossible to reach without a resistive environment which was unrealistic from technological point of view @xcite . in regular bot devices , substantial current gains ( @xmath4 ) have been hard to achieve @xcite . \n recently , it has been demonstrated that large @xmath5-values can be obtained in devices whose characteristics are close to bistable behavior @xcite . \n the base current can have two different steady - state values in the hysteretic regime and , consequently , the onset of hysteresis corresponds to a bifurcation point where the current gain of the device diverges . \n the applications of a bot are expected to be mostly in metrology @xcite , dealing with source resistances of a few m@xmath1 at low frequencies below 1 khz @xcite . \n one of the remarkable features of all bots is that they may operate below the shot noise limit as clearly demonstrated in ref . \n @xcite where a suppression factor of 4 was reached at base current 60 pa and input referred current noise , @xmath6 fa/@xmath7 was obtained . in this work \n we further suppress the shot noise by choosing to work with bot devices in which the onset of hysteresis can be tuned at small base currents . when operated near the onset of hysteresis , \n the regular current amplifier description is insufficient with realistic source impedances as the input impedance and the optimum noise impedance are also expected to diverge along with current gain @xcite . \n hence , the relevant figures of merit are the transconductance gain and the voltage noise which are experimentally characterized in the present work . \n one of the challenges of high - sensitivity , low - noise measurements is their susceptibility against external perturbations . as a consequence , \n differential amplifier stages are commonly preferred since they can eliminate common mode disturbances and detect only the differential signal from the source . in this paper \n , we also study the applicability of bots for differential measurements . \n we have connected two bots in a manner where we have been able to bias them separately with opposite bias voltages ( currents ) and measure the sum and difference signals in current and transconductance gain modes while changing the common mode ( cm ) signal , either voltage or current . \n we characterize the results in terms of common mode rejection ratio ( cmrr ) which is found to be 20 db even without properly optimizing the operating point in a slightly asymmetric device . \n moreover , we compare the noise properties of the bot in current and transconductance gain modes . \n the bot samples employed in this work were fabricated on oxidized si substrates . \n lor 3b was spun at 2000 rpm for 60s and baked on hot plate at 150 c for 10 mins . \n we repeated it for two times which gives total thickness of lor of @xmath8 800 nm . \n 20 nm thick ge was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.3  / s . \n pmma was spun at 4000 rpm on ge layer followed by baking for 3 mins at 170 c. rate of deposition of ge and baking of pmma found to be two important factors which play a role to generate cracks in ge film . \n the bot structures were patterned on this layer using e - beam lithography at 20 kev . \n after pattering the chips were subjected to mibk : ipa ( 1:3 ) solution for developing , followed by reactive ion etching with @xmath9 plasma to etch away the ge through the pmma window . \n finally , the lor under the germanium was etched in oxygen plasma up to the desired extent of undercut in an inductively coupled plasma etcher with temperature control for the substrate holder . \n shadow angle evaporation at four different angles was employed to generate the structures consisting of three metals . \n the process order in the evaporation sequence was ( ) chromium , ( ) aluminum , ( ) oxidization , ( ) aluminum , and ( ) copper . \n oxidation was done in ar : o@xmath10 ( 6:1 ) mixture at 80 mtorr for 1 min . \n nmp or pg remover was used for lift - off .    in short , al-@xmath11-al squid forms the emitter electrode while a cr thin film resistor works as the collector , and normal metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) junction corresponds to the base . even though the nominal process parameters for the bots on the same chip were equal , the characteristics of the individual devices varied substantially , as can be seen from table [ botparams ] which summarizes the parameters for the measured differential pair . \n the underlying cause is attributed to the nonuniform bending of the ge mask after the etching that was employed to create the undercut . due to this reason , \n angle evaporation of different metals did not give exactly identical sample structures among all the samples on the chip . \n lllllllll bot # & @xmath12&@xmath13&@xmath14 & @xmath15&@xmath16 + 1 & 53 & 27 & 550 & 17 & 40 + 2 & 123 & 19 & 660 & 18 & 45 +      the measurements were done on a plastic dilution refrigerator ( pdr-50 ) from nanoway ltd . \n the base temperature of the refrigerator was 50 mk . \n the filtering in the pdr consisted of 70 cm long thermocoax cables on the sample holder and 1 k@xmath1 series resistors at 1.5 k. also , microwave filters from mini - circuits ( blp 1.9 ) were used at the top of the cryostat in the bias lines . \n the electronic temperature , deduced from the @xmath17 characteristics , turned out to be 150 mk , which is presumably due to joule - heating of the extremely thin cr resistors . \n aluminum bonding wires were used to connect the e , b and c ( see fig . [ botschema ] ) contact - pads to the sample holder . \n surface - mount , metallic thin film resistors of @xmath18 k@xmath1 ( 510 k@xmath1 at 100 mk ) were soldered on the sample holder itself ; the whole configuration was cooled to base temperature to minimize the thermal noise coming from the resistors @xmath19 . \n two @xmath19s were connected to common - mode port with thin copper wire . in the transconductance @xmath20 and input impedance measurements @xmath21 , we measured the current through @xmath19 , which allowed us to determine the current division of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the base . \n knowledge on the division allowed us to determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the bots simultaneously . \n the base electrodes of the bots were dc biased , either by current or voltage depending on the configuration on the cm port . \n base currents were fed via equally large resistors @xmath26 g@xmath1 , located at room temperature . \n ground contact at the other end of @xmath19 converted the current bias into voltage bias . \n voltages at the base and at the collector were tracked by li-75a amplifiers while currents were measured using dl1211 preamplifiers . for noise measurement , \n sr780 spectrum analyzer was employed . \n first , we characterized both samples in the current bias mode and measured the current gain ( @xmath27 ) on the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 plane . \n similar cross - over curve between stable and bistable operation was observed as found in ref . \n @xcite . near the bifurcation point , \n large gains were obtained and we chose to operate in a regime where the cross - over curve is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath29 , which was expected to improve the long term stability of the cmrr measurement . \n close to the divergence point , it is also easy to tune the current gains to @xmath30 for the cmrr measurement . \n unfortunately , when the cm port was fed using current , the cmrr was found to be poor . \n this was traced back to the difference in @xmath31 values of the bots , because an equally large relative difference is there in the input impedances as @xmath32 . \n the main obstacle in balancing between @xmath24 values is the variation in the @xmath8 6.5 nm thick chromium resistor which is difficult to control within a few percent in our lithographic process . \n therefore , the common mode current is divided unevenly between the bots and no proper cancellation is achieved . \n hence , we conclude that the operation of a differential bot pair is more difficult in current gain mode than in transconductance regime where it is sufficient to match just the gains . \n second , we grounded the resistors @xmath19 and traced out the transconductances of the two bots ( @xmath33 g@xmath1 ) . in order to measure @xmath25 along the whole @xmath34 characteristics \n , we traced @xmath35 using different values for @xmath28 . \n @xmath36 was calculated by subtracting two @xmath37 traces for two different base currents , whereas @xmath38 was determined from the change in the division of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . \n [ cmdata]a shows the measured @xmath25 for both bots plotted against voltage @xmath39 . \n the absolute maximum value of transconductance peaks appear in the negative resistance regime of @xmath34 curves . \n the maximum for @xmath25 is found to vary from 2 @xmath40s to 9 @xmath40s in the present samples which corresponds to @xmath41 to @xmath42 . \n this coincides well with the simulations of ref . \n the transconductance was recorded across the hysteretic point of the current gain , but no abrupt change was found in @xmath25 . \n this finding reflects the fact that both @xmath24 and @xmath5 diverge and @xmath43 @xcite .    for a differential bot \n we define the signal to be the emitter difference current of the bots . in a realistic configuration \n the post - amplification could be arranged , e.g. , by transforming the currents to magnetic fluxes with opposite polarities in a squid postamplifier . \n thus we can define the cmrr as @xmath44 when the magnitude of the base bias voltage is the same . \n due to opposite bias in the non - hysteretic regime ( @xmath45 ) we can have @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . \n if @xmath49 , @xmath50 would be fully independent of the common mode signal and cmrr = @xmath51 .    fig . \n [ cmdata]b shows one example of the effect of @xmath52 on the output current @xmath50 . in this case , the two bots were biased at the points where they have almost equal magnitude of transconductance , @xmath53 @xmath40s and @xmath54 @xmath40s , but the values of which may increase slightly with @xmath55 . \n nevertheless , as @xmath55 is varied , @xmath56 changes rather weakly , and the straight line in fig . \n [ cmdata]b yields a cmrr value of 20 db . \n we also performed equivalent input noise measurements on bots in the transconductance mode , connected to a 510 k@xmath1 source impedance . \n since the source impedance is clearly less than the impedance for noise optimum , we are mostly sensitive to the voltage noise generator of the amplifier . fig . \n [ noiseintrans ] shows the noise spectral density on the emitter terminal under current and voltage biased conditions . \n [ noiseintrans]a displays the input referred current noise when the device is used as a current amplifier . \n the blue trace is at the operating point with @xmath57 . \n the bandwidth was found to be @xmath8 20 hz , which is consistent with the @xmath58 input time constant with @xmath59 10 m@xmath1 . \n the input referred current noise exceeds @xmath60 below 10 hz , which indicates slightly more @xmath61 noise compared with ref . \n @xcite . \n the equivalent input voltage noise @xmath62 in the transconductance mode is displayed in fig . \n [ noiseintrans]b . \n we find @xmath63 10 nv/@xmath7 at the maximum @xmath64 @xmath40s . \n the bandwidth is around 200 hz which is limited by the output impedance of @xmath65 k@xmath66 . \n simultaneously with these noise measurements , we determined the input impedance and obtained @xmath24 = 6 m@xmath1 . using the obtained @xmath62 and @xmath24 \n , we estimate for the optimum impedance @xmath67=5 - 10 m@xmath1 . \n the uncertainty in @xmath67 arises from the different operating conditions in the determination of @xmath62 and @xmath68 . in order to deduce @xmath67 \n we have made the assumption that the equivalent input noise of the bot near the bistability point is governed by the output switching noise , which allows scaling of the noise sources between different conditions . \n this estimate for optimum impedance supports the theoretical result @xmath69 of ref . \n @xcite .    in the transconductance mode \n the output current noise is @xmath70 100 fa/@xmath7 , which sets the criterion for the post - amplification . \n this requirement can be met , e.g. , with squid - based post - amplifier @xcite . within the source resistance range 1 m @xmath1 @xmath71 , the bot transconductance amplifier over - performs squid - based amplifiers as @xmath72 is in the range of 1 - 10 fa/@xmath7 , i.e. , lower than the current noise of the state - of - the - art squid ammeters at low frequencies . \n in conclusion , we have performed transconductance ( current gain ) , voltage noise ( current noise ) , and input impedance measurements in voltage ( and current ) biased , galvanically coupled bloch oscillating transistors in a differential pair configuration . we found that biasing with voltage works better for the cmrr measurement , providing easily a rejection ratio of 20 db . \n the superiority of the transconductance mode is attributed to the fact that it is then sufficient to match just the @xmath25-values of the two amplifiers , while careful matching of @xmath24 in addition to gain @xmath5 is necessary in the current gain mode . in the transconductance mode \n , we find for the input referred voltage noise @xmath73 nv/@xmath7 at @xmath74 @xmath40s and @xmath75 m@xmath1 , with the @xmath61 corner frequency at around 5 hz . \n altogether , we can say that by matching the @xmath25 values of the two bots closer to each other coupled bots will make an excellent candidate for a transconductance amplifier in metrological cryogenic applications . \n we thank mikko paalanen and heikki sepp for fruitful discussion . \n we acknowledge micronova cleanroom facilities for fabrication of our samples . financial support by academy of finland , technology industries of finland centennial foundation and tekes is gratefully acknowledged . \n likharev k k and zorin a b 1985 theory of the bloch -

jets with @xmath2 and @xmath3 photons per photon - jet . \n thus it is essential to develop tools to separate single photons from photon - jets from qcd - jets . \n otherwise we are unlikely to understand either the signal or the background . \n atlas recently made attempts to identify photon - jets from higgs decays  @xcite . \n these analyses rely on relaxing the isolation / shower shape criteria , which use the differing distributions of energy deposition within the calorimeter cells to quite successfully discriminate single photons from qcd - jets . \n unfortunately , the parameters of the underlying model can be easily adjusted so that the resultant photon - jets pass the strictest isolation / shower shape criteria just like photons . more importantly , loosening isolation criteria results in a larger fake rate for qcd - jets . \n discriminating photon - jets from qcd - jets is more challenging than separating single photons from qcd - jets . \n fortunately jet substructure techniques  @xcite have recently been developed to distinguish qcd - jets from jets containing boosted heavy particle decays , and we can use this work for detection of photon - jets . more broadly , \n ` jets ' , as defined by an infrared safe jet clustering algorithm , are being proposed as a universal language to describe _ all _ calorimeter objects including single photons , photon - jets and qcd - jets . by using the tools developed in jet substructure physics , we do not need to rely on isolation cuts . \n we supplement the traditional / conventional variables currently used to discriminate photons from qcd - jets with substructure variables that probe in detail the energy distribution within the jet . \n note that the photons - jets are composed of energetic photons distributed inside the jet , where the distribution is a result of the kinematic features of the model , e.g. , the masses and spins of the intermediate particles . \n the existence of this structure within photon - jet suggests that substructure variables will be efficient at finding and discriminating photon - jets . \n we show that our analysis is capable of separating photon - jets from both single photons and qcd - jets _ at least as _ efficiently as the traditional discriminators separate photons from qcd - jets \n .    there is another important advantage to applying jet substructure techniques to purely electro - magnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) objects . \n the introduction of ` grooming ' algorithms ( including filtering  @xcite , pruning  @xcite , and trimming  @xcite ) promised to suppress the undesirable contributions to purely hadronic jets from the underlying event ( the largely uncorrelated soft interactions surrounding the interesting hard scattering ) and from pile - up ( the truly uncorrelated proton - proton collisions that occur in the same time window ) . \n indeed , the recent results from studies at atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite indicate this grooming is effective . \n we expect that this substructure - based grooming will work as well for all ecal based objects . \n it should be noted that in the context of higgs physics , the decay to photon - jets is not the only example where the collinearity of the decay products adds complexity to the analysis . \n collinearity plays a role for traditional decays of the higgs boson when it is boosted . in ref . \n @xcite , the authors exploited the collinearity of the @xmath4-quarks in boosted higgs decays ( both quarks in a single jet ) to greatly enhance the chances of detecting the @xmath5 channel , featuring jet substructure as a mainstream tool ( see also refs . \n the application of jet substructure in higgs physics has now become a very active area of research , applied both to the sm higgs  @xcite as well to beyond the sm higgs scenarios  @xcite . for reviews , more detailed descriptions , and references \n see refs . \n @xcite . \n the paper is organized as follows : in sec . \n [ sec : simplified_models ] , we start with a simplified model for photon - jets . \n we propose a set of benchmark points , where we take different combinations of masses and parameters in the simplified model to produce photon - jets displaying a variety of distinct kinematics . in sec . \n [ sec : simulations ] we define the details of our simulation . \n we describe , in detail , how we generate samples of photon - jets , one for each of the benchmark points , qcd - jets , and single photons . \n we present our analysis in sec . \n [ sec : analysis ] . \n we describe all the variables that we use in this work to discriminate photon - jets from qcd - jets from single photons . \n then we combine these variables in a multivariate analysis . \n we train boosted decision trees ( bdts ) using the samples of jets and use these to optimize the discriminating power of our analyses . \n we also show how these bdts can be used to simultaneously separate photon - jets , photons , and qcd - jets from each other . \n our conclusions are presented in sec . \n [ sec : conclusion ] . \n by definition , photons - jets refer to calorimeter objects consisting of more than one hard photon . \n however , such a broad definition presents a challenge since all photon - jets are not the same . \n they differ in terms of the number of hard constituent photons as well as in the distribution of those photons within the photon - jet . to provide a systematic phenomenological study of photon - jets we classify these objects in more detail in terms of the production mechanism and consider a broad range . \n we will refer to the various production scenarios as ` benchmark ' scenarios . \n we find that a simple model in the spirit of ref . \n @xcite with two new particles is sufficient to characterize these benchmarks . \n the model includes a small number of interactions and we can vary the strength of these interaction and the new particle masses in order to generate the benchmark scenarios . in particular , we introduce two scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 of mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . without loss of generality , \n we choose the naming convention such that @xmath10 . \n neither @xmath6 nor @xmath7 carry any sm charges . \n we use the following interactions to generate photon - jets @xmath11 where @xmath12 are mass parameters , @xmath13 are dimensionless coupling constants , and @xmath14 is the electromagnetic field strength operator . \n this simple model bears a resemblance to a higgs portal scenario  @xcite because of the @xmath15 coupling . in the higgs portal \n language , @xmath6 and @xmath7 constitute a ` hidden ' sector while the coupling @xmath15 provides a tunnel to the corresponding ` hidden valley ' . the electromagnetic couplings ( proportional to the @xmath16 parameters ) provide ways for the new particles to decay back to sm particles , photons in this case . with respect to higgs physics \n , this simple model provides a realistic example where the sm higgs field decays through the new particles to multiple photons . in the limit @xmath17 , the resultant photons ( the decay products of @xmath6 ) \n are essentially collinear .    in table \n [ table : bench ] we list the benchmark scenarios ( labeled photon - jet study points or pjsps ) that we investigate in this work . all are generated by varying the parameters in eq .. the symbol @xmath18 in table  [ table : bench ] denotes that a non - zero value is selected for that parameter , which then determines the decay mode . \n we have chosen the benchmarks in such a way that the parameters denoted by @xmath18 only change the _ total _ width of the decaying particles . as long as \n the decays are prompt , the exact values of these parameters are irrelevant to the phenomenological properties of the photon - jets . \n .[table : bench ] the study points used in our analysis . for @xmath19 , @xmath7 does not participate in the decay chain since @xmath20 and the @xmath9 and @xmath21 columns are empty . by @xmath18 \n we denote that a non - zero value is chosen for the parameter , which facilitates prompt decays , but the specific value plays no role . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we estimate these numbers by integrating the energy deposited in an electromagnetic shower in a cell of size ( @xmath22 ) and situated @xmath23 from the origin of the shower . \n we assume that the cell is made of lead ( @xmath24 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1984394154325, "RequestID": "65b13f1e47304a0da591d7fdb5c711c4", "TotalTokens": 2604}

detection are sought . \n these detectors should have a quantum efficiency that is similar to the quantum efficiency of ccds in the optical and a dark count rate below that of ccds . \n additionally , it is desirable that these detectors can time - resolve single photons ( spd ) . a review of spds is given in ref . \n @xcite .    in sections  [ seggern : \n sec : ccd ] to [ seggern : sec : pmt ] ( electron - multiplying ) ccds , qi spds from ref . \n @xcite and pmts are discussed , respectively , and the figures of merit are calculated . \n the results are compared in section  [ seggern : sec : concl ] . to calculate the count rate sensitivity , @xmath12 , a confidence level of @xmath16 is assumed . \n ccds are currently the prime choice for scientific visual imaging with a wide range of devices to choose from . \n the imaging area of ccds is segmented into columns each consisting of a series of mis capacitors . during data taking \n , these capacitors are biased into deep - depletion . \n incident photons are absorbed in the semiconductor material and produce free charges which are stored by the capacitors . \n these charges are integrated during an exposure . at the end of an exposure , \n the collected charges are transported to a read - out structure and digitized . \n hence , a ccd can not resolve single photons . \n in addition to the charges generated by incident photons , thermally generated free charges are produced and stored as well . \n these constitute the dark counts , which contributes to the overall noise . \n the process of read - out and digitization adds a second source of noise . \n hence , the total noise is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the read - out noise , @xmath19 the exposure time and @xmath20 the production rate of dark counts . \n o0.37     the lsw experiment alps at desy used a commercially available , low noise ccd camera with @xmath21 sized pixels ( pixis ccd )  @xcite . \n a dark count rate below @xmath22 was achieved by liquid cooling of the ccd chip and the camera was equipped with low - noise read - out electronics ( @xmath23 )  @xcite . \n thus , the read - out noise is the larger contribution to the total noise for exposures shorter than @xmath24 . \n if the signal can be focussed to a single pixel , a data set of 20 one hour exposures yields a figure of merit @xmath25 for a quantum efficiency of @xmath26 which is typical in the visible spectrum . \n electron multiplying ccds ( emccds ) amplify the charge signal before read - out in an avalanche multiplication register  @xcite . \n this allows to neglect the read - out noise and , hence , short exposure times are possible . \n but at the same time , the quantum efficiency is effectively reduced by a factor of two due to the additional noise from the multiplication process  @xcite . \n the original quantum efficiency , i.e.  without charge multiplication in an avalanche register , can be recovered by interpreting the read - out values in a binary fashion , i.e.  photon detected yes / no  @xcite , where a photon is counted if the digitized signal is above a threshold , @xmath27 . \n hence , the analysis can be reduced to that of a counting experiment . \n if contamination by noise and loss of signal due to the threshold can be neglected , this yields @xmath28 assuming the same values as above ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of data ) .    for nir wavelengths , \n the pixis ccd was found to have a reduced quantum efficiency of @xmath32  @xcite . \n the figure of merit is reduced accordingly for the pixis ccd ( @xmath33 ) and emccd ( @xmath34 ) . \n ingaas based ccds exist , which have a much smaller band gap than silicon and , therefore , a much higher quantum efficiency ( @xmath35 ) than the silicon - based pixis ccd . \n but these devices also have a dark count rate , which is six orders of magnitude above that of the pixis ccd  @xcite . \n therefore , these specialized ccds are of no help when improving the detector part of lsw experiments . \n to maintain a low dark count rate and achieve a high quantum efficiency at nir wavelengths at the same time , sensors operated at cryogenic temperatures can be used . \n most of the devices listed in ref . \n @xcite ( cryogenic or not ) have however dark count rates much above that of the pixis ccd \n . only transition edge sensors ( tes ) were found to have low dark count rates below that of the pixis ccd  @xcite . \n tes are bolometric sensors which are operated at @xmath36 . combined with a proper coating \n , high quantum efficiencies of @xmath16 can be reached  @xcite . \n the dark count rate and quantum efficiency expected for alps -

sensitive material with a low work function . \n incident photons produce free electrons which are directed to an electron multiplier by a focussing electrode . \n the high gain of the electron multiplier allows single photon detection . cooling the sensitive area reduces the dark count rate . \n for example , the ships helioscope uses a pmt with an active area of @xmath43 , which has a peak quantum efficiency of @xmath44 and a dark count rate of @xmath45 when cooled to @xmath46  @xcite . \n this corresponds to @xmath47 . \n surprisingly , of all spds used in qi experiments , only tes detectors have a sufficiently low dark count rate to improve significantly over conventional ccds \n . the figures of merit of the detectors mentioned in the above sections are summarized in tab . \n [ seggern : tab : comparison ] . of the presented alternatives , \n a tes is the best option . especially in the nir , \n a tes is superior to a ccd because its quantum efficiency does not deteriorate for these wavelengths . in the visible regime , \n ccds remain a viable option when only few resources are available for detector development . from the values listed in tab . \n [ seggern : tab : comparison ] , it seems that pmts are the worst option . \n their figure of merit is two orders of magnitude below that of ccds ( visible ) , which is caused mainly by their high dark count rate . \n however , considering their large sensitive area , pmts are the detector of choice if the signal can not be focussed very well . \n these findings are schematically summarized in fig . \n [ seggern : fig : findings ] . \n the study of the pixis ccd was kindly supported by g.  wiedemann ( hamburger sternwarte ) . \n 99 j.  redondo and a.  ringwald , contemp . \n phys .   * 52 * , 211 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1011.3741 [ hep -

electron interactions . @xcite \n even though , due to the vanishing of the density of states at the fermi energy , the electron - electron interactions are expected to remain unscreened and strong , it is not clear what is their influence in the properties of graphene .    in the present work we study the influence of the electron - electron interactions on the static dielectric function of graphene at half filling . \n we perform calculations to one order beyond the conventional random phase approximation ( rpa ) vacuum polarization bubble , by including self - energy and vertex corrections into the polarization loop . \n our main finding is that vertex contributions become important in the coupling regime @xmath2 , which in turn means that other non - rpa contributions should also be included . \n we were mainly motivated by the question whether the interactions can significantly affect the screening properties . \n this issue is particularly relevant in graphene for two reasons : ( 1 . ) \n the effective coupling constant @xmath0 ( see the precise definition below ) in graphene is large @xmath2 , and thus interactions are expected to be generically important , and ( 2 . ) despite of the above , to the best of our knowledge , no clear signatures of interaction effects have been observed so far in graphene . \n for example measurements of the compressibility @xcite have not detected electron correlation effects . \n in addition , screening of external charged impurities introduced in graphene is also expected to be sensitive to interaction effects , at least on theoretical level , @xcite and could be relevant for interpretation of recent experiments on charged impurity scattering . @xcite it is thus generally important to investigate the problem of how the correlations affect the effective charge of the carriers in graphene , which is determined by the vacuum polarization . \n we will assume that graphene at half filling ( i.e. when the chemical potential crosses the dirac point ) remains a homogeneous gas of quasiparticles , which in itself is not necessarily an innocent assumption due to the possibility of puddles , ripples , etc . \n @xcite however we assume that the system is homogeneous as the importance of the above effects is still unsettled . \n our starting point is the low - energy hamiltonian of graphene which can be written as ( we use units such that @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fermi velocity , @xmath8 is the chemical potential away from half - filling , @xmath9 is the 2@xmath102 identity matrix , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are pauli matrices . \n the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) reflects the effective lorentz invariance that exists in the non - interacting problem at low energies and gives rise to bizarre electronic behavior analogous to the one found in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . \n @xcite    in eq.([ham1 ] ) , @xmath13 is the electron - electron interaction , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential in 2d . \n the relative strength of the coulomb interactions to the kinetic energy is determined by graphene s  fine structure constant \" @xmath16 . unlike qed \n , the dirac fermion velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , @xmath17 , and hence the coulomb field can be treated as instantaneous ( @xmath18 ) . as a result \n , the coulomb interaction breaks the lorentz invariance of the problem leading to fundamental differences between the graphene problem and qed . from now on we absorb the dielectric constant of the medium @xmath19 into the definition of the effective charge @xmath20 . \n for example in the typical case of graphene on a sio@xmath21 substrate with dielectric constant @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the charge of the electron . \n keeping in mind that @xmath25 , one then finds the coupling constant @xmath26 . \n @xcite nevertheless , even in this situation when the relation @xmath27 is not strictly satisfied , perturbation theory is expected to give a good indication for the behavior of physical quantities . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . section ii deals with corrections to the polarization loop arising from the dressing of the electron propagators . in the section \n iii the true interaction ( correlation ) insertion , the vertex correction , is examined . \n section iv contains our conclusions . \n we concentrate on the most interesting case of zero fermi energy ( @xmath28 ) , when the low - energy physics is controlled by the proximity to the dirac point . \n the free dirac green s function is @xmath29 the interaction effects lead to the dressed green s function @xmath30 , where the self - energy @xmath31 is a sum of two terms with different matrix structure : @xmath32 , @xmath33 . at hartree - fock \n ( hf ) level ( first order in @xmath0 ) a divergent contribution appears , due to the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction @xcite where @xmath34 is an ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath35 is the lattice spacing ) . \n one finds @xmath36 which implies that the effective velocity changes @xmath37 , and grows without bound at low energies @xmath38 . \n this should in principle lead to anomalies in thermodynamic and spectral properties of graphene . \n @xcite from theoretical viewpoint , most importantly , the single logarithmic behavior was found to persist to second order of perturbation theory as well , @xcite and consequently this is expected to be the case to all orders , reflecting the fairly simple ( at least at weak - coupling ) renormalization structure of the theory . \n we now turn to the calculation of the static polarization , @xmath39 . \n the frequency variable in @xmath40 is omitted from now on . the bare polarization bubble ( without any interaction lines in the loop ) \n is known to be @xmath41 from now on the trace stands for summation over spin ( s ) , valley ( v ) and pseudospin ( pauli matrix @xmath42 ) indices , i.e. @xmath43 the momentum sums are performed as @xmath44 . \n next , we calculate the bubble dressing due to the electron - electron interactions to first order in @xmath0 . \n the two diagrams at this order are shown in fig . \n we write the total polarization as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the contributions of fig . \n [ fig1](a ) and fig . \n [ fig1](b ) , respectively .        the self - energy dressing of fig . \n [ fig1](a ) can be written as ( the factor of @xmath48 originates from the two possible insertions ) @xmath49 at lowest order , the self - energy is simply the hartree - fock one , meaning that in ( [ pol1 ] ) we replace @xmath50 the large logarithm present in @xmath51 at low momenta , eq . \n ( [ hf ] ) , is expected to appear also in some form in @xmath52 . \n let us define the following quantities which appear in our results from now on @xmath53 @xmath54 after performing the frequency , and then momentum integrations in ( [ pol1 ] ) , and using the self - energy from ( [ se ] ) , we obtain @xmath55^{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   = \\frac{\\alpha}{16 } \\ \n \\frac{|{\\bf q}|}{v } \\ \n \\ln(\\lambda/|{\\bf q}| ) , \\ \\ \n \\lambda/|{\\bf q}| \\gg 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result means that the large logarithm in @xmath52 simply reflects the renormalization of the fermi velocity , i.e. this divergence is not independent , but can be simply reabsorbed into the velocity by replacing @xmath56 in the one - loop result @xmath57 . due to the simple logarithmic structure of the theory this \n is expected to hold to all orders of perturbation theory , i.e. all self - energy corrections lead to a replacement of the coupling @xmath0 in all final expressions with the  running \" coupling @xmath58 , accounting for the velocity renormalization . \n we therefore assume that the velocity renormalization procedure is performed in all higher order diagrams . at finite small chemical potential , @xmath59 , which is the case in any realistic experimental situation , the divergence is cut - off , @xmath60 . due to the slow variation of the logarithmic function or possible other factors ( such as strong dielectric screening ) , \n no significant variation of the velocity has been found in experiment . @xcite    an interesting effect , related to the interaction contribution @xmath52 , eq .  ( [ pol10 ] ) \n , was recently discussed in ref .   within the rg approach . \n our calculation , leading to eq . \n ( [ pol10 ] ) , provides an explicit perturbative confirmation of the rg results . \n if we imagine an external coulomb impurity with charge @xmath61 , probing the polarization of the vacuum , then the induced charge density , in momentum space , is @xmath62 . here \n while the first term leads to induced charge @xmath64 , localized in real space at the impurity site and with a screening sign , the interaction term @xmath65 has an opposite sign and decays as an inverse power law ( @xmath66 , with logarithmic corrections ) . \n this peculiar behavior simply reflects , however , the renormalization ( increase ) of the fermi velocity at low momenta , which leads to suppression of screening at large distances .    , given by eq . \n ( [ vertex ] ) . ] \n we proceed with the calculation of the vertex correction in fig . \n [ fig1](b ) . before evaluating this expression , it is useful to examine the ( possible ) singularity structure separately in the vertex operator , shown in fig . \n for simplicity we use the notation @xmath67 which stands for the more conventionally used form @xmath68 , where the variables denote both frequency and momenta ( @xmath69 is the bosonic momentum / frequency ) . \n since the coulomb interaction is non - retarded , we have the simple expression @xmath70 after evaluating the frequency integral , the result is a sum of an off - diagonal and diagonal parts ( with respect to the pauli matrix indexes ) , @xmath71 . more explicitly , @xmath72 we are interested only in the zero frequency limit ( and only in the real part of @xmath73 , since the imaginary part does not contribute to the polarization ) . \n in this case the off - diagonal piece vanishes identically , @xmath74 . \n this is expected to be the case since the coulomb interaction is diagonal and thus the vertex can not generate a static contribution with a different matrix structure . on the other hand \n the diagonal part is finite in the same limit @xmath75 an explicit evaluation shows that @xmath76 does not have any divergent contributions . \n for example at @xmath77 , @xmath78 while in the opposite limit @xmath79 for our purposes the exact formulas are not important ( we also do not show the dependence on the angle between @xmath80 ) ; our main conclusion at this stage is that the vertex does not have any divergent parts . \n we have also examined diagrams of higher order , such as  ladder \" and  crossed \" ladder vertex corrections , and have found that all of them are finite . therefore the vertex insertions into the polarization function are expected to give a finite contribution to that quantity , and below we evaluate the lowest order vertex correction numerically . \n it is clear that a ward identity relating divergent contributions in the self - energy and in the vertex does not hold here , unlike conventional qed where lorentz ( and gauge ) invariance guarantees cancellation between vertex and self - energy corrections , @xcite and charge is renormalized only through simple polarization loops in the photon propagator . on the other hand in graphene , where the only non - trivially renormalized quantity is the velocity @xmath7 \n , both the polarization operator and the vertex operator do not show any independent divergencies .    the diagram of fig . \n [ fig1](b ) now reads @xmath81 where the full expression for @xmath73 from eq . \n ( [ vertex ] ) should be used . \n an explicit calculation , starting by evaluation of the energy integrations , leads to the result @xmath82 taking into account : @xmath83 where @xmath84 stands for a vector product , we then arrive at the final formula @xmath85 it is clear on dimensional grounds that @xmath86 is linear in @xmath87 . \n this is in fact the case for polarization diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory . \n the four - dimensional integrals , appearing in ( [ pol20 ] ) , can not be evaluated analytically . \n we have found , as expected in light of our previous discussion of the vertex function , that the expressions converge in the ultraviolet limit . \n after computing the integrals numerically , we obtain the following result for the combination @xmath88 , which appears in the dielectric function , @xmath89 adding also the one - loop rpa result , we have finally ( where @xmath90 is the static dielectric constant , defined by the formula below ) @xmath91 @xmath92    we conclude that , at @xmath2 , the vertex correction is more than @xmath1 of the one - loop result . \n it also has a screening sign , i.e. it reduces the effective charge . \n one also expects that finite contributions will appear to all orders in @xmath0 . \n however , resummation of perturbation theory by simple means seems impossible , as the contributions in question are finite and accumulate over a wide range of momenta in the corresponding diagrams ( rather than within a specific integration window , from where divergent parts typically originate , and thus can be easily collected ) . even though the vertex contribution is a sizable one , two remarks \n are in order : ( 1 . ) it does not change drastically the structure of the theory , apart from contributing towards further screening of the interactions . \n the fact that perturbation theory is used with the intention of being applied at a rather strong coupling is in itself questionable . \n nevertheless , perturbation theory provides a clear indication that a significant contribution to screening exists beyond the conventional one - loop rpa result . on the other hand in the weak - coupling regime , @xmath27 , \n rpa is parametrically well justified as far as the static polarization properties are concerned ( although the rpa is not justified for the self - energy . \n it is also useful to compare our results to the situation in ordinary metals with a finite fermi surface . \n certain approximations are typically used to account for vertex corrections , such as the hubbard form of the dielectric function . when extrapolated to low momentum \n , the vertex contribution tends to decrease the screening length , @xcite i.e. it reduces further the range of the interactions . \n naturally in graphene , where the screening length is infinite ( for the case of zero chemical potential considered here ) , the vertex correction affects directly the effective charge , without changing the shape of the coulomb potential . \n finally we mention two recent related works , discussing interaction effects , that appeared while the present manuscript was being prepared . in ref . \n , the effect of self - energy and vertex corrections to lowest order ( @xmath0 ) on the minimal conductivity in graphene was discussed , with the conclusion that the corrections is of order @xmath93 . \n dynamical polarization properties were studied in ref .  , where the vertex diagrams were found to have logarithmically singular contributions near the threshold @xmath94 , leading to the possibility of a plasmon mode .    in summary , we have shown that vertex corrections can have sizable effect in the static vacuum polarization diagrams in the regime of strong coupling , while for small coupling their importance diminishes parametrically . \n the self - energy corrections are naturally absorbed into the renormalization of the fermi velocity . \n the non - rpa vertex diagram at lowest order of perturbation theory was found to decrease the effective charge , meaning that in principle correlation effects at higher order must also be taken into account . \n thus the ultimate asymptotic behavior of the static polarization function for @xmath2 remains an open problem .", "StartTimeOffset": 2025224899879, "RequestID": "f3677bb4843b4f43ac5acea37e44b33a", "TotalTokens": 4051}
{"ContextTokens": 3455, "GeneratedTokens": 350, "SynthesizedBody": "semi - regular variables ( srvs ) are a sub - class of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars which also include long period variables called mira variables . \n these objects show a large amplitude visual variability ( v@xmath1 2.5 ) with well defined periods of 300 - 400 days . on the other hand srvs have smaller variability amplitude ( v@xmath2 2.5 ) and periods range from 10 to 1000 days . \n srvs are also less studied than mira variables . \n there is a speculation that srvs could be the progenitors of mira variables , but needs confirmation ( bedding & zijlstra , 1998 ) . \n the boundary between these two subclasses is not well defined . \n several stars which were classified as mira variable , have been reclassified as srv ( srb ) after observing irregularity in there periods ( ragland et al . , 2006 ) . \n asymmetry in agb variables , particularly in miras , have been observed earlier with high angular resolution techniques like lunar occultations ( lo ) , long baseline interferometry ( lbi ) , and aperture masking interferometry ( mondal & chandrasekhar , 2002 ; ragland et al . \n , 2006 ; weiner et al . , 2006 ) . \n the departure from spherical / circular symmetry may be due to stellar rotation , non - radial pulsation or bright hot / cold spots in the outer layers of the atmosphere . \n multi - epoch angular diameter measurements of the same source using lo technique are important in this context as they provide angular diameter values at different position angles across the occulted stellar source . \n any significant variation in the angular diameter values is an indication of asymmetric brightness distribution in the occulted source . \n such asymmetric brightness distributions have been reported earlier in several miras . in a study using hst images , karovska et al . \n ( 1997 ) reported asymmetry in mira a atmosphere at 0.5 @xmath0 which they ascribed to bright spots on the surface of the star , while the asymmetry observed in uv - band is explained as mira a s interaction with mira b. asymmetric structure in a mira variable , u ori , has been seen using lo technique by mondal and chandrasekhar ( 2004 ) . \n this spatial asymmetry was attributed to pulsational mass - loss in a preferred direction . \n asymmetry in mira variables often changes over their pulsation periods which is because of directional mass - loss in different pulsation periods .    in an extensive study , ragland et al . \n ( 2006 ) observed 56 agb variables using the three - telescope infrared optical telescope array ( iota ) interferometer at near infrared h - band ( 1.65 @xmath0 ) to study asymmetry in the source brightness distribution . \n their sample includes 35 mira variables , 18 srvs and 3 irregular variables . \n asymmetric brightness distribution has been detected in 29% of the sources . \n they also speculated that 75% of the mira variables in their sample could be asymmetric , but are beyond the spatial resolution of the detector system they used . among the 16 sources which show asymmetric brightness distributions , 3 are srvs , namely , uu aur , v hya and y cvn . \n all of the srvs are carbon stars and have uniform disk ( ud ) angular diameters of 10.9 milliarcsecond ( mas ) , 21.2 mas and 14.1 mas respectively . \n the cause of the asymmetry is not clearly known . \n they explained that it is unlikely for these stars to have rotational asymmetry or non - radial pulsation unless they have a relatively massive companion ( @xmath3 0.1 m@xmath4 ) . \n these stars are large in size and harbour massive envelopes around them . \n hence , they can not have sufficient angular momentum to develop asymmetry without a binary companion . though convective cells can stimulate non - radial pulsations , but that will be on a smaller scale . however , they speculated that the asymmetry seen in mira variables is due to the formation of an inhomogeneous translucent molecular screen located at about 1.5 to 2.5 stellar radii . \n agb variables generally develop molecular layers in the atmosphere which may cause different optical depth in different wavelengths . \n wittkowski et al . \n ( 2011 ) performed spectro - interferometry on four mira variables in the near - infrared ( nir ) k - band and found wavelength dependent angular diameter . \n they also found a significant deviation from the point symmetry in h@xmath5o band near 2.0 @xmath0 , which was interpreted as inhomogeneities or presence of clumps within water vapour . \n another aspect to be investigated while studying asymmetry in srvs is the polarization of the source . \n radiation from the luminous agb variables is often found to be linearly polarized , generally 1 - 5% . \n asymmetric radiation field due to localized hot / cool spots or deformed shape of the envelope may provide an overall polarization . in case of agb variables polarization arises from purely scattering phenomena . in a recent paper , neilson , ignace & henson ( 2013 ) \n has shown that mira v - band polarization varies only 0 - 1% over last 40 years but the variation in position angle corresponding to it is from 0@xmath6 to 150@xmath6 . \n they suggest that these variations in polarization as well as position angle of mira are due to convective hot spots . on the otherhand in a srv ( v cvn ) \n , they found variability in the polarization of 0 - 7% with a nearly constant position angle . \n the constant position angle of polarization suggests a long term asymmetry along the direction of polarization . \n polarization in very cool stars have been studied for a longtime ( serkowski , 1966 ; dyck , forbes & shawl , 1971 ; kruszewski & coyne , 1976 ) . \n kruszewski & coyne ( 1976 ) reported polarization measurement of 18 cool stars ( including uz ari ) in the visible and nir bands in the spectral range of 0.3 - 1.0 @xmath0 . \n they made polarization observations with the steward observatory 229 cm reflector on the kitt peak and the 154 cm reflector of the mt . \n lemmon observatory . \n they found a good correlation of degree of polarization with [ 3.5 - 11 @xmath0 ] colour which characterizes the dust envelope of the star . on the otherhand \n , a weak correlation is found for polarization with nir ( i - k ) colour which characterizes the stellar photosphere . \n in addition to polarization , maser emission also is not an uncommon phenomena among the late type giants . \n circular polarization observations of these masers have revealed the strength and structure of the magnetic field through out the circumstellar shell . \n kruszewski & coyne ( 1976 ) found a good correlations between the degree of polarization and the separation between 18 cm oh - maser line components . \n the authors concluded that the polarization is produced in the extended stellar atmosphere where the infrared excess and oh - maser emission also originate . \n however , the source of our interest uz ari , does not have any oh - maser emission detection till date , though water maser at 22 ghz has been seen sporadically ( engels , schmid - burgk & walmsley , 1988 ; takaba et al . , 2001 ) . \n in this paper we present 3-epoch uniform disk angular diameter measurements of the semi - regular variable uz arietis using the lo technique in the nir k - band ( 2.2@xmath0 ) . \n these measurements are the first reported high angular resolution observations of uz ari . \n we have made a detailed study of the srv uz arietis based on our lo observations and optical polarimetric observations made at a latter epoch .

irradiated detectors ) . \n the markers correspond to the temperature and the _ mean _ electric field @xmath22 present in the detectors under study , where v is the applied voltage and d is the depletion depth . \n ( 75,50 ) ( -6,0 )    the irradiated samples have a lower lorentz angle because of lower mobility due to a larger electric field . \n actually the electric field is not constant in the detector due to the presence of spatial charges , then lorentz angle varies throughout the detector with the position inside the depletion zone . \n the track incidence angle for which the mean hit multiplicity is minimum was defined _ effective lorentz angle_.    the doping concentration was assumed to be uniform . \n this is in agreement with the scaling of depletion depth with bias voltage observed in half - irradiated detectors : the depletion approximately doubles when the voltage is increased from 150  v to 600 v. with this assumption the electric field varies linearly from the backplane to the read - out plane , both in irradiated samples , which have a p - type substrate and are partially depleted , and in not - irradiated devices which are over depleted . \n the mean multiplicity for a given detector and track incidence angle was computed taking into account charge drifting , charge diffusion and threshold . \n experimental results were compared with the model . \n the values of depletion depth used in the model were experimentally measured ( see section[sec : dep ] ) . \n the results obtained are summarized in table  [ table:2 ] . \n the measurement of the depletion depth was performed rotating the detector around the axis parallel to the longer size of pixels . \n the angle between the beam direction and the normal to the sensor plane was set to @xmath23 or @xmath24 . \n the method is illustrated in fig  [ fig : pixel3 ] : a cluster of contiguous pixels is activated by the beam particles crossing the detector . \n ( 75,75 ) ( -6,0 )    the charge collected at each pixel is proportional to the length of the track segment in the depleted area below the pixel itself . \n the alignment of the tracks is performed by the measurement of time over threshold of the first fired pixel in the cluster . for each fired pixel in the cluster the depth of the center of the segment \n is calculated .    in fig . \n [ fig : scan ] the distributions of the track - segment depth are shown for a sensor irradiated to a fluence of @xmath25 and operated at two different values of bias voltage . \n the maximum depth is measured determining with a fit the point of inflexion of the track - segment depth distribution . \n the consistency of the method was checked with not - irradiated sensors , that are fully depleted , for which the depletion is equal to the nominal thickness . \n the lorentz angle of atlas pixel radiation - hard sensors in a field of 1.4 tesla was measured . for a not - irradiated sensor operated at 150 v a value of @xmath10 \n was found . \n two different measurements for a sensor irradiated with @xmath26 and operated at 600 v gave the compatible values of @xmath11 . and \n the lorentz angle depends through the mobility upon the electric field inside sensors . \n the observed behaviour is well explained by a model based on charge drift in silicon . at the operating conditions for atlas pixel sensors a lorentz angle of @xmath27 at the beginning of data taking , decreasing to @xmath28 after 10 years of operation , \n is expected . \n 999 the atlas pixel collaboration , atlas pixel detector technical design report , * cern / lhcc/98 -

time geometry in the vicinity of external gravitating bodies , this enabling high precision tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity to be carried out . \n there are important issues regarding the approximation to a geodesic that are being addressed by the motion of an actual extended body . on the one hand , in general relativity @xcite , \n the problem of an extended body is subtle due , not only to the non - linearity of the equations of motion , but also because of the need to deal with the internal structure of a compact body , constructed of continuous media , where kinetic variables and thermodynamic potentials , are involved , and where there may be intrinsically non - local effects arising from the internal structure of an extended body , such as tidal ones . \n moreover , there are problems concerning approximations that need to be made in order to describe a given extended body as a test particle moving along a geodesic , these being related with the fact that many of the common newtonian gravitational concepts such as centre of mass , total mass , or size of an extended material body do not have well defined counterparts in general relativity @xcite . \n the ehlers - geroch theorem @xcite , which generalized an earlier result by geroch and jang @xcite , provides a justification , under appropriate conditions , for the trajectory of an extended body , having a limitingly small gravitational field of its own , to be a geodesic :    _ a timelike curve @xmath0 on a 4-manifold of lorenzian metric @xmath1 must necessarily be a geodesic , if for each closed neighborhood @xmath2 of @xmath0 there exists , within each neighborhood of the metric @xmath1 ( with accompanying connection ) in @xmath2 , a metric @xmath3 whose the einstein tensor @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the ricci tensor and @xmath6 the scalar curvature of @xmath3 ) satisfies the dominant energy condition in @xmath2 , is non - zero in @xmath2 , and vanishes on @xmath7 . _ \n the conditions of the theorem are not specific to any equations of state that the material of a test body might be subject to , beyond its satisfaction of the dominant energy condition . \n this theorem , asserting that _ small massive bodies move on near - geodesics _ , thus achieves a rigorous bridge from general relativity to satellite experiments . \n this suggests a high level of suppression of non - gravitational and self - gravitational effects from the satellite s own small gravitational field , enabling us to consider that it has a very nearly geodesic motion and , hence , providing a genuine testing ground for general relativity effects . \n laser relativity satellite ( lares ) @xcite was launched on february 13 , 2012 from the european space agency s spaceport in kourou , french guiana . \n that launch also marked the first qualification flight of the new vehicle - rocket vega of the european space agency . \n the satellite is a tungsten alloy sphere of 18.2 cm radius and mass 386.8 kg ( fig . \n 1 ) , covered by 92 retro - reflectors to reflect the laser signals from the international laser ranging service stations . \n the orbit is circular to high accuracy , the eccentricity is 0.0007 , and inclination 69@xmath8.5 at semi - major axis 7820 km . \n the efficiency of lares is in the simplicity of its design , aimed at the suppression of non - gravitational orbital perturbations including atmospheric drag and the anisotropic thermal radiation from its surface due to the anisotropic heating of the sphere due to the solar and earth s radiations ( yarkovsky effect ) : it has the smallest ratio of cross - sectional area to mass of any other artificial satellite , including the previous two laser geodynamics satellites ( lageos ) and a single piece structure . \n ( lageos had a heterogeneous structure . ) \n the experience with the lageos satellites had proved the efficiency of laser ranging passive satellites for testing the frame - dragging effect predicted by general relativity @xcite . \n an important fact was the availability of the improved earth s gravity models of grace , providing the possibility of the accurate evaluation of their spherical harmonic coefficients . \n the obtained behavior for the residuals of the nodes of the lageos 1 and 2 confirmed the lense - thirring effect @xcite , i.e. the rate of drag of the longitude of the nodes @xmath9 to an accuracy of the order of 10% @xcite , where * j * is the angular momentum of the central mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the orbit of the test particle , respectively . \n the analysis of the first months of measurements @xcite confirmed the efficiency of the design of lares , even though its orbit is lower than that of both lageos : the acceleration due to the non - gravitational perturbations for lares achieves 2 - 3-times improvement with respect to lageos . \n it has to be stressed that until the launch of lares , the two lageos satellites had the smallest residual acceleration of any other artificial satellite . \n the creation of a general relativistic test particle moving along a geodesic in the earth s space - time gravitational field has to be considered as a principal achievement for high accuracy testing of any relativistic effect . \n these studies are able to constrain possible extensions of general relativity such as the chern -

{"ContextTokens": 2687, "GeneratedTokens": 317, "SynthesizedBody": "the exciting evidence for evolution in distant clusters of galaxies @xcite has diverted attention from nearby clusters . \n this is unfortunate , since although nearby clusters show less evidence of galaxy activity they may be studied to much greater depth . \n the findings may then be applied to studies of higher redshift clusters and to the general understanding of the cause for evolution in cluster populations with redshift . \n the potential importance of dust in the active galaxies of distant clusters @xcite underscores the need for selecting samples independent of the effects of dust extinction . \n radio continuum emission ( in this study we will use a frequency of 1.4 ghz ) is a powerful probe of activity caused by both active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and current star formation @xcite . \n it is particularly attractive for this latter type of activity , as the radio continuum emission is directly related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) . \n consequently , a radio flux - limited sample drawn from a given cluster will select all agn and galaxies forming stars at a rate greater than some adopted threshold . \n we have constructed a sample of radio galaxies in 20 nearby abell clusters @xcite . for the nearer clusters , \n the radio data are taken from the nrao vla sky survey @xcite while for the more distant clusters we have collected our own vla data @xcite . \n the luminosities associated with the flux limits of these data correspond roughly to that of the milky way , meaning our completeness limit is a sfr of 4m@xmath0 yr@xmath1 ( for stars with masses @xmath2 m@xmath0 , using the relationship of @xcite ) . \n the more sensitive observations ( i.e. , the nearest nvss clusters and our vla data for the more distant clusters ) detect sfrs as low as 1m@xmath0 yr@xmath1 . \n velocity measurements based on optical spectra indicate whether the radio galaxies are members of their respective clusters , or merely seen in projection . \n the full sample contains over 400 cluster radio galaxies and over 150 foreground and background radio galaxies . \n we have quality optical spectra for about half of the cluster radio galaxies , which enables us to identify the source of the radio emission as either star formation or an agn .    using this sample \n , we ask the question : do any clusters show more evidence for activity and if so , why ? \n the motivation is to understand the butcher - oemler effect , including both the trend and its scatter . \n as noted , we also wish to establish a nearby benchmark for evolutionary studies of distant clusters . \n analogous to the blue fraction of butcher - oemler studies , we calculated the fraction of cluster galaxies associated with radio emission ( @xmath3 ) . \n for this calculation , we used all galaxies brighter than @xmath4 ( determined from the systemic velocities of the clusters ) . \n the optical spectroscopy indicated which radio galaxies were cluster members and which were foreground / background objects , while the total number of galaxies for each cluster was corrected for estimated background counts . to place the clusters on even footing , we used only sources with radio luminosities greater than the nvss completeness limit for the most distant cluster which used nvss data ( i.e. , radio detections at lower luminosities were considered non - detections for the fractional testing ) . in each cluster \n , we surveyed from the cluster center out to a radial distance of 3@xmath5 mpc , or @xmath6 . for the @xmath3 calculations we applied a radial limit of 2@xmath5 mpc in order to reduce variation caused by the background correction . \n the @xmath3 values were then compared via a @xmath7 test . \n two clusters showed an enhancement in activity ( larger @xmath3 than the other clusters of the sample , significant at @xmath8 confidence ) , abell 1185 and abell 2255 . to explore what types of galaxies cause these enhancements \n , we investigated @xmath3 as a function of optical magnitude . \n three bins in optical magnitude were created : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . for reference , \n @xmath12 for ellipticals @xcite \n so these approximately correspond to bright ellipticals , larger spirals and s0s , and later - type spirals and irregulars , respectively . \n the increased @xmath3 for abell 1185 was revealed to be caused by the intermediate optical magnitude galaxies . for abell 2255 , \n the increased @xmath3 was caused by both the optically brighter and fainter galaxies ( see figure [ fig - comprlf ] ) . in fact , the excess of the fainter galaxies was significant at over @xmath13 . \n this result is robust against variations in the background count . \n in fact , should _ all _ optically - faint galaxies in the direction of abell 2255 be cluster members ( hence no background correction and a minimum value for @xmath3 ) , the radio galaxy enhancement would still be significant at @xmath14 confidence .      with complete optical spectroscopy for abell 2255 , we further analyzed the emission source for the radio galaxies . \n of the 23 optically - faint galaxies in this cluster , 21 had radio emission associated with star formation . \n the other two were weak emission - line agn . among the star - forming galaxies \n there were many examples of rigorous star formation , including three starbursts with ew([oii])@xmath15 40@xmath16 and four dusty starbursts with slightly weaker ew([oii ] ) but strong h@xmath17 absorption ( see @xcite ) . \n additionally , one galaxy had a strong post - starburst spectrum . \n thus , there is strong evidence for current and dramatic activity within the galaxy population of abell 2255 . \n why is abell 2255 so special ? \n we searched for correlations between @xmath3 and parameters such as cluster richness and overall galaxy distribution ( i.e. , is the cluster compact or fairly dispersed ? ) , but found none . in studies of more distant butcher - oemler clusters , an increased @xmath3 for abell 2125 as compared to abell 2645 \n was noted despite the nearly identical redshift and richness of these clusters @xcite . \n the authors concluded that the discrepancy was likely the result of abell 2125 being a cluster - cluster merger rich in substructure whereas abell 2645 is more virialized . \n this explanation is attractive in the case of abell 2255 , as it is also a strong merger candidate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the main problem with this explanation is that other clusters in our sample are also probable mergers . as a case example , we discuss abell 2256 ( see @xcite for merger evidence ) . \n radio observations of this cluster were performed concurrently with those of abell 2255 , and the two clusters are also comparable in richness and redshift . however , with the possible exception of the optically - brightest galaxies the @xmath3 values for abell 2256 were normal ( see figure [ fig - comprlf ] ) . \n consistent with this result is the measured blue fraction for abell 2256 , @xmath18 @xcite . \n the key appears to be a combination of the merger stage and large - scale structure . \n we assessed the substructure in each cluster using a variety of techniques , including the dressler - schectman test @xcite and a kmm analysis to separate galaxies into respective substructures @xcite . \n each cluster showed evidence for substructure , but the specific distributions of the star - forming galaxies are illustrative . in abell 2255 , the star - forming galaxies were found in a strong north - south alignment which proved statistically significant through monte carlo testing . \n this alignment is perpendicular to the merger axis , which is east - west and fairly close to the plane of the sky @xcite . \n we would expect such an arrangement if the cluster - cluster merger initiated bursts of star formation as galaxies experienced spikes in ram pressure as they crossed the shock front of a very recent merger @xcite . \n presumably , the precursors to these starbursts were field - like spirals at the peripheries of the pre - merger systems . in abell 2256 \n , the star - forming galaxies are clustered slightly to the north of the cluster center , and prove to be almost exclusively associated with a high velocity group composed of around 30 members . \n interestingly enough , this substructure is not one of the culprits suggesting a large - scale merger in abell 2256 ; many more galaxies are associated with the primary cluster and a large infalling subcluster , the two obvious merger partners from the x - ray @xcite . that the star - forming galaxies originate in an infalling group \n underscores that the merger of a pair of rich clusters alone is likely not enough to cause an increase in the active galaxy population relative to other clusters . \n some `` fuel '' is required , in particular a population of gas - rich galaxies which can undergo a starburst . \n these are apparently supplied by outlying groups and field galaxies which are thrown into the mix by the merger . \n note that the main population responsible for the increased @xmath3 in abell 2255 are galaxies one to two magnitudes fainter than @xmath19 , similar to the magnitudes of late - type field spirals and the blue galaxies observed in butcher - oemler studies @xcite . in summary \n , we apparently see an enhancement in activity for abell 2255 as a result of both timing ( viewing the system after very recent core passage ) and large - scale structure ( having available galaxies which could undergo a starburst ) . \n the relationship of this explanation to the butcher - oemler effect is also quite attractive . \n currently favored cosmological models indicate that clusters are actively being assembled from smaller clusters and groups since @xmath20 , with the rate of such mergers increasing with redshift . \n consequently , the trend of increased blue fraction ( and @xmath3 ) with redshift is indicative of the assembly history of clusters . \n by @xmath21 , most clusters are fairly well assembled and virialized and consequently contain fewer active galaxies . \n the spread in the fraction of active galaxies at any given redshift is a reflection of the diversity of cluster dynamical states . \n more relaxed clusters would have fewer active galaxies , while clusters in the process of assembly would have more active galaxies . \n in fact , this explanation has been noted to alleviate the discrepancy in galaxy activity observed for the morphs and cnoc clusters , as the cnoc sample are x - ray selected and consequently more frequently associated with relaxed clusters @xcite . \n lastly , this spread in dynamical state indicates that galaxy activity may be observed even in nearby clusters . \n of course , this explanation requires a much larger sample of clusters to fill in necessary details . \n similar results are being found for very rich clusters at higher redshift , in a sample which includes the aforementioned abell 2125 @xcite . \n we have also obtained deep , wide - field radio and optical images of several nearby clusters ( out to @xmath22 ) in a range of merger stages . \n the author thanks the carnegie observatories for an informative and enjoyable conference , and frazer owen , bill oegerle , and john hill for their involvement in this work . \n the author also acknowledges the national radio astronomy observatory for a predoctoral appointment , and the national research council for postdoctoral support through an associateship award held at nasa goddard space flight center .", "StartTimeOffset": 2098466610555, "RequestID": "61ac658d4bb64a99b77d1aebf135c40d", "TotalTokens": 3004}
{"ContextTokens": 3609, "GeneratedTokens": 240, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of nuclear matter properties at high densities and at finite temperature has become an important problem since a large variety of data , where matter is being tested at extreme conditions of density , pressure and non - zero temperature , are becoming available in the modern experimental facilities which are already operational . \n moreover , the constitution of the interior of neutron and protoneutron stars is also a problem which is receiving much attention in the recent literature . \n the crust of the stars , where density is relatively low , can be adequately described by hadronic models . \n the correct calculation of the star properties as the radius and the mass depend on the accuracy of the equation of state ( eos ) used to describe its matter . \n we have checked that different models , either with constant or with density dependent meson - nucleon couplings present different features at subnuclear densities of nuclear asymmetric matter by comparing the regions of uniform unstable matter @xcite . \n the parametrizations of these models generally take into account saturation properties of nuclear matter and properties of stable nuclei . \n extensions of the models for very asymmetric nuclear matter or to finite temperatures show different behaviors . \n another topic of great interest is the in - medium modification of vector meson properties . \n it is well known that the hadron masses are much larger than the sum of its constituents . \n one possible explanation for the large masses is that they may be generated dynamically @xcite . \n spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is also related with the hadron masses . at high temperature and/or dense matter this symmetry \n is expected to be at least partially restored , which modifies the hadron masses and the decay widths @xcite,@xcite . \n experimental signature of the in - medium modifications of the vector mesons have been found very recently @xcite . in @xcite \n the in medium modifications of the @xmath1 meson were investigated in photoproduction experiments and its mass was found to be lowered . in @xcite \n the vector masses were verified to decrease by ten percent in medium . \n other experimental results were also reported in the same direction @xcite and still some experiments have been proposed to detect in - medium modifications in a near future @xcite . in order to take into account the in - medium modifications of the hadrons , density dependent relativistic models are certainly more useful than models with fixed parameters . in 1991 \n brown and rho ( br ) @xcite proposed an in - medium scaling law for the masses and coupling constants for effective chiral lagrangians . \n our proposal here is to study hadronic properties under extreme conditions using lagrangians which incorporate br scaling since this has been successfully applied to describe meson properties . \n as argued in the literature the br scaling describes the behavior of the light mesons in extreme conditions very accurately . \n for example the enhancement of dilepton production observed in heavy ion collisions ( s+au ) in the ceres collaboration and ( s+w ) in the helios-3 is most economically and beautifully described by a chiral lagrangian with br - scaled meson masses @xcite . \n the strategy is to assume that the in - medium effective lagrangian has the same structure as in free space accordingly to the qcd constraints but with parameters which are modified in the medium . \n so , using this approach we obtain an effective theory with density dependent parameters including many - body correlations in a practical framework . \n it has also been shown that it is possible to obtain a relation between the effective parameters of chiral lagrangians in medium and landau fermi liquid parameters@xcite . \n so , a link between the effective theory of qcd at mean field level and the many - body theory of nuclear matter is achieved . using this reasoning \n the authors in @xcite proposed an effective lagrangian whose parameters scale in nuclear medium according to the brown - rho ( br ) scaling . \n we have already shown that one of these density dependent models , to which we refer as tw model @xcite , originally derived at @xmath2 can be extrapolated to finite temperatures once the thermodynamical consistency remains unaltered @xcite . \n the important range of temperature which is discussed lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 mev since the liquid - gas phase transition takes place around @xmath3 mev , the phase transition from hadronic to quarkionic matter around 150 mev and the relevant temperatures in the cooling of a protoneutron star after a supernova explosion takes place go up to approximately 40 mev @xcite . in this work \n we discuss another possible application of the formalism we have derived in @xcite in order to incorporate temperature effects in the study of lagrangians with br scaling . \n it is well known that the same relativistic models used in order to explain data coming from heavy ion collisions at finite temperature , with appropriate parameter sets , also provide eos which can be used in the solution of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff differential equations @xcite for the calculation of stellar properties such as mass , radius and central energy density . \n recent measurements of gravitational redshift of spectral lines provided direct constraints on the mass - to - radius ratio @xcite . in this second case , however , the interpretation of the absorption features as atomic transition lines is controversial @xcite . in recent works \n @xcite we have checked that there are relativistic models which can be accommodated within these constraints . \n hence , astrophysical observations can help in the choice of appropriate models to describe hadronic matter . \n the most common relativistic model used in the description of hadronic matter is the non linear walecka model @xcite . \n when applied in nuclear astrophysics , this model is normally extended with the inclusion of hyperons , which are expected to appear at high densities . \n it was shown in @xcite that a low effective mass at saturation density makes the model inappropriate once hyperons are included . \n the inclusion of hyperons makes the scalar meson interaction stronger and hence the proton and neutron effective masses decrease more rapidly with density , acquiring a negative value . as a test of the br scaled model , \n we also extend it to incorporate the eight lightest baryons and enforce @xmath0 equilibrium plus charge neutrality by accommodating the two lightest leptons as well . \n the same extension is done within the tw model so that both density dependent models can be compared . \n hence , the present work is organised as follows : in section ii the formalism for the br scaled model and its extension to finite temperature are presented , the results are compared with the ones obtained with other relativist models and a discussion is included . in section \n iii the br scaled model is modified so that hyperons can be incorporated and @xmath0 equilibrium and charge neutrality are enforced so that an eos can be obtained and applied to compact stars . in the same section the tw model is also considered so that the results from two density dependent models are compared . in section \n iv a discussion on the role played by the rearrangement term in different models is presented . finally , in the last section , the conclusions are drawn . \n in its simplest version the lagrangian density reads @xcite & = & | + & & + ( _ ^-m_s^2 ( ) ^2 ) -_^+ m_v^2 ( ) _ ^ + & & -_^+^2 _ ^ , [ brlag ] . \n where in the notation of @xcite @xmath5 is the nucleon field , @xmath6 the isoscalar vector field , @xmath7 an isoscalar scalar field , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the vector isovector field , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the isospin operator and the masses with asterisk are br -

type lagrangian and all the finite temperature formalism that we have developed for the density dependent hadron field theory ( ddhft ) @xcite can be immediately applied to these lagrangians . \n the thermodynamics of effective lagrangians with br scaling has been studied in @xcite for zero temperature . \n the study of the validity of the br scaling hypothesis for the non - zero temperature case is demonstrated in what follows . from the euler - lagrange equations we obtain the field equations of motion in the mean field approximation for infinite matter , where the meson fields are replaced by their expectation values . in this approximation , the expectation value of the @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 meson fields \n are called @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . the coupled equations \n read @xmath26 \\psi&=&0 , \\label{dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rearrangement term @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and the scalar and baryonic densities are defined as @xmath29 notice that if the original parametrization for the br - scaled model is used , @xmath30 is a constant and the last term of the rearrangement vanishes . in the following discussion we consider nuclear matter in the the mean - field approximation . due to \n translational and rotational invariance the lagrangian density reduces to @xmath31\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2 } { m_s^*}^2 \\phi_0 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2 } { m_v^*}^2 v_{0}^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } { m^*_\\rho}^2 b_{0}^{2 } \\label{lag2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 for protons and neutrons respectively . \n the conserved energy - momentum tensor can be derived in the usual fashion @xcite : @xmath33   \\label{tem } .\\ ] ] note that the rearrangement term included above and defined in eq.([rearr ] ) assures the energy - momentum conservation , i.e. , @xmath34 . from \n the energy - momentum tensor one easily obtains the hamiltonian operator : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is identified as the effective nucleon landau mass and @xmath37 is the volume of the system . \n notice that the energy density does not carry the rearrangement term because it cancels out in a mean field approximation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the distribution functions for particles and anti - particles respectively and are calculated next . following the notation in @xcite , the thermodynamic potential can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the entropy of a classical fermi gas , @xmath43 is the temperature , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the proton ( neutron ) chemical potential and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the proton and neutron densities , calculated in such a way that @xmath48 . \n we have @xmath49 where the distribution functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 for particles and anti - particles have to be derived in order to make the thermodynamic potential stationary for a system in equilibrium . \n after straightforward substitutions , eq.([omega1 ] ) becomes @xmath50 for a complete demonstration of the above shown expressions obtained in a thomas - fermi approximation for the non - linear walecka model , please refer to @xcite . \n at this point , eq.([omega2 ] ) is minimized in terms of the distribution functions for fixed meson fields , i.e. , @xmath51 for the particle distribution function , the above calculation yields @xmath52 where @xmath53 . a similar equation , with a sign difference is obtained for the anti - particle distribution function . \n it is important to point out that the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on the distribution function which appear in the definition of @xmath54 , @xmath21 and @xmath55 and hence , the whole calculation is performed self - consistently . \n the effective chemical potentials are then defined as @xmath56 and the following equations for the distribution functions can be written : @xmath57}\\ ; , \\quad i = p , n . \\label{disfun}\\ ] ] in the above calculation we have used @xmath58 and @xmath59 . within the thomas - fermi approach \n the pressure becomes @xmath60 it is worth mentioning that the thermodynamical consistency which requires the equality of the pressure calculated from the thermodynamical definition and from the energy - momentum tensor , discussed in @xcite , is also obeyed by the temperature dependent brown - rho scaled model .      at this point , \n the parameters used in the br method have to be fixed . through out \n this paper the nucleon mass will be @xmath61 mev , the @xmath1 meson mass @xmath62 mev and the @xmath21 meson mass @xmath63 mev . \n three different sets are used in @xcite . in what follows we use the parameter set called s3 in @xcite and define another one which we call ma , whose bulk properties are more similar to the nl3 @xcite parameter set but with a larger effective mass at nuclear saturation density . while s3 is a parametrization for the original br scaled model given by equation ( [ phirho ] ) , ma is a parametrization for the new scaling , given in equation ( [ phirho2 ] ) . in table \n [ tab1 ] we show the s3 and ma constants and in table [ tab2 ] we display the nuclear matter bulk properties described by the different models used in this work . \n it is important to point out that the value for the saturation density ( vide * in table ii ) was not given in @xcite . for the saturation density value shown in table [ tab1 ] , \n the compressibility is slightly different from what is stated in @xcite ( 260 mev ) . \n this is probably a consequence of the fact that the authors in @xcite have not included the rearrangement term in their calculations . \n notice that we distinguish the @xmath64 from the @xmath65 values . in the br scaled models it is the landau mass that should be identified with the nucleon effective mass determined by the qcd sum rule @xcite and its value should lie in between 0.55 m and 0.75 m.", "StartTimeOffset": 2104092822136, "RequestID": "91dcdd9ec8de4467a2e439b7274a1509", "TotalTokens": 3849}

resonant weak corrections on the w width measurement . \n we illustrate the effects caused by photon radiation using z boson production as an example . \n the electroweak @xmath11 corrections to neutral - current drell - yan processes naturally decompose into qed and weak contributions , i.e.  they build gauge invariant subsets and thus can be discussed separately . \n the radiation of collinear photons off quarks requires the factorization of the arising mass singularities into the pdfs which introduces a dependence on the qed factorization scale , @xmath15 .    in fig . \n [ fig : one ] we show the effect of the qed corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the final state lepton pair . \n photon radiation strongly affects the shape of the @xmath16 distribution . \n this is due to the mass singular terms associated with final state photon radiation , which are proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the final state lepton . \n +    at the z pole , the differential cross section is reduced by about 30% in the electron case and by about 20% in the muon case . below the z peak , qed corrections \n enhance the cross section by up to a factor  2.7 ( 1.9 ) for electrons ( muons ) . \n when lepton identification requirements are taken into account , the large contributions from mass singular logarithms largely cancel in the electron case because electron and photon momenta are combined for small opening angles between the two particles . for muons , \n the energy of a photon which traverses the same calorimeter cell as the muon is required to be @xmath19  gev , and only the momenta of muons and photons with @xmath19  gev are combined . as a result , the mass singular logarithmic terms survive , and the effect of radiative corrections becomes more pronounced , especially at large di - lepton masses . \n the distortion of the shape of the breit - wigner resonance curve of the z boson due to final state photon radiation leads to a shift in the z boson mass extracted from data . in the electron channel \n , the shift is about 100  mev , whereas for @xmath20 one finds approximately 300  mev . \n since the neutrino in w decays is not observed , it is impossible to reconstruct the @xmath21 invariant mass , and the transverse mass ( @xmath22 ) distribution is frequently used to extract the mass and width of the w boson . \n final state photon radiation in @xmath23 affects the shape of the @xmath22 distribution in a similar way as the di - lepton invariant mass distribution in @xmath24 . \n the ratio of the @xmath25 and lowest order differential cross section as a function of @xmath26 with and without lepton identification requirements taken into account is shown in fig . \n [ fig : onea ] . \n since neutrinos do not interact with photons , the shift in @xmath6 due to final state photon radiation is about a factor two smaller than in the z case . for more details \n we refer the reader to ref . \n @xcite . \n the virtual radiative corrections to @xmath27 comprise resonant and non - resonant contributions . \n the non - resonant contributions , which include those originating from the @xmath28 box diagrams , vanish for @xmath29 , and thus were not included in ref . \n @xcite . for precision physics \n away from the w pole , however , the non - resonant corrections must be included . \n these corrections become important at large values of @xmath22 due to the presence of large sudakov - like electroweak logarithms of the form @xmath30 , which eventually may be resummed  @xcite .    in fig . \n [ fig : two ] we show the @xmath22 distribution including the full @xmath11 corrections normalized to the differential cross section in the effective born approximation ( eba ) at the tevatron for electron and muon final states .     +    separation cuts and lepton identification requirements to simulate the detector acceptance as described in ref . \n @xcite are taken into account in fig . \n [ fig : two ] . for comparison the relative corrections including the resonant @xmath11 electroweak corrections only are also shown ( dashed line ) . \n as expected from the presence of large electroweak sudakov - like logarithms , the non - resonant weak corrections strongly increase in magnitude with increasing transverse masses . \n both , the resonant and non - resonant electroweak corrections reduce the differential cross section . \n the high transverse mass tail can be used for a direct measurement of the width of the w boson , @xmath9 , which in the sm is predicted to be @xmath31  gev . in run \n i , @xmath9 has been been measured by cdf and d  with a combined uncertainty of 105  mev from the @xmath22 tail  @xcite . in run \n iia , with an integrated luminosity of 2  fb@xmath32 , one expects to achieve a precision of 50  mev per lepton channel and experiment  @xcite . in order to determine how non - resonant electroweak corrections affect the w width extracted from the tail of the transverse mass distribution \n , it is useful to consider the ratio of the normalized @xmath22 distribution for an arbitrary w width to the normalized @xmath22 distribution with sm w width , @xmath33\\over \\left[d\\sigma(sm)/dm_t\\right]}~{\\sigma(sm ) \\over\\sigma(\\gamma_w)}\\ ] ] when resonant @xmath11 corrections only are taken into account . \n it is easy to show that @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 for @xmath36 . \n @xmath34 is shown for @xmath37 at the tevatron in fig . \n [ fig : three ] . \n the dashed , dotted and dash - dotted curves represent the predictions for @xmath38  gev , 2.042  gev and 2.052  gev , respectively . \n the solid line shows the result if , instead of a non - standard w width and resonant corrections , the full @xmath11 electroweak corrections with @xmath31  gev are used . \n the error bars represent the expected statistical uncertainties for 2  fb@xmath32 . \n experimental lepton identification criteria and detector resolution effects are taken into account in fig . \n [ fig : three ] . \n figure  [ fig : three ] shows that both , non - resonant electroweak corrections and a w width smaller than that predicted in the sm , lead to similar effects in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution . \n this effect sets on gradually in case of the non - resonant corrections . for a non - standard w width in contrast \n , the ratio drops rapidly above the w pole position , and becomes constant for @xmath39  gev . \n since the experimental precision in the tail of the @xmath22 distribution quickly decreases with increasing values of the transverse mass , one concludes that non - resonant electroweak corrections , if ignored in the experimental determination of the w width from the high @xmath22 tail , would shift the extracted value of @xmath9 by about @xmath40  mev . \n calculations of the full @xmath11 electroweak corrections to w and z boson production in hadronic collisions are now available . \n our results show that , for future precision measurements the full electroweak @xmath11 corrections and probably also multiple photon radiation effects should be taken into account . \n the calculation of the non - resonant @xmath11 corrections to w production has recently been completed  @xcite ( see also ref . \n @xcite ) . as a first step towards a calculation of the @xmath41 qed corrections , the effects of two - photon radiation in w and z boson production at hadron colliders have been computed in ref . \n we would like to thank the organizers of radcor-2002 , for a delightful and inspiring conference experience . \n one of us ( u.b . ) is grateful to the fermilab theory group , where part of this work was carried out , for its generous hospitality and for financial support . \n this research was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no . \n phy9970703 . \n u.  baur , r.  clare , j.  erler , s.  heinemeyer , d.  wackeroth , g.  weiglein and d.  r.  wood , in _ proc . of the aps / dpf / dpb summer study on the future of particle physics ( snowmass 2001 ) _ ed . \n n.  graf , arxiv : hep -

{"ContextTokens": 2151, "GeneratedTokens": 133, "SynthesizedBody": "particle physics candidates for dark matter abound , the most popular being the lightest neutralino of supersymmetric models such as the minimal supersymmetic standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions . on the other hand , \n non - supersymmetric models also have their own dark matter candidate , the most popular one being the axion . introduced by peccei and quinn @xcite long ago to solve the strong cp problem , the axion has required an extra global @xmath1 symmetry , attached to the fields of the standard model ( sm ) . \n its inclusion in a supersymmetric lagrangean has also always required the introduction of an extra global symmetry , together with a supersymmetric partner ( the axino ) . to bring both components ( the axion and the neutralino ) under the spell of the gauge principle requires , quite likely , a gauging of the axionic symmetries . \n the study of axionic symmetries and of their gauging is an important aspect of string theory at lower energy , being connected with the presence , in these effective models , of several moduli fields , deprived of a potential and derived from geometrical compactifications . \n the attempt to match these descriptions with effective models ( with or without supersymmetry and gravity ) based on ordinary quantum field theory and supersymmetry ( in flat space ) is pursued in several works @xcite @xcite , where the role of the anomalous interactions and of light pseudoscalars is investigated under the tenets of gauge invariance and unitarity @xcite . \n in general , these effective field theories are characterized by the presence of higher dimensional operators to correct for the exposed ( axial ) anomaly ( in the form of wess - zumino terms with stckelberg axions ) @xcite . \n their gauge structure , in fact , requires at least one extra anomalous @xmath1 interaction . \n the presence of gauge couplings and of a mass for this axion not related by the same suppression scale ( @xmath2 ) - which is of the order of @xmath3 gev for a traditional ( ungauged ) axion - makes this new axion a very attractive dark matter candidate . \n however , building axion models with gauged axionic symmetries is rather challenging from the field theory point of view since it requires a grasp of the unusual features of the chiral anomaly , from the organization of the effective action(s ) to the presence of anomaly poles that challenge the consistency of the s - matrix in some of their scattering amplitudes @xcite . \n one of the realizations of field theories which contain axion - like particles in their spectrum is the minimal low - scale orientifold model ( mlsom ) @xcite , based on a construction involving charge assignments obtained from intersecting branes . \n these models introduce one stckelberg axion for each anomalous @xmath1 present in the gauge structure . in @xcite \n it is shown that the physical spectrum of the mlsom contains always one physical axion , independently of the number of anomalous u(1 ) s . \n supersymmetric extensions of these class of models have been discussed rather recently @xcite , using a superpotential which is the one typical of the ussm @xcite , extending previous studies respect to the mssm , the ussm contains an extra singlet superfield and an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry , which is anomaly free . in the ussm - a model of @xcite , which is the theory proposed as a possible supersymmetric extension of the mlsom , \n this symmetry has been left anomalous , and the bosonic mechanism of cancellation of these anomalies , which is enforced via the inclusion of wess - zumino ( counter)terms , has been generalized . \n these models contain a combined higgs - stckelberg mechanism for the generation of the mass of the anomalous gauge bosons . \n a physical axion state ( the axi - higgs ) appears quite naturally , together with its supersymmetric partner , the axino . \n this second state becomes a component of the fermionic neutralinos , after diagonalization of the mass matrix of the neutral fermion sector . \n compared to other constructions , in which the axion disappeares from the physical spectrum being just a goldstone mode , in the ussm - a the presence of the extra singlet superfield allows a physical projection of the stckelberg axion of the model on the axi - higgs ( @xmath4 ) . \n therefore this physical state inherits direct axion - like couplings ( such as @xmath5 ) to the gauge fields , becoming a gauged supersymmetric axion @xcite . \n the particle is massless in the absence of peccei - quinn - breaking potentials , in which the axion appears as a phase , while the instanton vacuum can naturally lift its mass up to @xmath6 ev as in the peccei quinn ( invisible axion ) case .    in the non - supersymmetric version of these theories , i.e. in the mlsom , one of the special features of these theories is the presence of anomalous trilinear gauge interactions , which are totally absent in the standard model ( sm ) due to anomaly cancellation @xcite . \n we just recall that in the sm these interactions are suppressed and appear only away from the chiral limit in @xmath7 diagrams ( for instance in @xmath8 vertices ) . \n we show in fig . 1 results for the production of two axions @xmath9 in the mlsom at the tevatron ( left panel ) and at the lhc ( right panel ) , as a function of the invariant mass @xmath10 of the final state , obtained from a recent analysis . \n the gluon fusion chnnel is the most important one for their study . \n the processes involve the usual triangle diagrams as for the production of the higgs sector . in our case \n we have considered two higgs doublets @xmath11 in the cp - even sector . \n the s - channel exchange involves either an @xmath12 , a @xmath13 or a @xmath4 . \n we have selected a mass of the @xmath14 gev and of @xmath15 gev for the @xmath13 , with @xmath16 gev . \n the search for light ( gauged ) pseudoscalars is for sure a challenge for the experimental acvitity at the lhc @xcite , requiring precise evaluation of the qcd background . \n however , while the detection of anomalous extra z prime which modify the neutral current sector of these theories remains difficult , the identification of a light pseudoscalar ( in the mass range of 1 to 10 gev ) , which is their second signature , is more favoured . \n we thank roberta armillis and luigi delle rose for discussions . \n this work was supported ( in part ) by the european union through the marie curie research and training network `` universenet '' ( mrtn -

{"ContextTokens": 3281, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "ultrarelativistic charged hadrons ( protons or nuclei ) give rise to strong electromagnetic fields . consequently , in hadronic collisions at the lhc , the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron or can interact directly with the other hadron @xcite . \n the study of these photon - photon and photon - hadron interactions offers a unique opportunity to study fundamental aspects of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n in particular , the two - photon particle production have been extensively discussed in literature ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs . \n @xcite ) , with a recent revival of interest due to the experimental results on the exclusive two - photon production of @xmath0 and @xmath4 pairs by @xmath5 interactions reported by the cms collaboration @xcite . \n the observation of these processes demonstrated the feasibility of measuring such events within the current experimental apparatus available at the lhc , allowing novel studies of qcd at very high energies and searches for beyond standard model physics ( see , e.g. , ref . \n @xcite ) . \n the basic ingredient in the analysis of the photon - induced processes is the description of the equivalent photon distribution of the hadron , given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of the hadron energy carried by the photon and @xmath8 has to be identified with a momentum scale of the process . \n the equivalent photon approximation of a charged pointlike fermion was formulated many years ago by fermi @xcite and developed by williams @xcite and weizsacker @xcite . \n in contrast , the calculation of the photon distribution of the hadrons still is a subject of debate , due to the fact that they are not pointlike particles . in this case \n it is necessary to distinguish between the elastic and inelastic components . \n the elastic component , @xmath9 , can be estimated analysing the transition @xmath10 taking into account the effects of the hadronic form factors , with the hadron remaining intact in the final state @xcite . \n in contrast , the inelastic contribution , @xmath11 , is associated to the transition @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and can be estimated taking into account the partonic structure of the hadrons , which can be a source of photons ( see , e.g. refs . \n @xcite ) .    in a recent paper \n @xcite we have proposed , for the first time , the study of the diffractive quarkonium photoproduction in @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies as a probe of the photon distribution of the proton . \n our results indicated that , for the models considered , the contribution of the inelastic processes is of the same order or larger than the elastic one , with the predictions for the rapidity distributions being largely different , which makes the experimental discrimination feasible , with the detection of the two protons into the final state being indispensable to separate the inelastic and elastic events . \n our goal in this paper is to extend our previous analysis for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production by two - photon interactions in @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies ( for related studies see refs . \n our study is strongly motivated by the recent results reported by the cms collaboration , which shows that the experimental technique currently applied allows the measurement of the two - photon production of pairs with large invariant mass in a scenario with non - negligible pileup @xcite , and by the perspective of setup of forward detectors by the cms and totem collaborations @xcite , which will enhance the kinematic coverage for such investigations , bringing more data to elucidate the proper model for the photon . \n it is important to emphasize that the uncertainty present on the current measurements is an important aspect regarding the observation of rare processes that have not been measured in laboratory , like the exclusive production of photon pairs in @xmath2 , @xmath14pb and pbpb collisions , with predictions presented for the first time in ref . \n then , the study of the different approaches for the photon flux is important to provide accurate predictions to be compared with data . in this sense , \n the purpose of this paper is to investigate the available approaches for the two - photon processes in @xmath2 collisions and to determine the regions of the phase space that allow the discrimination among these possible models . \n this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism for the two - photon particle production and discuss the different models for the photon flux . in section [ sec : res ] \n , we present our results for the effective photon - photon luminosities and for the two - photon @xmath0 and @xmath1 differential cross sections . \n finally , in section  [ sec : sum ] we summarize our main conclusions . \n following ref .  @xcite we will write the cross sections for the @xmath3 production of a final state @xmath15 @xmath16 or @xmath17 of invariant mass @xmath18 in a factorized form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cross section for the hard subprocess @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the effective photon - photon luminosity for the production of the system @xmath15 at rapidity @xmath23 . \n the effective luminosity is given in terms of the photon distribution of the incident hadrons as follows @xmath24 the photon distribution of a nucleon consist of two parts : the elastic and inelastic components . \n in the elastic case , we have the coherent emission of photons from the hadron , without the dissociation of the incident hadron . \n in contrast , in the inelastic case the photons are emitted by the quarks and antiquarks present in the hadrons , and the incident hadron is excited in a low - mass state . \n consequently , we can define three different classes of @xmath3 events : ( a ) the _ elastic _ processes , where the final state @xmath15 is produced with the two incident hadrons remaining intact , and the effective luminosity is proportional to @xmath25 ; ( b ) the _ semielastic _ processes , where one of the incident hadrons remain intact and the other dissociates , with @xmath26 $ ] and ( c ) _ inelastic _ processes , where the two incident hadrons dissociates and @xmath27 . \n these three classes are represented in fig . \n [ diagrams ] . in all these processes \n , the final state will be characterized by the presence of the state @xmath15 and two rapidity gaps , with the hadrons or the low - mass hadron beam fragments traveling in the beam direction ( for related studies see , e.g. ref . \n @xcite ) .    in principle \n , these different processes can be separated by the tagging of the two very forward scattered hadrons and by the requirement of the presence of large rapidities gaps in the central detector . \n unfortunately , forward detectors were not available during run i of the lhc , and the next run starting in 2015 is going to produce a sizable pile - up obliterating the observation of rapidity gaps . \n therefore , experimental separation of those contributions is a hard task and demands better knowledge of final - state kinematics in an observed event . in run \n i , the cms collaboration have separated the signal of two - photon production of pairs ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) by selecting lepton tracks from the information recorded in the tracking system , which can be used to analyze exclusive events even in a scenario with large number of interaction per bunch crossing ( high pileup ) . \n offline , events have been selected with no additional tracks associated to the @xmath28 vertex . since both elastic and non - elastic processes contribute in this case , \n we have higher photon luminosities , although larger uncertainties in the theoretical predictions , due to the lesser theoretically controlled inelastic photon flux ( see below ) . \n currently , there is a great expectation due to the installation of the cms - totem precision proton spectrometer ( ct - pps ) @xcite , which will be setup in a first stage in one of the cms sides at about 200 metres from the interaction point . \n certainly , this new detector will improve the analysis of exclusive processes and allow us to access a variety of physics topics at high luminosities . \n however , a precise determination of the semielastic contribution will be still fundamental before the search of new physics in two - photon processes .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      ( color online ) upper panels : ratio between the sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections and the elastic cross section ; lower panels : ratio between the inelastic cross section and sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections . ] \n in this paper we have investigated the contribution of inelastic , semielastic and elastic processes for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production by two - photon interactions in @xmath2 collisions considering different models for the inelastic photon distribution . \n we demonstrated that these distinct models implies very distinct behaviours for the effective photon - photon luminosities and differential cross sections . \n it implies that the use of the two - photon particle production mechanism to search rare events will be not a easy task before the determination of the correct description of the inelastic photon distribution . \n in particular , since in a first moment only one of the very forward detectors of ct - pps will be installed , which would not eliminate the semielastic processes . \n our results indicate that the analysis of the rapidity distribution for @xmath1 production can be a discriminator among the possible models for the photon distribution . \n in particular , the determination of the distribution for central rapidities already differentiate the distinct models . \n moreover , the analysis of the invariant mass dependence of the ratio between the sum of semielastic and elastic cross sections and the elastic one also can be used to determinate the inelastic photon distribution . finally , we believe that the analyses carried out with the data of the two - photon production of pairs , in conjunction with the exclusive vector meson production discussed in ref . \n @xcite , will allow us to precisely determine the adequate description of the photon distribution , which still is an important open question in high energy physics . \n this work has been supported by cnpq , capes and fapergs , brazil . \n g. baur , k. hencken , d. trautmann , s. sadovsky , y. kharlov , phys . \n rep . * 364 * , 359 ( 2002 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves and m.  v.  t.  machado , mod . \n a * 19 * , 2525 ( 2004 ) ; c.  a. bertulani , s.  r.  klein and j.  nystrand , ann . \n nucl . part . \n sci . * 55 * , 271 ( 2005 ) ; k.  hencken _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rept .   * 458 * , 1 ( 2008 ) . \n j.  de favereau de jeneret , v.  lemaitre , y.  liu , s.  ovyn , t.  pierzchala , k.  piotrzkowski , x.  rouby and n.  schul _ et al . \n _ , arxiv:0908.2020 [ hep - ph ] ; s.  atag , s.  c.  inan and i.  sahin , jhep * 1009 * , 042 ( 2010 ) ; s.  c.  inan , phys . \n d * 81 * , 115002 ( 2010 ) ; e.  chapon , c.  royon and o.  kepka , phys . \n d * 81 * , 074003 ( 2010 ) ; r.  s.  gupta , phys . \n d * 85 * , 014006 ( 2012 ) ; h.  sun , eur . \n j.  c * 74 * , no . 8 , 2977 ( 2014 ) ; p.  lebiedowicz , r.  pasechnik and a.  szczurek , nucl . \n b * 881 * , 288 ( 2014 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves , w.  k.  sauter and m.  thiel , phys . \n d * 89 * , 076003 ( 2014 ) ; p.  lebiedowicz and a.  szczurek , phys . \n d * 91 * , no . \n 9 , 095008 ( 2015 ) ; v.  p.  goncalves and w.  k.  sauter , phys . \n d * 91 * , 035004 ( 2015 ) ; s.  fichet , g.  von gersdorff , b.  lenzi , c.  royon and m.  saimpert , jhep * 1502 * , 165 ( 2015 ) .                                        j.  ohnemus , t.  f.  walsh and p.  m.  zerwas , phys \n .  lett . \n b * 328 * , 369 ( 1994 ) ; g.  bhattacharya , p.  kalyniak and k.  a.  peterson , phys . \n d * 53 * , 2371 ( 1996 ) ; d.  denterria and j.  p.  lansberg , phys . \n d * 81 * , 014004 ( 2010 )", "StartTimeOffset": 2176322343315, "RequestID": "372cee6344f34744b0251f34c89bebf8", "TotalTokens": 3533}
{"ContextTokens": 3004, "GeneratedTokens": 191, "SynthesizedBody": "with the quickly development of nano technology , the scale of electrical devices becoming smaller and smaller , and the ability of single nano machine is very limited due to its size , therefore , sharing information among nano machines is good for the use of single nano machine through the connection of them , which organise the nano network . achieving the communication of nano machines has two main ways which are nano electrical communication through carbon nanotubes and molecular communication through information molecules . among them , molecular communication(mc ) is the most potential way to achieve , which relies on the bio - inspired method and fits for the biological environment . \n + at the open space of biological environment , the three dimensional space is fit for molecular communication@xcite to model channel . in mahfuz \n et al s articles , they elaborated on the spatiotemporal distribution of information messages under the binary concentration -

bed , which is studied based on the one dimensional environment . also in extremely tiny pipe , the transmitter and receiver nano machines on sides of the pipe can regard as in the same line . additionally , \n when transmitter and receiver nano machines are in extremely small distance , we can consider they are in one dimensional environment . \n + in this paper , we mainly considered in the tiny slim pipe , how the continuous information molecules are transmitted . and how the information transmission is affected by the transmission frequency and the distance of transmitter and receiver . \n the study can help us know how the frequency affect the communication between nano machines . also can help us to place the nano machines in the future . \n + the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec_mc_model ] , we produced a molecular comunication model ; in section [ sec_sample_threshold ] we introduced the sample method and the threshold of the receiver ; in section [ sec_analysis ] , we analyzed some parameters which affect the model ; in section [ sec_conclusion ] , we make a conclusion of our work . \n we model a communication system composed of a pair of devices which are connected by an extremely slim pipe , each called a nanonetworking - enabled node(nen , ie . \n , nano node or nano robot)@xcite . \n the communication system is described as fig.[fig_mc_model ] . in molecular communication via diffusion(mcvd ) , the nens communicate with each other through the propagation of certain molecules via diffusion@xcite . \n the tn transmits the encoded information molecules in the propagation medium , the communication phase being known as the sending phase . \n the transmitted molecules propageated by the channel , the bind with the rn , which is known as the ligand - receptor binding@xcite . \n since the tn and rn nano machine are connected by the extremely slim pipe , surely , we can consider the tn and rn in the one dimensional environment , then we can study its spatiotemporal distribution of signal strength in one dimensional environment . \n the emission of information can be an instantaneous or a continuous emission . \n as the instantaneous release of information molecules , in a single puff , would be ideal design for communications requiring rapid fade - out . \n on the other hand , the source emitting message molecules continuously at a constant rate , to some extent might be useful for status telemetry , navigational beacons or periodic sampling monitors@xcite . in this paper \n we regard the emission is continuous . \n + the spatiotemporal distribution of molecules transmitted by the tn that will be available at rn is calculated by the well - known roberts equation explained in @xcite . \n we assume that a point source type tn continuously emitting molecules at a rate @xmath0 molecules per second , x is taken as the distance down the pipe from the source , @xmath1 is the cross - sectional area of the long and slim pipe , and the concentration of molecules @xmath2 at distance @xmath3 and time instant @xmath4 , then in one dimensional situation , @xmath2 is described as follows eq.[equation_spatiotemporal_1d ] , @xmath5 where @xmath6 as the dummy variable of integration , d is the diffusion constant in @xmath7 . \n + we use the on - off modulation method to transmit information . by transmit 1 bit , the tn will emitting a quantity of molecules @xmath8 , and transmit 0 bit , the tn will emitting nothing to the channel . \n we utilize @xmath9 stands fot the emitting frequency of tn , and @xmath10 is the emitting period . in the emitting period , we can emitting molecules continuously , or transmitting nothing as described in eq.[equation_on_off ] or fig.[fig_on_off_modulation ] . \n in this paper , we regard @xmath0 as a constant value @xmath12 which is the average molecules in the emitting period . \n as aforementioned we transmit `` 1 '' when emitting a quantity of molecules , and transmit `` 0 '' when emitting nothing . \n in this situation , the distance between tn and rn is x , as fig.[fig_single_duration_spray ] describes , we try to transmit bit sequences `` 10110 '' . \n when molecules were transmitted to the receiver(rn ) , the rn needs to decide the information is `` 1 '' or `` 0 . \n therefore , we need to set a threshold for the receiver , by comparing the available information molecules(aim ) to the threshold , we can know the information is ' ' 1 `` if the aim is great or equal than the threshold , and in vice versa , the information is ' ' 0 \" . in the rn side , it s no need to sample the value of aim for each time instant , according to the nyquist \n shannon sampling theorem , we can get the sampling value at time instant of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the length of the bit information , we only need to compare the @xmath14 to the threshold . in fig.[fig_single_duration_spray ] , the red arrow is the sampling instant , and the interference is the noise information molecules from the previous molecules informations , in this paper , for a simple description , we only need to consider one bit information of the previous information molecules . \n in this section , we study how the distance and emitting frequency affect the transmission under the environment of air medium . and at last \n , we do the simulation to testify the difference of information transmission in one dimensional(1-d ) situation and three dimensional(3-d ) situation . in this section , \n we only transmit two bit information `` 10 '' , for it can help us analysis the aim in the first bit `` 1 '' , and interference in the second bit `` 0 '' . \n we assume that the @xmath12 is 10000 molecules / sec , @xmath16 is 30@xmath17 , the diffusion coefficient in air medium is @xmath18=0.43@xmath19 , we utilize the model in eq.[equation_spatiotemporal_1d ] to do the simulation at different distances , such as @xmath3 are 0.05@xmath20,1@xmath20,10@xmath20 respectively .    through the fig.[fig_distance_varies ] , we find that with the increase of distance between tn an rn , the aim in the rn side is become smaller and smaller , but the interference is becoming larger and larger . \n therefore , we need to set the distance at short distance , in order to transmit enough information molecules , and improve the probability of successful information transmission .      assuming that the @xmath12 is 10000 molecules / sec , \n the distance between tn and rn is @xmath21 , and the diffusion coefficient in air medium is @xmath22 . using the model in eq.[equation_spatiotemporal_1d ] \n , we do the simulation at different emitting frequencies , such as @xmath23,@xmath24 and @xmath25 .    through the fig.[fig_distance_varies ] \n , we find that with the increase of @xmath9 , the aim in the rn side is become smaller and smaller , also the interference is becoming smaller and smaller . \n since the aim and interference increase or decrease simultaneously , we need to make a compromise for the change of frequency , in order to transmit enough information molecules , and improve the probability of successful information transmission \n .      we need to do some researches to study the differences between one dimensional situation and three dimensional situation . \n we use the same basic values of the parameters described before , except for the distance @xmath26 , the frequency @xmath27 . \n the three dimensional model of molecules transmission is adapted from @xcite . \n the simulation result shows in fig.[fig_compare_1d_3d ] .    from fig.[fig_compare_1d_3d ] , we know that the 3-d line higher than 1-d , and the interference is almost the same . \n in one dimensional situation can make sure the receiver the information molecules completely in certain time , however , the available information in three dimensional situation is higher . \n we think the reason is that in three dimensional situation , there are a large quantities of molecules in certain time slot , but to the one dimensional situation the information molecules needs to transmit sequencely which result the through out is smaller . \n in this paper , we studied continuous molecules were transmitted in one dimensional molecular communication . \n we use binary concentration - encoded method to encode information molecules into bit `` 1 '' or `` 0 '' , also we introduce sample theorem and threshold for the receiver to decode information molecules . \n to study the molecular communication deeper , we studied that how the metrics of distance and frequency affect the molecules concentration , and we learned that the longer the distance the lower of the available information molecules in rn , but higher in interferences , and the frequency has two sides on the available molecular communication , either positive or negative , therefore , we should make a compromise between the available information molecules and the interferences from the former information bits . \n finally , we made a comparison between one dimensional situation and three dimensional situation , and we find that in three dimensional situation , the rn side has a higher available information molecules , but can not make sure the rn receives the molecular information for one hundred percent . \n + still there are many areas need to study , for the future research work , we can promote our research from three aspects . \n for the first , we can study how the variation of different emit rates affect the molecules concentration . \n for the second , we should find a method to make a cut - off between the frequency and the interference , in order to make the communication more accurate and high efficiency . for the third \n , we should consider to combine the advantages of the three dimensional and one dimensional situation to improve the available information molecules . \n this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( 61173190 ) and the fundamental research funds for the central universities(gk201501008 ) . \n h.  b. yilmaz , a.  c. heren , t.  tugcu , and c .- b . \n chae , `` three -

including thermoelastic dissipation , surface dissipation and dissipation due to lattice defects@xcite . for fused silica fibers with diameter less than a few mm , \n the dissipation in the surface is much more important than losses in the bulk material ; in this regime the dissipation decreases with increasing the diameter of the fiber  @xcite . \n the surface loss in fused silica has not been fully explained by any single loss mechanism , although hypotheses have been proposed for several contributing processes , including adsorbed water @xcite , surface bond oscillations @xcite , microcracking @xcite , and absorbed alkali molecules@xcite . \n a vacuum annealing treatment was shown by numata and collaborators to improve the quality factors of fused silica for all resonance frequencies  @xcite . \n annealing in air also improves the quality factor , but can cause surface defects and increase surface losses  @xcite .    in the work presented here , we measured the quality factor of the transverse vibrations of fused silica rods , with large diameters ( up to 12 mm ) to reduce dissipation from the surface . \n we were especially interested in exploring the effects of an annealing treatment , which we performed in an argon atmosphere . \n the measurement method was the same as with previous experiments performed in our laboratory at syracuse university  @xcite . \n the quality factor of the rod was measured using the ringdown method . \n the sample was suspended in a vacuum chamber by an all silica isolation chain of fine fibers and massive isolation bobs , as shown in fig . \n [ setup ] . \n our samples were made of suprasil  2 , suprasil  312 and suprasil  312  sv fused silica from heraeus amersil , inc . \n the material was supplied as cylindrical rods about 20 mm in diameter . \n each of our samples was made in the syracuse university glass shop using a glass lathe and a natural gas flame . \n the section of the sample that was to be measured was drawn to the required diameter and length from the original material . \n the length of the measurement rod for all samples was between 24 and 29  cm ; diameters were 3  mm , 8  mm or 12  mm . \n the end result of the fabrication process was a structure made from one piece of material , consisting of the measurement rod , an isolation bob 10  cm in length and 20  mm in diameter and a smoothly tapering section between these two rods @xmath2 to @xmath3  cm in length . \n the process of preparing the sample took about 2  hours . \n the subsequent annealing treatment was performed in a continuous flow of high purity argon gas to remove any expelled impurities and prevent the adsorption of impurities . \n samples were heat treated for 10  days : 3  days were devoted to slowly heating the sample , which was then held at the annealing temperature of 950  @xmath4c for 1  day . \n finally , the sample was cooled over 6  days to room temperature . \n we chose the long annealing period and long cooling period in order to decrease internal density fluctuations that could be responsible for additional dissipation . \n as shown in papers  @xcite , annealed silica samples have decreased levels of density fluctuations , as shown by a lower level of rayleigh scattering . \n the rayleigh scattering intensity is also lower in slowly cooled samples , for a given annealing temperature . \n flexural modes of the measurement rod were excited by the gradient of an applied electric field oscillating at the resonance frequency . \n the source of electric field was a comb capacitor placed near the end of the rod . \n after excitation the capacitor was grounded and the mode was allowed to ring down . \n we used the shadow method for measurement of the vibration of the sample . \n a light beam from a diode laser cast a shadow of the sample on a split photodiode . \n the photocurrents from the two halves of the detector were fed through a differential amplifier , whose output in turn went to a bandpass filter , a lock - in amplifier and computer data acquisition system . \n the signal of the detector contains the spectral component corresponding to the oscillation of the sample . for extraction of the amplitude of the oscillation \n , we applied a reference sinusoidal signal to the lock - in amplifier , with frequency slightly offset from that of the resonance . \n hence , our data was a damped time series with frequency @xmath5 hz . \n the amplitude decay time @xmath6 was fitted from the recorded time series . \n the quality factor was calculated using the formula @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mode frequency . \n the time of each measurement was about 5  @xmath6 , ranging for different modes from 3 hours to 8 days . \n all measurements were made at room temperature , at a working pressure of @xmath9  torr . \n for each sample , we measured the quality factor of three or four modes . \n the quality factor of each mode was measured three times ; repeated results had a difference not higher than  @xmath10 . \n the statistical error of the fits was less than  @xmath11 . \n .dissipation of fused silica samples before and after annealing . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 lists the minimum measured loss level for each sample before and after annealing . these loss levels are plotted against the samples volume - to - surface ratio in fig .  [ graph ] . \n the line drawn in the figure was taken from the phenomenological model of gretarsson and harry  @xcite for suprasil  2 fused silica fibers with diameter less than about 1 mm . \n the line shows the scaling of dissipation expected if it were limited by surface losses , without significant levels of bulk losses in the material . \n every data point in the figure is the smallest dissipation measured for each sample ; usually this is seen in the second resonant mode . \n we have not fitted the thermoelastic losses for our samples , because thermoelastic losses are negligibly low for samples of the diameters we used in the flexural modes that we measured . \n the highest quality factor was obtained for an annealed sample  8 mm in diameter produced from suprasil  312 . before annealing the sample \n had the best quality factor ( @xmath12 ) of any unannealed sample . \n this sample was accidentally broken and then it was fixed ( we lost about 5 cm length at the end of the sample ) . \n the best @xmath1 after the repair was @xmath13 . \n the best value for the annealed sample was @xmath14 ( the loss angle @xmath15 ) at a resonant frequency of 384  hz . \n note that we obtained rather different results with different brands of fused silica . \n all of our best results were obtained with suprasil  312 . \n samples of 312  sv showed substantially improved @xmath1 after annealing , but even then the quality factors were poorer than unannealed suprasil  312 . \n we found the strongest effects from annealing in our thickest samples . \n our 8 and 12  mm samples showed @xmath1 improvement of order a factor of 2 , while our thinnest sample showed only a small improvement . \n this last observation is similar to what was seen by the moscow group  @xcite . \n we can compare our results with the @xmath1 measured by numata and collaborators for modes in the range 30 to 100  khz on a fused silica cylinder sample  @xcite . \n these results for suprasil  312 show frequency - dependent @xmath1s , with @xmath1 decreasing with increasing frequency . \n ( comparison of the pattern of @xmath1s to the mode shapes allowed a model to be made of contributions from bulk losses , surface losses , and suspension losses . ) \n notably , the @xmath1 values improved after annealing . \n samples were annealed in a vacuum furnace for 24  hours at 980  @xmath4c . \n the best @xmath1 from these experiment was @xmath16 before annealing ( improving after annealing to @xmath17 ) , at a frequency of about 33  khz . \n our @xmath1 at lower frequencies is much higher , but fits with the frequency dependence seen in the numata experiments . \n significant differences in values of the quality factors for samples from different material were noted in numata s work . \n willems  @xcite has measured the quality factor of many modes of large unannealed samples of suprasil 312 and 311sv . \n the gravest mode of the 312 sample had a @xmath1 of 120 million ( at a frequency of 11 khz ) , about 50% better than the best @xmath1 seen in our unannealed samples . \n other modes had poorer @xmath1 , but there were many with @xmath1 within a factor of 4 of the best . \n the best @xmath1 of the 311sv sample was 50 million , again about 50% better than the best @xmath1 seen in our unannealed 311sv samples . \n the higher frequency modes of the two samples had quite comparable quality factors . \n willems argues that this last fact demonstrates that the two samples have , in fact , similar dissipation levels overall , but it is also possible that the gap in best @xmath1 is consistent with differences between 312 and 312 sv like those seen in our own work . \n further study will be required to untangle the comparison between 312 and 312sv .    in fig . \n [ graph ] we drew the phenomenological law from gretarsson and harry  @xcite for comparison with the results of our measurements . \n note that very few of our data points fall close to the line . \n ( perhaps this is because our data set is rather heterogeneous ; it includes measurement of annealed and unannealed samples of three different brands of silica . ) \n nevertheless , one can clearly see a trend to higher @xmath1 at larger diameters , in qualitative agreement with the prediction that losses are dominated by surface effects , as opposed to dissipation in the bulk . \n our best result , @xmath14 , shows that the quality factor of fused silica after annealing has reached a value comparable to that of sapphire at room temperature  @xcite . this has led to renewed consideration of fused silica as a possible test mass material for advanced ligo@xcite . \n however , it must be noted that advanced ligo would require silica with the low optical absorbtion of suprasil 312  sv , where mechanical dissipation is not quite as good . \n research on this question is in progress  @xcite . \n we thank john chabot , the glassblower at syracuse university , for his skill and care in drawing the fused silica samples . for useful discussions , \n we thank phil willems , kenji numata , gregg harry , and riccardo desalvo . \n this work was support by syracuse university and by national science foundation grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 2213841486809, "RequestID": "62b6f72b28fe4f43b65569c9e5235124", "TotalTokens": 2889}

piskunov ( 1991 ) ) . \n we use the stellar model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) for local line profile calculations for a set of temperatures and limb angles . \n this table is then used for the disk integration of a given surface temperature distribution . \n the surface imaging problem can be solved by searching for a such surface temperature distribution that minimizes the discrepancy function between the observations and the calculated line profiles ( hackman et al . \n ( 2001 ) ) . \n high resolution spectra of ii peg were measured in july - august 1999 , september 1999 , august 2001 , august 2002 and november 2002 . \n all the observations were made using the sofin high resolution echelle spectrograph at the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma , spain . \n the data were acquired with the 2nd camera equipped with a ccd detector of 1152@xmath1298 pixels , and the spectral region @xmath2was chosen for surface imaging . \n the observations are summarized in table 1 . \n the spectral observations were reduced with the 4a software system ( ilyin 2000 ) . \n bias , cosmic ray , flat field and scattered light corrections , wavelength calibration and normalization were included in the reduction process . \n the stellar parameters used in the inversions were chosen according to berdyugina et al . \n ( 1998a ) , and read @xmath3=4600 k , @xmath4 kms@xmath5 , @xmath6=3.5 kms@xmath5 , @xmath7=6.724333 d , @xmath8=22.6 kms@xmath5 , @xmath9 . \n the following spectral lines were used in the surface temperature inversions : fe i 6173  , ni i 6175  , ni i 6177  , and fe i 6180  . \n spectral line parameters were obtained from the vienna atomic line database ( kupka et al . \n 1999 ) ; the @xmath10 values of the two included ni i lines were modified from the standard value of @xmath11 to @xmath12 as the standard values were found to produce much weaker absorption lines than the actually observed ones . \n this is equivalent to an increase in the ni abundancy , which is probably the real reason for the observed strong ni lines . \n figures 1 - 5 show the results of the inversions . during july - august 1999 ( fig . \n 1 ) only one spot is seen approximately at latitude 40@xmath0 . \n the minimum temperature inside the spot was measured to occur at the approximate longitude of 170@xmath0 or phase 0.47 . \n our image is quite different from the one obtained by gu et al . \n ( 2003 ) for almost a simultaneous observing period , but a different spectral region . \n their inversions gave much larger , longitudinally extended , spot structures around 170 - 290@xmath0 at roughly 60@xmath0 of latitude .    in september 1999 \n our inversions also show only one strong spot that has barely moved in the orbital reference frame ( latitude 44@xmath0 and longitude 160@xmath0 or phase 0.44 ) . \n there is a weaker , longitudinally extended feature visible between 220 - 270@xmath0 or phase 0.61 - 0.75 . \n almost two years later , in august 2001 ( fig . \n 3 ) , the star exhibits much more surface structures : three spots are visible in our image ( longitudes 70@xmath0 , 140@xmath0 , and 200@xmath0 or phases 0.19 , 0.39 and 0.56 ) at an approximate latitude of 40@xmath0 . \n the inversions of gu et al . \n ( 2003 ) for an observing run 5 months later show much less structure , and the maximal activity seems to have moved roughly to the other side of the star than what was seen in their images during 1999 and 2000 . \n one year later , in august 2002 ( fig . \n 4 ) our maps show one strong spot at the latitude 40@xmath0 and longitude 80@xmath0 or phase 0.22 , and a weaker one at 300@xmath0 or phase 0.83 . in november 2002 ( fig . \n 5 ) only the stronger spot is seen approximately at the same location . comparing the surface temperature distribution during the observing seasons 1999 and 2002 \n , the maximal spot activity seems to have moved by roughly 100@xmath0 in the orbital reference frame , while very little drift of the spots can be seen during the consequtive observing runs during 1999 and 2002 . in between these \n two states of only one strong spot at different location on the surface , a much more complex distribution could be seen during august 2001 . \n our images give some support to the conclusion of gu et al . \n ( 2003 ) of a significant change of the longitudinal spot distribution having occured sometime during 2001 ( fig . \n we plan to continue to study the spot evolution on ii peg by analysing photometric and spectropolarimetric observations of the object , both to invert the surface temperature distribution , but also the magnetic field configuration of the object . \n 1998a , _ a&a _ , 340 , 437", "StartTimeOffset": 2229226710182, "RequestID": "f92f3a35f41840e19275d62d89e4e862", "TotalTokens": 2421}
{"ContextTokens": 3930, "GeneratedTokens": 108, "SynthesizedBody": "supersoft x - ray sources ( sss ) were established as a new class of astronomical objects during the early years of this decade ( trmper  1991 , greiner  1991 , kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 ) and are thought to contain white dwarfs accreting mass at rates high enough to allow quasi - steady nuclear burning of the accreted matter ( van den heuvel  1992 ) . \n the sources are highly luminous ( @xmath0 ergs s@xmath1 ) , but since their characteristic temperatures are on the order of tens of ev , much of the energy is radiated in the far ultraviolet or soft x - ray region of the spectrum , where the radiation is easily absorbed by the interstellar medium . because of this , \n only 2 close - binary galactic supersoft sources are known ( motch  1994 , beuermann  1995 ) , though there should be about 1000 in the milky way ( distefano & rappaport 1994 ) . \n the situation is further complicated by the fact that supersoft x - ray binaries are highly time variable , both at x - ray and optical wavelengths ( greiner 1995 ) . the greatest number \n are known in the magellanic clouds , but they are difficult to study because of their distance . the quest to find new ssbs has inspired several projects including comprehensive studies of deep rosat pointings . \n so far , these were not generally successful , however . \n recently , two other approaches to search for further members of the sss class have been attempted : ( 1 ) using a unique variability pattern : although most sss are variable in their x - ray and/or optical emission , the behaviour of several systems is distinctive . \n data collected during the macho team s monitoring of the lmc has shown that the seemingly sporadic x - ray bright states of rx j0513.96951 , a well - known supersoft x - ray binary in the lmc ( schaeidt  1993 , pakull  1993 ) , are correlated with short - lived optical low states ( pakull  1993 , reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . as first suggested by brian warner \n , the birthday of whom we are celebrating here , at the sss workshop in garching in 1996 , the 3 year macho light curve ( southwell  1996 ) suggests a strong similarity to the vy scl stars . \n vy scl stars are a subclass of nova - like , cataclysmic variables which are bright most of the time , but occasionally drop in brightness by several magnitudes at irregular intervals ( bond 1980 , warner 1995 ) . \n ( 2 ) searching among unusual cataclysmic variables : one possible galactic source , v sagitae , has been suggested by studying the properties of several unusual cataclysmic variables ( patterson  1998 ) . \n steiner & diaz ( 1998 ) note the similarity of @xmath2 other galactic systems to v sge .    in the following \n , i will describe both strategies and review the evidence for transient , luminous supersoft x - ray emission in the two cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) v751 cyg and v sge during their optical low states . \n full details of the correlated x - ray and optical observations of 7   have appeared elsewhere ( greiner  1999 ) , so we only summarize the relevant information here . \n the distinct lightcurve of 0513  and its similarity to vy scl stars led us to decide to monitor the light curves of the known vy scl stars . \n when 7  started to drop in brightness somewhere between 1 march and 11 march 1997 ( fig . \n [ lc751 ] ) we performed a target - of - opportunity rosat hri observation ( 4660 sec ) on 3 june 1997 . a new x - ray source , rx j2052.2 + 4419 , was discovered within 1  of v751 cyg , at a mean count rate of 0.015 cts / s . during a second rosat hri observation on dec . \n 28 , 1997 the count rate and x - ray spectrum are nearly identical to the june values . \n in contrast , 7  was not detected during the rosat all - sky survey on nov . \n 19/20 , 1990 giving a 3@xmath3 upper limit of 0.019 cts / s in the pspc . \n in addition , it was also not detected during a serendipituous pointing on nov . \n 11 , 1992 providing an upper limit of 0.0058 cts / s in the pspc . on both occasions \n 7  was in its optical bright state . \n this suggests an anti - correlation of optical and x - ray intensity in 7 .    a new method ( prestwich  1999 ) to extract reliable spectral information from hri data allowed to craft a response matrix for a given observation . \n fits using this response matrix to all the source photons of v751 cyg show that simple black - body models with kt of a few tens of ev are consistent with the data , whereas higher temperature models ( 0.5 kev ) can be ruled out ( fig . \n [ ufs ] ) . an iue observation performed in 1985 ( during an optical high state ) \n was used to derive the extinction towards 7  based on the broad absorption centered at 2200  : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 = 1.1@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 . \n this implies a distance of the order of 500 pc . with this @xmath6 the x - ray spectral fitting gives @xmath10 ev ( see fig . \n [ ufs ] ) . at this temperature , \n the bolometric luminosity on 3 june 1997 is 6.5@xmath710@xmath11 ( d/500 pc)@xmath12 erg / s . \n thus , during its optical low state , 7  was emitting soft x - rays with a temperature and luminosity which confirm that it is a transient supersoft x - ray source . \n the appearance of 4686   emission in optical spectra taken in sep . \n 1997 also indicates the presence of @xmath1354 ev photons . \n cyg , like the other members of the vy scl star group , accretes at a few times 10@xmath14 yr@xmath1 . \n if the mass of the white dwarf in 7  is small , this may allow nuclear burning , as the high x - ray luminosity suggests . \n the 7  values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are consistent , within the uncertainties of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the relation @xmath19 found for 5 ssb ( van teeseling  1997 ) implying that , if nuclear burning is the correct interpretation of the x - ray flux during the optical low state , then nuclear burning may continue during the optical high state . \n the discovery that 7  is a transient supersoft x - ray source arose from the similarity in the optical light curve of rx j0513.96951 and vy scl stars . \n 0513 ( schaeidt  1993 , pakull  1993 ) shows @xmath204 week optical low states which are accompanied by luminous supersoft x - ray emission ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . \n it is generally assumed that the white dwarf accretes at a rate slightly higher than the burning rate , and thus is in an inflated state during the optical high state . \n changes in the irradiation of the disk caused by the expanding / contracting envelope around the white dwarf have been proposed as explanation for the 1 mag intensity variation ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . \n the explanation of the x - ray / optical variability of 7  could be similar to rx j0513.96951 : variations change both the photospheric radius and the disk spectrum . \n if the white dwarf has a small mass , than photospheric radius expansion is reached at 1@xmath710@xmath21 /yr ( cassisi  1998 ) . \n the explanation for the character of the optical and uv observations is not yet clear , but it seems certain that the illumination of the donor and disk play important roles in determining what we see . if the x - ray source during the optical low state indeed is very luminous one may expect a strong heating effect on the secondary as well as on the accretion disk . \n the heating of the secondary in 7  is probably comparable to that in sss because the illumination depends on the ratio of companion radius and binary separation which is similar in both kind of systems . \n unfortunately , no photometry has been obtained during the optical low state to immediately test for this effect in 7 though it is anyway not expected to produce a strong modulation due to the low orbital inclination . \n the question of the illumination of the accretion disk has to be addressed separately for optical low and high state . \n there is ample evidence in some vy scl stars that during the optical low state the accretion disk has vanished . though we have no direct evidence for this in 7  due to the lack of optical observations , the disk is certainly optically thin thus drastically reducing the efficancy of illumination . in the optical high state \n the illumination depends on whether hydrogen burning stops or whether it continues on an inflated white dwarf at a temperature below the sensitivity range of rosat : if the burning stops then there are no soft x - rays which could be reprocessed . \n if the nuclear burning continues , reprocessing may still not be strong because the amount of reprocessing depends on the size of the accretion disk ( orbital period ) and only for large disks also on the flaring of the disk . \n for v751 cyg \n the disk is so small that any flaring is probably insignificant compared to the angle which the white dwarf subtends with respect to the disk . \n even if flaring were significant , reprocessing of the radiation from the white dwarf will begin to have a dominant effect on the local disk temperature ( king 1997 , knigge & livio 1998 ) if the white dwarf luminosity @xmath22 @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the albedo of the disk surface ) . \n that is , a disk around a 1  white dwarf accreting at 10@xmath25 /yr will be dominated by reprocessing only if the white dwarf temperature is @xmath132@xmath710@xmath26 k @xmath5 17 ev . \n this is seemingly just a value between the temperatures of sss ( 3050 ev ) and v751 cyg ( 15 ev ) . \n thus , one difference of the systems could be that the disk in v751 cyg is not flared and therefore not dominated by reprocessing while the sss disks are flared and dominated by reprocessing and thus are optically much brighter than the vy scl disks . \n it has recently been suggested ( steiner & diaz 1998 ; patterson  1998 ) that v sge ( and possibly also wx cen , v617 sge and ) have properties very similar to ssbs . \n these suggestions are based on the following characteristics , shared by these four stars but rare or even absent among canonical cataclysmic variables : ( 1 ) the presence of both and emission lines , ( 2 ) a @xmath27/h@xmath24 emission line ratio @xmath132 , ( 3 ) rather high absolute magnitudes and very blue colours , and ( 4 ) orbital lightcurves which are characterized by a wide and deep eclipse . \n v  sge has been the target of three dedicated pointed pspc and hri observations ( one of these splits into 3 separate observation intervals ) , and in addition is in the field of view of another pspc observation . \n a detailed comparison of the optical states of v sge and archival rosat observations has shown that during optical bright states , v  sge is a faint hard x - ray source , while during optical faint states ( @xmath28 mag ) , v  sge is a ` supersoft ' x - ray source ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) . \n spectral fitting confirms that v  sge s x - ray properties during its soft x - ray state may be similar to those of supersoft x - ray binaries , although a much lower luminosity can not be excluded . \n the model that has been suggested for 0513cannot explain the observational data of v  sge . \n first , the optical brightness changes of v  sge are very rapid : both the faint-/bright - state transitions as well as the succession of different faint states may occur on timescales of 1day ( compared to the smooth decline of several days in 0513 ) . \n such very rapid changes are only possible if the white dwarf envelope expands and contracts on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale and the mass of the expanding envelope is rather small ( @xmath29 ) . \n such a small envelope mass is difficult to accept for a white dwarf with stable shell burning ( e.g. prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) . \n second , the expected optical eclipse would become deeper when the system becomes brighter , opposite to what has been observed ( patterson  1998 ) . \n it is possible to explain the different optical / x - ray states of v  sge by a variable amount of extended uneclipsed matter , which during the optical bright states contributes significantly to the optical flux and completely absorbes the soft x - ray component ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) . a simple wind model for the recently observed radio flux density of v  sge implies a mass - loss rate of the order of 10@xmath30/yr ( lockley  1997 ) . with their ( assumed ) terminal velocity of 1500 km / s \n this wind zone is completely opaque for x - rays up to 0.7kev , even if the wind is assumed to be circumbinary instead of arising from one component . \n since the radio measurement has been obtained during optical high state , it supports the above described scenario . \n as shown above , both strategies to search for new sss were successful . \n this is very promising , and opens up the way to use optical observation strategies besides x - ray observations to identify new sss . \n the surprising part of this development is that both , 7  and v sge , are short - period cvs , and if true , their transient supersoft source nature would establish a direct link between classical cvs and canonical sss which typically have orbital periods inthe 0.53 days range . \n for both sources , v751 cyg and v sge , the estimates for their x - ray luminosity ( under reasonable assumptions on @xmath6 ) are @xmath20 10@xmath31 erg / s . \n this is at the lower end of the stable burning region . \n two issues are relevant in this respect : ( 1 ) as for most cvs , the available evidence for vy scl stars suggests that the white dwarfs have a low mass . at these low masses \n the accretion rate necessary for steady - state burning ( consistent with fujimoto 1982 ) is 13@xmath710@xmath25 /yr ( sion & starrfield 1994 , cassisi 1998 ) , and correspondingly the luminosity is lower than the canonical values for sss . \n ( 2 ) even at rates below the steady - state burning level there could be a range where the hydrogen flashes are rather mild . \n a recent study of this parameter space has shown that the luminosity between the flashes remains at the surprisingly high value of @xmath2010%30% of the burning luminosity ( rappaport 1999 ) . \n _ acknowledgement : _ \n i m grateful to the organizers of this symposium for the exciting atmosphere which stimulated many fruitful discussions . \n jg is supported by the german bundesministerium fr bildung , wissenschaft , forschung und technologie ( bmbf / dlr ) under contract no . 50or96098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2242300082205, "RequestID": "ecef998cf8804f7bb65214731b0996d0", "TotalTokens": 4038}

dependent schrdinger equation @xcite . \n firstly a wave function can be written in the polar form @xmath1 . \n secondly @xmath2 is substituted into the time - dependent schrdinger equation . \n then the real part of the resulting equation is@xmath3 and the imaginary part has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . \n these two equations look like the classical hamilton - jacobi equation and the equation of continuity , respectively , except eq . \n ( [ h1 ] ) has an extra term @xmath8 which is usually called quantum potential in bm . \n ( [ h1 ] ) is called the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation governed by an external potential @xmath9 and the quantum potential @xmath8 . \n the motion of particle is guided by the bohm - newton equation of motion , @xmath10 , or , equivalently , by @xmath11 in practice , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation to obtain @xmath2 , and then @xmath12 . in this way \n , the quantum trajectory of the particle can be gained by integrating eq . \n ( [ eq ] ) . \n the schrdinger equation for hydrogen atom in ilf can be written as ( atomic units are used throughout ) @xmath13\\psi(\\mathbf{r},t).\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the field - free hydrogen atom hamiltonian and @xmath15 is the intense laser - atom interaction : @xmath16 @xmath17 where the laser field is the linearly polarized field ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the laser field profile . due to the linearly polarized laser field , \n magnetic quantum number @xmath20 of hydrogen atom is a good quantum number , so that the problem of solving the time - dependent schrdinger here can be simplified into a two - dimensional problem ( see the inset in fig . \n 1 ) . in this work \n the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath2 is obtained by the grid method and the second - order split - operator method , which has been detailedly introduced by tong _ et al _ @xcite . \n the laser field profile is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the electric field amplitude and angular frequency , respectively . \n we choose @xmath25 a.u . \n ( i.e. , @xmath26w/@xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 a.u . \n ( i.e. , @xmath29 nm ) . \n the initial wave function @xmath30 of the system is in the ground state of the field - free hydrogen atom . \n after obtaining the wavefunction @xmath2 , we can follow the time evolution of electron trajectory @xmath31 by integrating eq . ( [ eq ] ) with the electron initial position @xmath32 . according to bm @xcite , \n the initial electron distribution is @xmath33 . in this work \n , @xmath30 is the ground state of the field - free hydrogen atom . \n thus we can obtain an ensemble of electron trajectories with the corresponding electron initial positions . \n for an individual electron trajectory , the atomic dipole moment @xmath34 along the laser polarization direction is @xmath35 . \n the corresponding power spectrum is gained by the fourier transformation of the dipole moment @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the propagation time @xmath38 is @xmath39 in this work . \n explicitly , we take one atomic electron as an example with the initial position @xmath40 a.u . , @xmath41 in polar coordinates . \n the electron trajectory @xmath31 is calculated by integrating eq . \n ( [ eq ] ) . the corresponding power spectrum is shown in fig . 1 from eq . ( [ fd ] ) . \n the spectrum has even harmonics , which is dominated by a rayleigh scattering component at the laser frequency @xmath42 . \n we have obtained lots of electron trajectories with different initial position @xmath32 according to the initial electron distribution @xmath43 . \n the corresponding power spectra have the similar character described above . in the following , \n however , we will show the even harmonics of the power spectrum are coherently removed in an ensemble of atoms and the corresponding power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics . \n the harmonic generation of an atom ensemble can be gained with the maxwell equation @xcite:@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble at the point @xmath46 and @xmath47 describes the electromagnetic field ( involving the fundamental and the harmonic fields ) . \n obviously , the electronic polarization @xmath45 plays a key role for the harmonic generation from the ensemble of atoms . \n we will show that the electronic polarization @xmath45 gained from bm is , approximately , equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics , i.e. , both of their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are consistent . \n we first assume the number of atoms is @xmath48 in a small volume @xmath49 near the point @xmath46 in the atom ensemble ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the focal spot size of laser ) . the electronic polarization @xmath52 is defined as the atomic dipole moment per unit volume : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the atomic dipole moment of each atom in the small volume @xmath55 . from the view point of quantum mechanics , \n the dipole moment of each atom is @xmath56 in the @xmath57 direction , where @xmath58 is the electron coordinate of atomic system and @xmath2 is the electron wavefunction . \n thus the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble obtained from quantum mechanics is @xmath59 in the @xmath57 direction . \n [ 2 ]     on the other hand , we calculate the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble from bm . according to bm @xcite , the probability that an electron lies between @xmath58 and @xmath60 in the atomic system at the time @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 , where the corresponding atomic dipole moment is @xmath58 ( in atomic units ) . \n then in the small volume @xmath55 of the atom ensemble , the number of atoms with atomic dipole moment @xmath58 is @xmath63 . \n the sum of all kinds of atomic dipole moments in the volume @xmath55 is @xmath64 . \n thus the electronic polarization @xmath45 at the point @xmath46 in the atom ensemble is @xmath65 ( see fig . \n 2 ) . for an atom ensemble \n , we can replace the sum by an integral , @xmath66 further , because the laser field is the linearly polarized field ( @xmath18 ) , the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath2 is symmetrical along @xmath57 axis . \n thus in the @xmath57 direction , @xmath67 where the last term equals eq . \n ( [ s ] ) . in this way , \n the electronic polarization @xmath45 gained from bm is , approximately , equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics , i.e. , both of their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are the same . \n figure 3 shows the harmonic spectrum from an ensemble of hydrogen atoms interacting with ilf ( laser confocal parameter @xmath68 mm , gas density @xmath69 atoms/@xmath70 described by a truncated lorentzian in the @xmath71 direction with @xmath72 mm @xcite ) , which has a clear plateau region and cutoff at the @xmath73th order . \n in bm , harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory has even harmonics ( see fig . \n 1 ) , but they are removed in the spectrum associated with an ensemble of atoms ( see fig . \n the reason is that an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center @xcite , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre . here \n we will numerically show that two electron trajectories are enough to get rid of the unphysical even harmonics if the initial positions @xmath32 of the two electrons are centrally symmetric . \n let s take two electrons as an example with the initial positions @xmath74 a.u . , @xmath41 and @xmath75 a.u . , @xmath76 , respectively . \n the corresponding atomic dipole moment @xmath34 along the laser polarization direction is @xmath77 $ ] and the power spectrum gained from eq . \n ( 4 ) is shown in fig . \n 4 ( solid curve ) , which has only odd - order harmonics . \n in addition , we calculate the hhg power spectrum in the length form from the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( dotted curve in fig . \n 4 ) @xcite . \n note that these two curves can basically overlap if the value of the power spectrum from bm is multiplied by a factor of 0.4 , i.e. , both of them have the same relative intensity . \n this is an interesting result , but the reason why hhg power spectra from bm and the time - dependent schrdinger equation have the same relative intensity should be studied in the future . \n in summary , we introduce bm into the intense laser - atom physics to discuss hhg . \n it allows us to follow the time evolution of each electron trajectory in an atomic system . \n we find that the power spectrum from an individual electron trajectory has the even unphysical harmonics . \n but the even harmonics are coherently removed in the ensemble of atoms and the power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics . \n the reason of the appearance of the even harmonics is an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre . \n sanz a s , borondo f and miret -

{"ContextTokens": 2497, "GeneratedTokens": 223, "SynthesizedBody": "the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) has been a puzzle for over 35 years , but now there is strong evidence that this will be explained by a large population of absorbed agn . if these are to explain the bump in the xrb spectrum at 30kev , however , the total energy output of this population must exceed that of broad - line agn by at least a factor of @xmath1 , with wide ranging implications @xcite . \n this hidden population could also explain the apparent discrepancy between the black hole densities predicted by ordinary qsos and recent observations of local galaxy bulges @xcite , @xcite .    deep x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm will soon test this obscured agn hypothesis , although existing surveys with rosat , asca and bepposax have already revealed what could be the ` tip of the iceberg ' of this population . \n several unambiguous cases of obscured qsos have been detected ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) while at the faintest x - ray fluxes there is growing evidence for a large population of x - ray luminous emission - line galaxies , many of which show clear evidence for agn activity @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . \n arguably the most convincing evidence for the obscured agn model came from the ultra - deep survey of hasinger , schmidt et al ( @xcite , @xcite ) . using the keck telescope to identify sources from the deepest x - ray observation \n ever taken they found that most of these x - ray galaxies could be classified as agn . \n exciting new work has also been undertaken at harder energies with asca and beppo - sax ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) resolving @xmath2 of the @xmath3kev xrb . \n increasing numbers of these sources have been identified with absorbed agn . \n deep sub - mm observations offer the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the high redshift universe . beyond 100@xmath4 m , \n both starburst galaxies and agn show a very steep decline in their continuum emission , which leads to a large negative k - correction as objects are observed with increasing redshift . \n this effectively overcomes the ` inverse square law ' to pick out the most luminous objects in the universe to very high redshift @xcite . \n since the commissioning of the scuba array at the james clerk maxwell telescope a number of groups have announced the results from deep sub - mm surveys , all of which find a high surface density of sources at @xmath5 m ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n the implication is the existence of a large population of hitherto undetected dust enshrouded galaxies . in particular , \n the implied star - formation rate at high redshift ( @xmath6 ) is significantly higher than that deduced from uncorrected optical - uv observations , roughly a factor of two higher than even the dust - corrected version of the optically derived star - formation history @xcite . \n the recent detections of the far - infrared / sub - mm background by the dirbe and firas experiments provide further constraints , representing the integrated far - infrared emission over the entire history of the universe ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n since most of this background has now been resolved into discrete sources by scuba , the implication is that most high redshift star - forming activity occurred in rare , exceptionally luminous systems .    in other words , at high redshift ulirg - like starburst galaxies dominate the cosmic energy budget , in stark contrast to the situation today where ( to quote andy lawrence ) ` ulirgs are little more than a spectacular sideshow ' @xcite . \n considerable excitement has been generated recently by the possibility that many of these scuba sources could be agn . \n whether these agn are actually heating the dust is another matter ( see section 5 ) but there are now several independent lines of argument which suggest that agn are present in a significant fraction of these scuba sources . at the very least , the implication is that much of the star formation in the high redshift universe occurred in galaxies containing active quasars . \n first we present the arguments predicting an agn contribution , followed by recent observational evidence .      * * the analogy with ulirgs : * in many ways a significant agn fraction would not be a surprise . \n the scuba sources are exceptionally luminous systems , essentially the high redshift equivalents to local ulirgs . at the luminosities of the scuba sources ( @xmath7 ) we note that a least @xmath8 of local ulirgs show clear evidence for an agn @xcite . * * predictions based on agn luminosity functions : * one can estimate the agn contribution by transforming the x - ray luminosity function to the sub - mm waveband using a template agn sed . \n we estimate that @xmath9 of the sources in recent scuba surveys could contain agn , perhaps higher if one allows for compton - thick objects @xcite . \n major sources of uncertainty are in the extrapolation of local agn seds to high redshift , the dust temperature and in assuming the same underlying luminosity function for obscured agn . \n note that an independent but very similar analysis by manners et al ( in preparation ) predicts a lower fraction ( @xmath10 ) . \n * * re - radiating the absorbed energy : * another approach , also based on obscured agn models for the xrb , does not rely on uncertain seds but instead on thermally re - radiating the absorbed energy directly in the far - infrared @xcite . \n this method also predicts a significant agn fraction among the scuba sources ( @xmath11 ) although the exact prediction is strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature . * \n * scuba observations of high - z quasars : * observations of the most luminous , very high redshift quasars ( @xmath12 ) suggest that many are exceptionally luminous in the far - infrared / sub - mm , with sub - mm luminosities comparable to arp 220 @xcite . whether this emission is due to dust heated by the quasar or associated with starburst activity \n is unclear , but the lack of any correlation between the quasar power and the sub - mm luminosity would favour a starburst origin for the far - infrared emission . if one assumes that all high redshift quasars have similar sub - mm luminosities this would lead to a very large agn fraction in the deep scuba surveys ( @xmath13 ) . in reality \n , however , some weak correlation between quasar power and the associated starburst is likely to exist , which would reduce this fraction significantly . \n further sub - mm observations of high - z quasars are required to investigate these correlations .      * * the seds of detected scuba sources * : a recent analysis of the multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of scuba sources has suggested that @xmath14 are likely to be agn @xcite . * * spectroscopic identification : * although the identification of many scuba deep survey sources remains elusive ( perhaps indicating their exceptionally high redshift ) there are growing indications that a significant fraction harbour agn . \n the first clear - cut identification turned out to be an obscured qso @xcite and since then various surveys have been able to place limits on the agn fraction . from a study of @xmath15 sub - mm sources , barger and collaborators \n have placed a lower limit of @xmath16 on the fraction showing evidence for agn activity @xcite . \n of seven sub - mm sources studied in detail by ivison et al , at least @xmath17 show evidence for an agn @xcite . \n these estimates are in good agreement with the predictions of the various models outlined above . \n forthcoming deep x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm will push significantly fainter than ever before . in the soft x - ray band , \n we expect to reach at least an order of magnitude fainter than the deepest rosat surveys , while in the hard x - ray band the improvement is even more dramatic ( figure 1 ) \n . the puzzle of the xrb should therefore soon be solved , and we expect to detect large numbers of obscured agn and study their properties in detail . \n in addition , we will be able to detect typical quasars to very high redshift ( @xmath18 ) and hence assess the importance of quasar activity during those early epochs . \n these deep x - ray observations are potentially ideal for identifying agn in sub - mm surveys . \n the source densities expected are very similar ( @xmath19 deg@xmath20 ) and hence with the resolution of chandra in particular it will be possible to pick out the agn directly from their x - ray flux , with very little confusion . \n the @xmath21mjy survey of the uk scuba consortium is ideal for such a study ( figure 2 ) . \n this is the only wide area scuba survey being conducted , covering @xmath22 square arcminutes in @xmath23 contiguous regions . \n one of these regions is in the lockman hole ( which will be covered by chandra in pv time ) . \n the other is concentrated on the n2 region of the elais survey , where we have deep chandra and xmm observations planned ( pi : almaini ) . \n we will be able to detect the hard x - ray emission from the hidden agn _ and _ obtain a measurement of the absorbing column . \n if the equivalent width is high enough , in some cases xmm may even allow a redshift determination from an iron line detection \n several independent arguments now point to the conclusion that a significant fraction ( @xmath24 ) of the luminous sub - mm sources detected by scuba will contain agn . \n this points to a very important link between x - ray astronomy and the newly emerging sub - mm field , both of which provide probes of the obscured , high redshift universe . \n if a significant agn fraction is confirmed with forthcoming chandra / xmm surveys , considerable uncertainties will still remain . is the dust heated by the agn or by stellar processes ? \n if the agn is responsible , and their contribution is large , the recent conclusions about star - formation at high redshift may require significant revision . \n on the other hand the dust may be largely heated by stellar activity ( see @xcite ) but with the interesting implication that much of the star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies containing active quasars . \n it has recently been postulated that perhaps all quasars could go through an obscured phase during the growth of the black hole , a process which could be intimately linked with the formation of the galaxy bulge itself ( see @xcite ) . \n future surveys combining x - ray and sub - mm observations will provide a powerful tool for disentangling these processes .", "StartTimeOffset": 2257615751461, "RequestID": "a0b74073cc714234a0856456e18b13f9", "TotalTokens": 2720}
{"ContextTokens": 3049, "GeneratedTokens": 81, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum states encoded in optical fields are an obvious way to implement quantum communication protocols @xcite . \n the optical approach offers also a route towards scalable quantum computing , with the particularly promising linear - optics scheme of knill , laflamme , and milburn @xcite . \n optical fields are distinguished from standard qubit models of quantum information processing in two ways . \n first , photons are bosons that can occupy field modes in arbitrary numbers . \n although a qubit can be implemented as a superposition of a single photon in two orthogonal modes , the entire hilbert space describing optical fields has plenty of room to go beyond this standard , dual - rail representation . \n secondly , most important error mechanisms that affect optical fields have a specific form . \n this enables one to optimize strategies for shielding quantum information from their deleterious effects . \n the above features can be illustrated with the example of photon loss , also referred to in literature as amplitude damping . \n such a mechanism can be modeled as a transmission of optical fields through a partly reflecting beam splitter . \n this attenuates the transmitted field , leading to a random removal of photons from the initial state . \n the effects of photon loss can be dealt with by adopting the strategy of quantum error correction @xcite , which consists in designing so - called code subspaces in which qubits are protected from dominant errors . \n such codes can be constructed from states that contain more than one photon per mode @xcite , which makes them more efficient in terms of required numbers of photons and modes .    a natural method to manipulate optical codes \n is to use linear optics networks @xcite . in the simplest scenario , \n such networks are passive , i.e.  they do not involve auxiliary photons , conditional detection , or feed - forward operations . in this contribution \n we review the recent proof @xcite that even the simplest codes , which correct for just a single photon loss , can not be universally processed using passive linear optics only . \n as we will see below , the same properties that make the codes correctable for photon loss , also prohibit a range of linear - optics manipulations . \n logical qubits can be protected from the effects of errors by preparing more complex states of physical systems @xcite . \n such states span the so - called code subspace , within which an arbitrary quantum superposition remains preserved despite the occurrence of an error from a certain class . in the most elementary case , \n the subspace is spanned by two orthogonal states which we shall denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n the specific scenario we shall consider here is shielding logical qubits carried by optical fields from amplitude damping by encoding them in suitable multiphoton states . \n let us restrict our attention to errors induced by the loss at most one photon from the field . \n if we make two assumptions :    * the code is constructed in a subspace with a fixed total photon number , * the damping parameter is identical for all the modes involved ,    then the necessary and sufficient conditions for a code constructed in a system of bosonic modes to be robust against one - photon loss are given by @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the field modes , and the indices @xmath5 run over all of @xmath6 bosonic modes . \n the action of an operator @xmath7 on the code states can be interpreted as an event when a third party has observed in the leaked portion of the field one photon in the @xmath8th mode . \n the third party belongs to the external environment , and her actions , as well as the outcome of her measurement are of course unknown to the owner of the qubit . \n the equation @xmath9 implies a simple constraint : it must not be possible to pass between two orthogonal code states by moving just one photon between the modes , i.e.  annihilating it from the mode @xmath7 and creating one in the mode @xmath3 . starting from this observation , it is easy to construct two elementary examples of photon - loss codes using four photons distributed between two modes @xcite : @xmath10 are mutually orthogonal and have identical norms . \n a code subspace can be conveniently characterized with the help of the corresponding projection operator @xmath11 , which in our two - dimensional case takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a certain @xmath14 matrix . \n this matrix is hermitian , which is easily proven by considering the hermitian conjugation of eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) . \n a general passive linear optics transformation of a system of @xmath6 modes can be written as : @xmath15 where the operators @xmath3 describe the input representation , the operators @xmath16 refer to the output representation , and @xmath17 is a unitary @xmath14 matrix . \n the unitarity of the matrix @xmath18 guarantees the preservation of commutation relations for the field operators . \n any linear - optics transformation can be reversed , therefore the labels of input and output representations are purely conventional . \n let us now write the correctability condition given in eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) in the representation of the output modes @xmath19 . \n a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote respectively the transposition and the complex conjugation of the matrix @xmath18 . \n this means that after the application of the network @xmath18 the subspace @xmath11 remains a photon - loss code , and that the only change is the transformation of the matrix @xmath23 on the right hand side of the correctability condition . \n this property reflects the fact that in our error model the correctability condition is independent of the specific modal decomposition . \n indeed , the third party monitoring the leaked field can decompose it in an arbitrary basis of modes and measure them individually for the presence of a photon . because the damping coefficients are assumed to be identical for all the modes , such a procedure performed on the leaked field \n does not alter the error model . \n the fact that the photon - loss code is preserved by passive linear - optics transformations has important implications for encoding and decoding . \n suppose that we start from a qubit in the standard , dual - rail representation , with the aim of mapping it onto the encoded subspace . a simple way to accomplish this would be to combine it with auxiliary modes prepared in a certain state and apply a passive linear optics transformation . \n however , the reversed version of the argument presented above implies that if the output is a photon - loss code , then the input needs to be such a code as well . \n this means that the input qubit itself is protected against photon loss , which obviously is not the case for the dual - rail representation . \n the same applies to decoding : if we know a priori that no photon loss occurred , we can not convert the encoded qubit back into the dual - rail representation using a passive network . \n therefore , there can not exist a passive network that would work more universally for the input affected by errors and provide a decoded qubit with the error syndrome contained in the state of auxiliary modes . \n we will now consider single - qubit gates operating on the encoded qubit that can be implemented with passive networks . \n thus we are looking for networks that do not mix the code subspace @xmath11 with the remaining complement of the hilbert space . \n let us consider a linear - optics transformation of the annihilation operators given by eq . \n ( [ eq : linopttransf ] ) . \n the transformation of the modes induces a certain unitary operator @xmath24 in the hilbert space of the multimode bosonic system . \n the condition that the operator @xmath24 does not take us beyond the code subspace can be written as : @xmath25 the set of all networks that preserve the code subspace forms a group . \n let us now suppose that this group is continuous . \n this means that we can find a one - parameter subgroup composed of elements @xmath26 parameterized with a real parameter @xmath27 according to : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an @xmath14 hermitian matrix . \n mathematically , @xmath30 is an element of the lie algebra associated with the lie group of unitary @xmath14 matrices . \n the unitary operator @xmath31 can then be written as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the representation of the matrix @xmath30 for the multimode bosonic system . \n it is given by a bilinear combination of the creation and annihilation operators @xcite : @xmath34 the correctness of this expression can be verified by considering operators @xmath35 and writing differential equations for @xmath36 , whose solution recovers eq . \n ( [ eq : linopttransf ] ) with the transformation matrix given by eq . \n ( [ eq : gammas = exp - slambda ] ) . \n let us now consider an infinitesimal transformation of the form @xmath37 . \n the second term , given explicitly in eq . \n ( [ eq : rlambda ] ) , comprises a sum of expressions of the form @xmath38 that appear also in the correctability condition given in eq . \n ( [ eq : correctpc ] ) . \n it is easy to see that : @xmath39 where we introduced a real coefficient @xmath40 . inserting this result to eq . \n ( [ eq : prgammap = rgammap ] ) yields : @xmath41 this means that for general , not necessarily infinitesimal , operators @xmath31 we have @xmath42 . \n therefore the operator @xmath31 restricted to the code subspace generates only an irrelevant , uniform phase factor . \n consequently , there does not exist a continuous group of linear transformations that would produce non - trivial gates on the encoded qubit . \n we demonstrated in the preceding section that groups of transformations which can be implemented on photon - loss codes using passive networks must be discrete . for two examples of codes presented in section  [ sec : photonlosscodes ] \n these groups can be found analytically . in the case of the four - photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : fourphoton ] ) , one can use the parameterization of special unitary @xmath43 matrices in terms of euler angles to show easily that all gates preserving the code subspace are generated by two transformations given , up to overall phase factors , by : @xmath44 the above transformations are realized respectively by a balanced beam splitter and a @xmath45 phase shift . in order to gain an insight into the structure of the set of gates , it is helpful to consider transformations of the state @xmath46 . \n the application of @xmath47 and @xmath48 generates two other states given , up to phase factors , by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which together form an equilateral triangle in the bloch sphere of the encoded qubit , shown in figure  1(a ) . \n gates that can be implemented with passive linear optics form the rotation group of this triangle . \n a more lengthy , but still elementary reasoning @xcite shows that for the three - photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : threephoton ] ) the transformations preserving the code subspace are obtained from two generators : @xmath51 which correspond respectively to a tritter @xcite and a @xmath52 phase shift on one of the modes . \n starting from the initial state @xmath53 , these transformations generate a regular tetrahedron in the bloch sphere of the encoded qubit , with vertices corresponding to the states @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , shown in figure  1(b ) . as before , \n passive networks realize the rotation group of this solid .    ) and ( b ) the three photon code defined in eq . \n ( [ eq : threephoton ] ) . \n the points represent states that can be produced from the logic state @xmath1 using passive networks , and dashed lines depict rotations that are generated by unitary transformations defined respectively in eqs . \n ( [ eq:4phtr ] ) and ( [ eq:3phtr ] ) . ] \n we have shown that restrictions on manipulating photon -

{"ContextTokens": 3982, "GeneratedTokens": 65, "SynthesizedBody": "almost since the discovery of charm mesons , mixing of @xmath0 mesons have been sought in analogy to the well - known @xmath1 mixing . \n due to very effective gim suppression , the expected mixing rate in the charm system is much smaller than for kaons . only very recently , \n the babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations have reported the first evidence of charm mixing . \n these results have renewed the interest from the theory community as the observed mixing rate could be caused by physics beyond the standard model or at least provide additional constraints on new physics . \n none of the mixing measurement have a significance above four standard deviations , but several have similar precision for the mixing parameters . by combining the measurements we therefore obtain more precise values for the mixing parameters and exclude the no - mixing hypothesis with larger confidence . combining the different mixing measurements is not completely straightforward , since not all measurements are sensitive to the same charm mixing parameters . \n the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) in 2006 created a subgroup with the responsibility of providing averages of charm physics measurements . \n one of the high priority tasks of this group is to combine the charm mixing measurements into world - average values for the fundamental mixing parameters . \n the first average assuming cp conservation was shown at fpcp @xcite . besides those results \n , we here report the first results of combining mixing measurements where we allow for cp violation . \n mixing is present in the @xmath0 system if the mass eigenstates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , differ from the flavor eigenstates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n generally one can write @xmath6 . \n the variables of fundamental interest are the mass difference , @xmath7 and decay width difference , @xmath8 between the two mass eigenstates . \n traditionally , in charm mixing one uses the dimensionless variables , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average decay width . \n cp violation in mixing or in the interference between mixing and decay would manifest itself as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively is for the moment assumed to be independent of decay mode . ] . \n in addition cp violation could show up in the decay itself giving rise to decay mode dependent parameters . \n most measurements do not directly measure @xmath14 . \n for instance in mixing measurements using @xmath15 decays there is a unknown strong phase , @xmath16 , so the results obtained are for @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the averaging procedure , we first combine measurements of the same parameters to obtain the more precise observables . \n most measurements are performed using likelihood fits and the combination is therefore performed by multiplying likelihood functions from each measurement and finding the new maximum . by combining likelihoods , correlations between observables and possible non - gaussian tails are taken into account . for measurements which are not using likelihoods , \n we construct a likelihood using symmetrized , gaussian uncertainties . to combine different types of measurements , \n the different combined likelihoods are recalculated as a function of @xmath19 minimizing over any other variables . \n @xmath16 is included since there is both a direct measurement @xcite and by combining the @xmath15 measurement with the other measurement of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one can also get a precise measurement of @xmath16 . \n when plotting confidence contours for @xmath14 we minimize the likelihood over @xmath16 . \n the combining of likelihood functions is currently only done for the cp conserving case . in principle \n it can be done also for the cp violating case by simply having two more variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in the final likelihood function . \n unfortunately not all likelihoods are currently available for the measurements which allow for cp violation . \n a simple combination is therefore performed by forming a @xmath24 of all measurements expressed in terms of the fundamental mixing parameters . \n the @xmath24 assumes gaussian errors , but correlations between observables in each individual measurement is taken account by using the full covariance matrix for each result . \n the following averages were performed by adding log likelihoods from fits where cp conservation was assumed . \n one can observe charm mixing by finding a difference in the lifetime measured in decays to cp eigen states such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the mixed - cp decay @xmath27 . \n we combine six results @xcite from such analyzes . \n all of these measure @xmath28 . in the limit of cp conservation one has @xmath29 . \n the average of the six measurements is @xmath30 . \n this is @xmath31 from the no - mixing hypothesis . \n as can be seen from figure  [ fig : ycp ] , this average is mainly driven by the recent belle measurement . \n values and the hfag average.,width=302 ]      wrong - signed semileptonic decays provide a clean way of searching for charm mixing , but the measurements are only sensitive to the integrated mixing rate @xmath32 . \n four measurements @xcite are combined and give an average of @xmath33 . \n in addition to the semileptonic decays , @xmath34 can also measured in the analysis of fully hadronic decays . \n the semileptonic result is therefore combined from two hadronic analyzes @xcite and in addition an analysis of tagged decays at the @xmath35 @xcite . \n the combination is illustrated in figure  [ fig : rm ] and gives an average value of @xmath36 . in the transformation to a likelihood in @xmath14 \n , we ignore the non -

dimensional coverage probabilities of 68.27% , 95.45% , etc . \n , and therefore @xmath46 etc .     from the combination of @xmath41 , @xmath47 and @xmath14 from the time - dependent dalitz analysis of @xmath48.,width=302 ] \n as mentioned above , one can measure @xmath50 and @xmath51 using the doubly - cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) decay @xmath49 . \n the likelihood functions are available for two measurements @xcite of this type . \n these are combined and gives the averages @xmath52 and @xmath53 . \n the corresponding likelihood contours are shown in figure  [ fig : kpi ] .    . \n the wiggles in the 4 and @xmath45 contours for @xmath54 is a binning effect . \n , width=302 ]      the combined likelihood for @xmath49 decays can be expressed as a function of @xmath19 ignoring the part with @xmath54 . \n this likelihood can be combined with the likelihood from the combination of the other mixing results in section  [ sec : nonkpi ] which do not depend on @xmath16 . \n an additional constraint comes from a cleo - c measurement @xcite of @xmath55 , where a small dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath21 is ignored in the combination . \n figure  [ fig : all ] shows the likelihood contours in @xmath14 after minimizing over @xmath16 . \n the region around the central value is almost unchanged with respect to the result without the @xmath49 decays ( figure  [ fig : xy ] ) . \n this is also reflected in the over all average for @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are @xmath56 the @xmath49 measurements do not contribute much to the central value , because of the poorly known phase @xmath16 . \n however they do help exclude the no - mixing hypothesis and cause the dip seen in the contours close to @xmath57 . \n at @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 with respect to the minimum . \n this corresponds to a significance of the combined mixing signal of @xmath59 . \n the combination also gives an improved value for @xmath16 . \n this can be seen in the projection of the likelihood after minimizing over @xmath20 and @xmath21 in figure  [ fig : delta ] . \n the combination gives @xmath60 . without the cleo - c measurement of @xmath16 \n , there would be an equally good second minimum at @xmath61 . \n , from combining all mixing measurements . \n , width=302 ] \n measurements of charm mixing can be done without assuming cp conservation by fitting @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons as separate samples . \n most of the measurements above have done that and we therefore can combine those to also provide constraints on the cp violating parameters . when allowing for cp violation , the measured parameters are related slightly differently to the mixing parameters . for the lifetime ratio measurements , one has @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the measured relative lifetime difference for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for @xmath49 decays , \n the @xmath50 and @xmath51 measured for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 . for @xmath38 \n decays the measurement directly gives @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while for the @xmath34 analysis the results are not separated and therefore just measure @xmath32 . \n the measurement of @xmath16 from cleo - c is not done separately for @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons and is not included in the combined result allowing for cp violation .    in total 22 measurements \n are combined in a @xmath24-fit to extract seven parameters , the four mixing and cp violation parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and three characterizing @xmath49 , namely @xmath16 , the dcs rate @xmath70 , and the direct decay rate asymmetry @xmath71 . \n the fit gives @xmath72 and the following mixing parameters @xmath73 the mixing parameters are almost unchanged with respect to the cp conserving average . \n this is also seen from the confidence levels shown in figure  [ fig : xycpv ] . \n one can also draw the @xmath44 to @xmath45 confidence level contour for @xmath23 versus @xmath22 using @xmath74 . \n this is shown in figure  [ fig : qp ] . \n the no - cp violation hypothesis is seen to lie well within the @xmath75 contour . \n the combined results for the @xmath49 parameters are @xmath76 there is little change in @xmath16 with respect to the cp conserving average and no evidence for direct cp violation as @xmath71 is consistent with zero .     from combining mixing measurements with cp violation allowed . \n the dashed blue curve shows the @xmath75 contour from the cp conserving case for comparison.,width=302 ]     from combining mixing measurements with cp violation allowed.,width=302 ] \n evidence of charm mixing has been reported from several experiments in the last year . \n a new subgroup of hfag has performed an average of these and other existing charm mixing results . \n the combined result has a signal significance in excess of 5 standard deviations and gives the mixing parameters @xmath77 cp violation parameters have also been combined and gives @xmath78 this is fully consistent with no cp violation being present in charm mixing . \n hfag intends to periodically update these averages as new results become available in order to provide the most precise mixing parameters to the community . \n 99 b.  aubert _ et al . _ [ babar collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 98 * , 211802 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv : hep -

of - mass energy . \n this is because the impact of hadronisation , which blurs the view at the quarks and gluons , diminishes with a reciprocal power of the scale of the process . \n hence the distortion due to hadronisation effects at @xmath3  gev is only about @xmath12 of that at the z mass scale  @xcite . \n this article presents a scrutiny of the potential of the tesla linear collider to perform a determination of the strong coupling constant at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath3  gev . \n the study is restricted to an investigation based on monte carlo generator simulations using the pythia 5.722 @xcite , herwig 5.9 @xcite , and ariadne 4.8 @xcite programs which , except for herwig , have been tuned by the opal collaboration at lep  @xcite . \n these generators are used to simulate the production of quark - antiquark pairs from the annihilation . to account for the substantial production cross - section of massive gauge boson pairs ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , background from hadronic decays of z and w bosons is considered , where in addition also the decay w@xmath13 is included . \n all other leptonic decays of these massive bosons can easily be identified and , hence , rejected . \n likewise , background contributions from @xmath14 scattering and @xmath15 pair production are not included . \n their contribution can be removed very efficiently as is known from the experiments at lep ii ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . \n the production of top quarks leads to significant effects . \n this is due to its large mass and the appearance of typically three jets of particles from its decay . \n top quark events , therefore , appear rather spherically in the detector , thus immitating multijet events . \n figure  [ fig - top - distortions ] shows the impact of the pair - produced top quarks on the thrust observable and the jet rates , both of which are usually used to determine the value of the strong coupling constant . \n it is therefore indispensable to exclude the contribution from top quarks when performing an @xmath2 determination . \n the impact of initial state radiation is accounted for using its next - to - leading order treatment in the pythia generator . \n radiative events constitute a large fraction of the hadronic final states , especially radiative returns to the z pole . \n most of these can easily be rejected by requiring the reconstructed mass of the whole event to be close to the centre - of - mass energy of the colliding beams . \n such a cut on the effective centre - of - mass energy , @xmath16 , is usually applied in the hadronic event selection at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n it effectively takes out radiative z return events as can be seen in figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] . \n beamstrahlung , which is of relevance at a linear collider only , is simulated using the program circe 1.28  @xcite which has been interfaced to the pythia generator . \n when using the parameters proposed for the tesla linear collider , only a negligible fraction of the events is lost due to beamstrahlung ( see figure  [ fig - isr+bs ] ) if the cut @xmath17 is applied which is usually used by the lep experiments . \n to study the prospects of a determination of @xmath2 at the tesla linear collider , an integrated luminosity of @xmath18 fb@xmath19 has been simulated . \n this corresponds to roughly one year of data taking at the design luminosity of the collider . \n .[tab - no - of - events ] approximate number of events for @xmath18  fb@xmath19 and the cross - sections taken from pythia  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the error budget of an @xmath2 determination is compiled from different sources . since \n a perfect detector has been assumed , the corresponding experimental uncertainties are adopted from measurements at lep ii ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n effects due to the roughly @xmath20 background from boson pairs are neglected . \n the statistical uncertainty is estimated by considering a @xmath21 selection efficiency and an expected integrated luminosity of @xmath22 within one year . \n this corresponds to about @xmath23 million hadronic events which have been generated using the pythia generator employing the tuned set of parameters . \n the simulated events are used to assess the remaining uncertainties due to hadronisation corrections and due to the choice of the hadronisation parameters by fitting the @xmath4-matched second order ( @xmath5 ) and resummed calculations ( nlla ) to distributions of the observables in the hadronic final state . \n distributions from the thrust , heavy jetmass , total and wide jet broadening , @xmath24-parameter , and the @xmath25 to @xmath26-jet flip @xmath27 value , @xmath28 , obtained from the durham jet algorithm are used . \n hadronisation correction factors are applied to these distributions before fitting the theoretical expressions . \n the result of the fits is exemplified for thrust , heavy jetmass , wide jet broadening , and the jet flip in figure  [ fig - evshapes ] . in general good fits \n are obtained . \n however , for the heavy jetmass and the wide jet broadening an excursion of the fitted curve from the simulated data is visible at small values of these observables . \n this could indicate a problem of either the theoretical formulae or of the event generator program . \n the fit must , therefore , not go too far into this @xmath25-jet region , which represents the bulk of statistics indeed . \n finally , also the impact of a variation of the renormalisation scale factor , @xmath29 , is considered . as has become usual @xmath29 is varied from unity to @xmath23 and @xmath25 , respectively , assigning the change in @xmath30 as the uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalisation scale factor . \n table  [ tab - alphas - error - budget ] lists the individual contributions to the total uncertainty of @xmath2 at the z mass scale , @xmath31 . to calculate a total uncertainty , \n the individual error contributions from all six observables are averaged for each systematic variation individually . \n the total error is then obtained by adding the individual contributions in quadrature . excluding the uncertainty derived when \n choosing the herwig generator to correct for hadronisation effects , because it is not tuned to the lep data yet , the total error becomes @xmath32 . \n this error incorporates a significant contribution of about @xmath33 due to the scale uncertainty . \n it should be noted that it is of similar size as the typical error obtained by the lep and slc experiments . \n the error @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 . \n a feasibility study of the determination of the strong coupling constant , @xmath2 , at the tesla linear collider has been presented starting from the selection of hadronic events . \n neither initial state radiation nor beamstrahlung constitute a substantial problem for such a qcd investigation at this collider . \n the major background stems from the pair production of w and z bosons . \n both can be easily suppressed by cutting on the hemisphere masses and on the polar angle of the thrust axis . \n top quarks significantly distort event shape and jet rate distributions and must , therefore , also be excluded from an @xmath2 determination based on such observables . \n it has been found that a cut on the minimum value of the jet broadening effectively removes the contribution from top quarks without affecting the selection efficiency . \n the hadronisation corrections and the associated uncertainties are very small at tesla energies . \n however , the contribution from different hadronisation models could become a dominating source of error . \n fits of the @xmath4-matched second order and resummed calculations to six observables have been performed to assess the systematic uncertainties of the derived value of @xmath2 using data from monte carlo generators only . \n exerimental uncertainties have been adopted from the lep ii experiments and are found to be small . \n a very significant contribution to the total uncertainty of @xmath36 stems from the choice of the renormalisation scale . \n its absolute contribution will shrink with increasing centre - of - mass energy but the relative uncertainty is not diminished . to improve on the scale uncertainty theoretical calculations of third order in @xmath2 \n are absolutely required . \n i would like to thank the organisers of the third ecfa workshop which took place from november 7 -

{"ContextTokens": 1345, "GeneratedTokens": 148, "SynthesizedBody": "the scientific goal of applying the doppler imaging technique to ap stars , is to derive observational constraints on the diffusion mechanism in the presence of a stellar magnetic field . \n theoretical studies ( michaud et al , 1981 ; mgessier , 1984 ) which predict that certain elements raise , sink or move horizontally in magnetic stellar atmospheres need to be verified . this can only be achieved if an unambiguous correlation between the elemental abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry is obtained . however , two major problems are responsible for difficulties in reaching that goal . \n firstly , doppler imaging can ( presently ) only be applied to stars which have a fairly weak magnetic field and hence only the variation of the integrated longitudinal field strength ( effective field , @xmath0 ) is usually determined . \n this sets only weak limits to the ` real ' magnetic geometry . for objects with stronger fields \n the spectral line profiles are severely influenced by zeeman broadening and are not mainly caused by abundance variations . \n this limitation can be avoided by obtaining all four stokes parameters as a function of the stellar rotational phase . \n then zeeman doppler imaging codes ( donati , 1995 ) can be applied to calculate the magnetic field strength and surface orientation in combination with the abundance distribution . \n but these measurements of the stokes parameters are not yet available , though strong efforts are made to get them from polarimetry . \n secondly , in the past , only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon , rarely iron and chromium , not even all of them for each object . \n furthermore , these maps were based on inversions from single ` unblended ' spectral lines , which are difficult to find , especially in cooler ap stars . \n this introduced uncertainties leading to a questionable reliability of the derived maps and weakening their relevance to theoretical modelling . \n considering this situation , we focused our programme on the production of abundance maps of up to five and more elements on the surface of each of our target stars . a brief report on the stars and \n the progress of our project is given hereafter , followed by the presentation of results obtained for the magnetic ap star cu virginis . \n as pointed out before , one crucial limitation of doppler imaging in the past was that only a few elements were mapped , mostly silicon and occasionally iron and chromium . \n furthermore , the number of stars studied was not sufficient to draw general conclusions by relating the abundance maps to the approximate magnetic field structure , thereby providing new constraints on theory ( hatzes 1995 ) . \n in particular , the abundance maps of elements which are pushed upwards by radiatively driven diffusion should look severely different from those of elements that have a tendency to sink .        the helium map ( fig . \n 1 ) is characterized by a dominant spot which appears to be at the approximate position of the positive magnetic pole ( phase 0.5 ) . only in the central part of this spot \n does helium reach the solar abundance ; on all other parts of the stellar surface , it is depleted by about 1.5 dex . \n this result confirms theoretical predictions by vauclair et al . \n ( 1991 ) which have been obtained by modelling helium abundance in main sequence magnetic stars by introducing a weak wind of ionized metals at the magnetic poles , where the field lines are vertical .    in total contrast to that , \n silicon ( fig . \n 2 ) is strongly depleted in the helium spot but overabundant on the remaining visible surface . in these regions \n the magnetic field lines are mainly horizontal and as predicted by e.g. mgessier ( 1994 ) , silicon accumulates at the magnetic equator band . chromium and iron \n have surface structures very similar to that of silicon , but both elements are less enhanced compared to their solar abundances \n .    however , the magnesium ( fig . \n 3 ) distribution differs much from that of the other metals . \n the main feature is a ring centred at the helium spot ( magnetic pole ) , but with an the overall abundance deficiency of about 1 dex and much less contrast than all other elements . \n the helium spot distribution of cu vir was already found by hiesberger et al . \n ( 1995 ) , on the basis of data obtained in 1980 , which is an evidence for the high reliability of this result . \n also , the silicon abundance structure confirms earlier results published by hatzes ( 1995 ) . \n furthermore , there are strong indications that cu virginis has slowed down its rotation rate abruptly in the year 1985 ( pyper et al , 1998 ) . \n this effect has not been found in any other ap star and no theoretical explanation can be given at the moment .    nevertheless , the doppler imaging results for cu virgins are a good demonstration of how important it is to obtain the surface distribution of different elements for the same star . \n cu virginis is one of the very few objects for which a correlation of the abundance structures and the magnetic field geometry can be given with high significance . \n furthermore , it is planned to obtain the abundance distributions for elements like c , n , o and some rare earth species . \n this should complete the picture and may lead to a detailed theoretical modelling of diffusion processes interacting with the magnetic field of this star . \n donati , j .- f . : 1995 , in _ stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 _ , eds : k.g . \n strassmeier and j.l . \n linsky , kluwer , dordrecht , 53 hatzes , a.p . : 1995 , in _ stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 _ , eds : k.g . \n strassmeier and j.l . \n linsky , kluwer , dordrecht , 305", "StartTimeOffset": 2336411196534, "RequestID": "38427757f18248c0805b0887cb110c86", "TotalTokens": 1493}
{"ContextTokens": 2549, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) processes in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have been suggested as a probe to investigate the physics of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) collisions more than a decade ago and have become a cornerstone of the experimental heavy - ion program both at rhic and lhc . yet , compared with for instance the modelling of the bulk medium evolution using hydrodynamics where an era of precision fits to differential data has begun ( see e.g. @xcite ) , theoretical progress in the physics of hard probes is slow .    partially , this can be attributed to the structure of the problem : hard probes are at the same time sensitive to the microscopical degrees of freedom of the medium and the macroscopical medium density distribution and evolution . \n thus high @xmath0 observables have the capability to potentially do both tomography and transport coefficient measurements in the medium , i.e. to constrain its microscopical and macroscopical dynamics . \n while the microscopical physics of the medium and hence the basic structure of the parton - medium interaction is currently in detail unknown , the density evolution ( in terms of fluid - dynamical modelling ) is constrained by bulk data , but not unambiguously determined . as a result , the description of any single observable in terms of a parton - medium interaction scenario and a medium evolution model is usually far from unique and does not allow a firm conclusion with regard to either question . \n however , systematic multi - observable studies of a matrix of parton - medium interaction and medium evolution models can reduce the allowed model space significantly , resulting in a class of models which shows good consistency across rhic and lhc observables . \n in vacuum , at the core of the computation of hard processes in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is the factorization of the hard , short - distance interaction part and the long - distance physics of initial state parton distributions and final state parton showers . in a medium , \n qcd factorization is not strictly proven , but remains a plausible working assumption . \n a sufficiently large separation of hard and thermal momentum scale then ensures that the hard process itself receives no medium corrections and can serve as a standard - candle , producing high @xmath1 partons at a known and calculable rate . \n the partons emerging from the hard process are typically characterized by a large virtuality scale @xmath2 . \n if one takes the uncertainty relation to estimate the timescale at which intermediate shower states at lower virtuality can be formed , one finds @xmath3 with @xmath4 the virtual parton energy . comparing this scale with typical medium lifetimes @xmath5 fm \n , one finds that for typical rhic and lhc kinematics a significant part of the partonic shower evolution ( i.e. with @xmath6 ) takes place in the medium , with the shower being gradually boosted out of the medium at top lhc energies and on the other hand hadrons with large mass @xmath7 being produced in the medium . \n however , over a large kinematical range and for sufficiently light hadrons it can reasonably be assumed that the medium modification largely concerns the evolution of a parton shower with subsequent hadronization as in vacuum .    as a baseline example for in - medium shower modelling , consider a virtuality - ordered parton shower such as implemented in the pyshow algorithm @xcite \n this is treated as an interated series of splittings of a parent into two daughter partons @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 and where the virtuality of partons in terms of @xmath11 decreases in each branching . \n the splitting probability is given by        where @xmath13 are perturbatively calculable objects , the so - called splitting kernels . \n the splittings cease when the parton virtuality reaches a non - perturbative lower scale @xmath14 gev at which point a hadronization model needs to be used . in this way \n , the original high virtuality of the shower initiator is converted into the transverse momentum distribution of the final shower partons ( and the initial virtuality sets a kinematic bound for observables like jet shapes ) . \n an important thing to note is that the splitting kernels @xmath13 are scale invariant , i.e. they do not depend on an absolute momentum scale . as a result , \n the fragmentation functions generated by a series of splittings is self - similar ( the momentum distribution of hadrons in a subjet looks almost the same as the distribution in the whole jet when plotted as a function of @xmath15 ) and up to logarithmic corrections has no strong energy dependence .    estimating the timescale associated with the initial , hard branchings which largely determine jet shape and subjet structure , one finds @xmath16 fm , i.e. well before any medium can be formed . \n this gives rise to the expectation that subject structure and jet shape at high @xmath0 should not be very sensitive to medium modifications . \n there are two main processes by which this pattern can be modified in a medium : 1 ) direct loss of energy ( by elastic collisions , drag ,  ) into the medium as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath17 and 2 ) enhanced soft gluon radiation by medium - induced virtuality as parametrized by a transport coefficient @xmath18 . \n the first mechanism is in general incoherent and the energy is lost into the medium , the second mechanism involves a de - coherence time for the radiated gluon and transfers energy from the leading parton into an increased number of subleading shower partons . \n note that this distinction can be made on average on the basis of transport coefficients , but not for a single interaction graph with the medium which may involve both direct and radiative energy loss . \n a recently suggested additional mechanism is the modification of color flow by the medium , leading to a modification of the hadronic shower evolution @xcite . \n models may now be classified based on what part of the dynamics they include , how they treat the medium and how they solve the shower evolution equations . \n the most complete approach are models which simulate the whole in - medium shower evolution such as jewel @xcite , yajem @xcite , q - pythia @xcite or resummed higher twist ( ht ) @xcite . however , if one is only interested in observables which probe the leading shower fragments , such as single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron suppression , which probe dominantly showers in which a large fraction of the energy flows through a single parton , then leading parton energy loss modelling in which the medium evolution is cast into an energy loss probability @xmath19 before vacuum fragmentation is applied is sufficient . \n models of this type include the asw @xcite , amy @xcite or whdg @xcite frameworks . \n finally , in hybrid approaches a vacuum shower is computed down to some scale , then the produced partons are put on - shell and each propagated through the medium using a leading - parton energy loss model . \n an example for hybrid modelling is martini @xcite .    of considerable interest \n is how the medium is included into the modelling process . \n a number of models come with an explicit treatment of medium partons and their interaction with shower partons , typically as a thermal gas of quark and gluon quasiparticles @xcite . \n such a description requires that the medium is , at least to some degree , perturbatively tractable , which is not in line with the basic assumption underlying almost ideal hydrodynamical modelling which assumes that the medium is strongly coupled and the mean free path essentially vanishes . \n usually an explicit treatment of interactions with medium partons breaks the scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the momentum scale of the medium partons and below , while it largely remains intact above . \n in addition , the medium provides additional kinematic phase space for transverse shower broadening . \n a different approximation is to cast all medium effects into a modification of the splitting probability , in essence replacing @xmath20 with the detailed form of @xmath21 motivated by a specific physics scenario as done e.g. in q - pythia @xcite . \n such a prescription explicitly conserves energy and momentum inside the shower , i.e. there is no additional phase space for transverse broadening . \n it also perserves scale invariance of the fragmentation function , but it alters its shape to a different functional form .    finally , the medium can be ( without any explicit reference to its degrees of freedom ) appear via transport coefficients such as @xmath22 and alter the kinematics of propagating partons as implemented in yajem @xcite . \n this again breaks scale invariance of the fragmentation function around the medium momentum scale and below and leads to additional phase space for transverse broadening . \n there are two main strategies to solve the shower evolution equations  analytical and mote - carlo ( mc ) techniques . in general , analytical techniques \n get exact treatment of quantum interference effects while they often rely on kinematic approximations such as eikonal propagation or infinite parent parton energy which violate energy - momentum conservation . \n in contrast , mc frameworks usually have exact kinematics , but have to resort to phenomenological prescriptions for interference effects . \n it is immediately evident that the combination of all observables cuts the available model space down much more than any single observable . \n most of the constraints are provided by the combination of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath23 at lhc which probes the dynamics of leading partons in combination with a dihadron correlation @xmath24 which is a probe of subleading fragment dynamics . \n current jet measurements do not have strong constraining power beyond this , however they do highlight the need to go beyond a purely probabilistic implementation of medium modification and also provide constraints for transverse dynamics of showers . \n a number of conclusions with regard to the nature of jet - medium interaction can be drawn from this :    * the combined data is compatible with a fairly standard pqcd picture of medium - induced radiation and a subleading component of elastic interactions leading to energy transfer into the medium * there is no evidence for exotic scenarios , the data neither indicate an @xmath25 dependence of energy loss as suggested by some variants of ads / cft inspired models nor a modification of the hadronization stage . * \n data from rhic and lhc consistently indicate that some moderate amount of energy is transferred from the hard parton directly into the non - perturbative medium rather than into subleading jet fragments . \n however , the amount of direct energy transfer is constrained by pathlength - dependent observables and found to be significantly smaller than if the medium can be described as a near - ideal quark - gluon gas . \n this may imply that the observed degrees of freedom in the medium are massive or correlated quasiparticles .    to make these conclusions more quantitative , \n further high - statistics multi - differential measurements are needed from the experimental side , followed by systematic multi - observable studies from theory . \n in particular , the systematics of h - h , jet - h and @xmath26-h correlations ( with decreasing geometry bias ) as a function of the reaction plane angle for various system centralities is expected to be a sensitive probe of both the parton - medium interaction mechanism and the medium density evolution . \n once these questions are reliably addressed , the precise nature of the mechanism by which the energy deposited from hard partons is carried by the medium presents itself as the next goal .", "StartTimeOffset": 2352765883720, "RequestID": "fd2a455ccad14cd28f3d9577fd4fa745", "TotalTokens": 2728}

pulse search reprocessing of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey data . \n currently @xmath070 of these sporadic pulsars are known . for these \n , we can calculate times - of - arrival and determine timing solutions , by using single pulses instead of the commonly used folded profiles . \n timing solutions are crucial to understand their relation to other pulsars and the nature of their emission .    here \n we introduce our results for six rrats , along with a comparison between rrats and normal pulsars . \n five of these rrats were discovered in a re - analysis of the parkes multibeam survey data and one was discovered through a gbt drift - scan survey . \n classical search algorithms based on fourier techniques or folding do not detect rrats . in stead \n we search for individual pulses with signal - to - noise ratio above some threshold ( typically 5@xmath1 ) in a number of trial - dm time series . \n then , once a rrat is discovered , the first step in our timing analysis is to identify which pulses are from the rrat . \n we do this by searching for pulses which are brighter at the dm of the rrat than at zero dm . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows an example of the single - pulse search output for a nearly one - hour observation of psr j1048@xmath25838 . \n we see very bright bursts peaking at dm of 69 pc/@xmath3 which differ from the signals peaking at dm of 0 pc/@xmath3 that are due to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . \n the pulsar only turns ` on ' for six minutes of this observation . \n to get a timing solution for a rrat , we must first calculate the spin period . \n we do this by measuring differences between pulse arrival times and calculating the greatest common denominator . \n once a period is known , we bin the data into single pulse periods and calculate times - of - arrival ( toas ) as the peak for each detected pulse . we have calculated timing solutions for six rrats . \n psr j1048@xmath25838 has the longest span of observation of these rrats : four years of post - discovery timing observations and a 13-year span including the discovery . \n note that this rrat was found in an even later reprocessing of the parkes multibeam survey after the initial rrats ( keane 2010 ) . \n the timing residuals shows good phase connection to its earlier discovery . \n we have calculated timing solution for this and five other rrats . \n the periods are : 1.231s ( psr j1048@xmath25838 ) , 0.503s ( psr j1623@xmath20841 ) , 1.818s ( psr j1739@xmath22521 ) , 1.320s ( psr j1754@xmath23014 ) , 0.933s ( psr j1839@xmath20141 ) , and 0.414s ( psr j1848@xmath21243 ) . \n they have surface magnetic fields ranging from 4@xmath410@xmath5 g to 4@xmath410@xmath6 g , spin -

scargle analysis ( scargle 1982 ) on the unevenly sampled pulse arrival times of psr j1048@xmath25838 to see if there are any periodicities in the timeseries . \n the spectrum gives the most significant periodic signal to be of period 19.15 hours with significance level of 1.95 @xmath1 . \n this is much lower significance than the periodicities of similar timescale reported by palliyaguru et al . \n ( 2011 ) for other rrats . \n at this time , 21 of roughly 70 rrats have timing solutions with period and period derivative , shown on the @xmath10 diagram in figure [ fig3 ] . \n we applied the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks test ) to the rrat and normal pulsar populations to see how their spin - down properties compare ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . \n the largest differences between the two groups are found in the distributions of period and magnetic field . while selection effects may be responsible for some of the period dependence , as longer period pulsars are more likely to be detected with higher signal -

{"ContextTokens": 3366, "GeneratedTokens": 276, "SynthesizedBody": "in a recent paper , tananbaum et al . ( 1997 ) have reported a detailed analysis of a rosat pspc observation of j2310 - 43 , a very peculiar and interesting galaxy firstly discovered as a luminous x - ray source ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) in an _ einstein _ \n ipc image ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) . \n the ipc data showed that the x - ray source is spatially extended . \n this , combined with the fact that the galaxy is a cd in cluster ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) supported the hypothesis that the x - ray emission is due to the cluster , rather than to the activity of the galaxy itself . however , on the basis of the x - ray spatial and spectral analysis of the pspc data , tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggested that only 20% of the total x - ray emission comes from the cluster , while the bulk is associated with a nuclear activity of the galaxy . \n optical spectroscopy of the galaxy ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) , however , did not reveal the emission lines or the excess blue continuum expected if j2310 - 43 contains an active nucleus . \n another interesting possibility considered by tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) , is that j2310 - 43 is related to the bl lac phenomenon . \n the lack of emission lines in the optical spectrum would apparently support this view . \n furthermore , the broad band energy distribution of j2310 - 43 , i.e. the position of the object in the @xmath6 plane ( tananbaum et al . \n 1997 ) , falls at the edge of the region occupied by bl lac objects ( stocke et al . \n on the other hand , the same authors show that the ( b - v ) color observed in j2310 - 43 is consistent with that of a normal elliptical galaxy and it is rather different from that of a typical bl lac object . \n the resulting picture is rather intriguing with contradicting or inconclusive evidences as for the presence of  nuclear activity \" . indeed \n tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) leave open the question whether j2310 - 43 belongs to the tail of the bl lac population or to a different class of objects and point out similarities with the optically dull galaxies with strong nuclear x - ray emission discovered by elvis et al . \n ( 1981 ) . \n the spectroscopic data on j2310 - 43 , however , were limited to the 4700- 6700   interval thus excluding two regions critical for the understanding of the nature of the source : that of the ca ii break ( expected at @xmath74355 ) and of the @xmath0 line ( expected at @xmath77145 ) . \n in fact agns showing no @xmath8 and [ oiii ] lines but exhibiting a broad @xmath0 line are known to exist ( stocke et al . \n 1991 ; see also halpern , eracleous & forster 1997 ) . \n for these reasons the possibility that j2310 - 43 is hosting a reddened seyfert nucleus or a bl lac object could not be completely ruled out .    with the aim of further studying j2310 - 43 and understanding its real nature we have therefore secured two optical spectra covering the wavelength range 3700  @xmath9 9800 . \n spectroscopy of j2310 - 43 was carried out with the eso 3.6 m telescope on 1996 december 10 . \n observations were made with efosc1 in longslit mode , using a 1.5 arcsec wide slit and two different grisms , b300 and r300 , with wavelength coverage from 3700   to 6800   and from 6200   to 9800 , respectively . \n the dispersions achieved with the two grisms , scaled to the tek512 ccd detector , were 6.3  / pixel ( b300 ) and 7.5  / pixel ( r300 ) . \n the exposure time was of 600 sec with the grism b300 and of 300 sec with the r300 . \n the data were reduced using the iraf - longslit package . \n the wavelength solution was obtained using a he - ar reference spectrum while the correction for the instrument response was based on the observation of a photometric standard ( ltt 377 ) . \n we did not make an absolute flux calibration , thus the flux density scale of the spectra is in arbitrary units . \n the calibrated spectra are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] . \n the spectra presented in figure  [ fig1 ] cover a wavelength range considerably larger than that of the spectrum discussed in tucker , tananbaum & remillard ( 1995 ) . \n in particular , the region of the [ oii ] , caii break ( @xmath2 4355 ) and the region where h@xmath10 is expected ( 7145 ) are fully covered . \n no emission lines appear in the spectrum , which shows only the typical absorption features of a `` normal '' early type galaxy . from the main absorption features seen ( ca ii h&k , g band , h@xmath11 , mgi 5175 , na i d ) we have computed a redshift of @xmath12 , confirming the value found by tananbaum et al . ( \n 1997 ) . \n the first result worth noting is the absence of h@xmath10 in emission . \n the fact that no emission lines are present from [ oii ] to [ nii ] definitively put to rest the possibility that a seyfert nucleus is hiding in j2310 - 43 . \n secondly , we note that a pronounced ca ii contrast is detected . \n we have computed its amplitude following dressler & shectman ( 1987 ) , i.e. by estimating the average fluxes ( expressed in unit of frequency ) between 3750-3950  ( @xmath13 ) and between 4050-4250   ( @xmath14 ) in the rest - frame of the source ; the contrast is then defined by : @xmath15 we have found , using the central part of the spectrum to minimize the stellar contribution , a ca ii contrast of 38% @xmath1 4.0% , which is below the mean value found for a `` normal '' elliptical galaxy ( @xmath2 50% , dressler & shectman 1987 ) .    if one considers the `` canonical '' limit of 25% for the definition of a bl lac object ( stocke et al . \n 1991 ) then j2310 - 43 can not be considered a bl lac . on the other end march et al . \n ( 1996 ) have proposed that objects with a ca ii contrast below 40% are likely to have an extra source of continuum , besides stellar , and consequently they have to be considered as possible low - luminosity bl lac candidates . \n the observed contrast can be used to set limits on the presence of such a non - stellar continuum , at least in the wavelength range 3700  @xmath9 4300  ( object rest frame ) . to this end , we have considered the spectrum of a `` normal '' galaxy , showing a ca ii contrast of about 60% . \n then , we have `` added '' a non - stellar continuum to the spectrum , in the form of a power - law ( @xmath16 ) with a spectral index ranging from 0 to 2 , and we have computed the ca ii contrast as a function of the fraction of non - stellar over stellar continuum . \n our results show that the ca ii contrast is about 40% if the non - stellar contribution is approximately equal to the stellar continuum , ( integrated between 3750  and 4250 ) . \n values of the contrast of @xmath17 25% ( the limit used to define a bl lac object ) are obtained when the non - stellar contribution is about 3 times or more higher than the stellar continuum . \n thus , in j2310 - 43 , which has a ca ii `` contrast '' of @xmath18 , the non - thermal component can still be present but at an intensity level comparable or lower than the fraction of the stellar continuum falling in the extraction region within the slit aperture . \n we have also extracted the spectrum of j2310 - 43 considering only the outer region of the galaxy , thus minimizing the contribution of the nucleus , and we have found that the ca ii `` contrast '' increases to 47%@xmath15% . we consider this as a further evidence that j2310 - 43 harbors in its nucleus a weak source of non - thermal continuum that can be detected only if the stellar contribution falling in the aperture is kept at a minimum . \n these results are consistent with the observed color of j2310 - 43 ( determined for the whole galaxy ) that indicates a negligible non - stellar contribution in the optical band , as discussed by tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) .    in conclusion , \n the spectroscopic observations of the galaxy j2310 - 43 presented here support the interpretation that this object represents the faint tail of the bl lac population , in which the extra source of continuum is present but does not contribute significantly to the optical spectrum . \n further observations ( polarization , radio spectral index , high resolution x - ray spectroscopy , etc . ) \n are obviously needed to characterize the presence of such non - thermal continuum emission in j2310 - 43 . \n it is worth noting that a similar object ( e0336 - 248 ) has been recently discovered by halpern et al . \n also in this case , the computed ca ii `` contrast '' ( 33% ) does not meet the nominal criterion of @xmath17 25% for classification as a bl lac object . nevertheless , these authors have produced convincing evidence for the presence of a non - stellar continuum in the spectrum of e0336 - 248 and , consequently , for its classification as a weak bl lac object . \n clearly , a re - assessment of the ca ii `` contrast '' criterion for the definition of a bl lac is needed . \n tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) ask  how common are sources such as j2310 - 43 ? \n \" we have reason to believe that they may be more common than currently recognized . \n we have recently initiated a survey of radio emitting x - ray sources ( the rex survey , caccianiga et al . \n 1997a , 1997b ) with the aim of selecting a new large sample of bl lac objects and radio loud quasars . to enter the sample , a source has to be detected in a pointed rosat pspc observation _ and _ in the vla nvss survey , above \n well defined flux limits and thresholds . during the optical identification program of the rex sources we have already found six objects that are similar to j2310 - 43 . \n the properties of these objects will be presented and discussed in detail elsewhere ; here we recall that , like j2310 - 43 , they have x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath19 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and radio luminosity in the range @xmath20 ( 1.4 ghz ) . \n they are all radio loud ( @xmath21 0.35 ) and they all have a caii  contrast \" between 25% and 40% and no emission lines in their spectrum . \n they do not seem to lie preferably in a cluster environment . \n we note that these six objects have been found out of @xmath22 new spectroscopic identifications . \n it is unfortunate however that , given the very low identification rate so far obtained for the rex survey , we can not , at present , make an estimate of the space density of these objects . \n we thank h. tananbaum for useful comments on an earlier version of this paper and a. wolter for bringing to our attention the work on e0336 - 2248 . this work has received partial financial support from the italian space agency ( asi contract 95-rs-72 dmd . \n 161fae/2 , asi ars-96 - 71 dmd . \n caccianiga , a. , della ceca , r. , maccacaro , t. , & wolter , a.,1997a , submitted to apj caccianiga , a. , della ceca , r. , maccacaro , t. , ruscica , c. , & wolter , a. 1997b , mem . \n astr . it . \n 68 , 325 dressler , a. , & shectman s. 1987 , aj , 94 , 899 elvis , m. at al . \n 1981 , apj , 246 , 20 halpern , j.p . , \n eracleous , m. , & forster , k. 1997 , aj in press march , m.j.m . , \n browne , i.w.a . , \n impey , c.d . , & smith , p.s . \n 1996 , mnras 281 , 425 stocke , j.t . \n 1991 , apjs , 76 , 813 tananbaum , h. , tucker , w. , prestwich , a. , & remillard , r. 1997 , apj 476 , 83 tucker , w. , tananbaum , h. , & remillard , r. 1995 , apj , 444 , 532", "StartTimeOffset": 2420918780442, "RequestID": "ff63e6c1765d4b08a5e3aa50f577c7c9", "TotalTokens": 3642}

torus must be dualized into the scalar fields . \n moreover , in order for the supergravity to gauge , the chern - simons term ( rather than the yang - mills term ) must be required in the lagrangian . \n recently the supersymmetric vortex solutions in @xmath0-gauged @xmath15 supergravity whose scalar sector is an arbitrary khler manifold with @xmath0 isometry were constructed  @xcite . \n it has been found that the einstein equations and the matter field equations of the model can be recast into a set of self - duality equations for a specific eighth - order choice of the higgs potential which reduces to the sixth - order potential of the flat space model when the newton gravitational coupling constant is set to zero . \n the abelian chern - simons higgs model in three - dimensional minkowski space - times and its vortex solutions were studied by  @xcite . \n it was shown that the model with a specific sixth - order higgs potential admits topologically stable vortex solutions and non - topological soliton solutions with nonzero flux and charge , which satisfy the bogomolnyi - type or the first order self - duality equations  @xcite . in the bogomolnyi limit \n , there is a ( first - order ) phase transition point between the symmetric ( non - topological solutions ) and the asymmetric phase ( topological vortex solutions ) .    in this paper , we construct the non - topological solitons , which do not preserve the supersymmetry , in three - dimensional @xmath0-gauged @xmath1 supergravity and find the region where the solutions can exist for various value of a cosmological constant . \n a further motivation for studying the non - topological solitons is that this model provided us with the simplest model of relativistic stars as self - gravitating systems . \n rotating boson stars with large self - coupling constant in three dimensions were studied in  @xcite , for example . \n the study of the non - topological soliton will lead to a new aspect of the self - gravitating systems . \n the organization of this paper is as follows ; in the next section we introduce the model and the basic ingredients . for the construction of the @xmath0-gauged @xmath16 , @xmath1 supergarvity lagrangian \n , we refer the reader to the existing literature  @xcite . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the khler manifold and a circularly symmetric ansatz for the metric which approaches asymptotically the btz configuration  @xcite , which is asymptotically anti - de sitter space ( rather than asymptotically flat ) and does not preserve the supersymmetry in general . in this setting \n we obtain numerically the non - topological solitons with zero - winding number case for various values of a cosmological constant . in the section  [ sec:4 ] \n , we show the numerical results and discuss the relation among the physical parameters for various values of a cosmological constant . \n in this section we consider ungauged @xmath1 three - dimensional supergarvity . assuming a @xmath0 isometry of the khler potential \n , we apply the noether procedure to obtain the @xmath0-gauged @xmath1 supergarvity  @xcite . \n the field content of the ungauged theory is the following .    * \n the @xmath1 supergravity multiplet @xmath17 contains a graviton  @xmath18  and two gravitini which are assembled into one complex spinor @xmath19 . * \n the @xmath1 scalar multiplet @xmath20 contains the fermions @xmath21 and scalars @xmath22 with @xmath23 , respectively in the complex notation . \n the matter sector is obtained by @xmath24 copies of the @xmath1 scalar multiplet . \n the scalar fields define a khler manifold of real dimension @xmath25 , characterized by its khler potential @xmath26 . \n it is assumed that the ungauged @xmath1 supergarvity is invariant under the global @xmath0 isometry . as in the maximally gauged supergravity theories  @xcite , \n the chern - simons term is required , in order to gauge the @xmath0 khler isometry . \n note that this term is topological and hence does not introduce new propagating degrees of freedom in the gauged theory . \n moreover , the @xmath27-dependent terms , due to the chern - simons terms , give rise to extra terms in supersymmetry transformations . in order to compensate these terms , \n the extra yukawa - type bilinear fermionic terms and a scalar potential must be added to the lagrangian \n .    then the bosonic parts of the @xmath0-gauged @xmath16 , @xmath1 supergarvity lagrangian is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a covariant derivative and @xmath30 denotes the khler metric @xmath31 . \n @xmath32 is an abelian field strength and @xmath27 is a gauge coupling constant . \n @xmath33 is a real scalar potential , which will be mentioned in the next section . \n we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) considered in the preceding section . \n we adopt a single complex scalar field case , that is @xmath34 . \n moreover we assume that the @xmath35 is a function of @xmath36 only and the khler potential is @xmath37 in order to obtain the canonical kinetic term for the scalar field . \n we thus find that the @xmath38 is unity . \n then , the eighth - order scalar potential is reduced to : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary real constant parameters . \n we assume the three - dimensional metric for a circularly symmetric spacetimes as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    for the single complex scalar field , we also assume the following dependence on the coordinates : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only and @xmath49 is a constant . \n we impose the boundary condition that @xmath50 approaches zero when the radial coordinate @xmath46 is taken to infinity , in order to obtain the non - topological soliton .    for the vector field @xmath51 , we choose the gauge , in order to require finite energy solution for the scalar field at radial infinity , in which @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath46 only .    varying the lagrangian with respect to the gauge field , the scalar field and the metric yields equations of motion . \n the equation of motion for the chern - simons term induces the first order equations @xmath55 and two of these equations take the form @xmath56 and the third one ( @xmath57 ) is automatically satisfied . \n the scalar field equation is reduced to the form : @xmath58    the einstein equation is also reduced to : @xmath59,\\\\   \\frac{\\delta}{r}\\delta'&=&-2\\kappa^2\\left   [ \\frac{e^{2\\delta}}{\\delta}g^2r^2   ( w+\\omega p)^2+\\delta(r')^2\\right],\\\\   \\frac{\\delta}{2r^2}(r^3e^{\\delta}\\omega')'&= &   2\\kappa^2g^2r^2pe^{\\delta}\\frac{w+\\omega p}{r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we set the metric which approaches asymptotically the btz solution when the scalar field falls into a vacuum of the negative value at radial infinity . in this setting , one can find that the cosmological constant @xmath60 is obtained to be @xmath61 and as analyzed in  @xcite , the physical parameters ( the btz mass , the angular momentum and the magnetic flux ) is the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a sufficiently large value for radial coordinate @xmath46 . \n these equations unfortunately can not be solved analytically . \n then we will find the numerical solution . in the next section , \n we discuss the relation among the physical parameters for various values of a cosmological constant . \n in this paper , we have numerically constructed the non - topological solitions in three - dimensional @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity . \n the non - topological soliton does not preserve the supersymmetry , in general , because the metric is described by the btz solution at radial infinity . \n we have found that the region of the solutions can exist for the non - topological solitons in fig .  1 , shown with the btz mass @xmath66 , the angular momentum @xmath67 and the magnetic flux @xmath68 for various values of the cosmological constant @xmath60 . in fig .  2 , we find two branches in a sequence of the solutions which are obtained numerically by the different conditions ( values of the scalar field and the vector field at the origin ) . \n one branch is the solutions from the origin to the maximal value of the @xmath66 , the other is from the point @xmath69 to the maximal value . as studied in  @xcite , one can also compare the results with black hole physics . in the case of the black hole \n , it is known that a black hole with a larger angular momentum than the critical one has a naked singularity and can not be the usual black hole . \n moreover there is the relation @xmath70 which is satisfied by the extreme black hole . \n if the non - topological soliton becomes a black hole , the soliton with @xmath71 can become the usual black hole . \n the non - topological soliton with @xmath72 can not be the usual black hole and the soliton with a large mass can certainly become an extreme black hole . \n thus , the region of the solutions for the non - topological solitons is plausible as self - gravitating systems because all of the maximal values for the soliton s mass exist in the area @xmath71 . in fig  3 , \n if we fit the plotted line with a solid line , one can find that the @xmath67 is proportional to the square of the @xmath68 . \n this is the same results as in the minkowski space - time case , as known in  @xcite . \n therefore , the relation between the angular momentum and the magnetic flux is not dependent of the cosmological constant . \n there is a phase transition point between the symmetric and the asymmetric phase in the abelian chern - simons higgs model in minkowski space - times . on the other hands , in the @xmath0-gauged @xmath64@xmath65 supergravity \n , differed from the usual phase transition , there is not a non - topological soliton in the transition point because the metric approaches asymptotically anti de - sitter space - time \n . it may be crucial in cosmological situation though this model has still three - dimensions .    in the present paper , \n we have treated the soliton with zero - winding number case , i.e. @xmath73 only . \n we will further investigate the binding energy , the stability of the soliton . \n the authors would like to thank n.  kan for useful advice . \n m.  baados , c.  teitelboim and j.  zanelli , phys .  rev \n .  lett .  * 69 * , 1849 ( 1992 ) ; m.  baados , m.  henneaux , c.  teitelboim and j.  zanelli , phys .  rev .  * \n d48 * , 1506 ( 1993 ) . for a review of btz black holes , s.  carlip , class . \n * 12 * , 2853 ( 1995 ) gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3490, "GeneratedTokens": 313, "SynthesizedBody": "among the most interesting new classes of materials under intense investigation in spintronics@xcite are the so - called multiferroics which combine several ferroic orders like ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity , ferroelasticity etc.@xcite the compounds combining the electric and magnetic order@xcite have several potential applications like magnetic - field sensors and electric - write magnetic - read random - access memories.@xcite magnetic order and ferroelectricity have different origins@xcite and thus the materials exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect are few and the coupling between the magnetic and electric properties is weak . \n an alternative route to achieve a strong coupling could be the growth of thin film heterostructures and several advances have been made towards the magnetic control of ferroelectricity@xcite and the electric control of thin film magnetism.@xcite    bismuth ferrite is probably the most studied representative of magnetoelectric materials . \n bulk bifeo@xmath0 crystallizes in a perovskite - like pseudocubic structure instead of a ferrite one and is classified as a ferroelectric g - type antiferromagnet.@xcite several first - principles calculations have been carried out to study the properties of bulk bifeo@xmath0@xcite and we refer readers to ref . for an overview of the literature on this compounds . since the single - component crystals like bifeo@xmath0 present only a weak magnetoelectric effect , \n an alternative route to achieve a more strong effect has been proposed to be the growth of heterostructures where epitaxial strain can enhance the phenomenon.@xcite thus first - principles calculations of such heterostructures involving alternating layers of bifeo@xmath0 and various spacers can serve as a test - ground to study the behavior of electric and magnetic properties of films . \n the study of the latter in the case of ultrathin epitaxial films is the aim of the present manuscript .    in a recent publication ( ref . ) \n we have presented extended first - principles calculations , employing the quantum - espresso@xcite ab - initio electronic structure method in conjunction with the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - erzenhof formulation,@xcite on the electronic and magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 alloy as a function of the lattice constant in the case of the cubic perovskite structure ( see figure 1 in ref . ) . in ref . \n we have extended this study to cover also the case of mn substation for fe . \n all compounds under study in these two references exhibited significant magnetic properties with spin magnetic moments at the fe and mn sites of the order of 3 @xmath1 . \n in the present contribution we expand these two studies using the same ab - initio method with grids of the same density in the * k*-space to cover also the case of ultrathin epitaxial films . \n although these films are ideal cases and can not be , with few exceptions , be realized experimentally , they can serve as starting point to understand the interplay between the interface structure and the magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 films with other spacers . for completeness we took into account three different spacers to cover different cases of electronic properties at the interface : inp semiconductor , metallic v and ferromagnetic fe . \n in section ii we present the structure of the multilayers and the results for the case of the inp spacer , in section iii the cases of fe and v metallic spacers and finally in section iv we present the main conclusions of our work . \n along the [ 001 ] direction bifeo@xmath0 can be considered to consist of alternating layers of bio and feo@xmath2 as shown in fig . \n the in - plane unit cell is a square of the same lattice constant as the cubic unit cell of the bulk bifeo@xmath0 . \n inp crystallizes in the zincblende structure , similar to gaas , as most of the iii - v semiconductors , and has an experimental lattice constants of 5.87  . along the [ 001 ] direction \n , the zincblende structure can be viewed as consisting of alternating pure in and pure p atomic layers as shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] . to fully describe the zincblende structure we have to consider , except the in and p atoms , also the occurrence of vacant sites ( voids ) \n ; there are exactly two no - equivalent voids within the zincblende unit cell . as shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] along the [ 001 ] direction there are not two but four alternating non - equivalent atomic layers . \n the difference between the a(b ) and c(d ) layers is that the in(p ) atoms have exchanged sites with the voids . \n this exchange of atomic positions is important since it lead to four non - equivalent interfaces between inp and bifeo@xmath0 in our study . \n finally we have to mention that the lattice constant of inp coincides with the bifeo@xmath0 lattice constant multiplied by the square root of two : @xmath3 . \n thus as shown in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the diagonal of the bifeo@xmath0 two - dimensional square unit cell can be assumed to be the side of the corresponding unit cell of the inp ( denoted with red color in the figure ) and thus epitaxial growth between inp and bifeo@xmath0 can be assumed . \n ( b ) possible terminations of the bifeo@xmath0 alloy along the [ 001 ] direction . with the red lines we denote the limits of the two - dimensional unit cell of inp ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) which has a lattice constant : @xmath4 . ]    for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 multilayers we studied four different cases with respect to the relative position of the atoms at the interface between the two spacers . along the growth axis we took into account eight atomics layers which are repeated in the [ 001 ] direction . \n initially we studied the structure ... feo@xmath2//in / p / in / p / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//in ... , and thus in the first case we have two non - equivalent interface in our structure : a p / bi and an in / fe ones . \n a close examination of figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] reveals that , in the case just mentioned : ( a ) with respect to the p / bi interface p atoms are situated in the diagonal connecting bi atoms ( compare ( a ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] with the d layer in fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) , and ( 2 ) with respect to the in / fe interface in atoms are situated in the midpoint between fe nearest neighbors ( take into account a layer in fig . [ fig2 ] and combine it with the ( b ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . \n direction taking into account also the vacant sites . \n the structure is built using four alternating pure atomic layers a , b , c and d. the difference between a(b ) and c(d ) is that the in(p ) atoms and the voids have exchanged sites . ]    in the second case under study in and p atoms have exchanged sites with respect to the first case under study and thus now we have along the [ 001 ] direction a ... feo@xmath2//p / in / p / in / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//p ... structure , _ \n i.e. _ the inequivalent interfaces are now in / bi and fe / p . \n notice that as in the fe / in interface in case 1 , also in the p / fe interface , which occurs in case 2 , the p atoms at the interface are located in the midpoints between the fe atoms ( if we examine only the in - plane projection of the multilayer ) just above the oxygen atoms and this results to vanishing magnetism in case 2 under study as will be discussed later in the next subsection . \n as we mentioned above the structure of inp along the [ 001 ] direction should be viewed as consisting of four atomic layers ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) since voids play a crucial role in interfaces . if in the two previous cases 1 and 2 we exchange layer a(b ) with layer c(d ) in fig . \n [ fig2 ] we get two new cases 3 and 4 with different arrangement of the atoms at the interface . in case 3(4 ) , the succession of the atomic layers is similar to case 1(2 ) . \n when we compare case 1(2 ) with case 3(4 ) , we conclude that the p(in)/bi interfaces are similar since the p(in ) atoms are now situated at the other diagonal connecting the bi atoms . \n critical is the other in(p)/feo@xmath2 interface since now in case 3(4 ) the in(p ) atoms are located just above the fe atoms while in case 1(2 ) they were located above the oxygen atoms at the midpoints between neighboring fe atoms .      in all cases under study \n our results converged to the ferromagnetic solution independently of the initial conditions and initial arrangement of the spin moments . as in - plane lattice \n constant we have chosen the @xmath5   @xmath6   ( 11.1 a.u . ) which is the experimental lattice constant of inp and moreover for the lattice constant of 4.153   bifeo@xmath0 exhibits very pronounced magnetic properties.@xcite as a result of the epitaxial growth along the [ 001 ] axis the lattice constant was 14.182   ( 26.8 a.u . ) . \n spacer ( fe@xmath7 at the middle of the spacer and fe@xmath8 at the feo@xmath2 interface for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation ) . \n positive dos corresponds to the majority spin ( spin - up ) electrons and negative dos to the minority spin ( spin - down ) electrons . \n the fermi level has been assigned to the zero energy . ]    in fig . \n [ fig3 ] we present the density of states ( dos ) of the fe d - orbitals for all four cases under study . \n we denote as fe@xmath7 the fe atoms within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and with fe@xmath8 the fe atoms located at the interface . \n we have also to note here that for the multilayer structures under study , we have a complete lift of the degeneracy of the fe d - orbitals and we can not refer anymore to the double - degenerated @xmath9 and triple degenerated @xmath10 orbitals as in bulk bifeo@xmath0 . in case 2 where we have \n a p / bi interface our calculations have converged to a non - magnetic solution . \n the loss of magnetism in this case should be attributed to the reduced hybridization between the neighboring fe and p atoms at the interface . \n the latter have as valence 3p electrons which are less extended in space with respect to the in 5p valence states and do not hybridize with the fe d - orbitals at the interface . in case i , \n the d - band is shifted to higher energy values for the spin - down electrons with respect to the spin - up electrons . \n this is more easy to visualize for the fe@xmath8 atoms since their hybridization with the p - orbitals of in leads to more pronounced electronic properties ( smaller bandwidth with respect to the fe@xmath7 atoms and thus more intense picks ) . \n the latter is also reflected on the spin magnetic moments presented in table [ table1 ] where the spin magnetic moments are considerable larger for fe@xmath8 with respect to fe@xmath7 . \n .fe spin magnetic moments in @xmath1 within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 epitaxial ultrathin multilayers for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation of different cases ) . \n the bifeo@xmath0 spacer contains two inequivalent atoms : fe@xmath7 at the middle of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and fe@xmath8 at the interface . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar is the situation for the fe spacer where for the two smaller lattice constants we could not even converge our calculations . \n as shown in table [ table3 ] only for the largest value of the lattice constant we got significant values of the fe spin magnetic moments , which even for this case , are considerable smaller than the spin magnetic moments of fe atoms of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer ( @xmath110.2 @xmath1 for fe spacer compared to @xmath11 0.8 @xmath1 for bifeo@xmath0 spacer ) and are about one order of magnitude smaller than in bulk fe . \n we have also included in table [ table3 ] the results for the interface structure of fig . \n [ fig6 ] , denoted as `` case 5-ii '' where we have changed the positions of the v(fe ) atoms at the interface . \n overall also in this case the magnetic properties of the spacer are not significant . only in the case of the fe / bifeo@xmath0 multilayer half the fe atoms at layer 1 ( located at the interface with feo@xmath2 ) present a significant spin magnetic moment of about 0.5 @xmath1 which is still much lower than the bulk fe value . \n we expand our study on the magnetic properties bifeo@xmath0 presented in refs . and to the case of ultrathin epitaxial multilayers using the quantum - espresso first - principles electronic structure \n method.@xcite we have studied several cases of these ultrathin epitaxial bifeo@xmath0 multilayers using different types of spacers covering a wide range of electronic materials : inp semiconductor , ferromagnetic fe and metallic v. irrespectively of the spacer the magnetic properties of the multilayers were found to seriously degrade due to the low - symmetry of the film and in some cases magnetism vanished completely . \n thus ultrathin multilayers of bifeo@xmath0 are not suitable for spintronic applications \n . more extended calculations covering more thick multilayers and including quantum molecular dynamics are needed in the future to determine in more detail the properties of the interfaces of bifeo@xmath0 with other alloys . \n y. h. chu , l. w. martin , m. b. holcomb , m. gajek , s .- j . \n han , q. he , n. balke , c .- h . \n yang , d. lee , w. hu , q. zhan , p .- \n yang , a. fraile - rodriguez , a. scholl , s. x. wang , and r. ramesh , _ nature materials _ 7 , 478 ( 2008 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2454103945861, "RequestID": "f393b8bb14204f0fb70a87b3ee103440", "TotalTokens": 3803}

that of cv4 is given in @xcite . \n heii emission with equivalent widths in the range 6 - 15   appear in the spectra of all four objects , as do strong balmer lines . \n in particular , @xcite found for cv2 and cv3 , respectively , heii 4686 equivalent widths of 11 and 15  . \n the h@xmath2 equivalent widths of these same two objects are 32 and 59  , respectively . \n the disks in all four objects are faint ( @xmath3 ) . \n @xcite has carefully compared the disks and heii line ratios of cvs 1 - 4 with those of other cataclysmic systems . \n we refer the interested reader to that careful and exhaustive analysis , simply quoting here edmond et al.s conclusions regarding cvs 1 - 3 :    `` they do not appear to be recent novae or nova - likes because of their faint disks ( with extra evidence from their heii 4686   line ratios ) , nor do they appear to be dwarf novae because they have moderately strong heii lines . \n the final option is magnetic systems . to conclude , cvs 1 - 3 do not appear to be dwarf novae , but they could be dq her - type systems . \n a possible alternative to the dq her hypothesis is that some of the ngc 6397 cvs are old novae ( possibly in deep hibernation between outbursts ; see shara et al . \n 1986 ) . '' \n figures 1 and 2 of this paper convincingly demonstrate that cv2 and cv3 are , in fact , erupting dwarf novae despite their prominent heii emission . \n intensive monitoring with hst is essential to determine if all of the cv candidates in ngc 6397and other globular clusters  eventually erupt as dwarf novae . \n the hibernation scenario of cvs @xcite postulates that old novae eventually display dwarf - nova like outbursts . \n one old classical nova in the globular cluster m80 has been recovered @xcite at dwarf nova - like luminosity , and one recent erupting classical nova in a globular cluster ( of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ) has been reported @xcite . \n cv2 and cv3 could be hibernating old novae , but we have , at present , no observational proof that they once underwent nova eruptions . \n edmonds suggestion that the ngc 6397 cvs might be dq her - like magnetic systems ( also known as ips or intermediate polars ) might seem to be disproved with the observed dwarf nova eruptions of cv2 and cv3 . however , there are a few well - documented cases of ips that undergo dwarf nova eruptions , including gk per , ex hya , xy ari , do dra , tv col , ht cam and v1223 sgr . \n most dwarf novae show some heii emission ( see e.g. @xcite for a compilation ) , so cv2 and cv3 are certainly not unique in this respect . \n a comparison of the heii and h@xmath2 line strengths for the cvs in ngc 6397 and for field ips is presented by @xcite . \n both the line strengths and line ratios of heii and h@xmath2 for cv2 and cv3 are comparable to those of other low mass transfer rate ips , with ex hya being a particularly good match . \n @xcite have presented a model for dwarf nova - like outbursts in magnetic cvs , which they apply to tv col and gk per . if the white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable has a strong magnetic field , the inner region of the accretion disk is disrupted . \n they found that disruption of the inner disk region leads to shorter outbursts , and , for disk instabilities starting near the inner disk edge , to much longer intervals between outbursts . \n the outbursts of most ips tend to be rare , short and of only moderate amplitude . as an example \n , @xcite has noted that the ex hya outbursts occur at @xmath4 year intervals , last less than 4 days and are of only @xmath5 magnitude amplitude . if the many globular cluster cv candidates identified by chandra @xcite and hst @xcite are also intermediate polars then the remarkably small numbers of erupting dwarf novae found by hst in globular clusters @xcite can be explained . in particular , a population of even dozens of ips will only occasionally show a dwarf nova near maximum light . under this scenario \n we can predict that more of these cvs will eventually be seen to erupt if individual clusters are searched on dozens or hundreds of occasions . \n we have observed ngc 6397 with hst during 5 separate epochs . \n two of the four spectrographically confirmed cvs are observed to undergo dwarf nova eruptions with amplitudes of at least 1.8 and 2.7 magnitudes . \n these eruptions were somewhat unexpected , as both objects display moderately strong heii 4686 emission lines , generally associated with non - erupting , magnetic cvs . \n the dwarf nova - like eruptions reported in this paper can occur in intermediate polars , suggesting that some of the ngc 6397 cvs ( and by implication some of the cvs in other globular clusters ) are indeed magnetic systems . \n the apparent rarity of erupting dwarf novae in globular clusters with large cv candidate populations is reconciled if those cvs are infrequently erupting intermediate polars . \n support for program # 8630 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 . \" \n l|l|c|c|c|c|c|c 1 : 3/6/96 & king & 700s,6@xmath6500s , & 4@xmath6500s , & 6@xmath640s,8s,1s & & & 2@xmath640s,8s,1s + & # 5929 & 28@xmath6400s,2@xmath680s , & 16@xmath6400s , & & & & + & & 2@xmath610s & 2@xmath680s,2@xmath610s & & & & + 2 : 4/3/99 & grindlay & & & 24@xmath640s,2@xmath68s & 1000s,4@xmath6900s & 38@xmath640s & 24@xmath640s + & # 7335 & & & 2@xmath61s & 18@xmath6800s,7@xmath6700s & 2@xmath68s,2@xmath61s & 2@xmath68s,2@xmath61s + & & & & & 2@xmath6140s & & + 3 : 11/4/01 & noll & 3@xmath6160s & 2@xmath6160s & & & & 3@xmath640s + & # 9313 & & & & & & + stis epochs & pi / prog . \n i d & clear ccd & ccd lp & clear mama & f25qtz & f25srf2 & + 4 : 3/28/03 & shara & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath6180s & & 533s,865s & & + & # 8630 & & & & 6@xmath6600s & & + 5 : 5/16/03 & `` '' & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath61000s & & 2@xmath6600s,883s & + & & & & & & 2@xmath61021s & +", "StartTimeOffset": 2476278976139, "RequestID": "733d460b642846b1884868d52a3890ea", "TotalTokens": 3569}

{"ContextTokens": 3984, "GeneratedTokens": 327, "SynthesizedBody": "a hundred years after the discovery of cosmic rays ( crs ) there is little doubt that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the sources of the bulk population of crs in the galaxy with energies up to a few times 10@xmath3 ev ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and may well produce crs to 10@xmath4 ev ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is the most likely mechanism to accelerate cr particles in the forward and reverse shocks of the snr shells \n . the high efficiency of the dsa mechanism has been demonstrated by nonlinear modeling ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . \n however , snrs do not comprise a uniform population of similar objects . \n there is a wide variety of different snrs since their evolution , cr acceleration , and non - thermal emission depend strongly on both the circumstellar and interstellar environments @xcite . \n it is important that a substantial fraction of core - collapsed supernovae likely occur in compact clusters of young massive stars and are associated with molecular clouds . \n the most massive stars explode first and their shocks are propagating through a complex environment created by both the very strong radiation of young massive stars and radiatively driven stellar winds . \n we discuss in  1 the results of modeling cr acceleration and the nonthermal emission of a supernova exploding in the stellar wind of its progenitor star following @xcite . \n in addition to an isolated snr , in a compact rich cluster of young massive stars the distances between the young stars may be about 10 - 15 pc and therefore crs may also be accelerated when the mhd flows produced by the supernova shell interact with a stellar wind from a nearby massive star . \n particle acceleration in the region where the expanding supernova shell approaches a powerful stellar wind is discussed in  2 ( see also * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n at a later stage of the young stellar cluster evolution ( an age of about ten million years ) multiple supernova explosions with great energy release in the form of shock waves inside a superbubble is a favorable site for particle acceleration . \n the collective acceleration from both stellar winds of massive stars and core collapsed supernovae in superbubbles was discussed in @xcite . \n early type stars with masses above @xmath5 ( of b0  v type and earlier ) are thought to create hot , low - density bubbles with radii @xmath6pc surrounded by a massive shell of matter swept up from the parent cloud by the stellar wind . \n a sn exploding in the early stages ( i.e. , the first few million years ) of the ob association evolution would interact with a cavern created by the pre - supernova wind . in this case , a strong supernova shock propagates for a few thousand years in tenuous circumstellar matter with a velocity above @xmath7km / s before reaching the dense massive shell . \n magnetic field fluctuations in the shock vicinity may be highly amplified by instabilities driven by the cr - current and cr - pressure gradient in the strong shocks @xcite . \n this is an important factor for determining the highest energy particles accelerated by the shocks .    a nonlinear , spherically symmetric model of the core - collapsed snr \n rx j1713.7 - 3946 that includes a hydrodynamic simulation of the remnant evolution coupled to the efficient production of crs by dsa at the supernova forward shock was studied in @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : snrxj ] ) . \n high - energy crs that escape from the forward shock are propagated in surrounding dense material that simulates either a swept - up , pre - supernova shell or a nearby molecular cloud . the continuum emission from trapped and escaping crs , along with the thermal x - ray emission from the shock - heated ism behind the forward shock , integrated over the remnant , \n was compared against broadband observations . \n overall , the gev - tev emission is dominated by inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from cr electrons if the supernova is isolated regardless of its type , i.e. , not interacting with a @xmath8 shell or cloud . \n if the snr is interacting with a much larger mass @xmath9 , pion production by the escaping crs may dominate the tev emission , although a precise fit at high gamma - ray energies will depend on the still uncertain details of how the highest energy crs are accelerated by , and escape from , the forward shock ( fs ) . \n importantly , even though cr electrons dominate the gev - tev emission , much more energy is put into cr ions and the efficient production of cr ions is an essential part of our leptonic model .    an important factor that allows a good fit to the broadband spectrum of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  with leptons , particularly including the highest energy hess points , stems from the fact that the pre - sn wind magnetic field , in which the sn explodes , is considerably lower than 3@xmath10 g due to the expansion of the wind . \n this allows the electrons to be accelerated to higher energies before radiation losses dominate . \n we take a pre - sn wind with speed @xmath11 , mass - loss rate @xmath12 , and temperature @xmath13 , all of which are assumed constant . \n the parameter @xmath14 determines the wind magnetic field at a radius @xmath15 from the explosion according to @xmath16 the constant parameter @xmath14 is the ratio of magnetic field energy density to kinetic energy density in the wind and can be related to properties of the star by ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) @xmath17 here , @xmath18 denotes the surface magnetic field of the star , @xmath19 is the stellar radius , @xmath20 is the star rotation velocity , and @xmath21 is the terminal speed of the wind . \n obtaining @xmath22 by fitting the spectrum of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 , as was done in @xcite , constrains the progenitor star parameters . as noted by @xcite , values of @xmath23 indicate that the stellar wind dominates the magnetic field , producing a roughly radial field far from the star .    for the parameters used in @xcite ( see also * ? \n * ) , the upstream magnetic field at the forward shock at the current age of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  is @xmath24 g and the @xmath6@xmath10 g  field immediately downstream from the shock is amplified by a factor of about 50 above the unshocked wind magnetic field ( see figure  [ fig : prof ] ) . \n the low unshocked wind field reconciles efficient cr acceleration , and the accompanying strong magnetic field amplification ( mfa ) , with the low magnetic field that is required for leptons to produce the highest energy gamma - ray emission with ic . \n it may also provide the relatively wide ( @xmath25 parsec - scale size ) profile of the ic emission consistent with the observed tev profile . \n the discussion of the possible effect of the reverse shock can be found in @xcite . \n we confirm that the circumstellar medium ( csm ) can strongly influence the non - thermal emission from core - collapsed sn ib / c and sniib snrs , and emphasize again that the magnetic field of the progenitor massive star may be well below the average interstellar medium ( ism ) values of a few micro - gauss alleviating an apparent contradiction between the low postshock magnetic field values required by the leptonic origin of high energy gamma - rays with the strong magnetic field amplification expected in efficient dsa . \n it is also important to emphasize that , even though electrons dominate the high - energy emission , the dsa model we are discussing accelerates cr ions efficiently . \n the results we illustrated here ( figures  [ fig : snrxj ] and [ fig : prof ] ) place 25 to 50% of the forward shock ram kinetic energy flux into relativistic ions at any instant . \n only 0.25% or less of the instantaneous ram kinetic energy flux goes into relativistic electrons . \n leptons dominate the model emission simply because leptons radiate far more efficiently than ions , not because ions are missing . \n furthermore , the best - fit parameters for this remnant result in maximum proton energies of @xmath26ev . \n iron nuclei would be accelerated to @xmath27ev , well into the cr `` knee '' regime . \n [ fig : snrxj ]        [ fig : prof ] yr . \n the third panel shows the mass within @xmath15 at @xmath28 and the fourth panel shows the escaping cr number density . \n the diffusion parameters used in @xcite are listed in the fifth panel . \n escaping crs are only followed beyond the fs and they leave the spherically symmetric simulation freely at the outer radius of @xmath29pc . \n , title=\"fig : \" ] \n the blast wave of the snr is expected to accelerate the wind material producing ultra - relativistic ions and electrons . \n the highest energy crs escape from the snr forward shock and can reach the termination shock of the stellar wind of a nearby massive star . in figure \n [ fig : snr_sw ] we show a highly simplified situation where the snr shock approaches the the stellar wind from a young ob - star . for efficient acceleration in such a system , the distance @xmath30 between the shocks should be about a pc and we estimate that this stage may last about 1,000 yrs . \n we modeled the energetic particle acceleration in the region where the expanding supernova shell is approaching a powerful stellar wind of a young massive star as it is illustrated in figure  [ fig : snr_sw ] . at the evolutionary stage where the mean \n free path of the highest energy cr is comparable to the distance between the two shocks , @xmath30 , the system is characterized by a very hard spectrum of accelerated crs as discussed in @xcite . \n the hard cr spectrum produces unusual spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of synchrotron and ic emission as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] . \n the sed is derived for the moment of close approach of the shell with the stellar wind with @xmath31 pc . for comparison , \n we show in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , with the dotted lines , the sed produced by an isolated snr shock at a similar age . \n [ fig : snr_sw ]      the effect of different environments in which an isolated snr may evolve on the maximum cr energy , and the time evolution of the maximum energy , was discussed in @xcite . in their model , the maximum cr energy is generally reached in the ejecta - dominated stage , much before the start of the sedov - taylor stage . \n it was concluded that , for sne evolving within the winds of their massive stars , the maximum energy is reached very early in the evolution . \n as shown in @xcite , a supernova exploding in a young stellar cluster and interacting with a nearby strong stellar wind will produce higher maximum energy crs in the colliding mhd flows compared to an isolated snr . \n furthermore , the snr can produce high - energy crs at the sedov - taylor evolution stage . \n the evolution of a snr , after the star explosion , is characterized ( in chronological order ) by the free expansion phase , the sedov - taylor stage , and the radiative stage . during the free expansion \n phase the forward shock velocity of the ejecta is approximately constant . at the sedov - taylor stage , \n the ejecta starts to decelerate when the swept - up mass becomes comparable to the ejecta mass . \n the transition from the free expansion phase to the sedov - taylor stage occurs around the time @xmath32 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) where    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 is the number density of the interstellar medium , @xmath35 is the snr explosion energy , @xmath36 is the mass of the ejecta , and @xmath37 is the mass of the sun . \n the evolution of the forward shock radius @xmath38 and shock velocity @xmath39 during the sedov phase of the snr expansion are given by the following equations :    @xmath40    @xmath41    for the calculation of the maximum momentum evolution we use the approach proposed in @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the particle velocity , @xmath45@xmath10 g  is the unperturbed magnetic field strength , @xmath46 , and the mass ejected with the snr explosion is @xmath47 .    in figure  [ fig : sedov ] we illustrate the evolution of @xmath48 accelerated in the system in which the forward shock of the snr approaches the strong stellar wind from a young ob star being at the sedov - taylor stage . \n the snr - stellar wind collision may also occur well before the sedov - taylor phase depending on the compactness of the stellar cluster and inter - cluster matter distribution . at some moment during the sedov - taylor stage of the snr evolution the forward shock of the snr is close enough to the termination shock of the stellar wind to produce efficient acceleration with the sharp increase in @xmath48 shown in the figure . \n the spectra of crs accelerated in the colliding flows are harder than those from dsa produced by a single shock @xcite . in the figure  [ fig : spectrum ] \n we compare the ic and synchrotron emission from the electrons accelerated in a colliding shock with that from electrons from a single shock . \n for this example , the local interstellar photon spectrum was constructed taking into account background ir fluxes typical for ob - associations , as measured by @xcite . \n the electron distribution functions used in the spectra calculations were computed with a time - dependent model that accounts for nonlinear flow modifications in the vicinity of the shocks , and radiation losses for the electrons . \n it is clearly seen that the emissivity of the snr - sw system is considerably higher than that for the single snr shock due to the hard electron spectrum up to @xmath49 gev . \n supernova remnants are the most likely candidates to accelerate galactic crs up to the knee regime and perhaps beyond the knee . \n core - collapsed supernovae are thought to be statistically the dominating class of supernova events . \n the effect of the clustering of core - collapsed supernova progenitors , and the interaction of supernova ejecta with the circumstellar matter produced by the wind of the progenitor star , affect both the maximum energy crs can obtain and the cr composition . in this paper we discussed briefly a few recent results illustrating the effects of both the strong wind of the progenitor massive star , and the collision of a supernova shock with the powerful wind of a nearby young massive star . \n in particular , we emphasized the importance of the structure of the magnetic field in the stellar wind of the progenitor star . in the case of slow rotation of the progenitor star , the wind magnetic field at large distances from the star may be well below the typical @xmath50@xmath10 g  value for the ism . in this case \n , the strong snr forward shock can accelerate cr ions efficiently with the expected strong mfa and still have low enough fields behind the shock ( i.e. , @xmath6@xmath10 g ) so relativistic electrons can obtain high enough energies to produce the high - energy gamma - ray emission via ic before radiation losses take over . in the case of a supernova explosion in a compact cluster of young massive stars , the collision of the supernova shock with the stellar wind of a nearby star is likely and the combined effect of shock and stellar wind may result in a substantial increase in the maximum cr energy , @xmath51 . this increase in @xmath51 \n can occur even during the stage when the maximum cr energy from the isolated snr was declining ( see figure  [ fig : sedov ] ) . \n the characteristic spectrum of non - thermal emission from the snr - sw collision is expected to be very hard ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) , a prediction that can be tested observationally . \n a.m.b . and d.c.e . \n thank f.  aharonian , w.  hofmann and f.  rieger for the excellent symposium `` high energy gamma -

prey system . \n the rules considered are in some sense inspired in the north - east - center ( nec ) cellular automaton @xcite , which also consider an unsymmetrical neighborhood of northern and eastern sites . \n the present stochastic dynamics predicts the existence of states , called absorbing states , in which the system becomes trapped . \n once the system has entered such a state it can not escape from it anymore remaining there forever . \n there are two absorbing states . \n one of them is the empty lattice . \n the other absorbing state is the one in which the lattice is full of prey . \n this situation occurs if there are few predators and they become extinct . \n the remaining prey will then reproduce without predation filling up the whole lattice . \n the existence of absorbing stationary states is an evidence of the irreversible character of the model or , in other words , of the lack of detailed balance @xcite . \n however , the most interesting states , the ones that we are concerned with in the present study , are the active states characterized by the coexistence of prey and predators .      the densities of prey , predator and empty sites are defined as @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 respectively . \n the lower index @xmath5 is used to denote the site and the upper index @xmath9 stands for the time . \n the pair correlation of two neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath36 one being occupied by prey and the other by predator is defined as @xmath37 in this definition the sites @xmath5 and @xmath36 are two neighboring horizontal sites , the site @xmath36 being at the east of @xmath5 . for two neighboring sites placed \n vertically we use the notation @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the neighbor of @xmath5 to the north . \n the evolution equation for the densities can be obtained by using the rules of the automaton and the evolution equation for the probability @xmath40 . using equations ( [ master ] ) , ( [ regra1 ] ) , ( regra2 ) and ( [ regra3 ] ) , we obtain the time evolution equation for the density of prey at site @xmath5 , @xmath41+p_i(1)-\\frac{b}{2 } \\left [ p_{ij}\\left (   \\begin{array}{c } 2 \\\\   1% \\end{array } \\right)+p_{ik } (   \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 2% \\end{array } ) \\right ] ,   \\label{dens1}\\ ] ] where we have used prime and unprimed to denote quantities at time @xmath42 and @xmath9 , respectively . \n again , @xmath43 denotes a pair correlation of a site @xmath5 which is empty and its neighbor at the north @xmath36 which is occupied by a prey and @xmath44 denotes the pair correlation of the site @xmath5 which is is empty and its neighbor to the east @xmath39 which is occupied by a prey . \n note that site @xmath5 is the site to be updated . \n the time evolution equation for the density of predators at site @xmath5 is given by @xmath45+(1-c)p_i(2 ) . \n \\label{dens2}\\ ] ]    the evolution equations for correlations of two neighbor sites are given by equations which involves clusters of two , three and four neighbors to the north and east and they are too cumbersome . \n we will write them in the pair approximation in the next subsection \n .    we will assume in the present analysis that the densities and the pair correlations are homogeneous so that the correlations of sites placed horizontally or vertically are the same . in other words the systems exhibits a specular symmetry along the southwest - northeast line ( see fig . \n [ nec ] ) . \n therefore , @xmath46 and @xmath47 \n we will first analyze the equations ( [ dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) for the densities of prey and predators by means of a simple mean field approximation @xcite . in this approximation \n we write the probability of a given cluster of sites as the product of the probabilities of each site . in our analysis \n we maintain the space dependence of each probability . \n this is necessary since the rules that define the model are not isotropic . \n we will use the notations @xmath48 where the index @xmath49 stands for a site at the @xmath49 layer . \n a layer is defined as the sites belonging to a line perpendicular to the southwest - northeast axis , as shown in fig . \n [ nec ] . using this approximation and considering equations ( [ dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) \n we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 . due to this relation \n there is no need for the equation for the density of empty sites . \n the analysis of the above set of equations show that the stable solutions are of two types : a prey absorbing state , where the all lattice is full of prey ; and an active solution with prey and predators densities constant in time and space . \n so , we have just homogeneous and nonoscillating solutions when we treat the anisotropic pca by means of simple mean - field approximation . at this level of mean - field approximation the space anisotropy does not play any role in determining the kind of coexistence of species . \n now we consider the evolution equations for one - site correlations and two site ( pair ) correlations . \n the evolution equations for the pair correlations depend on clusters of three and four sites . following the approach of the pair approximation @xcite we write the clusters of three and four sites as products of pair correlations and one - site correlations \n . however , we must be careful in doing this approximation because we are maintaining the spatial anisotropy dependence of the one and two site correlations . \n for example , the correlation of a site at layer @xmath49 in state @xmath2 , a site at layer @xmath53 in state @xmath2 and a site at layer @xmath54 in state @xmath3 , is written in the pair approximation as @xmath55 there are more complex clusters that appear in the evolution equation for pair correlations . \n for example , the following cluster of four sites is approximated by @xmath56 observe that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two independent variables . \n now we use the notation @xmath59 \n @xmath60 @xmath61    using the pair approximation we derive the following equations for pair correlations , @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79    the equations for the densities are @xmath80 and @xmath81    therefore , we get a set of eight equations that we have iterated to find the solutions . \n we considered periodic boundary conditions and an initial condition where half of the lattice with a set of densities and the other half with another set of densities .    for @xmath82 and great values of @xmath20 \n the system attains a stationary state which is the absorbing prey state . \n decreasing @xmath20 there is a transition to an active state , coexistence of species , and we found very interesting solutions which are characterized by travelling waves of the densities of each species . in fig . \n [ oscespac ] we show , for a particular set of the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the prey and predators oscillations as a function of space and for a fixed instant of time . \n we can see that the behavior of the space oscillations are very complex and very different from a sinusoidal wave . \n we remark that our assumption concerning the spatial dependence of densities and pair correlations underlying our mean - field approach could not easily be conceived a priori . \n it was set up by considering the type of local dynamics with unsymmetrical rules and from the results of monte carlo simulations for the present pca @xcite . to further clarify this point we show in fig . \n [ snap ] a snapshot generated by simulation of the present pca on a square lattice where each site can be occupied by prey , predators or can be empty . \n periodic boundary conditions were used and the system evolved in time according to the rules defined by eqs . \n ( [ regra1 ] ) , ( [ regra2 ] ) and ( [ regra3 ] ) . a synchronous update was used . \n we see that the distribution of individuals of each species is not homogeneous but exhibits a pattern composed by layers of prey and predators . \n these layers are displayed in a manner perpendicular to the southwest - northeast direction , the direction along which the oscillations occur as can be seen in fig . \n we have found that the spatial oscillations do not occur independently of the time oscillations , since the spatial layers of prey and predators are not static but are like fronts moving along the southwest - northeast direction . \n the spatial pattern oscillations are intimately associated to local time oscillations of the species kelly , tome2007 . \n these features were incorporated in the present mean - field analysis of the model . \n we have considered a predator - prey probabilistic cellular automaton with anisotropic local stochastic rules . \n we studied this model by means of dynamic mean - field approximation at two orders : simple mean - field approximation and pair mean - field approximation . \n due to the anisotropy these approximations only can be performed if we consider the spatial dependence of probabilities . \n the simple mean - field approximation for this automaton just provides the prey absorbing state and active spatial homogeneous solutions which are also constant in time . \n the pair mean - field approximation gives much more rich results and show that the active states characterized by time oscillations of species densities are inhomogeneous in space . \n therefore , we have spatiotemporal patterns of coexistence . \n this is in accordance with previous monte carlo simulations @xcite where we have found local time oscillations connected to inhomogeneous spatial distributions of species individuals .", "StartTimeOffset": 2527690848155, "RequestID": "8b5e6030566840d78387b9444f748417", "TotalTokens": 3830}

kutta methods @xcite and @xcite . finally , this paper closes with the summary of the obtained results . \n this paper presents a new chaotic system derived from the lorenz system . \n the system is generated by the following simple three - dimensional system :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are variables and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are real parameters . in the new proposed chaotic system , \n all the equations have some differences compared to the original lorenz system . in order to see the differences between the two systems we can compare the equations - and - one by one . \n evidently , in the lorenz system equation is linear , whereas equation is non - linear . \n furthermore , equations and are both non - linear , where the @xmath12-dependence of equation is cancelled . \n the most significant difference can be observed comparing equations and . in the term @xmath0 \n is squared compared to equation . \n the initial values and the parameters of the system are chosen as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 with varying @xmath6 . \n then it has been observed that the behavior of the new chaotic system changes depending on the different values of @xmath6 as shown in figure [ fig : three graphs ] .    0.4 , @xmath16 and various parameter values , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath16 and various parameter values , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath16 and various parameter values , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath16 and various parameter values , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath16 and various parameter values , title=\"fig : \" ]    as a result of the calculations , as it can be seen in figure [ fig : three graphs ] \n , it has been observed that the new system is chaotic for the parameters @xmath17 the analysis of the new chaotic system will be done according to those parameters . \n the first step to analyze a chaotic system is to find the equilibrium points . in order to determine the equilibrium points of the proposed system - \n , we need to solve the system    @xmath18    thus , the solution of the system with respect to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 give the equilibria points as :    @xmath19{\\beta\\,\\rho^3},\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{\\beta}{\\rho}},\\rho\\right ) \\\\ \n \\it e^-&=&\\left(-\\sqrt[4]{\\beta\\,\\rho^3},-\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{\\beta}{\\rho}},\\rho\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the parameters chosen in , the numerical values of the equilibria points are    @xmath20    in order to decide on the stability of the new proposed system , the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix must be analyzed . \n the jacobian matrix for this system - can be easily obtained as @xmath21    the expressions for the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix are very long and complicated . \n as we are only interested in the numerical values of the eigenvalues at the equilibria points - for the given parameters , the eigenvalues are stated in the table below :    .eigenvalues of the jacobian at the equilibrium points [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     as the eigenvalues @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the equilibrium point @xmath24 are both negative , the system is unstable at this equilibrium point . \n the eigenvalues corresponding to the equilibrium point @xmath25 will be the same with the eigenvalues of @xmath26 , because of the quadratic nature of the system . since @xmath27 is a negative real number and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two complex conjugate eigenvalues with positive real parts , equilibrium points @xmath26 and @xmath25 are unstable according to @xcite . \n the system - has a natural symmetry and is invariant under the coordinate transformation @xmath28 which persists for all values of the system parameters . \n so , system - has rotation symmetry about the @xmath29 . \n let , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the system - . \n then we get for the vector field    @xmath33    consequently the divergence of the vector field @xmath34 yields to :    @xmath35    note that @xmath36 is a negative value , so the system is a dissipative system and an exponential rate is :    @xmath37    from , it can be seen that a volume element @xmath38 is contracted by the flow into a volume element @xmath39 at the time @xmath40 . \n the lyapunov exponents generally refer to the average exponential rates of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space . \n the important part is that if there is at least one positive lyapunov exponent , the system can be defined to be chaotic . \n according to the detailed numerical and theoretical analysis , the lyapunov exponents are found to be @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . \n therefore , the lyapunov dimension of this system is :    @xmath44    this result is consistent with the findings in @xcite , i.e. that the lyapunov dimension is in the range 2 - 3 . \n equation means that the system - is a dissipative system , and the lyapunov dimensions of the system are fractional . having a strange attractor and positive lyapunov exponent , it is obvious that the system is a 3d chaotic system . \n [ h ]          time series analysis of the system - according to @xmath45 axes are listed in the figure [ fig : wf ] . for the solutions of the system \n the runge - kutta method was employed .    0.4 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively , title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 respectively , title=\"fig : \" ] \n obviously the time series show that the functions @xmath48 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are not periodic , indicating that the system is chaotic . \n the projections of the system - , on the various axes is given in the figure [ fig : pp ] .    0.4     0.4     0.4 \n the chaotic attractors are displayed in the figure [ fig : pp ] . \n it appears that the new attractor exhibits an interesting complex chaotic dynamics behavior . \n as an application of the dynamical systems , the newly formed chaotic system can also be written in the sense of geometric and the bigeometric calculus .      the geometric chaotic system corresponding to system - , can be written as    @xmath49    on the other hand , the bigeometric chaotic system corresponding to system - will be    @xmath50    in order to solve the system , one can use the geometric runge - kutta method defined in @xcite , while the system can be solved by using the bigeometric runge - kutta method which was defined in @xcite . by choosing the same values for the parameters , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 with varying @xmath6 and the initial values as @xmath51 \n , we can see that the solutions of the geometric chaotic system and the bigeometric chaotic system will be similar to the ones that we get from the solutions of the chaotic system - . \n the following figure shows the chaotic behaviour of the geometric and the bigeometric dynamic systems when the parameters are chosen as @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath52 . \n , width=302 ] \n the proposed modified quadratic lorenz attractor was analysed theoretically and numerically showing that this system is chaotic . \n following the standardized analysis method for chaotic systems , we determined first the equilibria points and the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix at these equilibria points to get a first indication about the stability of the proposed system . \n as the eigenvalues are either non - positive real numbers , or complex numbers with positive real parts , we can conclude that this system is not stable at the equilibria points . \n moreover , we could identify that the proposed system has a rotational symmetry about the @xmath13-axis , and shows dissipative behaviour contracting the volume element @xmath38 to @xmath53 . \n the lyapunov exponents yield to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , showing the chaotic nature of the system . \n the fractional dimension of the system @xmath54 has also been given . \n overall , the analysis shows that this is a new chaotic system with two scrolls . \n 32 [ 1]#1 [ 1]`#1 ` urlstyle [ 1]doi : # 1          ml  cartwright and je  littlewood . on non -

{"ContextTokens": 3502, "GeneratedTokens": 146, "SynthesizedBody": "the knowledge of the formation energy of solid surfaces is of obvious importance for surface physics and technology . given the difficulties of a direct measurement of the surface energy , accurate calculations @xcite of this quantity play a relevant role in surface science . \n the standard method for calculating the surface energy @xmath0 is to evaluate the total energy of a slab of the material of interest ( generally with a thickness between 5 to 15 layers ) and to subtract from that the bulk energy obtained from a separate calculation . \n this procedure singles out the total energy contribution due to the presence of the surface . \n it is based on the general and intuitively appealing expression @xmath1 with @xmath2 the total energy of a @xmath3-layer slab and @xmath4 the bulk total energy ; the limit is approximated in practice by the @xmath3th term . \n the factor of 1/2 accounts for the two surfaces of the slab . \n a central but often underestimated problem with this approach is what value should be chosen for the bulk energy . while at first sight this point might be dismissed as irrelevant , in a recent paper@xcite boettger pointed out that any difference between @xmath4 and the change in @xmath5 with slab thickness will cause the calculated surface energy to diverge linearly with @xmath3 . \n thus , increasing the slab thickness _ must _ sooner or later lead to unacceptable results , because the bulk energy from a separate calculation will never exactly equal the slope of the slab energy vs @xmath3 .    in ref . \n , severe errors incurred by this standard approach were reported . \n their unusual magnitude was presumably due to a technical matter , namely the use of two completely different methods for calculating the bulk and surface properties . \n thus , the practical importance of the divergent behavior of the surface energy remains unassessed for state - of - the - art methods , which carefully treat bulk and slab systems in the same way . \n the aim of this paper is to supply such an assessment . \n in particular , the natural objection to boettger s argument would be that , when using the same calculational method in a technically consistent way to obtain both bulk and slab quantities , this problem would simply not show up . \n we show in this paper that this is not the case : the proper choice of the bulk energy according to boettger s principle is an important issue in surface energy calculations even when the bulk and slab systems are handled consistently within accurate methods such as fp - lmto , pseudopotentials - plane waves , or such . \n further , we compare different approaches to remedy the problem , presenting what seems to be the best solution . as modern calculations advance to study more subtle surface effects and employ thicker slabs , these results will become increasingly relevant . \n in this section we present _ ab initio _ surface calculations demonstrating that the surface energy is not only formally , but also practically divergent for accurate calculations . to this end , we compare results obtained by the standard approach with those calculated using an alternative procedure suggested by boettger @xcite and with a modified approach to be described below . \n it will become clear that the latter method is the most reliable by a wide margin and should be prefered for high - accuracy applications .      for the standard methods , we first of all use eq . \n ( 1 ) whereby the bulk energy was obtained from a well - converged bulk calculation ( see below ) . \n we also considered the slightly modified version @xcite @xmath6 whereby the total energies needed are that of a slab containing @xmath3 layers ( @xmath2 ) and that of a @xmath7-atom bulk supercell consisting of the slab plus the vacuum space between the slabs filled with atoms ( @xmath8 ) . \n in other words , the weighted energy of the filled slab is taken as bulk energy . using eq . \n ( [ tre ] ) , many sources of difference between the slab and bulk energies can be eliminated since the same supercell is used for the bulk and slab systems , albeit at the cost of an increase in computational effort . for this approach \n , we used @xmath9 with n up to 11 . \n boettger@xcite suggested the following method to avoid the divergence problem . for each slab thickness @xmath3 , pick as bulk energy @xmath4 the differential increase in the slab total energy upon addition of one layer of material : @xmath10 where @xmath11 . \n this formula has the obvious merit of using only slab - related quantities , making no reference to separately - calculated bulk energies . \n consequently , the calculated surface energy should not suffer from the divergence problem of eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) . \n the price to pay is that of repeatedly calculating total energies for slabs of increasing thickness . at slight variance with ref . \n , we use @xmath12 in order to maintain inversion symmetry in our slabs .    as a fourth alternative \n , we note that as @xmath3 becomes large and convergence is approached , the definition of the surface energy in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) implies that @xmath13 this straight - line behaviour is already dominant for very thin slabs . \n this can be understood on the basis that the energy of a given atom is determined to a large extent by its nearest - neighbor environment @xcite . \n the most straightforward way to extract the quantity @xmath4 is to fit a straight line to all the slab total - energy data vs.  @xmath3 ( except for the thinnest slabs ) and to take its slope . \n this value is then used in eq . \n ( [ uno ] ) . \n this procedure uses the same data needed in boettger s suggested approach . \n it is free of the divergence problem because no separately - calculated bulk energy enters . \n the only uncertainty in the procedure is the assumed onset of the straight - line behaviour ; indeed , apart from the very thinnest slabs , the error bar in @xmath4 when starting the fit at different @xmath3 s in the range from 3 to 13 is @xmath140.01 mry ( see also table i below ) .    as a test case , we report results for the surface energy of pt ( 001 ) , evaluated by the four schemes just described . \n total energies were calculated within the local density approximation to density functional theory @xcite , using the all - electron full - potential lmto method @xcite . \n slab thicknesses of up to 15 layers , and a vacuum spacing equivalent to seven bulk layers were used . \n the slabs were left unrelaxed in the ideal fcc geometry . \n the technical ingredients ( basis set , k - point summation , etc . ) are given in ref . . \n figure [ f - uno ] shows the calculated surface energies as function of slab thickness when the four described methods are used . \n the two approaches using a separately - calculated bulk energy [ eqs . \n ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ tre ] ) ] are shown by open circles and triangles , respectively . \n both evidently suffer from the divergence problem , shown by the linear decrease as the slabs are made thicker . \n boettger s approach ( taking the bulk energy as differential increase of the slab energy , filled diamonds ) does indeed give a surface energy which does not have this systematic linear behaviour . \n unfortunately , it shows large oscillations which decrease only very slowly as the slab is made thicker . \n if only these three techniques were available , the best legitimate conclusion would be that the surface energy lies somewhere between 1.21 and 1.26 ev / atom . \n this is an uncertainty of 5% even though slabs as thick as 15 layers were considered . \n the fourth technique ( fitting a straight line to the @xmath2 data to obtain @xmath4 ) is shown by filled squares . in comparison to the other approaches , very fast convergence to a stable value \n is achieved . \n we can now accurately determine the calculated surface energy to be 1.246 ev , a value which is numerically stable to within 0.5 mev . \n this reduces the uncertainty to below 0.1% . in order to suppress the weak residual oscillation , we averaged over the last three points in the curve : however , the deviations from the average are below 0.5 mev . \n ( for completeness , in table i we list the raw data for the slab total energies , where a constant offset of 36800 ry / atom was subtracted for convenience , and the bulk energies obtained by linear fittings to @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 starting at different values of the slab thickness @xmath3 . ) \n our main point here is that one should be wary of the standard technique ( which uses a separately calculated bulk energy ) even for calculations of high accuracy . \n we can compare the bulk energy as deduced from the slope of the @xmath2 data ( @xmath15  ry ) with that from the well - converged bulk crystal calculation ( @xmath16  ry ) , finding a difference of only 0.6  mry  @xmath17  ev . despite this very small discrepancy \n , the undesired linear behaviour in the calculated surface energy is already prominent for thicknesses of eight or more layers . \n the accumulated bulk error for the ( typically used ) slab thickness of around seven is already uncomfortably large , namely 4.2  mry @xmath18  ev . optimistically going to thicker slabs \n would soon lead to unacceptable values of the surface energy . \n although previously calculated surface energies using the standard technique with slab thicknesses of below ten layers can be considered reasonably reliable , it is clearly important to keep the problem addressed here in mind when doing surface calculations . \n to some extent , the severity of the problem will depend on the calculational method used . in terms of k - points and selfconsistency iterations , \n our bulk crystal energy was converged to within 0.01 mry . \n thus , the discrepancy in @xmath4 presumably comes from the k - point mesh for the slab , which consisted of 15 irreducible special points in the @xmath19 plane . \n it is highly desirable to be able to use a mesh of this typical size , independent of the exact _ ab - initio _ \n scheme used . in this context \n , our conclusions apply in exactly the same way to other methods . \n although our suggested scheme at first sight looks like a mere numerical procedure , there is a clear theoretical background to it . the squares in fig . \n 1 show small but definite oscillations of the surface energy as function of the slab thickness with a period of about six to eight layers . \n these quantum size effects are due to the finite thickness of the slab . \n the problem of boettger s scheme is that it artificially magnifies these oscillations by a large factor because the bulk energy is calculated from two slabs of similar thickness . \n a technique which exploits the overall linear behaviour of the @xmath2 data , such as ours , eliminates this problem .    finally , we point out that our tests up to now , while informative , used all the @xmath2 data up to @xmath3=15 to obtain the converged surface energy . in practice , \n the aim is to use the data from slabs up to a thickness of typically 7 to 9 layers . using the same procedure as before , \n this gives surface energies of 1.2456 and 1.2457 ev / atom , respectively . \n these values are much closer to the converged value than those of the three competing approaches . for completeness \n , we mention that analogous results have been obtained for al ( 001)@xcite , and rh and ir low - index faces @xcite , as will be presented elsewhere . \n in summary , it has been previously pointed out@xcite that the calculated surface energy will diverge with slab thickness if a bulk energy is used which is not exactly equal to the slope of the slab energy vs. slab thickness . here \n , we have investigated this phenomenon in the context of accurate state - of - the art computational methods which are careful to treat bulk and slab systems in the same way . \n the results show that the effect must be taken seriously for this type of calculation also . \n the problem can be easily solved by obtaining the bulk crystal energy directly as the slope of the @xmath2 data , but care should be taken to eliminate quantum size effects . \n this can be done by making an overall linear fit to the slab total energy as function of the thickness . \n m. methfessel , d. hennig , and m. scheffler , phys . \n rev . * b 46 * , 4816 ( 1992 ) ; v. fiorentini , m. methfessel , and m. scheffler , phys . \n lett . * 71 * , 1050 ( 1993 ) , j. c. boettger , phys . \n b * 49 * , 16798 ( 1994 ) . see _ e.g. _ r. j. needs , phys . \n lett . * 58 * , 53 ( 1987 ) . \n robertson , v. heine , and m.c . \n payne , phys . \n lett . * 70 * , 1944 ( 1993 ) . \n r. dreizler and e. k. u. gross , _ density functional theory _ , ( springer , berlin , 1990 ) . \n we use the exchange -

; ; ; ) . \n assuming data simulation @xmath16 under the model given @xmath17 is easily obtainable , likelihood - free methods embed the posterior @xmath15 within an augmented model @xmath18 where @xmath16 , @xmath19 , is an auxiliary parameter on the same space as the observed data @xmath20 . \n the function @xmath21 is typically a standard smoothing kernel ( e.g. ) with scale parameter @xmath22 , which weights the intractable posterior with high values in regions when the observed data @xmath20 and auxiliary data @xmath23 are similar . \n for example , uniform kernels are commonplace in likelihood - free models ( e.g. ) , although alternatives such as epanechnikov and gaussian kernels provide improved efficiency . \n the resulting approximation to the true posterior target distribution @xmath24\\ ] ] improves as @xmath22 decreases , and exactly recovers the target posterior as @xmath25 , as then @xmath26 becomes a point mass at @xmath27 . \n posterior simulation from @xmath28 can then proceed via standard simulation algorithms , replacing pointwise evaluations of @xmath28 with monte carlo estimates through the expectation ( [ eqn : marginal - posterior ] ) , based on draws @xmath29 from the model ( e.g. ) . \n alternatively , simulation from the joint posterior @xmath30 is available by contriving to cancel the intractable likelihoods @xmath31 in sample weights or acceptance probabilities . for example , importance sampling from the prior predictive distribution @xmath32 results in an importance weight of @xmath33 , which is free of likelihood terms . \n see for a discussion of marginal and joint - space likelihood - free samplers .    in general \n , the distribution of @xmath31 will be diffuse , unless @xmath23 is discrete and @xmath34 is small . hence , generating @xmath35 with @xmath36 is improbable for realistic datasets @xmath20 , and as a result the degree of computation required for a good likelihood - free approximation @xmath37 ( i.e. with small @xmath22 ) will be prohibitive . in practice , the function @xmath21 is expressed through low dimensional vectors of summary statistics , @xmath38 , such that @xmath21 weights the intractable posterior through ( [ eqn : joint - posterior ] ) with high values in regions where @xmath39 . \n if @xmath38 is sufficient for @xmath17 , then letting @xmath25 recovers @xmath40 as before , but with more acceptable computational overheads , as @xmath41 . as sufficient summary statistics are generally unavailable , \n the use of non - sufficient statistics is commonplace . \n the effect of less efficient estimators of @xmath17 in ( [ eqn : marginal - posterior ] ) is a more diffuse approximation of @xmath42 . \n hence the choice of summary statistics in any application is critical , with the ideal being low - dimensional , efficient and near - sufficient .    in this article \n , we implement the likelihood - free sequential monte carlo sampler of , detailed in appendix a. as the class of particle - based algorithms is the most efficient currently available in likelihood - free computation ( e.g. ) , and within this class , the sampler of is the only one to allow non - uniform functions @xmath21 , this sampler provides the best combination of efficient simulation and flexible modelling . \n we now develop univariate and multivariate bayesian @xmath0-stable models . unlike existing methods , \n likelihood - free inference is independent of model parameterization . \n denote the characteristic function of @xmath11 i.i.d . \n univariate @xmath0-stable distributed random variables @xmath43 by @xmath44 a popular and convenient parameterization is @xmath45 \\right ) & \\text { \\ if } \\alpha \\neq1\\\\ \\exp\\left (   i\\delta t-\\gamma\\left\\vert t\\right\\vert \\left [ 1+i\\beta\\frac { 2}{\\pi}\\text{sgn}\\left (   t\\right )   \\ln\\left ( \\gamma\\left\\vert t\\right\\vert \\right ) \\right ]   \\right ) & \\text { \\ if } \\alpha=1 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( e.g. ) . \n many alternative parameterizations are detailed in and . under ( [ alphastablecharacteristicfn ] ) , \n the intractable stable density function is continuous and unimodal , taking support on @xmath48 if @xmath49 ; @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 otherwise . \n efficient simulation of auxiliary data , @xmath16 , under the model is critical for the performance of likelihood - free methods ( section [ sec : abc ] ) . here , it is straightforward to generate @xmath0-stable variates under the model defined by the characteristic function ( [ alphastablecharacteristicfn ] ) ( e.g. ; ) . \n this approach is provided in appendix b.      a key component of likelihood - free inference is the availability of low - dimensional , efficient and near - sufficient summary statistics . since @xmath0-stable models can possess infinite variance ( @xmath53 ) and infinite mean ( @xmath54 ) , this choice must be made with care . \n here we present several candidate summary vectors , @xmath55@xmath56 , previously utilized for parameter estimation in the univariate @xmath0-stable model . in section [ sec : examples ] we evaluate the performance of these vectors , and provide informed recommendations for the choice of summary statistics under the likelihood - free framework .    0.5 cm _ \n mcculloch s quantiles _ + and estimate model parameters based on sample quantiles , while correcting for estimator skewness due to the evaluation of @xmath57 , the @xmath58 quantile of @xmath23 , with a finite sample . here \n , the data @xmath59 are arranged in ascending order and matched with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 . \n linear interpolation to @xmath62 from the two adjacent @xmath63 values then establishes @xmath57 as a consistent estimator of the true quantiles . \n inversion of the functions @xmath64 then provides estimates of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . note that from a computational perspective , inversion of @xmath67 or @xmath68 is not required under likelihood - free methods . \n finally , we estimate @xmath9 by the sample mean @xmath69 ( when @xmath70 ) . \n hence @xmath71    0.5 cm _ \n zolotarev s transformation _ + based on a transformation of data from the @xmath0-stable family @xmath72 , ( p.16 ) provides an alternative parameterization of the @xmath0-stable model @xmath73 with a characteristic function of the form @xmath74 + \\mathbb{c}\\left (   \\nu^{-\\frac{1}{2}}-1\\right )   \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is euler s constant , and where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 this parameterization has the advantage that logarithmic moments have simple expressions in terms of parameters to be estimated . for a fixed constant @xmath79 ( recommends @xmath80 ) and for integer @xmath81 , the transformation is @xmath82 defining @xmath83 and @xmath84 , estimates for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are then given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , using sample variances @xmath89 and @xmath90 . \n as before , @xmath9 is estimated by @xmath69 ( for @xmath53 ) , and so @xmath91 .    0.5 cm _ press s method of moments _ + for @xmath92 and unique evaluation points @xmath93 , the method of moments equations obtained from @xmath94 can be solved to obtain (;

planar emission which is caused by galactic interactions or nuclear activity . \n the galaxy s size , i.e. the depth of the gravitational potential , is another parameter affecting the evolution of galactic halos . \n one of the main goals of this project is the determination of the energy budget in the halos ( magnetic field , thermal and radiation energy densities ) . \n ( @xcite ) x - ray observations presented here are used to detect previously unknown extended halo emission due to hot gas and/or to re - visit galaxies with known ( from earlier x - ray missions ) extra - planar x - ray emission features but now with a hitherto unreached sensitivity that can only be provided by deep   observations . \n such observations also allow us to investigate with unprecedented signal - to - noise the characteristics ( temperature , metallicity , energy density ) of the hot gas via x - ray spectroscopy . \n an earlier report on the status of our ongoing work was given by @xcite and @xcite . \n a more detailed motivation and general introduction of our multi - wavelength project can be found in the paper by m. dahlem ( this volume ) . \n this paper is based on  observations of the starburst galaxies ngc  1511 , ngc  4666 and ngc  3628 carried out as part of the guaranteed time proposal 011098 in july 2000 , june 2002 and november 2000 , respectively . \n the x - ray data have been cleaned for periods of high radiation background and images and spectra were generated with the science analysis system ( sas ) software package ( in its version 5.4.1 , except for ngc  1511 that was processed with 5.3.3 ) . \n we also made use of the epic background blank field files and tools provided by a. read @xcite . \n the starburst saa pec : h type galaxy ngc  1511 was studied as part of our project and x - ray results presented at this meeting have been published in @xcite . \n epic ( @xcite ) revealed for the first time the presence of a diffuse hot gaseous phase in ngc  1511 partly extending out of the disk plane . \n extra - planar emission due to cosmic rays and magnetic fields was earlier seen in radio continuum emission @xcite and is suggestive of a common origin for the outflow of these components of the ism . \n the x - ray spectral analysis of the integrated 0.2 - 12 kev emission ( excluding a strong point source about 30 north of the centre , which - if associated with ngc  1511 - might be an ultra - luminous @xmath0  erg s@xmath1 x - ray source ) showed a complex emission composition : one ( although not the only possible ) best - fitting model was found consisting of two thermal components and a power law contributing 12% ( 0.19 kev ) , 11% ( 0.59 kev ) and 77% ( powerl ) to the total flux , respectively . \n the finding that a spectral model with a single temperature gas component is not sufficient to describe the emission , points toward the fact that the x - ray emitting gas contains several phases . \n the best - fit model corresponding total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath2  erg s@xmath1 ) leads to a far - infrared - to - x - ray luminosity ratio for ngc  1511 which is typical for starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) . \n the optical monitor ( om , @xcite ) on board  was used to observe ngc  1511 in the uv during the x - ray observations and obtained images showing that this galaxy is heavily disturbed ( as it also can be seen in h@xmath3 ( @xcite ) and in the near infra - red ) . \n strong evidence for tidal interactions has only recently been obtained through h observations @xcite , unfortunately rendering ngc  1511 unsuitable as target galaxy to study the dependence of its gaseous halo s properties on the distribution and level of sf in the underlying disk . \n based on multi - wavelength ( optical , radio continuum and  x - ray observations ) , we ` classified ' ngc  4666 as a ` superwind ' sc galaxy @xcite harboring an extra - planar outflow cone emanating from a central sf region of @xmath4  kpc in radius , and having an opening angle of @xmath5 . \n the outflow could be traced up to @xmath6  kpc above the disk plane by optical emission line filaments . \n the  x - ray observations ( @xcite , see fig . \n [ fig_n4666_xray ] , left panel ) indicated the presence of soft extended x - ray emission outside of the disk on the north - western ( closer to us ) side of ngc  4666 . \n our  epic observation , in contrast , show for the first time that such soft x - ray emission exists on both sides of the galactic disk , originating from a huge , structured hot gas halo ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_xray ] , right panel , and fig . \n [ fig_n4666_multi ] ) . \n the diffuse emission detected by epic - pn is strong enough to allow us to perform a spectral analysis in several areas in the galactic disk and halo : the complex spectrum of the diffuse disk emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , top ) can be fitted by a combination of an internally absorbed mekal ( 0.54  kev ) and power law component plus another mekal model ( 0.18  kev ) all affected by galactic foreground absorption . the lower halo emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , middle ) shows a similar spectral behavior as the disk spectrum . \n the spectrum of the upper halo emission ( fig . \n [ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , bottom ) , however , does not need a second mekal component but is fitted reasonably well also with a single 0.23  kev thermal plasma . \n most of the total flux above 0.9  kev originates from the power - law type emission ( presumably due to unresolved point - like sources ) , whereas the thermal plasma clearly dominates in the soft 0.3 - 0.9  kev band ( contributing 72% , 69% and 92% to the ` diffuse ' disk , lower and upper halo emission , respectively ) . \n if the diffuse x - ray emission in the soft energy band is assumed to be due to hot gas , it is possible to calculate the gas density @xmath7 and its mass @xmath8 . to this end \n we used the model of thermal cooling and ionization equilibrium of @xcite where @xmath9 . \n the unknown filling factor @xmath10 allows for some clumpiness of the gas . \n if we fit all the spectra extracted from the three areas with a single - temperature mekal model , the unabsorbed flux in the 0.3 - 12  kev and corresponding luminosity ( adopting @xmath11  mpc ) are given in tab . \n [ tab_n4666 ] . for the gas temperatures of the hot gas , @xcite give a cooling coefficient @xmath12 of @xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath1 . \n assuming an ellipsoid for the disk and the outflow cone geometry ( see above ) for the emitting halo volume @xmath15 , and typical volume filling factors of 0.1 - 0.8 , we derive gas densities and masses listed in tab . \n [ tab_n4666 ] . \n lcccccc & t & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 + & & & & & & + disk & @xmath21 & 7.21 & 5.97 & 1.0 -

[ tab_n4666 ] ) , and hence the magnetic field important for the dynamics of the hot gas ( ` channeling ' the outflow ) , in the lower halo the relatively high thermal energy density is supportive of the idea that in this region the gas outflow might easily take place , even against a disk - parallel magnetic field configuration .    a detailed analysis of the halo emission and a possible correlation with h@xmath3 and radio polarization filaments ( \n as started in @xcite , see also fig . \n [ fig_n4666_multi ] ) will be addressed in an upcoming paper by ehle et al . ; there we also plan to present a self - consistent dynamical and thermal spectral model @xcite which does no longer depend on the usual assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . \n we note that the same  observations have been discussed by @xcite comparing the disk - emission with spatially unresolving _ bepposax _ data . \n the authors discuss their findings with respect to the discovery of starburst plus agn activity both contributing to the x - ray emission of ngc  4666 : the sf activity was found to be extended over most of the disk and associated with diffuse thermal emission , whereas the quite small low - luminosity type-2 agn contribution ( revealed by prominent k@xmath3 line emission from `` cold '' iron at 6.40  kev ) was detected from the nuclear region .    in ngc  4666 , @xcite failed to detect conclusive evidence for the existence of h gas in its halo . \n however , seen in their h maps are prominent tidal arms probably generated by interactions with the galaxy ngc  4668 and previously undetected dwarf companions . \n the high sf rate responsible for the superwind of ngc  4666 hence might be triggered by gravitational interaction . \n ngc  3628 is a peculiar sbc galaxy known to be an interacting member in the leo triplet ( arp 317 , assumed distance @xmath27  mpc ) . \n earlier x - ray observations with _ einstein _ @xcite and  ( @xcite , see fig . \n [ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , left panel ) showed evidence for a collimated outflow along the minor axis from a starburst nucleus in ngc  3628 and led to the detection of an extended soft x - ray halo . \n our xmm - newton observations ( fig . \n [ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , right panel ) are able to detect the extraplanar diffuse emission with much higher significance : the epic image clearly separates the southern collimated spur - like halo emission from nearby ( most possibly background ) point sources ( see fig . \n [ fig_n3628_xmm+opt ] , left panel ) and calls the proposed link between this x - ray filament and qsos @xcite to question .    a detailed comparison of the diffuse extraplanar x - ray emission with for example the h@xmath3 filaments ( a plume extending about 130 to the sw in position angle @xmath28 and faint more widespread filamentary extraplanar structures to the north - see h@xmath3 map from @xcite or @xcite and fig .

otherwise it is valued to @xmath74 . \n the unit vectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 define the flow direction and the yield direction , respectively . \n the vector @xmath77 defines the direction and magnitude of applied load . \n 2    both elastic and plastic envelope responses are calculated from different stress values . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ elpl ] . the elastic response , calculated from eq . \n ( [ elastoplastic ] ) , has a centered ellipse as envelope response for all the cases . \n since the direction of this response does not always correspond to the direction of the volumetric strain increment , the general form for the elastic stiffness must be written as    @xmath78d\\tilde{\\sigma}. \\label{elastic}\\ ] ]    here @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the classical parameters of the elasticity , i.e. the young modulus and the poisson ratio . \n they are not material parameters because they depend on the stress state we take . \n moreover , an additional variable @xmath81 must be included in this relation , taking into account the anisotropy of the elastic response . \n a limit of isotropy is found around @xmath82 ( see fig .  [ elpl ] ) . \n below of this line the parameters of elasticity are almost constants with @xmath83 . above this limit \n the stiffness decreases as a result of open contacts , giving rise to an anisotropic elastic response .    in a previous work @xcite , the elasto - plastic quantities resulting form eq . \n ( [ plastic ] ) and eq . \n ( [ elastic ] ) have been evaluated as a function of the stress state . since the mechanical response of soils depends not only on the initial stress state but also on the way how this state is reached @xcite , these results are only valid in the case of monotonic load . in the classical theory of elasto - plasticity , \n the dependence of the strain response on the history of the deformation is described by the evolution of the so - called _ \n yield surface_. this surface encloses a hypothetical region in the stress space where only elastic deformations are possible @xcite .    we attempt to detect the yield surface by using a standard procedure proposed in experiments with sand @xcite . \n [ yield ] shows this procedure : initially the sample is subject to isotropic pressure . \n then the sample is loaded in the axial direction until it reaches a the yield - stress state with pressure @xmath39 and shear stress @xmath40 . since plastic deformation \n is found in this stress value , the point @xmath84 can be considered as a classical yield point . \n then , the classical theory assumes the existence of a yield surface containing this point . in order to explore the yield surface , \n the sample is unloaded in the axial direction until it reaches the stress point with pressure @xmath85 and shear stress @xmath86 inside the elastic regime . \n then the yield surface is constructed by taking different directions in the stress space for re - loading . in each direction , the new yield point must be detected by a sharp change in the slope in the stress - strain curve , indicating plastic deformations . \n [ de ] shows the strain response taking different load directions in the same sample . if the direction of the reload path is the same as that one of the original load ( @xmath87 ) , we observe a sharp decrease of stiffness when the load point reaches the initial yield point , which corresponds to the origin in fig . \n however , if we take a different direction of re - loading , we find that the decrease of the stiffness with the loading becomes smooth . \n since there is no straightforward way to identify those points where the yielding begins , the yield function , as it was introduced by drucker & prager @xcite in order to describe a sharp transition between the elastic and plastic regions is not consistent with our results . \n the incremental elasto - plastic response of a voronoi tessellated sample of polygons has been examined in the framework of the classical theory . \n the resulting constitutive relation leads to non - linear , anisotropic elasticity , where the classical parameters of elasticity , the young modulus and the poisson ratio , are not material constants . \n the plastic response reflects the non - associated features of realistic soils . here \n the classical analysis of drucker & prager is not applicable , because it is not possible to determine an elastic regime . \n future work will be oriented to a micro - mechanically based description of these elasto - plastic features . \n since the mechanical response of the granular sample is represented as a collective response of all the contacts , it is expected that the macro - mechanical response can be completely characterized by the inclusion of some field - variables , which contain the information about the micro - structural arrangements between the grains . \n some statistical variables like the fabric tensor have been included as internal variables @xcite . \n this description , however , does not seem to offer a complete characterization of the constitutive response . \n more salient aspects , such as the yielding of the contacts , and the fluctuations of the stress inside the granular material , might offer a more complete set of internal variables for the description of the macroscopic state . \n this is , in our point of view , an important challenge in the future . \n we thank f. darve , p. vermeer , f. kun , and j. strm for helpful discussions and acknowledge the support of the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ within the research group _ \n modellierung kohsiver reibungsmaterialen_.", "StartTimeOffset": 2689994521469, "RequestID": "40d0ce40f07040ac88eebd5868a99fa3", "TotalTokens": 4024}
{"ContextTokens": 3534, "GeneratedTokens": 222, "SynthesizedBody": "the origin of grb is one of the most fascinating outstanding problems in astronomy . \n their observed energy injection in the universe is sufficiently large to possibly resolve another long - standing puzzle : the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays@xcite . \n mounting evidence suggests that grb emission is produced by a relativistically expanding fireball , energized by a process involving neutron stars or black holes@xcite . in the early stages the fireball , its radiation trapped by the very large optical depth , can not emit photons efficiently . \n the fireball s kinetic energy is therefore dissipated until it becomes optically thin  a scenario that can explain the observed energy and time scales of grbs , provided the bulk lorentz factor of the expanding flow , @xmath0 , is @xmath1 . \n protons accelerated in shocks in the expanding fireball interact with photons to produce charged pions , the parents of high - energy neutrinos @xcite . assuming that particles accelerated in the grb sources produce the observed cosmic rays above the  ankle \" of the energy spectrum near @xmath2  ev \n , one derives that the average single burst produces only @xmath3 neutrino events in a high energy neutrino telescope with @xmath4 effective area . \n although the expected rate is therefore low , the neutrino signal should be relatively easy to observe provided the detector is large enough : grb neutrinos will have a hard spectrum extending well beyond the background from atmospheric neutrinos and , even more important , the high - energy grb neutrino events should coincide with observed grb photon events within a narrow time window .    in this paper \n we calculate the experimental signatures of grb in a kilometer - scale neutrino detector such as the proposed icecube @xcite . \n we emphasize the importance of taking into account burst - to - burst fluctuations @xcite as well as absorption of the neutrino signal in the earth for both event rates and experimental signatures . \n both effects produce additional and striking signatures with discriminating sensitivity to the value of the bulk lorentz factor whose value is only indirectly inferred from other astronomical observations @xcite . \n the observation of grb neutrinos over a cosmological baseline has scientific potential beyond testing the  best - buy \" fireball model : the observations can test with unmatched precision special relativity and the equivalence principle , and study oscillating neutrino flavors over the ultimate baseline of @xmath5 @xcite . \n in calculating the event rates and experimental signatures of grb neutrinos in a high energy neutrino telescope we follow the model of waxman and bahcall @xcite as implemented by halzen and hooper @xcite . \n we have normalized the neutrino flux to the energy rate injected in the universe needed to explain the observed cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum above @xmath6 ev , @xmath7 . \n this energy rate was calculated in reference @xcite , assuming a cosmological distribution of sources and taking into account cr propagation in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . \n the value quoted above corresponds to the `` low redshift '' ( @xmath8 ) energy generation rate of crs . \n note that , because of the absorption of highest energy cosmic rays by cmbr photons , one could further increase @xmath9 without directly affecting their observed flux . \n waxman and bahcall @xcite have calculated an upper limit to the cosmic rate production rate in the whole universe , assuming the energy generation rate evolves rapidly with redshift following the luminosity density evolution of quasi - stellar sources . \n they obtain an upper limit which is @xmath10 . it is interesting however to mention that @xmath9 is comparable to that produced in @xmath11-rays by cosmological grbs ( which are not expected to be absorbed by the intervening backgrounds since the typical photon energy is below 1 mev ) . assuming the efficiency with which electrons ( which ultimately produce the observed photons by synchrotron radiation ) and protons is the same inside the grb fireball \n , the value of @xmath9 quoted above might well be closer to the actual value . \n for this , and other reasons , it is anyway unlikely that our calculations are accurate to better than a factor 3 or so . \n moreover our neutrino event rate calculation might be conservative in this respect . \n the neutrino flux is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a normalization constant that is determined from energy considerations as explained above and in reference @xcite . \n the observed neutrino rates are calculated by folding this generic flux over the distributions of individual bursts in distance , @xmath14 , energy , @xmath15 and boost factor , @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy emitted by a particular grb , @xmath19 its redshift and @xmath0 the boost factor . \n @xmath20 represents the efficiency of detecting a neutrino of energy @xmath21 . \n the first two distributions can be modelled after observations : a cosmological distribution in distance , and an energy distribution which assumes that ten percent of grb produce more energy than average by a factor of ten , and one percent by a factor of 100@xcite . \n most important however are the fluctuations in the @xmath0 factor around its average phenomenological value of @xmath22@xmath23 . \n the fluctuations in @xmath0 affect the efficiency for producing pions in the @xmath24 collisions in the fireball as @xmath25 @xcite , as well as the break energy , @xmath26 , which varies as @xmath27 . \n unfortunately the distribution in @xmath0 can not even be guessed at . nevertheless , it is critical in making quantitative predictions@xcite . \n the physics is clear . in grbs , \n high luminosities are emitted over short times , therefore the large photon density would render grb opaque unless @xmath0 is very large . \n only transparent sources with large boost factors emit photons . \n they are however relatively weak neutrino sources because the actual photon target density in the fireball is diluted by the large lorentz factor . \n an even moderately reduced value of @xmath0 will produce a prolific neutrino source . \n we remind the reader that the results obtained from eq . \n [ eq : folding ] are at variance with the neutrino rate obtained by multiplying the average rate per burst by the number of bursts . even neglecting the all important fluctuations in @xmath0 , there is no such concept as an average grb . \n e.g.for @xmath28 , the correct computation of eq . \n [ eq : folding ] yields a rate of @xmath29 events per km@xmath30 and year , roughly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction obtained by neglecting the observed burst - to - burst fluctuations in distance and energy . \n another consequence of fluctuations is that the signal is dominated by a few very bright bursts , which greatly simplifies their detection . \n as pointed out above , the average neutrino energy varies with the square of boost factor and therefore the calculated event rates , especially their dependence on @xmath0 , is strongly affected by the fact that higher energy neutrinos are preferentially absorbed in the earth before reaching the detector@xcite . \n also this effect has been neglected in all previous calculations . \n for instance , the 75 events just mentioned are reduced by a factor 3 by absorption . \n one should on the other hand remember that by oscillations , a large fraction of @xmath31 can oscillate into @xmath32 which penetrate the earth @xcite . \n it is in this context important to realize that a kilometer - scale detector such as icecube can measure the energy of the neutrinos . \n therefore , signal events can be separated from the low energy atmospheric background by energy measurement , which allows the identifications of neutrinos from all directions and not just in the hemisphere where they pass through the earth . \n we calculate the flux of neutrinos from grb in the fireball model following reference  @xcite . \n the number of protons in the fireball is fixed by the assumption that they are the source of the ultra high energy cosmic rays above @xmath6 ev . \n the results are shown in figure [ grbfluxes ] which shows the @xmath33 flux from grbs for different values of @xmath0 . \n the fluxes have been multiplied by @xmath34 so that they represent the energy emitted in the form of neutrinos . \n notice the variation of the break in the spectrum @xmath26 as @xmath35 . \n also , for values of @xmath0 below @xmath36 100 the fireball becomes opaque to protons and at this point the total amount of energy available for neutrino production is converted . \n the neutrino flux , which roughly scales as @xmath25 , saturates and no longer grows with decreasing boost factor ; see figure [ grbfluxes ] .    as usual @xcite \n , we calculate the event rate per grb by folding the neutrino flux with the probability of detecting a muon produced in a @xmath37 or @xmath38 interaction . \n fluctuations in distance @xmath19 and total grb energy , or fluency , @xmath18 are accounted for by a monte carlo simulation we have developed for this purpose . \n we simulate a large number of grbs at different zenith angles assuming an isotropic distribution and subsequently obtain the event rate per year by assuming 1000 grbs / year . \n absorption of the neutrinos in the earth prior to reaching the detector is taken into account using the density profile of reference @xcite . \n it is also important to implement the fact that above the detector there is a limited column density of atmosphere and ice available for neutrino detection .    in table \n [ numuevents ] we separately show , for different @xmath0 s , the event rate of upgoing , i.e. neutrinos that cross the earth before interacting near the detector , and downgoing neutrinos . \n the first two columns show for comparison the number of events when neither absorption nor the limited amount of target above the detector are taken into account . \n it is clear that both effects play an important role in obtaining the correct event rate . \n this is not surprising : the earth becomes opaque to neutrinos of energy around 100 tev , and the muon range exceeds the @xmath36 2 km vertical depth of the icecube detector at energies around @xmath39 tev . \n .@xmath33 events @xmath40 \n . only fluctuations in distance and energy are taken into account . \n [ numuevents ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n this research was supported in part by the us department of energy under grant de -

energy expansion , but also provide a reliable error estimate and a well - defined domain of applicability . \n an eft appropriate for short - range interactions has been applied to a large variety of physical systems . \n i discussed how this short - range eft can be used to study universal relations in the three - body sector and how range corrections affect the three - body bound state spectrum . \n it is a surprising result that the efimov spectrum in the unitary limit remains unchanged at next -

{"ContextTokens": 2905, "GeneratedTokens": 70, "SynthesizedBody": "in theoretical extensions of the standard model , all the new particles are not necessarily on the heavy side ; the prediction of very light ( sub - ev ) scalar or pseudoscalar particles that are very weakly interacting is actually quite generic . \n looking for signatures of such `` axion - like particles '' ( or alps ) therefore represents another exciting possibility to probe the kind of physics there can be at very high scales , associated with these new degrees of freedom , which is complementary to collider searches . \n it is thus not surprising that a lot of ongoing effort is made to scan the parameter space of these hypothetical particles , actively searched for mostly via their electromagnetic coupling . \n current experimental developments include for instance light - shining - through - a - wall experiments such as alps , which is being upgraded  @xcite , or projects of next - generation helioscopes such as the international axion observatory  @xcite . \n due to their mixing with photons , these spinless particles are moreover not only of interest in particle physics but also in astrophysics , as their existence would change the properties and the propagation of light emitted from distant sources . \n a sizeable signal could be expected as the distances involved are huge , even if the alps are only coupled very weakly . in this context , various phenomena have in fact already been interpreted as possible astrophysical hints for the existence of alps , especially in the low - mass region of the parameter space : namely alps with masses @xmath0  ev and couplings to photons @xmath1@xmath2  gev@xmath3 . for a recent summary of the motivations for these particles from theory and of their implications , see refs . \n @xcite and references therein .    in this work \n @xcite , we consider light coming from quasars . \n the fact that these high - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are among the brightest and furthest steady light sources known in the universe makes them particularly appealing to look for signals of alps and to constrain their parameter space . \n we focus on the window of astrophysical interest and show that constraints can be derived using both linear and circular polarisation data . \n polarimetry is an extremely valuable tool to search for axion - like particles as the interaction of these particles with photons , in external magnetic fields for instance , would change the polarisation of light  @xcite . \n suitable interaction lagrangians read @xmath4 and lead to similar phenomenological consequences ; henceforth we focus on pseudoscalars . in a nutshell , \n one expects from the mixing that even unpolarised light will develop a non - vanishing degree of linear polarisation and that , in general , linear and circular polarisation will convert at least partially into one another as a consequence of phase - shifts induced by the mixing . as is well - known and readily seen from eq . \n , this is because , in an external magnetic field , such spinless particles only couple to one direction of polarisation  @xcite .    the mixing can actually be very efficient at modifying polarisation and can therefore be constrained by precise measurements . \n the limits derived from the absence of rotation of the linear polarisation of uv light from agn  @xcite are a recent example of this .    in this work , \n we follow a different idea , which is to consider the spectroscopically defined quasar classes known to have the smallest intrinsic polarisations in visible light , and to compare the predictions of the mixing with observations . as already discussed by harari and sikivie in ref . \n @xcite , light from distant sources should be characterised by at least some amount of polarisation if axion - photon mixing happens along the way . \n we do this for both linear ( @xmath5 ) and circular ( @xmath6 ) polarisation . \n quasar polarisation measurements at optical wavelengths can be found in the literature with uncertainties below 0.1% . \n light from quasars is known to be intrinsically linearly polarised , as differences can be seen in different spectroscopic types , and the polarisation is at the 1%-level for the least polarised ones . \n if there are many catalogs of linear polarisation measurements , the same can not be said about circular polarisation : it has rarely been studied , despite being measured in the same way as the linear one by simply adding a quarter - wave retarder plate . following the predictions of the mixing , new dedicated observations of quasar circular polarisation in visible light \n have therefore been carried out  @xcite . \n for observational reasons , most of the objects are located towards the north galactic pole direction , which points to the center of the local supercluster ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite . \n no evidence for non - vanishing circular polarisation could be found at the 3@xmath7-level however  @xcite . \n we will not repeat here the discussion leading to our subsample ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) or the method used to obtain our limits , as all the necessary details can be found in ref . \n let us simply emphasise again that we have aimed at being as conservative as possible : taking only into account the influence of the magnetic field in the supercluster , allowing the magnetic field to get a longitudinal component most of the time ( and allowing other quantities to fluctuate ) , as well as considering initially unpolarised light to make sure that the final polarisation due to the mixing is not overestimated for example .    using a conservative method leading to robust results \n , we can safely say that the mixing of light with axion - like particles is strongly constrained by the good - quality measurements of polarisation , and especially of circular polarisation , even when bandwidth effects are taken into account  @xcite . \n however this might say something about the magnetic fields or the electron density , and not about alps . \n this is why we provide here the evolution of our limit with the maximum transverse magnetic field strength and with the mean electron density . \n the only reported detection available in the literature for the magnetic field in the local supercluster plane favours a collection of @xmath8 g magnetic field domains that are coherent over @xmath9  kpc  @xcite , averaging to a field 510 times weaker at the supercluster scale . \n if we use this result , the 2@xmath7-limit we obtain is @xmath10  gev@xmath3 for @xmath11  ev ; as emphasised in our paper  @xcite , this limit can however be easily rescaled for any other value of the magnetic field strength as it always appears together with the coupling constant in the equations .    on the other hand , in order to give the evolution of our limit with the average electron density , we can take advantage of the fact that , for alp masses much smaller than the plasma frequency @xmath12 the two dimensionless quantities that determine the evolution of the stokes parameters then become independent of @xmath13 , leading to a plateau  @xcite . here , we give in fig . \n [ fig : ap_electrondensity ] the evolution of this plateau for various values of the average electron density @xmath14 ; the case illustrated in the paper  @xcite is given by @xmath15  @xmath16 , which is the value usually considered in superclusters . \n the information is summarised by saying that points in the parameter space are excluded at 1@xmath7 , 2@xmath7 and 3@xmath7 when the average probability that they contradict the observations is respectively 68.3% , 95.5% and 99.7% . \n as anticipated in the paper , the limits on the coupling constant @xmath17 for nearly massless pseudoscalars would be more stringent for values of the plasma frequency smaller than the one we have considered , which reflects the fact that the mixing then becomes more efficient . \n conversely , if the electron density in the local supercluster were to actually be much higher than that , then no constraint could be put on such particles as the mixing would then simply not take place in that medium .     on the average electron density . \n the maximum transverse magnetic strength used here is @xmath18 g . ] \n [ sec : figures ] \n we thank the ifpa group for the financial support received to attend this workshop , and acknowledge useful discussions with jean - ren cudell and damien hutsemkers . \n r.  bhre , b.  dbrich , j.  dreyling - eschweiler , s.  ghazaryan , r.  hodajerdi , d.  horns , f.  januschek and e .- a . \n knabbe _ et al . \n _ , jinst * 1308 * ( 2013 ) t09001 [ arxiv:1302.5647 [ physics.ins-det ] ] . j.  k.  vogel , f.  t.  avignone , g.  cantatore , j.  m.  carmona , s.  caspi , s.  a.  cetin , f.  e.  christensen and a.  dael _ et al . \n _ , arxiv:1302.3273 [ physics.ins-det ] . \n a.  payez , ph.d . \n thesis , arxiv:1308.6608 [ astro-ph.co ] . see the introduction and chap .  1 \n . k.  baker , g.  cantatore , s.  a.  cetin , m.  davenport , k.  desch , b.  dbrich , h.  gies and i.  g.  irastorza _ et al . \n _ , annalen phys . \n * 525 * ( 2013 ) a93 [ arxiv:1306.2841 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  ringwald , phys . \n dark univ . \n * 1 * ( 2012 ) 116 [ arxiv:1210.5081 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  payez , j.r . \n cudell and d.  hutsemkers , jcap * 1207 * ( 2012 ) 041 [ arxiv:1204.6187 [ astro-ph.co ] ] . \n l.  maiani , r.  petronzio and e.  zavattini , phys . \n b * 175 * ( 1986 ) 359 . \n g.  raffelt and l.  stodolsky , phys . \n d * 37 * ( 1988 ) 1237 . \n d.  harari and p.  sikivie , phys . \n b * 289 * ( 1992 ) 67 . \n p.  sikivie , phys .  rev \n .  lett . \n * 51 * ( 1983 ) 1415 [ erratum - ibid . \n * 52 * ( 1984 ) 695 ] . \n d.  horns , l.  maccione , a.  mirizzi and m.  roncadelli , phys . \n d * 85 * ( 2012 ) 085021 [ arxiv:1203.2184 [ astro-ph.he ] ] ;

{"ContextTokens": 2537, "GeneratedTokens": 311, "SynthesizedBody": "as a continuation of our study of the effects of scattering of x - rays by interstellar grains , we have undertaken an examination of the surface brightness profile ( sbp ) of the crab nebula . toward this end , we have investigated the large - scale structure of the nebula related to the existence of an x - ray halo . \n previous observations have offered convincing evidence for such a halo ( ku , et al . \n 1976 ; toor , et al . \n 1976 ; charles & culhane 1977 ) , though a decisive explanation as to its existence has , until the present , been lacking . \n two competing theories have been advanced . \n first , in analogy with other snrs , the halo is attributed to the emission of a strong shock . \n this interpretation is troubled by the lack of x - ray emission lines from this region ( schattenburg , et al . \n 1980 ) , though it can not be excluded by this fact alone , given the featureless x - ray spectrum for the sn 1006 remnant ( becker , et al .  1980 ) . \n a second theory which explains the x - ray halo is that it is due to the scattering of x - rays by interstellar grains . \n we argue below that this interpretation is the correct one , and discuss the crab s halo as a natural , observable feature of all bright galactic x - ray sources . \n the crab nebula was imaged by both the high resolution imager ( hri ) and the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) aboard the einstein observatory . \n a quantitative display of the hri data is presented in figure 1a . \n this is the azimuthally summed , radially binned sbp . \n the binning neglects the ellipticity of the nebula , and is centered roughly 16 arcseconds northwest of the pulsar at the centroid of the light in the phase - averaged image . \n three things are readily apparent : ( 1 ) the surface brightness drops off dramatically beyond about 50 arcseconds , ( 2 ) a bump in this trend kicks in at about @xmath1 arcseconds , and ( 3 ) we run out of the hri s field of view just when things are getting interesting . \n this brings us to the ipc data . \n we gain with the ipc in two ways : with its wide field of view ( @xmath2 arcminutes ) , and with its lower background . \n both of these features allow us to track the sbp of the crab to very large radii . in exactly the same way as the hri sbp , this data is presented in figure 1b . \n again , three things are apparent : ( 1 ) due to this instrument s broad spatial resolution , the structure of the nebula is entirely lost , ( 2 ) the flair in the sbp is real , extending in roughly power - law form beyond @xmath3 arcseconds , and ( 3 ) there is no hint of a shell , which would appear as a shelf - like extension of the sbp . \n obviously , we could hide a shell under this profile if it were dim and/or small enough that it did nt disturb the power - law tail on the measured sbp . \n in this way , we could place an upper limit on the luminosity of a shell from a shock wave surrounding the crab . \n we will return to this later . \n in order to address the shapes observed for the sbps , we need to consider carefully the contributions of the point response function ( prf ) , which is due to the point response of the mirror and the spatial resolution of each detector . \n since the hri has extremely fine ( 0.5 arcsecond ) spatial resolution , its prf is the point response of the mirrors . \n the prf of the ipc ( fig . \n 2 ) is much more complicated due to its broad spatial resolution . \n conceptually , however , we expect the ipc s prf to be the convolution of the mirror response ( which is measured by the hri ) , and its own intrinsic spatial resolution . \n the prf for both the hri and the ipc were determined during calibration testing prior to the observatory s launch . \n an analysis of this data reveals that the prf for each instrument contains an appreciable amount of power at large radii due to the scattering of x - rays from surface imperfections in the mirror elements . \n this effect produces nearly power - law prfs for the hri , and adds similar wings onto the ipc s prfs , which are themselves dominated by the broad , nearly gaussian , spatial resolution of this instrument . \n this explains to zeroth order the observed sbps for the crab nebula ( fig .  1 ) . \n the excess surface brightness beyond @xmath4 arcseconds in the hri profile is due to scattering by the mirror elements of x - rays from the pulsar and nebula . \n similarly , the power - law wing on the ipc s sbp is attributable to x - rays scattered by the mirror , while the width of the core is due as much to the spatial resolution of the detector as to the extent of the nebula . \n upon closer examination , the sbp of the crab , as measured by the ipc , has too much power at large radii : typically , 10% of the power of the prfs falls beyond 3 arcminutes , whereas this fraction is 15% for the crab s sbp . \n note that the @xmath5 arcsecond extent of the nebula , being the order of , or smaller than , the spatial resolution of the detector , and in turn being so much smaller than the scale of the effect we are discussing here , insignificantly impacts this comparison . \n the difference of 5% between the measured sbp and the prf is of the order of the halo intensity reported by others for the crab . \n a more detailed investigation involves the construction of a model profile for the response of the ipc to the intrinsic sbp of the crab . \n this is handled in the following way . to first order \n , the hri measures the intrinsic sbp of the crab \n the differences between these being the effect of mirror scattering and the hri s 0.5 arcsecond spatial resolution . \n a second order approximation to the crab s intrinsic sbp would result if we could deconvolve the hri sbp with the hri s prf . \n we settle with truncating the hri profile at @xmath1 arcseconds : this removes the power - law wing obviously associated with mirror scattering , while neglecting the broadening of the profile due to scattering interior to this radius . \n this approximation to the true profile suffices if we are not interested in , nor sensitive to , the small - scale structure of the nebula when observed with the ipc . \n we construct a model ipc sbp for the crab by convolving the ipc s prf with the crab s intrinsic sbp , which is approximated in the manner just described as the truncated hri sbp . \n the prf we use is a linear combination of nine monoenergetic calibration prfs , weighted is such a way as to approximate the response of the ipc to the crab s continuous spectrum \n careful account being made of the gain of the detector and the modification of the crab s intrinsic spectrum by the effective area of the mirror / detector combination . \n this prf is convolved with the crab s ` true ' sbp to produce a model ipc sbp . \n this is compared to the measured profile in figure 3a : a significant difference is seen to exist between these two profiles beyond @xmath6 arcseconds . \n the difference between the measured and model profiles reveals the size , shape , and intensity of the excess emission beyond the borders of the nebula . the magnitude of this excess , defined as the fractional difference between these two profiles is @xmath7 . \n while this figure agrees with the magnitude of the excess emission reported by other observers , we are able for the first time to choose unambiguously between the two theories advanced to explain it . in particular , this emission has the character of a halo produced by the scattering of x - rays from interstellar grains and not that of a shock . a theoretical explanation as to why the former interpretation is correct would take us too far afield ; \n the interested reader is left to pursue this topic in the literature ( overbeck 1965 ; hayakawa 1970 ; mauche , et al . \n we simply assert two things : ( 1 ) the halo around the crab nebula has ` exactly ' the same shape as the halo around the compact galactic x - ray source gx13 + 1 , shown in figure 3b , and ( 2 ) the halo around gx13 + 1 is due to scattering from dust . \n gx13 + 1 is but one of the compact sources for which we have detected halos . \n the strength of these have been found to correlate well with two quantities which measure the column density of grains to a given source : ( 1 ) the amount of visual extinction , and ( 2 ) the distance through the galaxy s dust layer . \n the data points for the crab are shown plotted amongst the points for the compact sources in figure 4 : the crab s relatively weak halo is consistent with its extinction as well as with its location with respect to the galactic plane . \n these two observations  the similarity between figures 3a and 3b , and the correlation in figure 4  unmistakably identifies the mechanism for the crab s halo as scattering from dust \n . however , we need to return to what the halo is not : emission from a shell associated with a shock wave . \n an upper limit on the luminosity of such a shell is dependent on its angular size , due to the obscuring effects of mirror and dust scattering on the ipc sbp , in such a way that the upper limit is smaller ( larger ) for a shell of larger ( smaller ) size . \n we choose to calculate the upper limit for a size of 9 arcminutes , consistent with the prediction of a sedov solution with nominal parameters , as well as with the ( age and distance ) scaled size of cas a. our estimate of the maximum surface brightness for a shell of this size is shown in figure 3a . \n the associated 0.54 kev luminosity is about 1% of the crab s , or about @xmath0 . \n significantly , this upper limit is a factor of @xmath8 larger than the luminosity ( though only a factor of three in central surface brightness ) of the sn 1006 remnant , which is of approximately the same age as the crab . \n consequently , we can not place a strong upper limit on the shell s luminosity \n . the important result of this paper is however that at ` soft ' x - ray energies the crab s dust - scattering halo completely obscures its putative shell . due to the @xmath9 dependence in the size of the halo , and the @xmath10 dependence in the halo intensity \n , the prospects for detecting the shell would be much better at higher energies .", "StartTimeOffset": 2756709140063, "RequestID": "1adbcf12c13a42de8895bb8b77494fb8", "TotalTokens": 2848}
{"ContextTokens": 3664, "GeneratedTokens": 206, "SynthesizedBody": "the issue of controlling chaos has attracted great interest in the last two decades ; much work has been done in the case of dissipative systems . \n ott , grebogi and york ( ogy )  @xcitedeveloped a method by which chaos can be suppressed by making small time - dependent perturbations in order to shadow one of the infinitely many periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor . \n this method has been extended by many following studies  @xcite and successfully applied to experimental systems  @xcite .    as a result of the absence of attractors in conservative systems and the complex nature of the phase space combining regular and irregular regions , constructing \n an effective method has remained a challenging question . \n lai ding and grebogi ( ldg ) extended the ogy method to hamiltonian systems by incorporating the notion of stable and unstable directions at each periodic point .    in relation to the above question , chandre _ et al . _ \n @xcite have developed a method for constructing barriers in phase space to subdue chaotic behavior for large times . \n this method is based on the introduction of a specifically designed small control term which changes the dynamics from chaotic to regular behavior . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have introduced a method for controlling chaos in two - dimensional hamiltonian system which they called adaptive integrable mode coupling based on the separation of the system into two coupled subsystems one of which is stable and the other unstable ; when the unstable system comes into the vicinity of the integrable system the conditions are reset resulting in an effective adaptive control . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have constructed a method which permits stabilization of kam islands through forward iteration of the orbits , and transforming them into global attractors of the embedded system . \n et al . _ \n @xcite have used a method of adding a small perturbation to modify systems , such as nonlinear plasmas , to follow more regular motion . \n additional efficient methods have been proposed in  @xcite ; some of these methods require tracking the trajectories while others involve the addition of interacting terms for which the criteria are somewhat sensitive . \n geometric approaches for the analysis of the stability of a given hamiltonian have been widely discussed  @xcite , for which curvature of a manifold is associated with stability .    the pioneering work of oloumi and teychenn  @xcite proposes a stabilization method by considering the gaussian curvature of the potential energy as a source of chaos . even if the condition of negative curvature of the potential and instability of the dynamics are not completely equivalent they were able to successfully control the instability by avoidance of negative curvature regions of the potential energy ( ancrp ) .    in this work \n we make use of a recently developed geometrical criterion  @xcite which is highly sensitive to instability in hamiltonian systems , and has been shown to be in complete agreement with the results of the numerical technique of surface of section ( poincar plot ) and more effective than other geometric methods  @xcite . \n this criterion is based on an equivalence between motions generated by hamiltonian in the standard form with quadratic kinematic terms and additive potentials ( which we shall call the _ hamilton _ \n description ) and a hamiltonian in which the dynamics is described by a metric - type function of coordinates multiplying the momenta in bilinear form ( which we shall call the _ gutzwiller _ description )  @xcite . \n the mapping between these equivalent descriptions was first introduced by appel  @xcite . \n the criterion for stability developed in  @xcite establishes an inverse mapping of the motion described completely geometrically in the gutzwiller space back to the hamilton description , carrying with it the covariance under diffeomorphisms that is a property of the gutwiller dynamics . \n the resulting orbits in the hamilton description , with the special choice of coordinates serving as the basis for the appel type relation , reduce to the standard description of the hamilton orbits under the hamilton equations . in general geometric form , as geodesic equations , however , they are subject to analysis in terms of geodesic deviation , and the resulting formula can be reduced to a computation in the special coordinates of a new ( symmetric ) matrix valued criterion for stability  @xcite which has been shown to be very effective in a wide range of examples  @xcite .    in the analysis of these systems \n , it was shown that the presence of negative eigenvalues for the stability matrix in the admissible physical region ( for which @xmath0 ) results in a chaotic type poincar plot . \n since the condition is local in coordinate space , the result necessarily implies some degree of ergodicity . \n there has , however , been no proof that the existence of negative eigenvalues is not strongly associated with the structure of the dynamics more globally , as is often the case , for example , for analytic function theory , where the presence of a complex pole implies a distortion of a relatively large region of the complex plane . the results of our application to the control of dynamical systems , however , indicates that the regions of negative eigenvalue correspond to a very localized phenomena . \n the observed instability they induce appears to be due to the passage of orbits through these regions , and they are not strongly correlated with the more global structure of the dynamics . \n what we have done here is to identify the regions of negative eigenvalue in the coordinate space , and modify the hamiltonian in these regions locally , removing the source of instability either by removing the instability inducing terms or varying the coupling to these terms to bring the hamiltonian closer to an integrable form in these regions . \n the remaining part of the space is left to develop according to the full , nonlinear , symmetry breaking , evolution . the effect on the poincar plots , as we show here , is dramatic . \n this result provides strong evidence that chaotic hamiltonian systems derive their properties from sources that may be thought of as highly localized in the regions of negative eigenvalues for the stability matrix . \n in addition to giving an interesting insight into the nature of hamiltonian chaos , it also provides an effective control method in which the hamiltonian dynamics is left to exercise its full function in a large domain of configurations , but is only constrained in prescribed local regions of the configuration space .    in the next section , \n we review the basic ideas underlying the geometrical criterion , and in the following section we give numerical results for the application of our control procedure for the cases of an oscillator with broken symmetry and a potential which may be derived from the toda form . \n @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 + @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6

geodesic motion in @xmath42    with the conformal metric in noncovariant form , ( in the coordinate system in which is defined ) , the dynamical curvature can be written in terms of derivatives of the potential @xmath17 , and the geodesic deviation equation becomes @xmath50 where the matrix @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 , defining a projection into a direction orthogonal to @xmath55 .    instability should occur if at least one of the eigenvalues of @xmath56 is negative , in terms of the second covariant derivatives of the transverse component of the geodesic deviation . \n this condition is easily seen to be equivalent to the same condition imposed on the spectrum of @xmath51 , and is thus independent of the direction of the motion on the orbit . \n the condition implied by the geodesic deviation equation , in terms of covariant derivatives , in which the orbits are viewed geometrically as geodesic motion , is a new condition for instability  @xcite , based on the underlying geometry , for a hamiltonian system of the form , providing new insight into the structure of the unstable and chaotic behavior of hamiltonian dynamical systems . \n the method has been successfully applied to many potential models  @xcite . \n we now apply the method , which is simple and straightforward , since the instability criterion is defined locally in coordinate space , to extract from a chaotic hamiltonian the part of the dynamics in the regions for which @xmath51 has negative eigenvalues which lead to unstable motion . \n we show by direct simulation that this procedure is remarkably effective . \n the results confirm the notion of the locality of our criterion , since the ( local ) removal of parts of the hamiltonian inducing instability by this criterion strongly affects the global stability of the motion . \n in the following we give some examples of hamiltonian motion which are unstable and exhibit chaotic behavior . in two dimensions , the terms in the potential that break rotational symmetry \n have a form , in these examples , that induces chaotic behavior . \n the matrix @xmath51 computed over the physically accessible region exhibits certain regions with negative eigenvalues . \n we have arranged our simulation to replace the hamiltonian _ in the regions of negative eigenvalues _ by a hamiltonian in which the symmetry breaking terms are either removed or for which the coupling coefficient is decreased , but in regions of positive eigenvalues , the hamiltonian remains in its original form . \n the changes are carried in relatively small regions of the configuration space in the neighborhood of the regions of negative eigenvalues . \n we take for illustration here a simple and important case of coupled harmonic oscillators with perturbation @xmath57 and a generalization of the toda potential @xmath58    the first of these is known to generate chaotic behavior ; as we have shown previously , the transition to chaotic behavior as a function of energy and of the coupling to the perturbation is well described by our geometric criterion @xcite . in the present work \n , we set the coupling to the chaos inducing perturbation to zero in the regions for which the geometric criterion results in negative eigenvalues .    in our previous study of the second example eq . \n we studied the sensitivity of the dynamical behavior to the choice of energy @xcite . in the present work , at the energies for which the system exhibits chaotic behavior we have removed the chaos inducing perturbation in the regions for which the geometric criterion results in negative eigenvalues . \n 1 shows the effects on the dynamical behavior of the change of the coupling to a stable value in the regions of negative eigenvalues for the perturbed oscillator potential . \n the results for different values of energy are shown ; these values correspond to different sizes of the physically accessible region . \n note that the radius of the region of positive eigenvalues does not change in this example . \n the first row shows the physical region and the location of negative eigenvalues . \n the interior of the circle corresponds to a region in which no negative eigenvalue occur , chosen in this way to simplify the computation . \n the second row shows the surface of section poincar plot(surface of section ) of the original uncontrolled hamiltonian indicating chaotic dynamics . \n the third row shows the poincar plot generated by the controlled potential : @xmath59    where @xmath60 stands for the radius of the region of positive eigenvalues . \n 2 shows the effect of control on second system , using the controlled potential : @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for the limit ( a horizontal dashed line ) of the region of positive eigenvalues . \n in both cases , for sufficiently high energies the uncontrolled systems become less stable and a chaotic signature appears . \n we examine the method for different values of the energy , all corresponding to chaotic motion of the uncontrolled system . \n one can easily see that the poincar plots in controlled systems present almost completely regular motion . \n we see from these computations that in regions of positive eigenvalues the hamiltonian with chaos inducing terms do not generate instability . \n if the chaos inducing terms are removed or decreased in coupling in the regions of negative eigenvalues , the chaotic motion of the system is reduced or disappears . \n we conclude that the chaotic behavior of the system is associated with local properties of the hamiltonian , and that our local criterion is effective in identifying these regions . \n furthermore , our procedure provides an effective method for control of chaotic systems of this type .", "StartTimeOffset": 2771965699435, "RequestID": "c8279441b0ed4bbdbdae738ec82ae813", "TotalTokens": 3870}

{"ContextTokens": 1555, "GeneratedTokens": 281, "SynthesizedBody": "because of their fairly simple geometrical and dynamical structure disk galaxies are the ideal benchmarks to test our theories of galaxy formation , gravity , and cosmology . \n one notable characteristic of disk galaxies is the flatness of their rotation curves , which implies either that ( i ) disks are embedded in a massive dark matter halo , or ( ii ) our theory of gravity is incorrect . \n one theory build around the latter option is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , originally proposed by milgrom ( 1983a ) . in mond a characteristic acceleration @xmath0 is assumed , such that for accelerations @xmath1 the true acceleration @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the standard newtonian acceleration . \n this implies flat rotation curves , with an asymptotic value @xmath4 , without the need for dark matter .    here \n we examine how mond fairs in comparison to cdm when it comes to explaining global properties of disk galaxies in the context of a model for disk galaxy formation . \n a more detailed treatment of the models and results presented here can be found in van den bosch ( 1998 ; 2000 ) and van den bosch & dalcanton ( 2000 ) . here \n we merely summarize some of our results . \n the zero - point , scatter , and slope of the tfr of disk galaxies ( @xmath5 ) all strongly depend on the photometric band in which the tfr is defined . in the near - infrared , where one is least sensitive to dust - extinction and to uncertainties regarding the ages and metallicities of stellar populations \n , one finds @xmath6 ( i.e. , verheijen 1997 ) .    in the cdm scenario , \n one predicts a tfr of the form : @xmath7 ( see van den bosch 2000 and references therein ) with @xmath8 the circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath9 the mass - to - light ratio of the disk , and @xmath10 a parameter that describes what fraction of the baryons inside the virial radius resides in the disk ( as either stars or cold gas ) . \n thus , @xmath11 is related to the efficiencies of feedback and cooling .    in the case of mond , direct application of the modified acceleration results in a tfr of the form @xmath12 ( see milgrom 1983b ) . \n thus , cdm and mond make distinct predictions regarding the slope @xmath13 of the tfr . \n furthermore , the prediction for mond is in better agreement with the near - infrared tfr . for cdm to yield a tfr as steep \n as observed the process of galaxy formation has to be such that @xmath14 . \n advocates of mond have used this to argue against cdm , as they have claimed that this requires extremely difficult fine - tuning ( i.e , , mcgaugh & de blok 1998a , b ) .    in the upper panels of figure  1 \n we plot the @xmath15-band tfr for the data as well as for three of our models : the @xmath16cdm model , and two mond models ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) . as can be seen \n , the @xmath16cdm tfr is as steep as the data ( @xmath19 ) , which we accomplished by adjusting the feedback efficiency . \n thus , indeed some amount of tuning is required in a cdm universe . \n the mond @xmath17 model , which has zero feedback , also reveals a tfr in excellent agreement with the data . \n the mond @xmath18 model , however , in which feedback is included , yields a tfr that is too steep and with too much scatter at the low - mass end . \n the reason for the inclusion of the feedback in this latter model becomes apparent below . \n the panels in the second row of figure  1 plot the gas mass fractions ( @xmath20 ) as function of the absolute magnitude . \n the data reveals a systematic decrease of @xmath21 with increasing magnitude , which is remarkably well reproduced by the models and owes in large part to the stability related threshold densities for star formation used in our models . \n panels in the third row plot the central surface brightness of the disk as function of @xmath22 ( the amplitude of the flat part of the rotation curve ) . \n the data indicates an absence of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies at the low mass end ( indicated by the thin solid line ) . \n this is nicely reproduced by the @xmath16cdm model , and owes to the particular feedback model used . in the mond @xmath17 model , however , no such deficit of low - mass hsb disks is present , in clear contradiction with the data . in model @xmath18 we included feedback , for which we tuned the parameters to reproduce the data . \n note , however , that this model yields a tfr that is too steep . \n finally , in the lower panels of figure  1 we plot the enclosed mass - to - light ratio @xmath23 as function of the local acceleration @xmath24 . here \n @xmath25 is the ` visible ' mass of the disk ( stars and cold gas ) , and @xmath26 is the galactocentric radius . \n each data point represents one resolved measurement in the rotation curve ( rc ) of a disk galaxy . as first pointed out by mcgaugh ( 1998 ) , the observed rcs of galaxies reveal a characteristic acceleration . \n this is evident from the fact that the data in the lower - left panel reveals very little scatter . \n the presence of such a characteristic acceleration is exactly the ` ansatz ' of mond , and , not surprisingly , the mond models @xmath17 and @xmath18 nicely reproduce the data . \n however , the @xmath16cdm model is also in good agreement with the data . \n therefore , the appearance of a characteristic acceleration is not a unique prediction of mond . \n the @xmath16cdm model requires tuning of the feedback parameters to yield a tfr as steep as observed . \n however , once this is achieved the model reproduces the gas mass fractions , the absence of low mass hsb galaxies , and reveals a characteristic acceleration as observed . \n all the particular problems for cdm pointed out by mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998a ) are in fact solved by this one simple tuning . \n the mond models , however , are unable to simultaneously reproduce the tfr and the absence of low - mass hsb disks . \n although we do not consider this a strong proof against mond ( as our particular assumptions underlying the model for galaxy formation might not be valid under mond ) , we do want to emphasize that our results largely remove the claimed advantages of mond over cdm .", "StartTimeOffset": 2828931516888, "RequestID": "a63002e6d50a439681fe062e332d89a0", "TotalTokens": 1836}

fledged quantum computer , in such a way that alice s input , output , and program are hidden to bob  @xcite . \n an unconditionally secure protocol of blind quantum computation with almost classical alice was first proposed by broadbent , fitzsimons , and kashefi ( bfk )  @xcite . \n their protocol uses measurement -

kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state  @xcite , continuous - variable mbqc  @xcite , topological mbqc  @xcite , and the ancilla - driven model  @xcite .    in these bfk - based protocols , \n alice has to possess a device which emits randomly - rotated single - particle states , such as single - photon states . \n if alice s device is not perfect , and sometimes wrongly emits more than two photons , extra photons can be exploited by malicious bob to learn alice s information , by using , for example , the photon number splitting attack  @xcite . \n therefore , it is necessary for alice to precisely control the number of emitted photons , which is not easy with today s technology .    in ref . \n @xcite , a complementary protocol of the bfk - type protocol , so called measuring - alice ( ma ) protocol , was proposed by morimae and fujii . in this protocol \n , alice has only to perform measurements in stead of state preparations . \n these measurements are not necessary to be single - photon measurements : they can be polarization measurements with a threshold detector . \n since a polarization measurement with a threshold detector is much easier than a creation of a single - photon state , ma protocol eases alice s burden . \n furthermore , as is shown in ref . \n @xcite , this protocol offers the device - independent security for alice , which means that alice does not need to trust her device : even if alice s device does not work correctly , bob can not learn alice s information . \n finally , it was shown  @xcite that the security of ma protocol is based on the no - signaling principle , which is more fundamental than quantum physics  @xcite . \n because of the no - signaling principle , the proof of the security of ma protocol becomes very simple . \n if bob can not learn anything about alice s computation whatever he does , we say that the protocol offers  blindness \"  @xcite . \n ( here , we ignore unavoidable leakage of trivial information , such as the upper bound of the computational size , or whether alice s output is classical or quantum , etc . \n @xcite . ) in fact , all bfk - type blind protocols and ma protocol satisfy the blindness . \n the  verifiability \" is another important concept in could quantum computing . \n the verifiability means that alice can check whether bob is following the correct protocol . \n if malicious bob deviates from the correct protocol , the verifiability enables alice to detect it with high probability , and therefore the probability for alice of accepting a wrong result can be exponentially small . \n fitzsimons and kashefi ( fk ) recently introduced a modified version of the bfk protocol which satisfies the verifiability  @xcite . \n the verifiability of ma protocol was shown in ref . \n @xcite .    however , all previous results ( except for ref . \n @xcite ) consider only stand - alone security . \n the stand - alone security means that the protocol is secure during a single execution of it in an isolated environment . \n the stand - alone security is often proven by showing that the mutual information between honest party and malicious party is exponentially small . \n the stand - alone security establishes the security of a protocol as a primitive , and often gives important insights for deep understanding of protocols . \n therefore , it is a first goal to show the stand - alone security of a cryptographic protocol . \n however , the stand - alone security is not sufficient if we consider a protocol in a broader and hence more realistic scenario . \n for example , the ( stand - alone ) unconditional security of the quantum key distribution protocol ( qkd )  @xcite has been proven by many researchers by showing that the accessible information is exponentially small . here , the accessible information is the mutual information between the distributed key and the outcome of an optimal measurement on the adversary s system . \n however , it was pointed out in ref .  @xcite that even if the accessible information is small , the key might not be enough secure if it is used in another protocol , such as the one - time pad encryption , due to the locking  @xcite , which is a purely non - classical property . \n if we want to guarantee the security of a protocol in such a broader context , we have to show the composable security  @xcite . \n the composable security means the security of a primitive protocol in a general environment . \n for example , a protocol is secure even if it is used many times as subroutines of a larger protocol . \n the composable security of qkd was shown in ref . \n the composable security of the key recycling in authentication was studied in ref . \n @xcite . \n the composable security of the bfk - type protocols were studied in ref . \n they showed the composable blindness of the bfk protocol and the composable blind - verifiability of the fk protocol by using the constructive cryptography  @xcite . \n although the composable security of ma protocol was also studied in ref . \n @xcite , it is not sufficient , since they showed only the composable blindness : the composable device - independent blindness , which is a new feature of ma protocol , was not shown . \n furthermore , the composable blind - verifiability of ma protocol was neither considered .    in this paper \n , we study the composable security of ma protocol . for that purpose \n , we utilize the framework of the constructive cryptography  @xcite . \n we will introduce two types of ma protocols , one is without verification and the other is with verification , and will show the composable security of them . \n hence , the device - independent blindness and the verifiability of ma protocol are shown to be composable . \n we will see that our proofs of the composable security are much simpler than those of bfk type protocols due to the simplicity of the stand - alone security of ma protocol based on the no - signaling principle . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n we will first review some necessary backgrounds , including the no - signaling principle ( sec . \n [ sec : ns ] ) , mbqc ( sec . \n [ sec : mbqc ] ) , ma protocol ( sec . \n [ sec : ma ] ) , and the constructive cryptography and the composable security ( sec .  [ sec : comp ] ) . \n we will then show our results in sec . \n [ sec : result1 ] and sec . \n [ sec : result2 ] . the discussion is given in sec . \n [ sec : discussion ] . \n no - signaling principle is one of the most fundamental principles in physics , and quantum theory also respects it . \n formally , it is explained as follows . \n let us assume that alice and bob share a physical system , which might be classical , quantum , or even super - quantum ( fig . \n [ ns ] ) . for example \n , alice and bob share the bell pair , @xmath0 , alice chooses her measurement parameter @xmath1 ( such as the measurement angles of a spin ) , and performs measurement . \n she obtains the result @xmath2 . \n bob also chooses his measurement parameter @xmath3 , and performs measurement . \n he obtains the result @xmath4 . the no - signaling principle ( from alice to bob ) \n is defined by @xmath5 for all @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the conditional probability distribution of @xmath8 given @xmath9 . \n equation  ( [ no - signaling ] ) means that the change of alice s measurement parameter does not affect the probability distribution of bob s measurement result . in other words , \n the shared system can not transmit any message from alice to bob . \n interestingly , the no - signaling principle is more fundamental than quantum theory in the sense that there is a theory which is more non - local than quantum theory , but respects the no - signaling principle  @xcite . \n in this section , we will review the basics of measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc )  @xcite . \n readers who are familiar with it can skip this section . \n mbqc is a new model of quantum computation whose computational power is equivalent to the traditional circuit model . in mbqc , we first prepare a highly - entangled @xmath10 qubit ( or more generally , qudit ) state , which we call the resource state . \n we next perform measurement of each qubit . \n the measurement angle of a qubit depends on the results of the previous measurements . \n if the resource state is a universal resource state , we can simulate any quantum circuit with the adaptive local measurements . \n a canonical example of universal resource states is the cluster state  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath10 qubits are allocated on sites of the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath13 is the controlled-@xmath14 gate between @xmath15th qubit and @xmath16th qubit , and @xmath17 is a pair of nearest - neighbour sites . here \n , @xmath18 is the identity operator acting on @xmath16th qubit , and @xmath19 is the pauli @xmath14 operator acting on @xmath16th qubit .    let us see fig . \n [ figmbqc ] . \n we first prepare the cluster state ( fig .  [ figmbqc ] ( a ) ) . \n we then perform local adaptive measurements ( figs . \n [ figmbqc ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) . by changing measurement angles \n , we can generate any state @xmath20 on the last layer of the cluster state ( fig . \n [ figmbqc ] ( d ) ) , where @xmath21 is any @xmath10-qubit unitary operator . \n ( actually , what we create on the last layer is @xmath22 where @xmath23 are random binaries . \n we call @xmath24 the byproduct , and we say that we can implement @xmath20 up to a byproduct . since @xmath25 are determined by measurement results , we can correct byproduct . ) \n in this section , we will review ma protocol  @xcite . let @xmath26 and @xmath21 be the input and the program ( unitary operation ) of alice s computation , respectively . in other words \n , alice wants to implement @xmath21 on @xmath26 , and obtain @xmath27 . \n if alice s input is classical , i.e. , she knows the classical description of the input quantum state @xmath26 , or her input is a classical data , she does not need to start with @xmath26 : she can start with the standard state , such as @xmath28 , which is prepared by bob , and the preparation of the initial state can be included in @xmath21 . \n bellow , we will introduce two ma protocols . \n we will first explain a simpler one : a protocol without the verification . \n we will next explain a protocol with verification . \n these two protocols satisfy the device - independent blindness . \n note that the device - independent verifiability is not guaranteed in the second protocol , because , as we will see later , the device - independent verifiability is impossible : a malicious device can always cheat alice by pretending that all tests are passed . \n let us consider mbqc between two parties , alice and bob ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ) : bob first prepares a resource state @xmath29 , such as the cluster state , in his laboratory ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( a ) ) . \n he next sends each particle to alice one by one , and alice measures each particle in a certain angle which is determined by her program @xmath21 ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( b ) ) . \n the program is kept secret to bob . \n if bob behaves honestly , i.e. , generates the correct resource state and sends each particle correctly , the last layer of his resource state becomes @xmath27 ( up to byproducts ) ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( c ) ) . \n if bob sends it to alice , alice can obtain the correct quantum outcome ( or if she needs the classical outcome , she can obtain the correct result by measuring it ) .    since there is no message transmission from alice to bob , the no - signaling principle guarantees that bob can not learn anything about alice s input , measurement angles ( i.e. , program ) , and outputs , whatever he does on his system  @xcite . \n ( as we said , we ignore trivial leakage of alice s information . in this case \n , bob can know the upper bound of the size of alice s mbqc , since he creates the resource state . ) \n this protocol also satisfies the device - independent blindness , which means that whatever alice s device does , bob can not learn alice s secret . \n this is again shown by using the no - signaling principle : due to the no - signaling principle , alice can not send any message to bob whatever she does . \n therefore , even if her measuring device does not work correctly , bob can not gain any information about alice s secret  @xcite .    . \n if he is malicious , he might create completely different state . \n ( b ) he sends each particle to alice one by one . \n alice measures each particle according to her program . \n ( c ) the last layer of bob s resource state is @xmath27 ( up to byproduct ) if he is honest . \n , scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the above protocol does not satisfy the verifiability . in other words , if bob behaves maliciously , alice accepts a wrong result although bob can not learn alice s secret . in order to achieve the verifiability , \n we modify the above protocol in the following manner . \n let us define the @xmath10-qubit state latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are certain states , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 are certain cptp maps . if we consider @xmath129 as the simulator for @xmath74 , this shows eq . \n ( [ comp1 ] ) . \n t. sueki , t. koshiba , and t. morimae , ancilla -

{"ContextTokens": 2907, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "the torus was introduced by @xcite to explain the revelation from spectropolarimetry that type  2 ( narrow - line ) seyfert galaxies can look like type  1 ( broad - line ) seyferts along different lines of sight . since that discovery , the torus primary purpose has been to obscure the broad - line region , but it also serves to explain the near- and mid - infrared ( ir ) emission observed in the vast majority of quasars whose spectral energy distributions ( seds ) indicate dust heated to near sublimation temperatures , presumably by the accretion - disk continuum .    typically , the torus has been modeled as a static , axisymmetric structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) that may have condensations ( clumps or clouds ) within it ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n a notable exception to this paradigm is the dusty wind model of @xcite , who started with a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind , and added in radiation driving on grains beyond the dust sublimation radius . \n they were motivated in part by the large scale - height of the obscurer required by the observed seyfert  1 to seyfert  2 ratio , the inevitability of radiation driving in the presence of such a strong source of uv photons , and the apparent luminosity - dependent covering fraction of the torus @xcite . since then others ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) have also incorporated some wind component into their models , and/or the effects of ir radiation - pressure in inflating the dusty medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the questions remains : how to test for the existence of this dusty wind ?    in the uv , \n wind signatures are clearly evident in the broad resonance lines of high ionization species such as c  iv . while most apparent in classic p - cygni - like broad absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the asymmetries in the same broad emission lines are also evidence for winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the most natural mechanism for accounting for the high velocities ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) of the outflows is resonance - line driving by uv continuum photons .    unlike the clear wind signatures in the uv , \n quasar ir spectra are characterized by broad features , such as the silicate emission bumps from the vibrational stretching and bending modes of the grains at 10 and 18  @xmath0 m , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : gall_one ] ) . \n the widths and peaks of the silicate bumps are affected by the grain size distribution , and so extracting information on the velocity of the emitting grains is impossible given the uncertainties in the inherent shape of the bumps . \n narrow atomic features in the ir are from forbidden lines such as [ o  iv ] and [ ne  v ] generated in low density , photoionized gas in the inner parts of the narrow - line region . \n clear spectral signatures of a dusty wind are therefore elusive . \n luminous sdss quasars from the _ spitzer _ irs archive . \n prominent emission features are labeled ; the horizontal bars indicate the approximate location of the broad silicate emission bumps . from hill \n ( in preparation ) . ] \n in the uv , the maximum possible terminal velocity of outflows seen in absorption appears to be set by the uv luminosity @xcite . \n this makes sense for a radiation - driven uv outflow ; a high uv photon density has the ability to transfer more momentum to the ionized wind . \n while this particular mechanism is not relevant in the ir , spectral features in this regime whose strength depends on luminosity are potentially fruitful for looking for evidence of the wind from the dust . \n one such feature is the 35  @xmath0 m bump , which can be successfully modeled as a blackbody with a temperature of 12001500  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n these temperatures are interesting because they are near the grain sublimation temperature of graphites , but higher than the grain sublimation temperature of silicates . \n @xcite first noted that this feature becomes stronger at higher luminosities . \n @xcite confirmed this trend with a much larger sample of sdss quasars with _ \n irac + mips photometry by searching for convex spectra between 1 and 8  @xmath0 m ; the amount of spectral curvature was significantly correlated with luminosity . \n the increasing prominence of the 35  @xmath0 m bump can be qualitatively understood in a wind paradigm , because more luminous quasars will have more radial ir outflows . \n assuming an accretion disk is the source of the optical through x - ray continuum , the dust - driving continuum will always be interior to ( and significantly more compact than ) the dusty wind , and thus act in the radial direction . in this scenario , \n the hottest dust is visible from a larger range of inclination angles in luminous objects . in the uv , an ionized wind launched from the accretion disk at small radii ( @xmath3  cm ) could have a significant vertical component to its acceleration . \n this geometric effect can naturally account for the larger observed fraction of bal quasars ( seen when looking through the uv wind ) compared to type 2 quasars ( seen when the broad - line region is blocked by thick , dusty material ) . \n to investigate the interplay of radiation driving and the ir sed , we have developed a dynamical model of the torus as a dusty wind launched by mhd forces and by radiation pressure from the accretion disk continuum . the dusty wind generated in this manner can cover a large fraction of the sky as seen from the central black hole . \n this model has the benefit of being more self - consistent than static torus models and including the important physics of motion around the black hole and radiative acceleration . \n ultimately , we wish to use this model to understand how the physical properties of dusty winds in quasars correlate with their observable spectral signatures in the ir .    the model and its corresponding code has been expanded from its original form ( described in * ? ? ? \n * ) by @xcite , where a comprehensive account of the model s components and key equations are described . \n we advance on @xcite by adding the continuum opacity of ism dust grains , as specified by the ism dust model @xcite in ` cloudy ` @xcite . \n the radiation pressure on the dust from the central source is very strong  even for cases where l / l@xmath4 , it is approximately 10 times the force required to unbind dust from the gravitational potential @xcite . \n dust grains absorb radially streaming photons originating from the accretion disk , and then cool by radiating isotropically . \n the force , felt by the dust particles due to conservation of momentum , feeds back on the wind structure by bending the magnetic wind from a vertical to more radial structure . \n the radiative force works in conjunction with the magneto - centrifugal forces to accelerate the wind flow and therefore modifies the structure of the outflow . \n after iterating the mhd+radiation pressure calculations to set up the structure of the wind , we use the monte carlo radiative - transfer code mc3d @xcite to send rays through the wind and predict the observed ir seds . \n the input parameters for the wind such as eddington ratio ( @xmath5 ) , black hole mass ( @xmath6 ) , and illuminating continuum ( the empirical optical - to - x - ray composite of @xcite , hereafter r06 ) are varied to investigate their effects on the output sed . \n m bump emission . \n _ right : _ the output ir seds generated by the wind models ;

spectral simulation framework latu @xcite . \n table [ table : paramscalar ] summarizes the relevant parameters of the simulation . \n this model extension has been analyzed in @xcite in great detail , considering important phenomena like amplification of the gradient s norm and alignment to strain principal axes . \n but in contrast to this publication , we focus on the comparison of different turbulent systems .

reaction of magnetic fluctuations on the velocity field . \n the equation for the time evolution of the magnetic field @xmath35 reads @xmath36 where the velocity field obeys the navier - stokes equations  ( [ eq : ns ] ) . in the lagrangian frame \n this equation takes the form @xmath37 again , using the same _ recent fluid deformation _ \n approximation for the resistive term and adding a stochastic forcing , which is as above gaussian and white - in - time , we obtain @xmath38    note that this equation differs from by the transpose in @xmath39 and - more important - the sign of the first term on the right hand side . thus directions , where the magnetic field is stretched , are directions , where the gradient of the passive scalar is compressed and vice versa . \n this very different influence of the stretching term results in a qualitatively different pdf for the magnetic field fluctuations compared to the @xmath34 fluctuations . in order to test \n whether the _ recent fluid deformation _ approach is able to reproduce the different role of the stretching term , we performed direct numerical simulations of kinematic mhd turbulence . here \n , we again performed simulations using the framework latu and the relevant parameters are given in table [ table : paramscalar ] . \n the simulation was started with random initial condition for the magnetic field @xmath35 and an already fully turbulent velocity field . \n external forcing was only applied to the velocity field by keeping the large scale fourier -

stokes turbulence @xcite to the case of fluctuations of the gradient of a passive scalar and to magnetic field fluctuations is able to produce probability distribution functions that agree well with pdfs obtained from direct numerical simulations . \n the pdfs from the stochastic odes ( [ eq : final ] , [ eq : sde_ps ] , [ eq : sde_mhd ] ) are obtained with a fraction of the computing resources necessary for direct numerical simulations . \n the next step is to include the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the fluid flow . \n if this can be managed , then generating magnetic field fluctuations using the _ recent fluid deformation _ model is a tempting alternative for e.g. the problem of cosmic ray propagation where magnetic field fluctuations are generated by other means which are not able to capture intermittency effects ( see @xcite ) . \n + r.g . acknowledges stimulating discussions with l. chevillard during the workshop `` euler equations : 250 years on '' . \n access to the jugene bluegene / p computer at the fz jlich was made available through project hbo22 . \n this work benefited from support through dfg -

ion beams with comparison with that of pristine samples @xcite have shown the decrease of both the penetration field and the irreversible magnetization after irradiation . \n as in accordance with previous studies @xcite the magnetic properties in whiskers are dominated by surface effects , the penetration field decrease was attributed to the suppression of surface barriers by cd . \n but after irradiation the bulk pinning becomes remarkable and contribute to a sample magnetization , which was measured in the work @xcite . \n it is impossible to separate contributions of surface barrier and bulk pinning in such type of measurements .    in our study \n we use another technique , namely , a registration of the hysteresis loop of microwave absorption ( mwa ) . \n this method allows one to separate contributions of bulk pinning ( bp ) and of surface pinning ( sp ) by the shape of loop . \n the present study of the irreversibility line in the thin films irradiated with heavy ions confirms the suggestion of ref.@xcite and the theoretical estimates @xcite of suppression of surface barrier by columnar defects . \n the results of measurements of hysteretic microwave absorption have shown that in the films irradiated with -ions the high temperature part of irreversibility line , which is due to surface barrier , shifts towards low temperature and magnetic field . \n the films were prepared on a substrate with sputtering technique as described in ref.@xcite . \n they are of 200  nm thickness and have the superconducting transition temperature near 85  k. they were irradiated with  ions in the accelerator facility of the gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung in darmstadt . \n the irradiation doses , expressed in the dose - equivalent matching field , were varied from 0.3 to 3  t. the superconducting transition shifts towards low temperature and broadens after irradiation of the films . \n the shift increases with the irradiation dose . \n the transition temperature of the film irradiated with dose @xmath3 t equals 78k . \n we studied irreversible properties of films by measuring the hysteresis of nonresonant microwave absorption . the detailed description of this method one can find in refs.@xcite . \n this method is sufficiently sensitive to enable the investigation of magnetic irreversibility of very thin superconducting films . \n moreover it allows one to separate contributions of bulk pinning and of surface pinning by the shape of the hysteresis loop . \n the measurements were performed in the high - temperature area , close to , where the surface pinning contribution became remarkable . \n the esr - spectrometer ber-418s ( bruker ) with the working frequency of 9.4ghz ( x - band ) was used to measure the microwave absorption of superconducting thin films . \n a sample was placed into the spectrometer cavity inside the helium gas - flow cryostat . \n its orientation was as follows : the applied dc field was perpendicular to the film plate ( parallel to c - axis ) , and the microwave field was in the film plane . \n a dc field was modulated with a frequency of 100khz and an amplitude from 0.1 to 10oe . to record \n the mwa hysteresis loop was swept with a velocity of @xmath4oe / s from cooling field @xmath5  to @xmath6 and back ( @xmath7oe ) . to avoid the instrumental error of detected hysteresis the signal of electron spin resonance ( esr ) of paramagnetic substance dpph ( diphenylpicrylhydrazyl ) is recorded along with the mwa hysteresis loop . \n the points of the irreversibility line were obtained by registration of the field at which the mwa hysteresis collapsed . \n previously we had found that both the shape of the mwa hysteresis loop and its dependence on modulation amplitude were governed by the vortex matter state and by the type of pinning : bulk or surface @xcite . \n one can exploit these properties of the mwa loop to locate the phase diagram areas with predominance of bulk pinning or surface barrier . in fig.[filoops ] \n the mwa hysteresis loops obtained on the pristine film at different temperatures are shown . at low temperatures ( @xmath8  k ) \n the loop shape corresponds to bulk pinning only @xcite . at high temperatures , close to , \n ( fig.[filoops]d ) the loop has the shape , which is due to surface barrier @xcite . here \n the point of irreversibility line ( @xmath9  oe ) is determined by surface pinning . at intermediate temperatures \n the mixture of these two types of the hysteresis is observed ( fig.[filoops]b ) . at @xmath10 \n k the small addition of `` surface loop '' to the main loop , which is due to bulk pinning , occurs in low field . \n the hysteresis disappears at @xmath11  oe , and the boundary of irreversibility is determined by the bulk pinning . at @xmath12 \n k ( fig.[filoops]c ) the contributions of bulk pinning and surface one are approximately equal to each other .    when both types of pinning contribute to a hysteresis we use the difference of their dependence on the field modulation amplitude in order to separate one contribution from another . \n in fig.[fimix]a it is shown the change of a loop shape with increasing the modulation amplitude from 0.4 to 8  oe . at small \n sp contributes remarkably in the low field range ( @xmath13  oe ) , and bp predominates in higher fields . at @xmath14 \n oe the bp contribution is fully eliminated . \n a shape of hysteresis loop is of `` pure surface type '' over whole field range from 0 to @xmath15  oe . \n so this field corresponds to the boundary of existing the surface barrier , and the irreversibility field has to be denoted as @xmath16 , that is due to surface pinning . \n the lower part of fig.[fimix ] shows the dependence of the hysteresis magnitude @xmath17  on the modulation amplitude for two values of applied field : a low field @xmath18  oe , where the sp contribution is considerable at any , and a higher field @xmath19  oe , where the bp prevails at small . \n it is seen that at @xmath20  oe the surface contribution increases almost linearly . in order to emphasize this fact the straight line \n is drawn along the points of @xmath18  oe \n . however , the bulk pinning contribution drastically reduces with increasing modulation amplitude . \n the curve of exponential decay is added for comparison . thus if one applies the modulation amplitude @xmath21  oe , it is possible to exclude the bulk pinning contribution and to investigate the dependence of @xmath16  on temperature and the irradiation dose . \n the points of irreversibility line @xmath22  are shown in fig.[il]a for three films , one is pristine and two films ion - irradiated with various doses , 0.3  t and 2  t. it is clearly seen that il shifts toward lower magnetic fields after irradiation . \n the effect is more pronounced in the film with large irradiation dose .    to take into account the shift of the superconducting transition temperature after the ion irradiation the il points of two samples are plotted versus reduced temperature @xmath23  in fig.[il]b . \n the shift of the il of irradiated film looks not so considerable with this axis as in fig.[il]a , but it is unambiguous .    the shift of the `` surface '' irreversibility line towards the area of low temperatures and magnetic fields indicates that the surface barrier is weakened upon the creation of columnar defects under the heavy - ion irradiation . \n this fact is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite . \n unfortunately , it is impossible to make quantitative comparison of our experimental data with the theoretical calculation since only the changes of the penetration field were estimated in paper @xcite , but not the irreversibility field . to estimate the decrease of the surface potential barrier under the cd generation quantitatively the comparison of the theoretically calculated il shift with the experimental results is needed . \n this might be a subject of future publication . \n thus , using the method of hysteretic microwave absorption measurements and its dependence on the applied magnetic field modulation we could isolate the contribution of surface pinning and watch the changes of the irreversibility line with increasing the dose of irradiation of the thin films with uranium ions . in agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite the suppression of surface barrier by columnar defects has been found . \n it manifests itself as the shift of irreversibility line towards low temperature and magnetic field . \n the effect is most significant for the films irradiated with large doses , @xmath24 t . \n this work was performed in the frame of joint program for scientific collaboration between russian academy of science and deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft . \n the work was partially supported by the russian ministry of industry and science under state contract no . 40.012.1.1.1356 , russian foundation for basic research ( grant no . \n 03 -

shedding limit ( i.e. see @xcite ) . \n thus the physical inspiral of binary compact stars terminates by either the orbital instability ( turning point of @xmath21 ) or the mass - shedding limit . in both cases \n , this defines the _ innermost stable circular orbit ( isco)_. the end of inspiral phase strongly depends on eos - for irrotational neutron star binaries a quasi - equilibrium sequence terminates by mass - shedding limit ( circles at the end of each line in fig 2 ) and for strange stars by orbital instability ( shown as diamonds in fig . \n the differences in the evolution of binary strange stars and neutron stars stem from the fact that strange stars are principally bound by additional force than gravitation : the strong interaction between quarks . \n they are self - bound objects having very high adiabatic index at the stellar surface ( see @xcite ) . \n although the crust of a @xmath24 neutron star contains only a few percent of the stellar mass , this region is easily deformed under the action of the tidal forces resulting from the gravitational field produced by the companion star . \n the end of inspiral phase of binary stars strongly depends on the stiffness of matter in this region . \n the frequency of gravitational waves at the isco is one of potentially observable parameters by the gravitational wave detectors . \n in addition so called `` break frequency '' , a characteristic frequency where the power emitted in gravitational waves decreases measurably @xcite , could be an observable quantity . _ the frequencies of gravitational waves at the depature point from the 3pn aproximation and at the isco strongly depend on the eos . \n _ for irrotational equal mass ( of 1.35 @xmath25 at infinite separation ) binaries the isco frequency is @xmath26 for strange stars described by the mit bag model and between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for neutron stars described by nuclear eos ( see also @xcite ) . \n the 3rd pn approximations for point masses derived by different authors are giving isco at very high frequencies of gravitational waves @xmath29 ( @xcite ) . \n it should be mentioned that the frequency at isco found in quasi - equilibrium approximation could differ from that obtained by the numerical integration of the full set of time dependent einstein equations . \n the only comparison ( according to the authors knowledge ) between these two approches for binary neutron stars can be found in marronetti et al . \n ( 2004 ) who showed that for a polytropic eos with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the frequency at the isco at quasi - equilibrium approximation is @xmath32 higher than the dynamical isco . \n thus full relativistic hydrodynamical calculations are required in order to obtain detailed predictions for particular forms of the nuclear matter equations of state . \n this work was partially supported by the `` ayudas para movilidad de profesores de universidad e invesigadores espanoles y extranjeros '' program of the spanish mec , by the grants 1 p03d 005 30 , pbz -

{"ContextTokens": 3302, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years there has been a growing interest for the vertical structure of the hi disks of spiral galaxies and for the disk - halo connection . \n evidence for hi gas flows between disk and halo comes from the detection of large vertical motions in several galaxies viewed close to face - on ( dickey et al . \n 1990 ; kamphuis 1993 ; schulman & bregman 1994 ) and the connection of this high velocity gas with hi holes and star formation activity in the disk ( kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) . \n more evidence comes from the study of edge - on galaxies like ngc  891 in which the hi has been found to extend up to at least 5 kpc into the halo , where it seems to rotate about 25 km @xmath1 more slowly than in the plane ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) . the combination of the results from face - on and edge - on galaxies leads to the picture of effervescent galaxies ( sancisi et al . \n 1996 ) , consistent with galactic fountains models ( bregman 1980 ; spitzer 1990 ) .    the galaxy studied here , ngc  2403 , has an intermediate inclination ( i=@xmath2 ) . \n the consequence is that the measured line - of - sight velocities are a combination of rotational , radial and vertical motions and the column densities are integrated along an oblique line - of - sight . \n therefore , the interpretation is less straightforward than in face - on or edge - on galaxies . \n however , there is the advantage that information is obtained on both the vertical density structure and the vertical kinematics of the hi for the same object .    for this study \n we have used the hi observations obtained by sicking ( 1997 ) with the westerbork radio telescope , which have about a factor of 2 better sensitivity and a higher velocity resolution than those of wevers et al . \n 1 shows the optical image , the total hi density distribution , the velocity field and the hi position - velocity map along the major axis . \n the latter shows that the hi line profiles at any position along the major axis are not symmetrical with respect to the rotation velocities , as they would be if they were determined by random motions only . \n instead , they are systematically more extended towards the systemic velocity . \n this striking asymmetry is particularly obvious in the lowest contour and extends systematically over almost the whole major axis . \n it was already noticeable in the maps produced by wevers et al . \n ( 1986 ) and by begeman ( 1987 ) and the puzzle presented by those early observations has motivated this study . \n the presence of such a ` beard ' is remarkable considering the size of the beam ( see lower left in fig . \n 1 ) with respect to the size of the galaxy . usually such an asymmetry is seen in edge - on galaxies or in galaxies which are not well resolved . in such cases \n the telescope beam ` sees ' not only the emission from a small area on the major axis but also larger areas away from it which have lower line - of - sight velocities and therefore cause the observed asymmetry . \n ngc  2403 is neither highly inclined nor poorly resolved .    what is the origin of the ` beard ' ? \n it is clear that it can not simply be explained by gas moving perpendicularly away from or towards the disk , because that would produce extensions symmetric with respect to the rotation velocity . \n neither can it be the result of deviations from axial symmetry or circular motion . \n these would affect the kinematics of the disk and produce visible effects in the velocity field , but not a low density asymmetry as observed . \n a likely explanation for the observed asymmetry is that not all of the hi is concentrated in a thin disk , but that part of it is in a vertically extended component . in this case , \n given the inclination of 61 degrees , a line - of - sight to a point on the major axis will also intercept the hi located above and below the plane which has line - of - sight velocities lower than those in the plane . \n this will produce a systematic broadening of the hi profiles towards the systemic velocity of the kind seen in fig . \n 1 . it is this effect that we study here with 3-d models of the density distribution and kinematics of the hi in ngc  2403 . \n [ f : lvmodels ] \n we consider the possibilities of both a thick hi disk ( as opposed to the usually assumed thin layer ) , and of a two - component structure , with a thin layer and a thicker but less dense one . \n this thick layer may be corotating with the thin one or may be rotating more slowly . \n both cases are examined . \n the reason for considering the slower rotation is that a non - corotating disk and halo have been proposed by swaters et al . \n ( 1997 ) as the most likely interpretation for the hi observations of the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 . \n axial symmetry and circular motions are assumed throughout . \n this assumption is supported by the results of schoenmakers et al . \n ( 1997 ) who found from their harmonic analysis of the hi velocity field of ngc  2403 that non - circular motions are not important in this galaxy . \n therefore , we have modelled ngc  2403 with a set of concentric rings , each ring characterized by a radius , a circular velocity , a velocity dispersion and a column density . \n centre , systemic velocity , inclination and position angle , scaleheight and vertical density profile were chosen to be the same for all rings . \n the values adopted here are , unless specified otherwise , those derived by sicking ( 1997 ) . \n the thin component always has a fwhm thickness of 0.5 kpc , the thickness of the thick layer is a free parameter . for the vertical density profile \n we have assumed a gaussian distribution . \n we have also tried an exponential distribution , but the results do not seem to change significantly . in the case of non - corotation \n the circular velocity of the thicker component has been lowered by a fixed amount , for example 25 km @xmath1 , in the flat part of the curve and a proportionally smaller one in the inner parts . for the velocity dispersion \n we have used a value of 7 km @xmath1 as derived for the profile widths in the regions of the flat part of the rotation curve . \n we have also constructed models with higher velocity dispersions for the thick components , up to 30 km @xmath1 , but the results do not differ significantly . \n the two - component models have been constructed by adding two one - component models . \n this is obviously an oversimplification as it is more likely that any vertical decrease of density and velocity would be gradual . \n the model data cubes have been inspected and analyzed in the same way as the observed cubes . for the comparison of the models and the observations we have used the channel maps and the position - velocity maps along the major and minor axes . here \n we present only the position - velocity maps along the major axis and only a small number of models , but we have explored the whole relevant parameter space .    initially , we tried a model with a one - component gas layer . \n cuts along the major axis for various thicknesses are shown in the first column of fig .  2 . \n the observations are in the top right panel . \n it is immediately clear that a thin disk model does not reproduce the observed asymmetry . \n a thickness of about 5 kpc ( fwhm ) would be needed to explain it . \n it is obvious that such a layer would be unrealistically thick , much thicker than that of our galaxy , which according to dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) has a fwhm of only 220 pc , or that of ngc  891 , for which most of the hi is in an unresolved layer with a fwhm thickness of less than 1 kpc ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) .    therefore , we explored the possibility of having , instead of one very thick gaussian disk , a relatively thin disk of high density and in addition a vertically more extended but lower density layer . for this \n we have built a model with two components , one thin and one thick , both rotating at the same velocity . \n the fwhm of the thick component and the column density ratio between the two components are free parameters . \n we found , however , that there is little freedom in the choice of this ratio and we fixed it tentatively at 1:1 . with a lower density for \n the thick component only a weak asymmetry would appear . \n the best model seems the one with a thick component of fwhm close to 5 kpc ( see fig .  2 ) \n . hence this model is not significantly different from the one - component model and is equally unrealistic as it requires unreasonable amounts of hi at large distances from the plane . \n finally , we released the condition of corotation and explored the effects of a decrease of the rotational velocity with distance to the plane . \n for this we have constructed models with a slowly rotating thick component . \n again , the fwhm of the thick component and the column density ratio are free parameters . but \n here as an additional parameter we have the velocity decrease \n . a thin - to - thick disk density ratio of 4:1 was found to give the best comparison with the data . with a higher ratio \n the asymmetry would tend to disappear , whereas a lower ratio would not reproduce the observed density contrast between the profile peak and its wings . \n for the thick component a fwhm of 1 kpc was adopted . for this thickness the best agreement with the observations is obtained with the 25 km @xmath1 decrease ( see fig .  2 ) . \n models with a thick component of larger fwhm than 1 kpc were also tried . \n for example , in the lower right of fig .  2 , we show a model that also reproduces the observed asymmetry well , and in which the thick component , still with a 25 km @xmath1 decrease in rotation velocity , has a thickness of 3.5 kpc . for this thickness \n the optimal column density ratio of the thin and thick disk is 6:1 . \n this illustrates that it is difficult to distinguish between an extended , low density and a less extended , higher density vertical distribution . \n from section 3 it is clear that all three types of models can explain the observed asymmetry to some extent . \n however , the first two models require unrealistic amounts of hi above the plane . \n the third model has a much more realistic vertical distribution , with less than 20% of the gas in the thick component , and it requires that the gas above the plane rotates more slowly than the gas in the disk , by about 25 km @xmath1 . \n this model also appears to reproduce the observed position - velocity diagram better than the other models , in particular near the center , where the hi has a narrow and peaked distribution , and at large radii , where low level wings are visible . \n note that in the observed position - velocity diagram ( fig . \n 1 ) the wings near the center extend almost to the systemic velocity . \n clearly , such features can not be reproduced in models with corotation , and not even in those with a velocity decrease as high as 35 km @xmath1 . \n to explain these extended wings a much larger velocity decrease is needed , probably at least 50 km @xmath1 . \n what produces such a thick hi layer and what causes its slower rotation ? \n galactic fountain models ( bregman 1980 ; spitzer 1990 ) may provide the framework for an answer . the fountain is formed by hot gas rising from the disk , its energy derived from stellar winds and supernova explosions . in the halo region \n the gas cools and condenses into clouds that fall back onto the disk . as the gas moves up , \n the centrally directed gravitational force decreases , and the gas moves outwards . due to conservation of angular momentum the azimuthal velocity decreases . \n this decrease will be most pronounced in the central parts of the galaxy , where a fixed radial displacement will result in a larger velocity decrease than in the outer regions . \n using thermohydrodynamic models , struck & smith ( 1999 ) have recently shown that a reduced circular velocity above and below the plane is expected to be present in turbulent disks as a result of radial motions driven by star formation activity . \n ngc  2403 appears to have sufficient star formation activity to drive a galactic fountain . \n this is for instance indicated by its large number of hii regions ( sivan et al . \n four of these are exceptionally bright , comparable to the most massive starburst region in the local group , the 30 doradus complex ( drissen et al . \n furthermore , thilker et al . \n ( 1998 ) have found that the surface of ngc  2403 is covered by shells and fragmentary structures which are likely to have formed as a result of star formation activity . \n they have also found that these structures are part of a diffuse component of neutral hydrogen extending at least 400 pc from the plane . \n the overall picture of ngc  2403 , as suggested by the modelling , is reminiscent of that of ngc  891 . for this galaxy \n it was found ( swaters et al . \n 1997 ) that the thick component has a fwhm of about 4 kpc , and this gas appears to rotate more slowly than the gas in the disk by about 25 km @xmath1 . in the central parts \n the velocity decrease was found to be much larger , perhaps up to 100 km @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we have presented evidence that the thin hydrogen disk of ngc  2403 is surrounded by a vertically extended layer of hi , which rotates more slowly than the disk . \n the observational picture is very similar to that found for ngc  891 . \n these results suggest that a vertically extended , slowly rotating hi layer may be common among spiral galaxies , at least among those with high levels of star formation . \n such extended hi layers have , however , very low surface densities and therefore very sensitive observations are needed to detect them . \n we thank f.j .  sicking for kindly making available the data and u.j . \n schwarz for helpful discussions .", "StartTimeOffset": 2971530315982, "RequestID": "3f4be669d7114970b0e9960dceddebcf", "TotalTokens": 3486}
{"ContextTokens": 2947, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "finding clues for the nature of dark matter in the universe is one of the most pressing issues in the interface between particle physics and cosmology . in this talk \n we briefly review some work we have done [ @xcite ] in the direction of finding a suitable , particle physics motivated , candidate that could solve some of the recent problems with the usual cold dark matter scenario .    the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) supplemented by a cosmological constant sucessfully explains , in the context of inflationary models , the observed structure of the universe on large scales , the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and type ia supernovae observations [ @xcite ] for a given set of density parameters , _ \n e.g. _ , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . \n according to this scenario , initial gaussian density fluctuations , mostly in non - relativistic collisionless particles , the so - called cold dark matter , are generated in an inflationary period of the universe . \n these fluctuations grow gravitationally forming dark halos into which luminous matter is eventually condensed and cooled . \n however , despite its successes , there is a growing wealth of recent observational data that raise problems in the cdm scenarios . \n n - body simulations predict a number of halos which is a factor @xmath3 10 larger than the observed number at the level of local group [ @xcite ] . \n furthermore , cdm models yield dispersion velocities in the hubble flow within a sphere of @xmath4mpc between @xmath5kms@xmath6 for @xmath7 and between @xmath8kms@xmath6 for @xmath0 . \n the observed value is about @xmath9kms@xmath6 . \n neither model can produce a single local group candidate with the observed velocity dispersion in a simulation box of comoving volume @xmath10 [ @xcite ] . \n a related issue is that astrophysical systems which are dm dominated like dwarf galaxies [ @xcite ] , low surface brightness galaxies [ @xcite ] and galaxy clusters without a central cd galaxy [ @xcite ] show shallow matter \n density profiles which can be modeled by isothermal spheres with finite central densities . \n this is in contrast with galactic and galaxy cluster halos in high resolution n - body simulations [ @xcite ] which have singular cores , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the range between 1 and 2 . indeed \n , cold collisionless dm particles do not have any associated length scale leading , due to hierarchical gravitational collapse , to dense dark matter halos with negligible core radius [ @xcite ] .    a possible solution , coming from particle physics \n , would be to allow dm particles to self - interact so that they have a large scattering cross section and negligible annihilation or dissipation . \n self - interaction induces a characteristic length scale via the mean free path of the particle in the halo . \n this idea has been originally proposed to suppress small scale power in the standard cdm model [ @xcite ] and has been recently revived in order to address the issues discussed above [ @xcite ] . \n the main feature of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) is that large self - interacting cross sections lead to a short mean free path , so that dark matter particles with mean free path of the order of the scale length of halos allows for the transfer of conductive heat to the halo cores , a quite desirable feature [ @xcite ] . \n recently performed numerical simulations indicate that strongly self - interacting dark matter does indeed lead to better predictions concerning satellite galaxies [ @xcite ] . however , only in presence of weak self - interaction [ @xcite ] the core problem might be solved . \n the two - body cross section is estimated to be in the range of @xmath13 @xmath14/gev , from a variety of arguments , such as the requirement of a mean free path between 1 and 1000 kpc [ @xcite ] , the core expansion time scale to be smaller than the halo age [ @xcite ] and analysis of cluster ellipticity [ @xcite ] . \n larger value of @xmath15 @xmath14/gev corresponds to the best fit to the rotation curve of a low surface brightness in simulations [ @xcite ] . in our work , we assume for definiteness that the the cross section is fixed via the requirement that the mean free path of the particle in the halo is in the range @xmath16 kpc . \n many models of physics beyond the standard model suggest the existence of new scalar gauge singlets , _ \n e.g. _ , in the so - called next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model [ @xcite ] . in this section , \n we provide a simple example for the realization of the idea proposed in [ @xcite ] of a self - interacting , non - dissipative cold dark matter candidate that is based on an extra gauge singlet , @xmath17 , coupled to the standard model higgs boson , @xmath18 , with a lagrangian density given by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the field @xmath17 self - coupling constant , @xmath21 is its mass , @xmath22 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value and @xmath23 is the coupling between the singlet @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n we assume that the @xmath17 mass does not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking since tight constraints from non - newtonian forces eliminates this possibility due to the fact that , in this case , there is a relation among coupling constant , mass and vacuum expectation value that leads to a tiny scalar self - coupling constant . in its essential \n features our self - interacting dark matter model can be regarded as a concrete realization of the generic massive scalar field with quartic potential discussed in [ @xcite ] . \n we mention that a model with features similar to ours has been discussed long ago in [ @xcite ] . \n we shall assume that @xmath17 interacts only with @xmath18 and with itself . \n it is completely decoupled for @xmath24 . for reasonable values of @xmath23 , this new scalar would introduce a new , invisible decay mode for the higgs boson . \n this could be an important loophole in the current attemps to find the higgs boson at accelerators [ @xcite ] . this coupling could , in principle , be relevant for @xmath25 scattering but we shall be conservative and assume that it is small and neglect its contribution . \n these particles are non - relativistic , with typical velocities of @xmath26 km @xmath27 . \n therefore , there is no dissipation of energy by , for instance , creating more particles in reactions like @xmath28 . \n only the elastic channel is kinetically accessible and the scattering matrix element near threshold ( @xmath29 ) is given by : @xmath30 near threshold the cross section is given roughly by : @xmath31    we shall derive limits on @xmath21 and @xmath20 by demanding that the mean free path of the particle @xmath17 , @xmath32 , should be in the interval @xmath33mpc . \n this comes about because , if the mean free path were much greater than about @xmath34mpc , dark matter particles would not experience any interaction as they fly through a halo . on the other hand , \n if the dark matter mean free path were much smaller than @xmath34kpc , dark matter particles would behave as a collisional gas altering substantially the halo structure and evolution . \n hence , we have : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number and mass density in the halo of the @xmath17 particle , respectively . using @xmath38 gev/@xmath39 , \n corresponding to the halo density , one finds : @xmath40 equating eqs . \n ( [ cross1 ] ) and ( [ cross2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath41    demanding the mean free path of the @xmath17 particle to be of order of 1 mpc implies in the _ model independent _ result : @xmath42    recently , it has been argued , on the basis of gravitational lensing analysis , that the shape of the ms2137 - 23 system is elliptical while self - interacting non - dissipative cdm implies that halos are spherical [ @xcite ] . furthermore , the limit    @xmath43    arises from that analysis , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than ( [ sstein ] ) . \n indeed , gravitational lensing arguments are acknowledged to be crucial in validating sidm ; however , estimates made in [ @xcite ] were criticized as they rely on a single system and because their intrinsic uncertainties actually allow for consistency with sidm [ @xcite ] .    in order to estimate the amount of @xmath17 particles that were produced in the early universe and survived until present , we assume that @xmath17 particles were mainly produced during reheating after the end of inflation . a natural setting to consider this issue is within the framework of @xmath44 supergravity inspired inflationary models , where the inflaton sector couples with the gauge sector only through the gravitational interaction . hence , the number of @xmath17 particles expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the photonic entropy density , is related with the inflaton ( @xmath47 ) abundance after its decay by    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the number of degrees of freedom . notice that @xmath50 is a conserved quantity since @xmath17 does not couple to fermions . in the context of @xmath44 supergravity inflationary models , the upper bound on the reheating temperature in order to avoid the gravitino problem ( see [ @xcite ] and references therein ) , @xmath51 is given by the ratio of the reheating temperature and the inflaton mass and , for typical models    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is an order one constant . \n this estimate allows us to compute the energy density contribution of @xmath17 particles in terms of the baryonic density parameter :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    using eq . \n ( [ mass ] ) and taking @xmath56 , we obtain :    @xmath57    which allows identifying @xmath17 as the cosmological dark matter candidate , i.e. @xmath58 [ @xcite ] , for @xmath59 , @xmath20 of order one and @xmath60 of about @xmath34mpc . \n we have also found that the @xmath17 particle do not generate dangerous non - newtonian forces [ @xcite ] . \n in this work [ @xcite ] , we suggest that a scalar gauge singlet coupled with the higgs field in such a way as to give origin to an invisible higgs is a suitable candidate for self - interacting dark matter . \n this proposal has some quite distinct features . \n firstly , since gauge invariance prevents the scalar singlet to couple to fermions , hence strategies for directly searching this dark matter candidate must necessarily concentrate on the hunt of the higgs field itself in accelerators . \n furthermore , in what concerns its astrophysical and cosmological implications , the main aspects of our proposal are quite unambiguously expressed by eqs . \n ( [ cross2 ] ) , ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ finaldensity ] ) . \n confronting the result of simulations with our candidate for different values of the relevant parameters with observations may turn out to be crucial for validating our proposal . \n we would like to add that a recent detailed study of our simple model [ @xcite ] has shown that our abundance computation is valid only if the higgs field is very weakly coupled to the scalar gauge singlet ( @xmath61 ) , since otherwise the scalar field will reach thermal equilibrium [ @xcite ] . \n the study of phion annihilation processes via exchange of virtual higgs particles indicates that in order to achieve @xmath62 requires @xmath63 [ @xcite ] which leads to a higgs decay width that is distinctly different than the standard model one . \n r.r . would like to thank pronex ( cnpq ) for providing travel funds and grupo de detectores avanados of centro de fsica nuclear da universidade de lisboa under project praxis / p / fis/10033/98 for support during his stay in portugal . \n l.t . would like to acknowledge the financial support from fundao para a cincia e a tecnologia ( portugal ) under the grant praxis xxi /bpd/16354/98 and the project praxis / c / fis/13196/98 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2983717136477, "RequestID": "0722ae53a9f14c96be2cfa97f1d73725", "TotalTokens": 3089}

scale magnetic fields to vorticity production in supernova shocks @xcite , and chaotic field line - stretching @xcite . \n the fact that vorticity production by colliding shells is almost inevitable in a clumpy and highly structured ism has first been pointed out by . the issue has then been investigated for the simplified case of driven expansion waves by @xcite and , more recently , by del sordo & brandenburg ( this volume ) . \n considering turbulence driven by non - helical transverse waves , @xcite have shown that the small - scale dynamo becomes harder to excite in the super - sonic regime , albeit the critical reynolds number for the onset of dynamo action only seems to depend weakly on the mach number . \n because the eddy turnover time is short at small scales , a dynamo based on chaotic field line stretching will be fast . \n this is in - line with observations , which exhibit dominant turbulent fields . \n open issues remain with respect to the mechanism governing the saturation of the small - scale dynamo . \n therefore , it is currently unclear whether equipartition field strengths can be obtained by a non - helical dynamo alone . \n alternatively , the turbulent field might be explained as a `` shredded '' coherent field , i.e. , as the by - product of a helical mean - field dynamo . \n notwithstanding the above , the presence of the observed coherent fields on scales larger than the outer scale of the interstellar turbulence ( @xmath0 , see * ? ? ? \n * ) clearly requires the presence of a coherent dynamo . \n the favoured candidates for such a dynamo are , in no particular order : ( i ) the kinetic driving by sne , ( ii ) the buoyant cosmic ray - supported parker instability @xcite , ( iii ) the magneto - rotational instability , and ( iv ) gravitational interactions @xcite . \n the last of these effects is certainly dominant at the early stages of galaxy formation and will provide a seed field for subsequent processes . \n it remains to be shown , however , how important external interactions are in the presence of a realistic feedback from scales currently unresolved in cosmological simulations . \n moreover , as have shown , the cosmic ray ( cr ) dynamo critically relies on the anisotropy of the cr diffusion coefficient . \n combined simulations , including both sne and crs , will prove whether this anisotropy remains effective for strongly tangled turbulent fields \n .    the mri will be important ( at least ) in the outer regions of galaxies , where the star formation activity is low @xcite  even under moderate turbulence , it may operate efficiently . \n the stability criterion for a global isothermal disk of thickness @xmath1 leads to the relation @xmath2 for instability . depending on the local rotation frequency , @xmath3 , turbulent diffusivity @xmath4 , and turbulent magnetic prandtl number @xmath5 \n which is generally expected to be of order unity  this value may be lower than the critical dynamo number for the supernova - driven dynamo \n . it should be worthwhile to address this question within state - of - the - art simulations of the ism , with an alvfn velocity of the external vertical field of the order @xmath6 .     of the top half of the now larger simulation box ( _ upper panels _ ) , and the disc midplane ( _ lower panels _ ) . \n the variables shown are : ( a ) number density @xmath7 $ ] , ( b ) column density @xmath8 $ ] , ( c ) temperature @xmath9 $ ] , ( d ) velocity dispersion @xmath10 $ ] , and ( e ) magnetic field strength @xmath11 $ ] . \n the logarithmic grey scales cover ranges @xmath12 $ ] , @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 $ ] , and @xmath16 $ ] , respectively . ] \n the energy input through sne into the ism is tremendous . \n the corresponding amplitude of the expected dynamo effect has first been estimated by @xcite . \n assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and applying quasi - linear theory , these estimates have subsequently been refined by . \n a shortcoming of the approach was the neglect of a possible galactic wind . \n in general , there was a controversy as to whether the turbulence created by the sne was too vigorous to warrant dynamo action  either because of a too strong wind ( carrying the field away ) , or contrary to this , because of a too strong downward pumping ( enhancing turbulent dissipation near the midplane ) .    in a series of papers , \n analytically derived the electromotive force stemming from isolated remnants ; the line of work was also later supported by simulations of single remnants . to obtain the net @xmath17  effect , \n a convolution with an assumed vertical sn distribution was applied . however , the approach suffered from a too weak dynamo and highly dominant ( upward ) pumping . only when considering the stratified nature of the galactic disc , the issue was somewhat alleviated , although still predicting a strong upward pumping \n .    pioneering semi - global simulations based on `` first principles '' where performed by @xcite , and it was only for the fact of a too low dynamo number that no field amplification was observed in their simulations . \n the first direct simulations exhibiting dynamo action were reported almost a decade later . \n the general morphology of such simulations is illustrated in figure  [ fig : slices ] ; note the apparent correlation between the density  ( a ) and magnetic field amplitude  ( e ) near the midplane , indicating field amplification via compression . \n in contrast , away from the midplane ( i.e. , in the diffuse medium ) the field shows more folded structures .    . \n the variables are plotted in dark ( @xmath18 ) or light ( @xmath19 ) colours , respectively . \n shaded areas indicate @xmath20-fluctuations . in the region for @xmath21 , the results agree well with a previous run applying a much smaller box . ] \n the fast growth of the dynamo can be understood rigorously in terms of mean - field theory , i.e. via a reynolds - averaged induction equation @xmath22\\ , ,    \\label{eq : mf_ind}\\ ] ] and assuming a standard parametrisation @xmath23 with tensorial coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the determination of these closure parameters @xcite hugely benefited from the development of the so - called test field method @xcite . for kinematically forced turbulence , this method allows to determine unambiguously all eight tensor components  and , in fact , none of them can be ignored @xcite . \n notably , we find a significant positive rdler effect in the off - diagonal elements of the diffusivity tensor ( see panel d in figure  [ fig : ae ] ) . \n the measured @xmath17  effect and turbulent diffusion are of the expected sign and magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : ae ] , panels a and c ) . \n the key finding is that of a moderate downward pumping ( panel b ) as predicted by . \n this inward pumping has profound implications in compensating the effect of the equally strong upward mean flow ( not shown ) , thus yielding ideal conditions for the dynamo . \n moreover , a wind may aid the shedding of small - scale magnetic helicity as discussed in @xcite . \n one major concern with the local box approximation was the issue of its limited dimension in the horizontal direction . in the low - pressure ambient medium of the galactic halo , \n supernova remnants can easily expand to several hundred parsec in diameter . \n because of the periodic boundaries and the finite domain size , this leads to ( spuriously ) correlated self - interactions . \n the simulations of @xcite used @xmath26 , which was justified for the limited vertical extent of their model . for our standard \n runs we applied @xmath27 together with a vertical box size of @xmath28 . \n even with near @xmath29 horizontal box size , the issue of self - interaction was still seen in the far halo region . to eliminate the possibility of an artificial dependence of the results on the horizontal box size \n , we carried out a fiducial simulation run at @xmath30 ( cf . \n figures  [ fig : slices ]  &  [ fig : ae ] ) . in the region of overlap \n , the extended profiles agree well with their counterparts derived from the smaller boxes ( cf . fig . \n 4.5 , model f4 in * ? ? ? \n beyond @xmath31 , the velocity dispersion increases significantly , enhancing the turbulent diffusion and resulting in noisy profiles for the other coefficients . \n note , however , the pronounced systematic @xmath17  effect in the region of strong vertical gradients near the midplane ( panels a and b in figure  [ fig : ae ] ) . \n this clearly supports the paradigm of helicity production being the direct result of inhomogeneous turbulence .      beyond the purpose of mere diagnostics , the profiles shown in figure  [ fig : \n ae ] serve as a foundation for global large eddy - simulations solving ( [ eq : mf_ind ] ) . \n we believe that the semi - global approach of vertically stratified local boxes captures the essential physics behind the turbulent @xmath17  effect in the galactic disc . at the same time \n , we are aware that the local geometry implies certain restrictions on the permitted dynamo modes . \n identifying global symmetries is however necessary for a direct comparison with observations .    to warrant global mean - field modelling of the @xmath32  dynamo \n , the scaling of the measured closure coefficients with the relevant input parameters has to be obtained . \n this is important because the angular velocity @xmath3 , the local shear rate @xmath33 , the supernova rate @xmath34 , and the midplane density @xmath35 are functions of the galactocentric distance @xcite . \n @xcite already made a first step in this direction by inferring the dependence on the supernova rate . \n corresponding mean - field models have been reported in @xcite . further scaling relations with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath35 \n will be reported elsewhere . \n first estimates ( subject to small number statistics ) for a range of 0.11 times the galactic star formation rate lead to the relations @xmath36 this has the consequence that the dynamo number @xmath37 scales inversely with the star formation rate . \n therefore we would not expect a stronger amplification of the large - scale field for stronger star formation activity . \n lastly , the pitch angle @xmath38 , in the kinematic regime , only seems to depend weakly on the studied parameters . \n the strongest dependence here is , however , expected from the local shear rate @xmath39 , suggesting a dedicated parameter survey . \n because current numerical simulations are limited to very moderate reynolds numbers , it is important to understand how efficient the observed mechanisms remain under realistic conditions . \n to achieve this , it has proven fruitful to study simplified scenarios and run multiple parameter sets ( see * ? ? ? * for a comprehensive review ) . \n fortunately , the emerging physical effects are dominated by the outer scale of the turbulence , i.e. , as soon as a rudimentary scale separation is achieved , the turbulent quantities should become independent of the actual micro scale . \n the growing complexity of models challenges the distribution of computing time : increasing physical realism leaves little margin for the variation of key parameters , let alone convergence checks or running multiple representations of a single parameter set . \n dedicated studies remain mandatory to segregate artificial trends from genuinely physical ones . \n the dilemma becomes even more apparent when looking at the recent trend to performing `` resolved '' global simulations . \n for these , convergence checks are a rare exception . \n while an `` enhanced '' diffusivity may be sufficiently approximated by the numerical truncation error on the grid scale , the diamagnetic pumping term certainly is not . \n yet vertical transport has profound implications on the emerging dynamo modes and growth rates .    in conclusion , we advocate a strategy that has been applied with great success in the design of aircraft , namely the concept of large eddy ( or mean - field ) simulations . \n global fluid simulations currently can not guarantee scale separation for all relevant physical scales . to obtain quantitatively correct results \n , we therefore believe that a sub - grid scale model is inevitable . \n present local box simulations are a valuable means to provide a rigorous framework for the calibration of such a model .", "StartTimeOffset": 2986900466215, "RequestID": "0865e31bc90d4943840c50b396f38243", "TotalTokens": 3289}

stellar emission , like active nuclei and dust / pah emission , which are hard to model from first principles . \n in particular , most available agn seds are empirically obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) by averaging photometric observations of a small number of quasars .    in this proceeding \n we discuss a non - negative basis of empirically obtained sed templates for galaxies and agns that accurately represents the colors of such objects . \n these templates are derived from a combination of 14448 galaxies and 5347 likely agns in the ndwfs botes field with spectroscopic redshifts and photometry spanning the far - uv to the mid - ir . \n all results shown in here have been presented and are discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . \n our data set consists on 14448 galaxies and 5347 likely agns in the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ? \n * ) botes field . \n each object has a spectroscopic redshift from the agn and galaxy evolution survey and has at least an upper limit in 8 of the 14 following bands : bw , r , i and k from ndwfs , j and ks from flamex , z from zbotes , irac [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] from sdwfs , galex fuv and nuv , and mips 24@xmath0 m from @xcite . \n the agn classification scheme is conservative , and objects classified as agns are either spectroscopically or photometrically classified according to their mid - ir , x - ray and radio properties . \n we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the sample selection . \n the methods we use to derive the sed templates are described in detail by @xcite and @xcite . in this section \n we give a brief summary of how our methods work and refer the reader to the aforementioned papers for detailed discussions . \n we assume that the spectrum of any object in our sample can be modeled as a linear combination of a small set of unknown spectral templates . \n we construct these unknown templates using the data sets described in the previous section . for `` pure '' galaxies , \n we assume the majority of them have seds that can be described as a linear combination of three templates : one similar to an elliptical galaxy ( an old stellar population ) , one similar to a spiral galaxy ( a continuously star forming population ) , and a third similar to an irregular galaxy ( a starburst population ) . for objects with active nuclei , \n we assume that every agn sed can be described by the same spectral template with varying amounts of reddening and absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , combined with the galaxy templates to describe the host . \n we use an iterative algorithm to derive the sed templates . \n this algorithm is based on the method proposed by @xcite for deriving principal component seds . \n we start with an initial guess for each of our sed templates and sequentially improve it to best fit the photometric data . \n our initial guess for the `` pure '' galaxy seds corresponds to the e , sbc and i m templates of , extended into the uv and mid - ir with the models of @xcite and with the addition of pah and dust emission of the vcc1003 and m82 seds obtained by @xcite to the star forming templates . for the agn component we use a combination of power - laws that broadly resembles the agn sed template of @xcite . \n we divide every sed template in 300 logarithmically spaced wavelength bins and fit each bin independently to our data set , with a restriction to force their smoothness . \n the top left panel of figure [ fg : temps ] shows the resulting sed templates alongside with the initial guesses . \n we have pursued several applications of our sed templates , including the estimation of photometric redshifts and k - corrections for galaxies and agns , the study of biases in mid - ir selection of agns , predictions of colors of agns and galaxies in the pass - bands of the recently launched wise mission , and the determination of luminosity function of mid - ir and x - ray selected agns from redshift 0 to 6 . \n the former three applications are discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite , while our results on the agn luminosity function were presented by @xcite . in this section \n we discuss two of these applications , namely the biases in the mid - ir color selection of agns and the colors of agns and galaxies in wise . \n figure [ fg : temps ] shows the mid - ir colors of all sources in sdwfs with @xmath1 , the agn selection diagrams of @xcite ( top right panel ) and of @xcite ( bottom left panel ) and the color tracks of our templates . \n the boundaries of the selection region of @xcite do a remarkable job of excluding inactive galaxies at @xmath2 , but also exclude unreddened agns at @xmath3 . in a more subtle manner \n , the selection region of @xcite also excludes agns that are faint in comparison to their host galaxies , as the latter will dominate the mid - ir colors . \n the selection region proposed by @xcite is not strongly affected by the biases of the @xcite criteria , but their agn selection region is heavily contaminated by intermediate redshift star forming galaxies and galaxies at @xmath4 . \n these problems are partially solved by the revised version of this criteria by @xcite . \n it can be seen , however , that if the left - most boundary in this criterion is pushed further to the right to limit contamination by inactive galaxies , similar biases to those of the @xcite selection criteria arise . \n using our sed templates , we have also studied the color distribution of sources in the wise mission . \n the selection boundaries shown in the bottom right panel of figure [ fg : temps ] correspond to those proposed by @xcite , and would be able to classify in between @xmath5 and @xmath6 agns , depending on whether a detection in the two longest wavelength bands is required or not . \n this criterion would keep the contamination by inactive galaxies and ulirgs to a minimum , as shown by the color tracks of our seds and of the sed of arp 220 produced by grasil @xcite . \n we note , however , that the wise colors of @xmath7 agns are similar to those of intermediate redshift galaxies and ulirgs , leading to a color degeneracy that must be broken by the inclusion of other data ( e.g. , optical broad - band photometry ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2992604980979, "RequestID": "1c926189d2e745d5805f80692aea2103", "TotalTokens": 1803}

emission ( ) diagrams . \n factorization may therefore be less questionable here than in the @xmath60  transitions discussed above .    using the cleo measurement @xmath89  @xcite   we can use the factorization hypothesis , isgw ii , and the qcd factor @xmath90  @xcite  to predict the branching fractions @xmath91  and @xmath92   respectively  @xcite . \n uncertainties in the formfactor and factorization hypothesis are not reflected in the errors quoted here . \n furthermore , contributions from anything other than the diagram are neglected in this kind of comparison . keeping this in mind , \n we conclude that the central value from the fit to the experimental data as shown in table  [ tab : results ] compares well with these predictions . \n we do not see any evidence for @xmath93  or @xmath94 . \n the dominant contributions to these decays are due to ( @xmath95 ) , and  respectively . \n the penguin diagrams in both cases are @xmath19  penguins . \n theoretical predictions for these modes range from less than @xmath96  to few times @xmath25@xcite . \n finally , we see no evidence for @xmath97 . \n this is not surprising as this decay can only proceed via  or  diagrams . \n theoretical predictions for this process are at the level of at most a few times @xmath98@xcite . \n we can therefore conclude that an overall consistent picture of charmless hadronic @xmath5  decays to two pseudoscalar mesons is starting to emerge . \n cleo has measured the dominant @xmath99  transitions at levels consistent with theoretical predictions . \n no signals are found in any of the decay modes that are expected to be suppressed . \n many thanks to all the other people involved in the search for @xmath5  decays to two charmless pseudoscalar mesons at cleo : peter gaidarev , jim alexander , peter kim , andrei gritsan , jean roy , and jim smith . \n further thanks go to lawrence gibbons for information concerning the factorization test , and to robert fleischer , karl berkelman and jim smith for many useful discussions . \n 99 m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n rosner , ; m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n y.kubota a.deandrea _ et al . \n _ , , ; l .- l.chau , , n.g.deshpande and j.trampetic ; m.bauer , b.stech , m.wirbel , . \n d. zeppenfeld , ; m.j.savage , m.b.wise , , erratum : ; m.gronau and d.london , ; m. gronau , o.f . \n hernndez , d. london , and j.l . \n rosner , ; r.fleischer , _ \n int.j.mod.phys._*a12 * , 2459 ( 1997 ) . \n f.wrthwein , ph.d . , cornell jan . \n 1995 ; p.gaidarev , ph.d . , cornell 1997 . \n dighe , m. gronau , and j.l . \n rosner , ; erratum : * b377 * 325 ( 1996 ) . \n f.j . gilman , r. kaufman , ; * 37 * 3348(e ) ( 1988 ) . \n i.halperin , a.zhitnitsky , hep -

10 nm , which is about of the size of small biomolecules , have the great potential for various applications in the modern biomedicine . in difference from organic biological labels , \n the luminescent qds have several advantages . \n at first they have a wide absorption band and can be used with a variety of laser sources having different output wavelengths . on the other side , \n the luminescence band of qds can be tuned from uv to ir by changing their sizes and this property allows combining several types of qds at the one excitation wavelength . \n it is also important to notice that qds are more photostable under the long time of laser irradiation . \n the existence of the mentioned properties of qds could dramatically improve the use of fluorescent markers in the biological imaging .    during the last decade \n various methods have been investigated for the synthesis of nps . recently , a simple and flexible method of the pulsed laser ablation in liquid media ( plal ) has been demonstrated for the laser synthesis of metal nanoparticles @xcite . \n this method also has been applied for synthesis of colloidal solutions of semiconductor qds 7,8,9 . \n laser ablation in liquids media is especially good - looking for biomedical applications , since nps could be formed directly in specially prepared bio - conjugated media and such nps colloidal solution can be exactly tuned for the specific biological target \n .    the formation of semiconductor nanoparticles via plal has been investigated in different experimental conditions , and photoluminescence properties of nanoparticles produced by the plal have been found to be strongly dependent as on the physical and chemical properties of liquid environment , as well as on the parameters of the laser irradiation . \n laser ablation syntheses of nanoparticles could be explained in terms of the dynamic formation mechanism of the particle growth @xcite . according this mechanism , a material of target evaporated in the laser plume very quickly aggregate into small embryonic particles , \n therefore such laser pulse parameters as pulse energy and duration could be highly critical in this process . in the paper \n @xcite the influence of a laser beam transverse electromagnetic mode structure on the luminescence properties of laser synthesized gaas nanoparticles has been studied . in the present work we studied luminescence properties of the si \n ni hybrid colloidal nanoparticles system fabricated in pure water by the laser ablation method using a nanosecond nd : yag laser . \n the pulsed passive q - switched nd : yag laser with wavelength of 1064 nm , pulse duration of 8ns and repetition rate of 10hz was used to synthesize nanoparticles in pure water . \n the laser beam was focused on the surface of a bulk target ( the plate of bulk si or ni ) allocated in the glass cuvette with distilled water ( see figure ( 1 ) ) . \n exposition of the laser irradiation was two hours . to produce hybrid metal - semiconductor system , \n at first we irradiated a ni bulk target , then in the same cuvette with water solution of ni nanoparticles was located the si bulk target to produce si nanoparticles . \n hybrid nanoparticles system was produced also in similar scheme when ni and si nanoparticles were produced separately in different cuvettes and after that mixed in one solution . \n note that luminescence spectra of the obtained hybrid nanoparticles were the same in these two experimental approaches . \n note also that a luminescence of separately prepared si nanoparticles was not observed . \n [ fig1 ]    for luminescence measurements the water solution of nanoparticles was relocated into quartz cuvette with the transparent walls in the uv spectral range . \n the luminescence of the colloidal qds was excited by the irradiation at 400 nm wavelength of the continuous wave diode laser with the power of 10mw . \n the luminescence spectra were analyzed by spectrometer constructed on the base of monochromator lomo mdr- 23-pmt . \n electrical signal amplifier was used to enhance output of the pmt . \n luminescence spectrum of colloidal si - ni qds is presented in the figure ( 2 ) . \n [ fig2 ]    the considerable blue shift of the photoluminescence has been registered with the location of the maximum at the wavelength of 455 nm which is connected with the size - effect and significant difference from the well known luminescence of a bulk si material located in the near infrared region . \n the peak on the 400 nm is the excitation laser wavelength . \n the bandwidth of the luminescence spectra on the halfheight was about 40 nm that demonstrates the narrow size distribution of laser generated qds , which is achieved without application of any size selection schemes . \n [ fig3 ]    possible contributions to the luminescence from a quartz material of the cuvette and water has been eliminated by a comparison with the photoluminescence from the same cuvette filled with the clean water or with the solution of coumarin 120 organic dye ( see figure ( 3 ) ) . \n the long - term stability of the luminescence properties of the produced qds was observed during the one year . \n here we give some interpretation of the results of our experiment by estimations based on the known properties of silicon nanoparticles and quantum confinement effect , as well as the effect of the charged nickel nanoparticles on luminescence spectra of the colloidal si quantum dots . \n as is known @xcite , metalic nanoparticles generated in diverse media by the method of a laser ablation carry a positive or negative electrical charge . in our case , \n the charged ni nanoparticles within the si \n ni hybrid system induce a static electrical field which causes stark shift of the electron - hole energy levels in the silicon qd . in the following , \n we consider a point charge at a certain distance from the surface of the silicon qd ( see figure ( 4 ) ) . \n the assessment of the si nanoparticles luminescence spectrum shifting under the influence of a static electric field of an external charge allows us to explain experimental results by the stark effect in the inhomogeneous ( coulomb ) field . \n the external point charge @xmath0 on the distance @xmath1  from the center of the silicon quantum dot creates a screened electrostatic field at the point @xmath2 inside the qd , potential of which can be given in the following form @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the legendre polynomial , \n @xmath5 -screening dielectric constant of si qds , @xmath6 -angle between the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the shift of the energy levels of an exciton caused by an external electrostatic field can be evaluated using the wavefunction @xmath9 of the electron - hole system :    @xmath10 \\left\\vert \\psi_{0}\\left ( \\mathbf{r}_{e},\\mathbf{r}_{h}\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}. \\label{2}\\ ] ]    taking into account the form of the potential of the external field ( [ 1 ] ) , the energy shift ( [ 2 ] ) can be represented in the form of the sum    @xmath11    where    @xmath12@xmath13    the first term in the sum ( [ 3 ] ) : @xmath14 . \n we will estimate only the term corresponding to @xmath15 taking into account the smallness of the other terms . \n thus ,    @xmath16    which can be written in the following form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the size of an exciton , @xmath19 are the mean values of the charge distribution density of the hole and the electron , respectively . to calculate the energy spectral shifting in accordance with the conditions of the above described experiment , \n let us estimate @xmath20 .    as is shown in @xcite , the emitted photon energy depends on silicone nanocrystallite size . with the decreasing of the size of nanoparticles the quantum confinement affects on the band gap of the exciton thereby increasing emission energy . \n during the experiment with the solely silicon nanoparticles the luminescence had not been observed in the visible spectrum at the irradiation by the wavelength of 400 nm . \n this fact evidences that bandgap energy of the si qds is more than 3 ev , which is agreed with the results of the work @xcite . \n according to the work @xcite , such energies corresponds to silicon nanoparticles with diameter less than 1.4 nm . to determine the other parameters we will take for screening dielectric constant @xmath21 , which corresponds to the diameter @xmath22 nm of si quantum dots at the passivation with the hydrogen atoms , according to the paper @xcite . \n as we consider si nanoparticles generated in a liquid medium ( pure water in our case ) , dangling bonds of the silicon atoms on the dot surface should be saturated mostly by the hydrogen atoms . \n note that in the process of the laser ablation hydrogen molecules are produced due to water molecules dissociation in the surroundings of the laser plume . as is shown in the work @xcite , \n in the case of the hydrogen passivated si nanoparticles the size of the exciton is approximately equal to the diameter of the qd . \n [ fig4 ]    since we consider the nickel nanoparticles in close proximity from the silicone qds , then @xmath23 , and coulomb potential is strong enough to pull the hole away from the electron . in this case \n , the quantity @xmath24 can reach as large as @xmath25 @xcite . \n then , we have @xmath26 ev . \n this shift of bandgap energy corresponds to a red shift of si quantum dot luminescence spectrum by about @xmath27 nm ( it is clear that depending on the distance of the point charge from the surface of silicon qd this shift will be changed ) . \n this shift can explain the observation of blue luminescense in the case of hybrid si - ni nanoparticles system in opposite to the case of the solely si nanoparticles in the colloidal solution . \n summarizing , by the luminescense picture of the mixed metallic - semiconductor nanoparticles in the colloidal solution one can define the sizes of quantum dots . \n the si colloidal qds in liquids can be used in a number of optical applications , in particular , as luminescent markers in the biomedical imaging in vivo and in vitro . \n the knowledge of peculiarities of their luminescent properties is very important for such kinds of biomedical applications . \n more complex assemblies of nanocrystals can be easily constructed by the presented technique of laser synthesis of colloidal qds including complexes of nanoparticles of different materials . \n these complex artificial structures will exhibit new physical and chemical properties that require further investigation and could be applied in the optical nanotechnologies . \n the results of this study may have far -

{"ContextTokens": 2413, "GeneratedTokens": 109, "SynthesizedBody": "fitting the ultra high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) spectrum is a common way to attempt to gain understanding of the sources of these particles . \n these fits often neglect the galactic component of cosmic rays , which is expected to be small at the very highest energies . \n however , the energy at which at which this becomes true is not known .    rather than assume a negligible galactic component \n , we employ a toy model in which composition determines source . in this model , we use the recent composition measurements of the hires prototype / mia experiment@xcite and of hires in stereo mode@xcite . \n these are shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] . the light component in these measurements , assumed to be protons , is identified with the extragalactic component of uhecrs ; the heavy component , assumed to be iron , is identified with the galactic component . \n having identified the extragalactic component of the uhecr spectrum , we fit this component using the assumption that the protons have lost energy between their acceleration and our observation , and that the sources are distributed uniformly throughout the universe , with a density that is smoothly varying in time . \n the fits assume a simple power law spectrum , @xmath3 , with a spectral index @xmath4 identical for all sources . \n we use the average energy loss model of berezinsky _ \n et al._@xcite to find the observed spectrum from a source a given redshift . \n in addition , we use a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation@xcite for the discrete energy losses associated with pion production . \n the mc is only important for propagating particles from small redshifts , @xmath5 , where the proton interacts only a few times . for propagation from larger redshifts , \n the distribution of observed energies for a given input energy is a gaussian of ever narrowing width . \n the mc is run to create an @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix with two million entries for propagation from each redshift , @xmath8 , to our observation . \n the @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix is calculated every 0.01 step in @xmath8 for @xmath9 to @xmath10 . \n smaller steps , as small as 0.0001 , are used below 0.05 . \n sources are assumed to be uniformly distributed at any given redshift , and with a density with which varies as @xmath11 . \n the mc results at individual redshifts are added together to form an @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix for uniformly distributed sources evolving according given value of @xmath12 . \n these @xmath8-integrated matrices were formed for @xmath130 to @xmath135 in steps of 0.5 . \n the fits are performed by varying the normalization , the spectral slope ( @xmath4 ) , and the evolution parameter ( @xmath12 ) . \n the goodness - of - fit is evaluated using the binned - maximum - likelihood method . \n the comparison spectra for fitting are calculated by multiplying a vector containing the input spectrum by the @xmath6-@xmath7 matrix using matrix multiplication . \n the input spectrum vectors are calculated every 0.05 in the spectral index @xmath4 . \n the comparison spectra for intermediate values of @xmath4 and @xmath12 are found by interpolation . \n the result of the fit to the most recent hires -

ii monocular data set for this analysis . \n unfortunately , the limited elevation coverage of the hires - ii aperture biases our @xmath19 acceptance , with the bias increasing at lower energies . \n the bias stems from the requirement that we find @xmath19 within that extent of the shower observed in the detector . \n events that are closer to the detector are more likely to have @xmath19 above the visible range , and thus be cut . \n furthermore , because lower energies can only be observed close to the detector , events at these energies will have a larger acceptance bias than those at higher energies . \n this bias precludes performing an elongation rate analysis at energies below @xmath18 ev .    instead \n , we have chosen to fit the @xmath20  distribution in energy bins to a combination of mc generated @xmath20  distributions from proton primaries and from iron primaries . \n the @xmath20  distribution in each energy bin is stored in a histogram , and the data histogram is then compared to a mixture of the proton and iron mc histograms to find the best fit proportion of each . \n the fit is performed using the binned maximum likelihood technique as implemented in the hbook@xcite routine hmclnl . \n the uncertainty of the fit in each energy bin is taken from the width of @xmath16 as fit to a quadratic in the region about the maximum . \n an example of this procedure for the bin at @xmath18 ev is shown in figure  [ fig : compfit18 ] . \n the result of these fits for the data at all energies is shown in figure  [ fig : rawdata ] .    at an energy of @xmath18 ev . \n the top panel shows @xmath16 as a function of the proton fraction in 1% steps ( black histogram ) , and a polynomial fit to the same ( red line ) . the bottom panel shows the @xmath20   distribution that results from the fit , with the data shown as filled circles with error bars , the proton distribution in blue , the iron distribution in red and the sum in black ]        this fit gives only the proportion of proton and iron in the final , accepted sample ; as such , it is not intrinsically interesting , but must be corrected to find the proton - iron ratio of uhecrs entering the atmosphere . \n however , one can test this procedure on an independent mc sample where one knows _ a priori _ which events are protons and which are iron . \n the result of this analysis on the mc sample used to calculate the aperture used in the spectrum analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : rawmc ] . \n the fits agree very well with what is actually in the sample . \n the raw composition measurements are corrected using the relative acceptances in the proton and iron mc samples . \n these are the same mc samples used to provide the comparison @xmath20  distributions used in the fit . \n the fit proton - iron proportion is interpreted as given numbers of proton events and iron events . \n these numbers then are separately corrected for the relative acceptance appropriate to each . \n finally , the proton - iron ratio is recalculated using the corrected numbers of events of each type .    for a mc sample \n , we can again compare the corrected proton - iron proportion to the input to the mc simulation . \n this is shown in figure  [ fig : cormc ] . in this case , the input is just the hires prototype / mia and hires stereo composition measurements , where the mean @xmath20  of the data is interpreted as representing a proton - iron proportion given by the distance between the corsika / qgsjet proton and iron lines . \n the input is in fact given by linear fits to the mean @xmath20  above and below @xmath21 ev . \n again , the corrected results of the fits agree very well with the inputs to the mc .        finally , we show as a very preliminary result , the corrected proton - iron ratio for the data . see figure  [ fig : cordata ] . \n this result shows a very light composition ( 90% protons ) above @xmath2 ev . below this energy \n we measure a sharply lower composition , but with large uncertainties because of few events and a large acceptance correction . \n the measured composition at high energies is in agreement with the hires stereo measurement , but closer to being all protons . \n the data used in the fits comes from the same data set used in the hires - ii spectrum analysis which was fit above \n . a considerable amount of data , about a factor of three more , was collected after this data set . \n this later data was collected with lower light thresholds , and as such , will have a lower energy threshold . \n in addition , the aperture at each energy will be increased , reducing the size of @xmath20   biases . \n performing this analysis on this expanded data set should give us much tighter constraints on the composition in the middle of the @xmath22 ev energy decade . \n the telescope array ( ta ) , which has already received japanese funding , and the ta low energy extension ( tale ) will be able to push this analysis even further . \n tale will use the hires phototubes with larger mirrors to push the thresholds even lower . \n the mirrors will be arranged in a tower rather than a ring to avoid biases in @xmath20 . \n geometrical resolution at the level of hires stereo will be provided by coincidences with the ta ground array .", "StartTimeOffset": 3035565634600, "RequestID": "155b0712128947279de5435dfe52fd6d", "TotalTokens": 2522}

[ s3 ] we discuss the impact of relative motion of the detector and the measured system on the performance of the witness and in sec .  [ s4 ] we give a summary and an outlook . throughout the paper \n we use natural units with @xmath4 . \n let us start by briefly reviewing the operational witness of nonclassicality based on the approach presented in @xcite . \n we are interested in the operational evaluation of nonclassicality of an unknown initial state of a quantum system . \n we consider a qubit detector which interacts with a harmonic oscillator . \n after the interaction , by analyzing the state of the detector we are able to verify the presence of nonclassicality in the initial state of the harmonic oscillator . + the system is assumed to start in a product state @xmath5 , corresponding to the qubit and the harmonic oscillator , and evolve according to a unitary transformation @xmath6 generated by a hamiltonian : @xmath7 in the above equation @xmath8 denote the usual bosonic annihilation and creation operators , @xmath9 are the pauli operators , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the frequencies of the respective subsystems , and @xmath12 is the coupling constant between them . \n we choose to parametrize the initial state in the following manner : @xmath13 where we have used the diagonal representation for the harmonic oscillator s density operator @xmath14 and the eigenbasis of @xmath15 for the qubit s operator @xmath16 . \n the full density operator evolves according to the equation @xmath17 and the state of the detector at any time @xmath18 is given by the reduced density operator @xmath19 . since @xmath20=0 $ ] , the only non - trivially evolving elements of the qubit density matrix , @xmath21 , are the off - diagonal ones : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote @xmath24 eigenstates with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath25 . \n an explicit calculation of the evolution of @xmath26 yields the following result : @xmath27 is the _ _ witness function _ _ as the witness function . ] . \n if the underlying @xmath0-representation is positive , then one can write the _ witness inequality _ ( or the _ classicality bound _ ) : latexmath:[\\ ] ] and confirm that @xmath156 satisfies the relation . \n based on this observation we can calculate the time evolution operator to obtain : @xmath157 in the above @xmath158 denotes the displacement operator and we have introduced : @xmath159 the above formulae can be used for evaluating the time evolution operator @xmath160 discussed in the core body of the manuscript . \n recall that the @xmath0-representation for coherent and thermal states take the following form ( here we consider one mode only and omit the label @xmath108 ) : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the average number of excitations . \n one can insert these formulae into the first line of equation ( [ witness - moving ] ) and evaluate the absolute value of the witness function . for the coherent state \n the corresponding absolute value of the witness function is equal to one , whereas for the thermal state we obtain : @xmath163 in both cases we obtain a function which does not exceed unity . \n here we evaluate the expression for @xmath104 that appears in eq .  . \n let us repeat the underlying integral : @xmath164 and the notation @xmath114 . for further convenience \n we introduce @xmath165 and continue the calculation to obtain :      this expression reveals a resonant behavior with a peak at @xmath167 , namely if we take the limit @xmath168 , we obtain a finite @xmath169 whose envelope increases linearly with @xmath48 . \n it allows us to identify the critical velocity given in eq .  . \n w. g. unruh , , 870 ( 1976 ) . \n w. g. unruh , _ proceedings of the 1st marcel grossmann meeting on general relativity _ , edited by r. ruffini ( north - holland , amsterdam ) , 527 - 536 ( 1977 ) . \n s. a. fulling , , 2850 ( 1973 ) . \n l. c. b. crispino , a. higuchi , and g. e. a. matsas , rev . \n phys . * 80 * , 787 ( 2008 ) . \n i. fuentes - schuller and r. b. mann , , 120404 ( 2005 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3523, "GeneratedTokens": 159, "SynthesizedBody": "consider a layered 2d acoustic waveguide , which is homogenous in the @xmath0-direction and has a sandwich structure in the @xmath1-direction . \n the media constituting the waveguide can be elastic , liquid or gaseous . \n waves in such a waveguide are described by a dispersion diagram in the @xmath2 coordinates ( @xmath3 is the temporal circular frequency , @xmath4 is the wavenumber in the @xmath0-direction ) . \n usually the dispersion diagram is a graph consisting of several branches ( curves ) . \n each point of the dispersion diagram is characterized by two important parameters , namely by phase velocity @xmath5 and group velocity @xmath6 ( the derivative @xmath7 is the slope of corresponding branch of the dispersion diagram ) . \n it is well known that wave pulses propagate in the waveguide with corresponding group velocities . \n it is well known also that in the experiment typically one can observe the _ \n first arriving signal _ \n ( fas ) propagating with the velocity of the fastest medium in the structure of the waveguide . in the case of a single elastic isotropic medium \n the velocity of the fas is close to the velocity of the longitudinal waves . in some cases \n the velocity of the fas is bigger than any of the group velocities provided by the dispersion diagram . \n the fas pulse decays with propagation distance unlike the pulses corresponding to usual modal pulses ( the latter are called _ guided waves _ in the medical - related literature ) . thus , fas is a transient process in a waveguide . \n it can negligibly small very far from the source , however at moderate distances it can be an important phenomenon . \n the most known applications of fas are related to medical acoustics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n a long bone can be considered as a tubular waveguide constituted of three media : a thin outer layer of dense ( cortical ) bone , a sponge bone underneath , and a liquid marrow core in the center . \n the fastest wave that can theoretically propagate in such media ( taken separately as infinite spaces ) is the longitudinal wave in the cortical bone . \n the sponge bone and the marrow bear much slower waves . \n however , when a standard analysis of a waveguide is performed ( say , by the finite element method ) the dispersion diagram contains no branch having group velocity close to the longitudinal cortical velocity . \n there exist different approaches to describe fas . \n the most comprehensive approach has been proposed by miklowitz and randles in @xcite . \n this approach considers an analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram . after passing some branch points , it is possible to find a single branch of the dispersion diagram whose group velocity and decay correspond to fas . \n another analytical approach is an application of the classical cagniard \n dehoop technique to invert the fourier transform in the time domain @xcite \n . an approximate approach to fas is described in @xcite , where this type of waves is treated as a head wave . \n also fas can be approximately described as a leaky mode . for this , the slow media composing the waveguide are declared as elastic half - spaces , while the fastest medium remains to be a layer . \n such an approach enables one to compute ( at least in the simplest cases ) the velocity and the decay of fas with an acceptable accuracy . \n the aim of the current paper is to present a model of fas based on an elementary analysis of real dispersion diagrams of a layered waveguide \n . it is known @xcite that a wave process in a layered waveguide can be treated as an interaction between the modes of different types and velocities . \n thus , the dispersion diagram has a `` terrace - like '' structure formed by overlapping of different sets of branches . \n since typically no crossing of the branches can happen ( except the branches corresponding to non - interacting waves ) , there occur quasi - crossings at which the type of the mode is changing . a typical fragment of a dispersion diagram is shown in fig . \n [ fig01 ] ( this is a dispersion diagram of a model two - media acoustic waveguide studied in the paper ) . the visible line of the smallest slope ( although this line can be composed of segments corresponding to different branches ) is a _ pseudo - branch _ ) relating to the fas .    in the current paper \n this idea is developed into an analytical model . \n an approximation of a fragment of the dispersion diagram by a sum of a tangent function and a linear function is constructed . \n an analytical continuation of the approximation to the domain of positive @xmath8 $ ] is performed . \n the tangent function tends to an imaginary constant there . using this trick , \n the estimation of the decay of fas is obtained .    the idea to study the analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram is inspired by the miklowitz \n randles method @xcite . in the paper \n we briefly describe this method and its connection with the description of the fas as a leaky wave . \n the structure of the paper is as follows . in section \n ii a sample problem is formulated . in section  iii a numerical modeling of pulse propagation in the two - media problem \n is performed . \n the presence of fas and its exponential decay are established . in section \n iv the approach by miklowitz \n randles is applied to the waveguide . \n the branch of the dispersion diagram responsible for fas is found . in section \n v the properties of fas are compared to those of a corresponding leaky wave . in section \n vi the signal in the waveguide is represented in the form of an approximation of the phase based on tangent function . \n the approximation is analyzed and the parameters of fas are estimated . \n the results obtained by miklowitz  randles approach , leaky wave approach and the analysis of the real dispersion diagram are compared . \n consider a waveguide in the @xmath9-plane occupying the strip @xmath10 ( see fig . \n [ fig03 ] ) . \n the layer @xmath11 is filled with a medium having density and speed of sound equal to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , respectively . \n the layer @xmath14 is filled with a medium with parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 . \n the wave equations in the media are as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the field variables ( say , acoustical potentials ) , notation @xmath20 stands for the second time derivative . \n the boundary conditions are as follows . \n the surface @xmath21 is rigid ( neumann ) : @xmath22 on the interface @xmath23 the pressure and the normal velocity are continuous : @xmath24 the surface @xmath25 is also rigid , but a point source is located at the point @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dirac delta - function , @xmath29 is the time shape of the probe pulse . \n the observation point is located at @xmath30 , i.  e. the function @xmath31 is recorded . \n the problem of finding the signal on the receiver is quite standard and it can be solved easily . \n namely , perform the 2d fourier transform of @xmath32 in the domain of time and frequency : @xmath33 get a 1d problem for @xmath34 as functions of @xmath1 . \n these functions should obey the equations @xmath35 the following boundary conditions should be valid : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38    the solution of ( [ eq0209 ] ) , ( [ eq0210 ] ) , ( [ eq0211 ] ) can be found : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 the field on the receiver can be obtained by inverting the fourier transformation : @xmath42    formula ( [ eq0215 ] ) can not be used directly , since zeros of the denominator belong to the plane of integration . \n the limiting absorption principle is used to change the contour of integration . \n namely , for @xmath43 we assume that the velocities @xmath44 have vanishing _ negative _ imaginary parts , while for @xmath45 the velocities @xmath44 have vanishing _ positive _ imaginary parts . due to this , for each @xmath3 the zeros of @xmath46 in the complex @xmath4-plane become displaced from the real axis . \n the dispersion diagram represents the zeros of @xmath47 ( for real @xmath44 ) , i.  e.  the dispersion equation is @xmath48 the roots of ( [ eq0216 ] ) are curves in the @xmath49 plane , each point of which corresponds to a wave freely propagating in the waveguide and having @xmath0- and @xmath50-dependence of the form @xmath51 . \n the following parameters have been selected for a numerical demonstration of fas presence : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 . \n dimensionless values are used in the computations , since no particular physical medium is under the investigation . \n the values plotted in the graphs are , therefore , also dimensionless . the dispersion diagram for this waveguide \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig01 ] . \n the fastest pseudo - branch is shown in the figure as a dashed line . \n the pseudo - branch is composed of parts of real branches of the diagram . \n one can see that for the selected parameters the pseudo - branch is quite loose , i.  e.  the gaps between its parts are quite wide .    for the demonstration we are using the probe pulse @xmath29 having the spectrum corresponding to the pseudo - branch . \n namely , we are using the region @xmath57 . in this region \n the group velocities of the guided waves are smaller than  @xmath58 . in the demonstration we are going to show the presence of a pulse whose velocity is approximately equal to the inverse of the slope of the dashed line . this velocity is close to to  4 . \n thus , the velocity of the fas is considerably higher than that of any of the guided waves . \n the shape of the pulse @xmath29 is shown in fig . \n [ fig03 ] , left . \n the spectrum of this pulse is shown in fig . \n [ fig03 ] , right . \n one can see that @xmath29 is a radio pulse centered around @xmath59 . \n the central circular frequency is about @xmath60 . \n the results of the computations made by formula ( [ eq0215 ] ) for @xmath61 are shown in fig . \n [ fig04 ] , fig . \n [ fig05 ] , fig . \n [ fig06 ] , respectively . \n the field at the receiver , i.  e. @xmath62 , is plotted . \n one can see that in all graphs there exists a small pulse , which can be interpreted as fas . \n parameters of fas approximately determined from these graphs are given in table  [ tab01 ] . \n tof is the `` time of flight '' , i.  e.  the travel time of fas . \n one can see that the velocity of the pulse is more than 4 , and the amplitude decay is close to exponential . \n such a behavior is typical for fas . \n the aim of the rest of the paper will be to estimate the group velocity of the fas pulse @xmath63 and the decay parameter @xmath64 . \n the decay parameter is the coefficient in the exponential dependence of the amplitude vs @xmath65 : @xmath66    .parameters of the fas [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the estimation of @xmath67 is , obviously , @xmath68 this parameter is an estimation of @xmath69 . \n the estimation of @xmath70 is @xmath71 finally , the estimation of @xmath72 is as follows : @xmath73 since the values of @xmath72 given by ( [ eq1005 ] ) are different for different points @xmath74 , we come to conclusion that @xmath72 in ( [ eq1001 ] ) is a ( slow ) function of @xmath3 . by ( [ eq1005 ] ) \n we obtain an estimation of @xmath72 at the points @xmath75 , and after that we can , say , interpolate @xmath72 between these points . as we mentioned above \n , function @xmath72 is an estimation of the decay parameter @xmath64 .    using the data extracted from fig . \n [ figa06 ] and fig . \n [ fig01 ] collected in table  [ tab02 ] , we can estimate the position of the pseudo - branch and the values of the attenuation parameters . \n the points related to the peaks of the group velocity are plotted in fig  [ figa05 ] as small circles . \n one can see that the points obtained from the the real dispersion diagram are in reasonably good agreement with the dispersion curve of the leaky wave for real @xmath3 . \n it is shown that fas pulses correspond to terrace - like structures of the dispersion diagrams . \n these structures are called pseudo - branches in the paper . a typical form of the pseudo - branch is shown in fig .  [ fig01 ] . \n the pulse propagation velocity for fas is the inverse of the slope of the dashed curve in fig . \n [ fig01 ] , and it can be larger than any of the group velocities available in the considered part of the dispersion diagram .    in the paper \n we describe three different approaches to finding the velocity and the decay of fas pulses . \n they are the miklowitz \n randles approach based on the analytical continuation of the dispersion diagram , the leaky wave approach and the approach based on the analysis of the pseudo - branch of the real dispersion diagram . \n only the third approach is original . in the third approach \n one should study the local peaks of the the group velocity , i.  e.  find the positions of the peaks and the values of the group velocity . \n these parameters provide data describing the fas . \n our computations prove consistency of all three approaches . \n m.  muller , p.  moilanen , e.  bossy , p.  nicholson , v.  kilappa , j.  timonen , m.  talmant , s.  cheng , and p.  laugier ( 2005 ) `` comparison of three ultrasonic axial transmission methods for bone assessment , '' ultrs \n biol . * 31 * , 633642 . \n j.  grondin , q.  grimal , k.  engelke , and p.  laugier ( 2010 ) `` potential of first arriving signal to assess cortical bone geomtery at the hip with qus : a model based study , '' ultras .   med \n .  biol . * \n 36 * , 656666 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3068466380091, "RequestID": "0d4171c13ae540e3ada27bbea93cdfdf", "TotalTokens": 3682}

like spectra and little interstellar absorption . pointed follow - up observations with the rosat pspc and/or hri yielded very small x - ray error circles which put stringent constraints on possible optical counterparts . \n walter & matthews ( 1997 ) could identify rxj1856.53754 with a faint blue object in an hst observation ( @xmath17 ) . \n the extremely large x - ray to optical flux ratio @xmath18 excludes anything other than an isolated neutron star for this object . \n recent observations of the likely counterpart of rxj0720.43125 ( star x1 ) reveals @xmath19 ( motch & haberl 1998 ) and @xmath20 ( kulkarni & van kerkwijk 1998 , kvk98 ) . with @xmath21 \n the inferred ratio @xmath22 again indicates an ins origin for the x - ray emission . on long time \n scales the x - ray emission of the two ins candidates is almost constant . \n however , most remarkably , pulsations with a period of 8.4 seconds were detected for rxj0720.43125 , which , under the assumption of accretion , indicate a low magnetic field ( @xmath010@xmath23 g ) and a small space velocity ( @xmath010 km s@xmath24 ) for the neutron star ( haberl et al . \n a third , fainter candidate ins , rxj0806.44123 , also detected in the rass has been reported by haberl et al . \n its optical counterpart has @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .    assuming that only two ins with count rates @xmath02 pspc cts s@xmath24 exist in the rass \n , we expect a number of order 20 over the whole sky with count rates @xmath00.2cts  s@xmath24 ( c.f . \n neuhuser & trmper 1998 ) . \n in order to improve the determination of the x - ray luminosity function of x - ray emitting source classes , mainly agns , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , we have almost completed a program of optical identifications of bright , high - galactic - latitude x - ray sources , termed the rosat bright survey rbs . the goal is to completely identify all bright x - ray sources , @xmath27 pspc cts s@xmath24 , detected in the rosat all - sky survey ( 1rxs catalogue , voges et al . \n 1996 ) at galactic latitudes @xmath28 , excluding lmc , smc and the virgo cluster ( hasinger et al .  1997 \n ; fischer et al .  1998 ; \n schwope et al . \n the rbs is already to 98% spectroscopically complete . \n we find a total of 757 stars , 659 agn , 297 clusters of galaxies , 171 bl lac candidates , 43 galaxies , 49 cataclysmic variables or x - ray binaries . \n only 36 of the more than 2000 sources in the sample are not yet identified . among the known types of x - ray emitters , the bl lac objects are those with the most extreme x - ray to optical flux ratio . \n yet the optically faintest bl lac objects at @xmath29 have @xmath30 ( fig . \n [ f : colcol ] shows the ratio @xmath31 for bl lac objects , ins candidates and unidentified rbs sources ) .    for all unidentified x - ray sources we have produced finding charts from the roe / nrl and apm digitised sky survey catalogues . \n the position errors of bright rass - sources are of sufficient quality that we can immediately localize x - ray sources with empty rass error circles on the sky survey plates . \n for quite a number of such objects we have been awarded short follow - up observations with the rosat hri in the last years or looked in the archive , in order to investigate whether the source is a fluke or has an exceptionally large x - ray position error ( a number of such objects existed in the first processing of the all - sky - survey , rass - i ) . \n another possibility is that the x - ray source is extended ( cluster or group ) and therefore has a formally empty error circle . finally , in one case so far the hri confirmed the position and flux of the x - ray source and has put very strong constraints on the magnitude of an optical counterpart . \n the field of rbs1223 has been observed with the rosat hri on june 13 , 1997 at 19:58 ut for a net exposure time of 2218s . \n we have corrected the individual x - ray photons for the hri plate - scale factor of 0.9972 ( hasinger et al . \n 1998 ) and then analysed the data using the standard interactive analysis system exsas ( zimmermann et al . \n the hri observation showed a point - like x - ray source consistent with the position of 1rxsj130848.6 + 212708 . \n positions of rosat pointed sources have a routine accuracy of @xmath010  due to inherent attitude errors . \n the hri position of rbs1223 however , could be related to an absolute celestial reference system through the fortuitous detection of a second , fainter hri source about 4.5 arcmin west of rbs1223 , which could be identified with the bright ( @xmath32 ) star ag+21 1341 ( using simbad ) . \n the x - ray position of the second hri source is within @xmath33 of the optical position of ag+21 1341 , as determined from the apm catalogue . \n we did not consider it necessary to correct for this shift . \n the final position of rbs1223 is therefore ra(2000)@xmath34 , dec(2000)@xmath35 . \n taking into account the statistical accuracy of the centroiding for both sources , the 90% position error for rbs1223 is 1.6 arcsec . fig . \n [ f : xcont_over ] shows a superposition of the x - ray contours of the rbs1223 field on a digitised copy of the poss - ii plate , clearly indicating an empty error box down to the plate limit . \n the hri count rate of rbs1223 , @xmath36  cts  s@xmath24 , is comparable to the pspc count rate of @xmath37  cts  s@xmath24 . \n rbs1223 has pspc hardness ratios which can be fit with a blackbody temperature of @xmath38ev , and an interstellar absorption column density of @xmath39  @xmath40 , consistent with the total galactic value in this direction , @xmath41  @xmath40 . \n the unabsorbed blackbody flux at earth is about @xmath42  erg  @xmath40  s@xmath24 . \n we have analysed the @xmath43 hri photons from rbs1223 for periodicities in the x - ray flux , but did not detect any significant signal in the fourier transform of the data . \n -0.5truecm    ( 8,8 )    -0.5truecm    -0.5truecm \n images of the rbs1223 field have been obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al . \n 1995 ) at the cassegrain focus of the keck ii telescope on the photometric night of march 19th , 1998 . \n the @xmath44 pixel loral ccd was read out in single amplifier mode . a 15 min exposure through the r filter \n was taken at 13:33 ut and a 15 min exposure through the b filter at 13:52 ut . \n the reduction was done using midas . \n the two frames were bias subtracted , cleaned of cosmic rays and flat - fielded using twilight flats . \n no photometric standards were taken . using the brightness limits derived by kvk98 for the same instrumental setup and same observing conditions we estimate the limiting magnitude of our images at about @xmath45 by scaling with the sqaureroot of the integration time . for our estimate of the x -

ray to optical flux ratio , a rather soft x - ray spectrum and a constant x - ray flux over long time scales . with its very small x - ray error box \n it will provide a further challenge for optical identification . scaling from the counterpart of rxj1856.53754 ( walter & matthews 1998 ) we expect its optical magnitude in the range @xmath52 , within reach of the hst and ground - based 810 m telescopes . \n the direct prediction of the optical brightness assuming pure blackbody radiation with the spectral parameters of tab . \n 1 gives only @xmath53 , beyond the limit of current telescopes . \n [ f : colcol ] shows the extreme position of rbs1223 and the other ins candidates of tab \n .  1 plotted in a kind of x - ray / optical colour - colour diagram together with the otherwise most extreme point - like rbs sources , the bl lac objects . only sources with a very peaked x - ray - optical spectrum can be in the upper left corner of this diagram . \n rbs1223 is the faintest of all known ins candidates and has also the highest x - ray temperature . among the 36 unidentified rbs sources , \n there is only a handful of objects with x - ray hardness ratios consistent with ins . \n ( we have , however , to be careful about possible misidentified objects in x - ray surveys ) . the next best ins candidate from the rosat bright survey is rbs1556 , which lies in the same part of the diagram . at somewhat lower values of @xmath54 \n there are a number of unidentified objects , which could be either bl lac candidates or ins . assuming between 2 and 10 candidate objects in the rbs , a rough estimate of the surface density of ins brighter than 0.2 pspc cts / s is @xmath55  sources  sr@xmath24 . \n the lower and upper limit can provide strong constraints on the ins @xmath56 function and therefore on the nature of the population as a whole . \n the accreting old neutron star scenario was recently criticized because of a number of highly uncertain assumptions or unlikely requirements ( see the discussion in kvk98 ; wang et al . \n a very low magnetic field is required to overcome the propeller effect and allow accretion . \n ism accretion would most likely be highly variable on time - scales of months to years . \n finally , accreting neutron stars would quickly build up a hydrogen - rich envelope , which should appear much brighter in the optical band than is detected for ins ( wang et al . \n 1998 ) . \n several authors have therefore proposed alternatives or variants for the nature of isolated neutron star candidates . \n haberl et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggest a connection of rxj0720.43125 to the class of anomalous pulsars ( mereghetti & stella 1995 ) which might be born with low space velocities and magnetic fields . \n kvk98 discuss the interesting possibility that the ins candidates are cooling magnetars , very high magnetic field isolated neutron stars with long spin period , which are associated with soft gamma ray repeaters . at any rate , \n the detection of more objects of this class and their detailed study with existing and upcoming x - ray and optical instruments is of vital importance for the understanding of their nature . \n we thank the referee frederick m.  walter for helpful comments . \n the rosat project is supported by the bundesministerium fr bildung , forschung und wissenschaft ( bmbf ) , by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the science and engineering research council ( serc ) . \n the w.m . \n keck observatory is operated as a scientific partnership between the california institute of technology , the university of california , and the national aeronautics and space administration . \n it was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m . \n keck foundation . \n this research has made use of the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france and was greatly facilitated by use of the apm catalogue based on scans of the poss plates performed at the institute of astronomy , cambridge , uk and the cosmos scans of the eso / serc j plates performed at the royal observatory edinburgh . \n this work has been supported in part by dlr grant 50 or 9403 5 ( ads , gh ) and by nasa grant nag5 -

qubit will be lost . in conventional quantum information theory ( cqit ) \n , people always assume that the central quantum system is at rest . in this paper \n , we present the time evolution of the spin state of a _ moving _ dirac electron . \n it can be seen that the decoherence properties is significantly modified by special relativity . \n we demonstrate that the dressed environment induced by special relativity will suppress the spin decoherence . \n one should note that , the problem we consider here is different from the gravitational decoherence @xcite , which results from quantum metric fluctuations and unruh effect . \n the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec . \n ii we demonstrate the spin dephasing of a rest electron . in sec . \n iii the influences of special relativity on the spin decoherence properties is investigated by presenting its dynamical behavior in the operator - sum representation form . in sec . \n iv are conclusions and some discussions . \n we start by considering the decoherence process for the spin degree of freedom of an electron with a background magnetic noise . in cqit , \n the electron is always assumed to be at rest . \n since the spin magnetic moment of the electron is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the electronic charge , its interaction with a magnetic field @xmath5 is described by the following simple hamiltonian @xmath6where @xmath7 are pauli matrices . \n if the noisy background magnetic field is @xmath8 in the @xmath2 direction with gaussian probability distribution @xmath9 , and under quasi - static approximation @xcite , we can write the spin state of the electron at time @xmath10 as a completely positive map with an operator - sum representation @xmath11where @xmath12 is the initial spin state , and the parameters @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 with @xmath17 . \n here we have set @xmath18 for simplicity . \n this kind of decoherence model , named dephasing , is very important and has been widely investigated in cqit @xcite . in the dephasing process , the diagonal elements of the spin density matrix remain unchanged . \n the decoherence is reflected by the off - diagonal elements , which will decay exponentially as @xmath19 until @xmath20 in the long time limit @xmath21 , i.e. the spin state becomes classically mixed . \n to deal with the relativistic dirac electron moving at a constant velocity @xmath22 relative to the rest frame @xmath23 , we should adopt the dirac equation for the electron in external homogeneous static fields . after choosing a suitable reference frame @xmath24 , \n the dirac hamiltonian in foldy - wouthuysen representation greiner is @xmath25where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represents the electric field . \n the above hamiltonian is a non - relativistic expansion to order @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the relative velocity of the electron in the reference frame @xmath24 . \n it is convenient for us to investigate the dynamical properties of the dirac electron in the the moving inertial frame @xmath30 with the velocity @xmath31 relative to the rest frame @xmath23 , in which the electron is at rest , i.e. @xmath32 . by virtue of the foldy - wouthuysen representation , we only need to consider the positive energy states . for the spin and momentum eigen state @xmath33 , of which @xmath34 , @xmath35 . \n after time @xmath10 , the evolution of the state is @xmath36 . \n the momentum phase @xmath37 becomes trivial when tracing out the momentum degree of freedom .    in the rest frame \n @xmath23 , the magnetic field is @xmath8 in the @xmath2 direction , thus the fields viewed in the moving frame @xmath30 can be obtained according to the lorentz transformations greiner2 as follows @xmath38where @xmath39 and @xmath40 mean parallel and perpendicular to @xmath31 , the rapidity @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 . after some straightforward calculations , and note that @xmath43 , we get the effective hamiltonian for the spin degree of freedom of the dirac electron @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . \n the above effective interaction hamiltonian means that from the viewpoint of the moving dirac electron , the environment is different compared to the situation when the electron is at rest due to the relativity of the magnetic field . in the following , we will investigate in detail how this kind of effects will modify the dynamical properties of the spin decoherence . \n the interaction with the external magnetic field @xmath48 will introduce a rotation on the spin by @xmath49 about the @xmath50 axis as @xmath51where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the rotation angle is @xmath56 . in the similar way , \n the noisy background magnetic field @xmath57 is with gaussian probability distribution , and under quasi - static approximation @xcite , we can write the spin state of the moving dirac electron at time @xmath10 as@xmath58where @xmath59 and @xmath12 denotes the initial spin state . \n we first examine the diagonal elements by calculating @xmath60 . according to eq.([rt ] ) , it is easy for us to write @xmath61 , where @xmath62 $ ] with two modulation factors defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . after integrating over the magnetic field @xmath57 with gaussian probability distribution , \n we obtain @xmath65where @xmath66 . \n the first term is just the same as the dephasing process in cqit , i.e. @xmath67 . \n however , the second item in eq.([de ] ) indicates that the diagonal elements will change as time , which is a different decoherence source introduced by the effects of special relativity . in the long time \n limit @xmath68 , the spin up population will decrease @xmath69 . \n now we turn to the off - diagonal elements , in the similar way we can obtain @xmath70\\sin \\delta $ ] , where @xmath71 $ ] . after integrating over the gaussian magnetic field @xmath57 \n , we obtain @xmath72the first term of @xmath73 is in a similar form of exponential decay , except that the decay rate changes to @xmath74 . \n the effects of special relativity is also reflected by the second term , which implies that when @xmath75 , @xmath76 that is a saturation value other than zero , i.e. the off - diagonals will not vanish . from the evolution of diagonal and off - diagonal elements in eqs.([de],[nde ] ) , we can establish a physical picture of the above analyses by expressing the spin density matrix at time @xmath10 in the operator - sum representation@xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \n the operators @xmath81 are @xmath82^{1/2}(\\cos \\varphi \\sigma _ { x}+\\sin \\varphi \\sigma _ { y})$ ] and @xmath83 . \n if the velocity of the electron @xmath67 , the modulation factor @xmath84 , and the above results reduce to the pure dephasing of a rest spin . when we consider a moving electron , the first two terms in eq.([osr ] ) \n is similar to pure dephasing . \n however , the decay rate of the off - diagonal elements is amplified by the factor @xmath85 . \n the suppression of dephasing stems from the third term @xmath86 . \n the other two operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq.([osr ] ) represent different decoherence mechanisms which makes the spin suffer from other decoherence than pure dephasing . \n we could also formulate the evolution of the spin state of the moving electron as in the dressed environment    @xmath89^{\\kappa } ( v\\rho v^{\\dagger } ) [ \\exp ( i\\frac{\\delta _ { 0}}{2}\\sigma _ { z})]^{\\kappa } \\eta ( b)db\\right\\ } v\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 $ ] is the dressing transformation , @xmath91 is the angle between the axes @xmath92 and @xmath2 . from the viewpoint of qubit , after the control operation @xmath93 , the initial state @xmath94 will undergo pure dephasing in the dressed hilbert space , the final reverse operation @xmath95 will recover some coherence information in the original hilbert space . \n the modulation factors @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the key ingredients that characterize the influence of special relativity . \n fig 2 shows the modulation factor @xmath96 as a function of the rapidity @xmath41 and @xmath98 . for a given rapidity @xmath41 , the modulation factor \n @xmath99 $ ] . \n we are interested in the maximum value of the modulation factor @xmath96 . \n thus we consider the first order partial differential equation @xmath100 , which leads to @xmath101 , and the corresponding maximum value of @xmath96 is@xmath102we plot the maximum value @xmath103 for various rapidity @xmath41 in the following fig 3(a ) . \n it can be seen that @xmath103 always increases monotonically as the rapidity @xmath41 grows . in the limit @xmath104 , \n i.e. the velocity is close to the light velocity @xmath105 , the maximum modulation factor @xmath103 reaches the constant value @xmath14 .    for the angle @xmath98 of the velocity @xmath106 that maximize the value of @xmath107 , the corresponding value of the other modulation factor @xmath108 is @xmath109 . \n when we consider the relativistic dirac electron , i.e. the velocity @xmath106 is comparable to the light velocity @xmath110 , @xmath111 , which can be neglected in some sense . \n _ example _ to explicitly demonstrate the influence of special relativity on the spin decoherence of a moving dirac electron , we consider a spin qubit in a fully coherent initial state @xmath112 . we could have chosen a more general initial spin state with different relative amplitudes . \n however , the above state gives rise to all interesting physical features in the situation considered here . \n we set the velocity angle @xmath113 to maximize the modulus of the saturation value of off - diagonal elements , thus @xmath114 \\\\ \n \\rho _ { \\uparrow \\downarrow } ( t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}[(1-\\eta ) e^{-\\gamma ^{\\prime } t^{2}}+\\eta ] \\end{aligned}\\]]we plot the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the spin density matrix in fig 3(b ) , and compare two cases when the rapidity @xmath115 and @xmath116 . \n the velocity angle @xmath98 is set to maximize the modulation factor @xmath96 . in the short time region , \n the off - diagonal elements decay much faster , which is due to the amplification of @xmath117by the factor @xmath118 . \n however , as the time is longer , the decay of the off - diagonal elements will be much suppressed . in particular , \n if the time is sufficiently long , for @xmath116 , the spin degree of freedom becomes completely classical ; while for @xmath115 , the off - diagonal elements will reach a nonzero saturation value @xmath119 , and the spin state becomes steady , which suggests that the decoherence process seems halting . \n the above discussions are extensible to the situation of several spin-@xmath0 dirac electrons coupled with one common gaussian background magnetic noise , i.e. @xmath120 @xcite . \n for example , we consider two electrons in the spin entangled state @xmath121 moving at the same velocity , if the electrons are at rest , the two - qubit entanglement quantified by the concurrence will decay exponentially as @xmath122 @xcite . in order to highlight the effects of special relativity , we assume that @xmath123 , thus the modulation factors are @xmath124 and @xmath125 . \n after simple calculations , it is easy to obtain the evolution of the two - qubit entanglement as @xmath126 . \n therefore , unlike the situation of a single electron , the effects of special relativity will makes @xmath127 much more quickly . \n the existing research in the field of rqit focused on the effects of special relativity on the _ static _ properties of quantum states , e.g. von neumann entropy and quantum entanglement . in this work \n , we investigate the _ dynamic _ properties , i.e. decoherence process of a moving dirac electron . \n the decoherence mechanisms will be significantly modified due to the _ dressed environment _ , which leads to the intriguing phenomenon that the coherent information will be preserved even as the electron is in the noisy environment for sufficiently long time . \n the extension of this work to general decoherence models will enlarge the research scope of relativistic quantum information theory , and may establish fundamental connections between special relativity and quantum mechanics . \n we thank prof . \n daniel a. lidar and l. lamata for valuable discussions . \n this work was funded by national fundamental research program , ncet-04 -

{"ContextTokens": 3456, "GeneratedTokens": 183, "SynthesizedBody": "open questions in stellar physics led to the idea that a dynamo operates in the radiative cores of early - type stars ( spruit 2002 ) . \n even the helioseismologic observation of rigid rotation of the solar interior shows in this direction . \n the angular momentum transport by the large - scale magnetic field pattern ( fossil field plus toroidal field induced by differential rotation ) does _ not _ lead to a solid - body rotation unless the viscosity of the plasma exceeds the molecular value by a few orders of magnitude ( rdiger & kitchatinov 1996 , eggenberger et al . \n other examples are given by the evolution of the fast rotating early - type stars which can only be understood if i ) there is a basic transport of angular momentum outwards and ii ) the radial mixing of chemicals remains weak ( yoon et al . \n 2006 , brott et al . \n 2008 ) . hence , \n if a ( magnetic - induced ) instability existed in the radiative stellar cores then the corresponding schmidt number @xmath3 must be rather large . \n we have shown that the kink - type instability ( or tayler instability , ti ) of toroidal magnetic fields forms a much - promising candidate for the instability . a schmidt number larger than ten results as the ratio of the effective viscosity and the diffusion coefficient ( rdiger et al . \n 2009 ) . \n the unstable modes of the ti are basically nonaxisymmetric driven by the energy of the electrical current which produces the toroidal field . \n interestingly enough , there exists even an instability of a toroidal magnetic field which in the fluid is current - free . in this case \n the energy comes from a differential rotation which itself is stable but which is unstable under the influence of the ( current - free ) toroidal field . \n we have called this instability as azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) as  like for the standard mri ( with axial fields )  the field itself is current - free and does not exert forces . in opposition to the standard mri \n the amri is always nonaxisymmetric and it is , therefore , much more interesting for the dynamo theory . for complicated radial profiles of the toroidal field we shall always have a mixture of ti and amri . \n generally , the latter is more important for fast rotation ( @xmath4 ) and v.v . here \n the alfvn frequency @xmath5 for the toroidal field is used which derives from the alfvn velocity @xmath6 as the related frequency . between two cylinders with different radii \n the toroidal field profile with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 radius ) is free of dissipation . \n the ` perfect ' amri appears for @xmath9 while the ` perfect ' ti results for @xmath10 . \n one can compute the necessary electrical currents to excite both sorts of instabilities in a columnar taylor - couette experiment with gallium as fluid conductor . \n as we have shown the critical hartmann numbers for self - excitation of axi- and nonaxisymmetric perturbation modes do not depend on the magnetic prandtl number of the fluid which is as small as @xmath11 for stellar plasma and @xmath12 for liquid sodium ( rdiger & schultz 2010 ) . \n it is typical for the nonaxisymmetric ti and amri that always the two modes with @xmath13 are excited for the same critical hartmann number and also  if supercritical  with the same growth rates ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . despite their simultaneous existence \n they can be excited as singles with different initial conditions . however , if the initial conditions are as neutral as possible with respect to a preferred helicity , in the majority of the cases one of the modes dominates after our experiences . \n this behavior may have dramatic consequences with respect to the dynamo theory . \n both the modes with @xmath13 have opposite helicity with the same total amount . \n the mode with @xmath14 is identical to the mode with @xmath15 but in a left - hand system . \n the helicity of @xmath15 in the right - hand system equals the helicity of @xmath14 in the left - hand system . \n so it is obvious that in one and the same coordinate system the sum of the helicity of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is zero . as a consequence \n the instability of a toroidal field can only develop helicity if by some reasons one of the modes with @xmath13 dominates the other . \n there are the two possibilities that i ) one mode dominates the other by chance ( so as the matter dominates the antimatter ) or ii ) the existence of a poloidal field prefers one of the modes . \n we have shown that indeed in stellar radiation zones  if the background field has a positive current helicity @xmath16  the resulting kinetic helicity @xmath17 of the fluctuations is always negative ( gellert et al . \n a positive current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electrical current are parallel . a negative current helicity of the background field results if an axial field and an axial electric current are antiparallel . \n hence , the resulting kinetic helicities on the basis of current - driven instabilities have , therefore , opposite signs in opposite hemispheres of the model . \n we are interested in the stability of a background field @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and the flow @xmath20 in a dissipative conducting fluid rotating between two rigid cylinders . \n @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath22 is the magnetic diffusivity , their ratio is the magnetic prandtl number @xmath23 . \n the stationary background rotation law is @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 as constants . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the rotation rates of the cylinders and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the azimuthal magnetic fields there . \n one finds for the current helicity of the background field @xmath31 which may be either positive or negative ( and of course vanishes for the current - free case @xmath9 ) . \n the inner value @xmath32 may be normalized with the uniform vertical field , i.e. @xmath33 for a profile with @xmath34 we have @xmath35 for the normalized current helicity of the background field . \n the sign of @xmath36 determines the sign of the current helicity . as usual , the toroidal field amplitude is measured by the hartmann number @xmath37 and the global rotation by the reynolds number @xmath38 with @xmath39 . \n the alfvn frequency is @xmath40 . \n the boundary conditions associated with the perturbation equations are no - slip for the flows and perfectly conducting for the fields . for all computations \n it is @xmath41 .    for purely toroidal fields \n the expected net helicities vanish as two nonaxisymmetric modes with @xmath13 exist with identical excitation conditions and the same amount of helicity but of opposite sign ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) .     the normalized negative kinetic helicity and the negative current helicity for the nonaxisymmetric perturbations as functions of @xmath36 . \n @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45.,width=302 ]    we now compute both the helicities for helical fields with various pitch values @xmath36 which is inverse to the current helicity of the large - scale field . the astrophysically relevant case is @xmath46 ( which is not the classical realization of the tayler instability ) . \n the instability only exists for nonrigid rotation so that we always work with a rotation law @xmath47 . \n the radial profile of the toroidal field has been modelled by the above mentioned most simple profile with almost uniform toroidal field . \n figure [ fig2 ] gives the results ( in units of @xmath48 ) . \n both the kinetic helicity @xmath17 as well as the current helicity @xmath49 are negative . \n they are decreasing functions of @xmath36 . \n we have also calculated the @xmath0-effect via the determination of the electromotive force @xmath50 by the fluctuations . according to the rule that the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is anti - correlated with the ( kinetic ) helicity we expect the azimuthal @xmath0-effect as positive for @xmath51 . \n this is indeed the case ( see fig . \n [ fig3 ] , left ) . \n one finds positive and negative signs in the container but the positive values dominate so that in the average the azimuthal @xmath0-effect is indeed positive . \n on the other hand , for negative @xmath36 we expect positive small -

{"ContextTokens": 2386, "GeneratedTokens": 247, "SynthesizedBody": "the rayleigh - bnard convection problem is one of the fundamental problems in the physics of fluids . \n the basic phenomena of the rayleigh - bnard convection in horizontally extended systems are widely known . \n the influence of the side walls , although not studied as throughly as the horizontally extended case , is of practical importance for engineering applications .    in this paper \n we study the rayleigh - bnard convection in a 2-d rectangular domain with no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity . \n this problem is also closely related to the problem of infinite channel with rectangular cross - section which has been studied by davies - jones @xcite , luijkx \n platten @xcite and kato \n fujimura @xcite among others . \n the linear aspects of the problem we consider in this paper have been studied by lee \n boyd @xcite , mizushima @xcite and gelfgat @xcite . in these papers , the critical rayleigh number and the structure of the critical eigenmodes \n have been studied for small aspect ratio containers .    from dynamical transition and pattern formation point of view , ma and wang @xcite proved that under some general boundary conditions , the problem always undergoes a dynamic transition to an attractor @xmath4 as the rayleigh number @xmath5 crosses the first critical rayleigh number @xmath0 . \n they also proved that the bifurcated attractor , homological to @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the number of critical eigenmodes .    in the 2-d setting that we consider , \n @xmath2 is either 1 or 2 and the latter case can only happen at the critical length scales where two modes with wave numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 become critical simultaneously . \n when @xmath9 , the structure of @xmath4 is trivial which is merely a disjoint union of two attracting steady states . \n thus our task in this paper is to classify the structure of the attractor when @xmath3 . \n this has been studied recently in @xcite for the 3d rayleigh - bnard problem where the boundaries were assumed to be free - slip for the velocity and the wave numbers of the critical modes were assumed to be equal . \n the main mathematical challenge in this paper is due to the no - slip boundary conditions since the separation of variables for the linear eigenvalue problem which works in the free - slip case is not possible anymore . to overcome this difficulty , \n the main approach for our study is to combine rigorous analysis and numerical computation using spectral method . \n as we know , spectral methods have long been used to address the hydrodynamic instability problems . \n in fact , in his seminal work @xcite , orszag studied the classical orr - sommerfeld linear instability problem using a chebyshev - tau method . in this paper , to treat the linear eigenvalue problem , we employ a legendre - galerkin method where compact combinations of legendre polynomials , called generalized jacobi polynomials , satisfying all the boundary conditions are used as trial functions . \n the main advantage of our legendre - galerkin method is that the resulting matrices are sparse which allows a very efficient and accurate solution of the linearized problem ; see also hill \n straughan @xcite and gheorghiu  dragomirescu @xcite . \n once the eigenpairs of the linear problem are identified , the transition analysis is carried out by reducing the infinite dimensional system to the center manifold in the first two critical eigendirections . \n the coefficients of this reduced system are calculated numerically . \n our main results are described below . \n we first classify the eigenmodes into four classes according to their parities using the symmetry of the problem . \n then we numerically show that the first two unstable modes are always parity class one or two \n . then we study the transition near the critical length scales where two eigenvalues become positive simultaneously . \n next , we rigorously prove that the local attractor at small supercritical rayleigh numbers is in fact homeomorphic to the circle which has four or eight steady states with half of them as stable points and the rest as saddle points \n . the critical eigenmodes are always bifurcated steady states on the attractor and when the attractor has eight steady states , the mixed modes which are superpositions of the critical eigenmodes are also bifurcated . \n second , let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the two largest eigenvalues of the linearized problem . we find that a small neighborhood of @xmath10 = @xmath12 in the @xmath10@xmath11 plane can be separated into several sectors with different asymptotical structures . in particular , we find that there is a critical prandtl number @xmath13 for the first two critical length scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that for @xmath16 , there is a sector in this plane for which mixed modes are stable fixed points of the attractor . for @xmath17 , \n the mixed modes are never stable and instead there is a sector in this plane in which both of the critical eigenmodes coexist as stable steady states . in this case , the initial conditions determine which one of these eigenmodes will be realized . \n the critical prandtl number is around @xmath18 for the first critical length scale @xmath14 and around @xmath19 for the second critical length scale @xmath15 . for higher critical length scales we found that mixed modes are never stable points of the attractor . \n third , recently ma \n wang has developed the dynamic transition theory to study transition and bifurcation problems in nonlinear sciences ; see @xcite . \n this paper is a first attempt to combine this theory with the numerical tools of the spectral methods to study the detailed structure of the transition and pattern formation . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the governing equations and the functional setting of the problem is discussed . in section 3 , \n linear eigenvalue problem is studied . \n section 4 states the main theorem . \n section 5 is devoted to the proof of the main theorem . in section 6 , \n we demonstrate a method to compute the coefficients of the reduced system . \n and the last section discusses the results obtained by our analysis . \n two dimensional thermal convection with no - slip , perfectly conducting boundaries can be modeled by the boussinesq equations . the governing equations on the rectangular domain @xmath20 read as @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the velocity field , @xmath23 is the temperature field and @xmath24 is the pressure field . \n these fields represent a perturbation around the motionless state with a linear temperature profile . \n the dimensionless numbers are the prandtl number pr and the rayleigh number r which is also the control parameter . \n @xmath25 represents the unit vector in the z - direction . \n the equations are supplemented with no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity and perfectly conducting boundary conditions for the temperature . \n @xmath26    for the functional setting , \n we define the relevant function spaces : @xmath27 for @xmath28 , let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be defined by @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the leray projection onto the divergence - free vectors . \n the equations  supplemented with initial conditions can be put into the following abstract ordinary differential equation : @xmath33    for results concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions of , we refer to foias , manley , and temam @xcite .    finally for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 \n we define the following trilinear forms . @xmath37 \n we first study the eigenvalue problem @xmath38 which reads as @xmath39 below we list some of the properties of this eigenvalue problem .    * \n the linear operator @xmath40 is symmetric . \n hence the eigenvalues @xmath41 are real and the eigenfunctions @xmath42 are orthogonal with respect to @xmath43inner product . \n moreover there is a sequence @xmath44 such that @xmath45 . \n @xmath46 is found by setting @xmath47 in . in this case \n the problem becomes an eigenvalue problem with @xmath48 as the eigenvalue . \n * we have @xmath49 which can be seen by computing the derivative of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath5 at @xmath50 . \n @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ith eigenfunction . also at @xmath50 , by the third equation in @xmath53 as @xmath54 . plugging these into and integrating by parts \n , we see that @xmath55 * we denote the critical rayleigh number @xmath56 . \n that is @xmath57 @xmath2 in does not depend on the prandtl number pr but only on @xmath58 . to see this , \n one makes the change of variable @xmath59 so that the solution of for the eigenvalue of @xmath47 is independent of pr . by simplicity of the first eigenvalue ( see theorem 3.7 in ma  wang @xcite ) , for almost every value of @xmath58 except a discrete set of values , @xmath2 in is 1 . \n the linear equations satisfy several discrete symmetries which may be found from the known non - trivial groups of continuous lie symmetries of the field equations ; see ( hydon@xcite , marques  lopez \n blackburn @xcite ) \n . however , for the problem we consider , it can be easily verified that the linear equations have reflection symmetries about the horizontal and vertical mid - planes of the domain . \n thus we can classify the solutions of the linear problem into four classes with different parities which are as defined in table  [ tab : parity ] where , for example , @xmath63 means that @xmath64 is odd in the @xmath65-direction and even in the @xmath66-direction .                      y.  kato and k.  fujimura , _ prediction of pattern selection due to an interaction between longitudinal rolls and transverse modes in a flow through a rectangular channel heated from below _ \n , physical review e * 62 * ( 2000 ) , no .  1 , 601 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3130560548159, "RequestID": "03b4891151b44f9a85769be2829b4421", "TotalTokens": 2633}

{"ContextTokens": 3478, "GeneratedTokens": 224, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last ten years the existence of supermassive black holes in the central part of an increasing number of galaxies has become a stronger and stronger evidence . in order to understand the formation process and the evolution of those black holes , it is important to relate them to the properties of the host galaxy . \n it was shown that the existence of a central smbh affects the dynamics not only in the core of the host galaxy but even in a region far from the hole . \n several relationships have been recently proposed between the mass of a central smbh and the velocity dispersion @xcite , the bulge luminosity or mass @xcite or the dark matter halo @xcite , of the corresponding galaxy . among them , the relationship with the smallest scatter is @xmath4 where @xmath5 . \n the different values of @xmath6 , found by several authors using different samples and different fitting methods , are well discussed in the paper of tremaine et al . \n @xcite that obtain @xmath7 where ( and also afterwards in the rest of our paper ) @xmath8 is expressed in solar masses , @xmath9 in @xmath10 and logarithms are base 10 . \n from the theoretical point of view there are still different interpretations of these results @xcite and in order to give a contribution to this open debate , in a previous paper @xcite , we proposed to study a relationship between the kinetic energy of random motions of elliptical galaxies and the rest energy of their central supermassive black hole . \n we used a sample formed by the intersection between the set of galaxies studied by tremaine et al . @xcite and the kinematical data extracted by @xcite that refer to the effective semimajor axis of each galaxy @xmath11 ( related to the effective radius @xmath12 by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ellipticity ) . \n the model used to compute the kinematical parameters is very simple . \n busarello , longo and feoli @xcite assumed that an elliptical galaxy    1 .   has a spheroidal symmetry , 2 . \n follows the de vaucouleurs @xmath15 law , 3 . \n its rotation axis is perpendicular to the line of sight , 4 . \n its stars have a rotation velocity with cylindrical symmetry and 5 . \n its velocity dispersion tensor is isotropic and has spherical symmetry . \n the details of the procedure used to compute velocity dispersions , rotation velocities and the masses of the 13 elliptical galaxies included in the so called sample a ( see table 1 ) were fully explained in @xcite and summarized in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter afdm ) . \n our first results were very encouraging because we found , taking into account errors in both variables and using an iterative procedure due to orear @xcite : @xmath16 with ( see appendix for definitions ) @xmath17 and with a linear correlation coefficient @xmath18 . \n if the akritas and bershadi method @xcite is used , the slope of the relationship is even closer to unity : @xmath19 with @xmath20 . \n even better results can be obtained using a reduced sample ( hereafter sample b ) of galaxies if we eliminate the two ellipticals with the largest residuals n821 and n4697 . \n the relationships obtained applying the fitting procedure to the remaining 11 galaxies are listed in afdm . \n the satisfying results are the increase of the correlation coefficient , the decrease of @xmath21 , and a slope closer to unity .    in order to understand better the origin of this relationship \n , we have performed in this paper four new tests :    1 . \n we used the well known iterative procedure of fitexy routine ( we had never used before ) to analyze again the same samples a and b of the previous paper afdm in the case of errors in both variables ; 2 . \n the simplest hypothesis of a linear relationship was tested using the exact `` least - squares '' fitting method ; 3 . \n the kinematical data used in the previous paper were extracted by old sources so we have performed a check of the relationship using the data recently published by hring and rix @xcite . \n 4 .   in afdm \n we have considered only elliptical galaxies . in this paper \n we tested the robustness of the relationship , including in the statistical analysis also the lenticular and spiral galaxies of the sample published by hring and rix @xcite . \n there is another remarkable novelty contained in this paper . \n actually in afdm we found a very poor correlation between the mass of the galaxy and its velocity dispersion . on the contrary with the sample of hring and rix @xcite \n this relationship is stronger and we will show that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 then ( as we expected ) a relation @xmath24 is such that @xmath25 furthermore , using the new data , we will show that the equation ( 7 ) has a @xmath21 smaller than the relation ( 6 ) . \n .we list in column ( 1 ) the name of the galaxy , in column ( 2 ) the black hole masses taken from tremaine et al . \n the velocity dispersions ( column 3 ) and the rotation velocities ( column 4 ) are taken from busarello , feoli and longo @xcite , the masses in column ( 5 ) from curir et al.@xcite and the corresponding relative errors in column ( 6 ) from busarello and longo @xcite . \n the sources of the experimental data for each galaxy are listed in the above mentioned papers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results are listed in table 5 and we argue that for the sample b the hypothesis is certainly right , and for the samples a and @xmath26 it can be acceptable . only the samples @xmath27 and c have a too high @xmath21 . \n the linear fit of sample c is shown in fig . \n 1 with a dashed line and involves @xmath28 . \n the fourth test for our relationship is the inclusion of lenticular and spiral galaxies in the statistical analysis . \n our sample d is now composed by all the 29 galaxies listed in table 2 . in fig . \n 3 we show with a dashed line the best fit ( 11 ) for the 18 ellipticals ( denoted with boxes ) , with the dot - dashed line the best fit for the remaining 11 galaxies ( denoted with circles ) : @xmath29 and with a solid line the best fit for the whole sample d @xmath30 we argue that the contribution of lenticular and spiral galaxies increases the slope that becomes closer to unity . \n from the first samples of data ( a and b ) we were induced in a previous paper @xcite to consider a relationship between the masses of smbhs and the kinetic energy of random motions in elliptical galaxies . this suggestion \n is now confirmed first by reanalyzing the old data using the fitexy routine and then comparing the results with the corresponding fit of a new set of kinematical data extracted from the paper of hring and rix @xcite . in the light of fig . \n 3 we show that the relationship works well also for lenticular and spiral galaxies . \n the remarkable result is that the relationship we proposed ( 7 ) , has now a smaller scatter with respect to the old equation ( 6 ) and the @xmath8 vs @xmath31 law . \n furthermore we have shown that , using the new data , all these relationships can be strictly connected because ( unlike afdm ) the mass of the galaxy strongly depends on the velocity dispersion : the linear correlation coefficient of this relationship ( 8) is very high and the @xmath21 very low . \n finally our result ( 14 ) with @xmath32 is surprisingly smaller than the ones expected of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    for the sample \n a and b , given the assumptions of the model of busarello , longo and feoli @xcite , it is clear that triaxiality , anisotropy of the velocity field , inclination , deviations from the @xmath15 law , are all sources of possible errors that could affect the derived kinematical parameters . for the remaining samples we must consider that the masses are not computed with the same method and \n often refer to a bulge region that ends to @xmath35 . at the same time \n all the velocity dispersions are no longer averaged until the effective semimajor axis of each galaxy . \n so the nonhomogeneity of the measurements and the differences in the part of the galaxy that each single measure now considers , can affect also the results obtained with the new set of data . \n of course a rigorous analysis will be possible only when the observational uncertainties in all quantities are reduced and the sample is further extended . \n however , though with the caution due to all these possible error sources , the study of the relationship we propose between the rest energy of a smbh and the kinetic energy of random motions of the host galaxy appears to be very useful for a more complete understanding of the formation and evolution of smbh not only in elliptical galaxies . \n we are grateful to gaetano scarpetta , antonio donofrio and nicola de cesare for useful comments and franco caprio for helpful suggestions about computer programs . the research was partially supported by far fund of the university of sannio . \n l. ferrarese and d. merritt , _ astrophysical journal _ * 539 * , l9 ( 2000 ) . \n k. gebhardt et al . \n , _ astrophysical journal letter _ * 539 * , 13 ( 2000 ) . \n s. tremaine et al . \n , _ astrophysical journal _ * 574 * , 740 ( 2002 ) . \n j. kormendy and d. richstone _ annual review of astronomy and astrophysics_*33 * , 581 ( 1995 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 1491, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "the problem of extracting scientific parameters from dirty ( dominated by artifacts ) interferometric radio images has resulted in many deconvolution algorithms being developed . however \n , none of these solve the problem of incorporating instrumental errors as a source of uncertainty when making measurements from radio data . \n deconvolution algorithms can only produce one image , which the scientist must then assume is correct before extracting any science ( for example , a catalogue of source fluxes ) from it . \n algorithms such as clean ( @xcite ) , the most popular algorithm in use , can not reliably produce any uncertainties ( @xcite ) , making it impossible to propagate the uncertainties from instrumental errors to the scientific parameters . \n further , if these parameters are correlated , as they likely are , even correcting the data for instrumental errors may lead to biased scientific results , as the measurement of the instrumental error may be wrong . these instrumental effects will become more important as more sensitive telescopes such as the square kilometre array come online . \n we propose in @xcite , a completely different approach , whereby we model the sky and all known sources of instrumental error simultaneously using the radio interferometry measurement equation ( rime ) ( @xcite ) . \n the rime can be written as ( @xcite ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the visibility matrix ( the radio data ) , @xmath2 is the @xmath3th jones matrix for antenna @xmath4 ( containing instrumental effects ) and @xmath5 is the brightness matrix ( containing the sky model , and hence all scientific parameters ) . \n we use the software package meqtrees ( @xcite ) , which implements the rime , to model our radio field and any known instrumental effects . we can then estimate the parameters of this model , both scientific and instrumental , in a bayesian context using a sampling method such as mcmc ( @xcite ) . \n we assume uncorrelated gaussian noise on the visibilities which leads to a simple gaussian likelihood for @xmath6 . with this approach , \n we are able to determine the full posterior for the problem , obtaining not only the best fits for all parameters , but also their uncertainties and correlations . \n figure [ fig : field ] shows the mock wsrt field which we tested biro on . \n this field , simulated using meqtrees and based on a real field , consists of 17 point sources . \n we also applied pointing errors to each antenna as an example of a source of instrumental error , which wsrt ( and many other radio telescopes ) have had to deal with in the past ( @xcite ) . \n a mispointed antenna will observe a point source through the edge rather than the centre of its beam . \n thus , in general , we would expect pointing errors and fluxes to be correlated and we apply our method to determine these correlations , as well as the parameters themselves . \n the instrumental parameters for this simulated data consist of the pointing errors , the width of the primary beam and the noise on the visibilities , which we assume to be gaussian , as is widely considered a good approximation . \n we allow the pointing errors to vary in time as second ordr polynomial functions , resulting in 84 pointing error parameters , 3 parameters for each direction for each antenna . \n our scientific parameters include the flux for each source , and the shape parameters of the extended gaussian source . \n we compared biro with the standard , commonly used clean algorithm combined with a source extraction algorithm on the cleaned image ( we call this clean+se ) for this dataset . \n figure [ fig : compare ] illustrates this comparison for the estimated fluxes from biro and clean+se . with no knowledge of the pointing errors , it is no surprise that clean+se returns biased fluxes and fails to find several sources . \n the danger is that the error bars , estimated using only the surrounding flux of the point source in this source extraction algorithm , do not and can not take into account the additional source of uncertainty from the instrumental errors . \n in contrast , the biro estimates are unbiased and the error bars are larger , correctly propagating the instrumental errors , and determining the correlations between parameters ( figure [ fig : covmat ] ) .    , due to the strong correlations between pointing error and flux . ] \n -plane , while the pointing errors are correlated simply because every pointing error affects every source . of particular interest is the complex way in which pointing errors correlate with the fluxes , which would be very difficult to determine from first principles.,scaledwidth=55.0% ] \n we have introduced biro , a bayesian approach to the deconvolution problem of radio interferometry observations . \n figure [ fig : covmat ] highlights the importance of fully propagating the uncertainty on instrumental errors , as they can be highly correlated with the scientific parameters and hence bias scientific results . due to the fully bayesian nature of biro \n , it allows for very elegant extensions to this simple scenario . \n for example , the choice of model for the field can be selected for using the bayesian evidence ( see @xcite ) . \n biro can be useful in any scenario where reliable statistics are required for the science extracted and may be essential to fully exploit the sensitivity of the ska . \n 1974 , _ a&as _ \n , 15 , 417    2013 , _ \n arxiv:1311.5282 _    2015

peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) . of \n the well observed pne about one third can be fitted reasonably well by 1d static chemically homogeneous photoionization models , but two thirds show temperature variations that are substantially larger than those predicted by simple photoionization models . in this paper \n we review further evidence in favor of the presence of large temperature variations in pne . \n we discuss possible causes for these variations and their effect on the determination of chemical abundances of pne . \n we discuss the proper procedure to obtain accurate abundances for chemically homogeneous and for chemically inhomogeneous pne . \n peimbert ( 1967 , 1971 ) found that the determinations of @xmath1([o  iii ] ) , the temperatures based on the @xmath2 ratio , are considerably larger than the determinations of @xmath1(balmer ) , the temperatures based on the intensity ratio of the balmer continuum to a balmer recombination line ; he interpreted this result as being due to the presence of temperature variations over the observed volume . to study this problem , peimbert defined the mean square temperature variation , @xmath0 ; typical simple photoionization models yield @xmath0 values in the 0.003 - 0.015 range . \n peimbert and collaborators , also developed equations to derive the abundances for chemically homogeneous nebulae with @xmath3 ( peimbert 1967 ; peimbert & costero 1969 , ruiz et al . \n 2003 , peimbert et al . \n the large differences between @xmath1([o  iii ] ) and @xmath1(balmer ) have been confirmed by several authors for a large number of pne ( e.g. liu & danziger 1993 ; zhang , liu , & wesson 2004 ) . \n peimbert , storey , & torres - peimbert ( 1993 ) based on the computations by storey ( 1994 ) were the first to obtain larger o@xmath4/h@xmath5 values from oxygen recombination lines than from collisionally excited lines under the assumptions of @xmath0 = 0.000 and of chemical homogeneity . \n most pne show this difference which has been usually called the abundance discrepancy factor defined by : adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) = ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath6 / ( o@xmath4/h@xmath5)@xmath7 , ( e. g. liu 2006 , and references therein ) . \n the adf(o@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) value is larger than predicted by simple photoionization models for about two thirds of the well observed pne . \n a similar abundance difference for c@xmath4/h@xmath5 has been obtained by peimbert , torres - peimbert , & luridiana ( 1995a ) based manly on the line intensities compilation by rola & stasiska ( 1994 ) . \n peimbert et al . \n ( 1995a ) compared the c@xmath4/h@xmath5 abundances derived from the c  ii @xmath8 4267 recombination line with those derived from the c@xmath4 @xmath9 1906 , 1909 collisionally excited lines . again \n about one third of the adf(c@xmath4/h@xmath5 ) of the well observed pne might be explained by simple photoionization models but two thirds present values too large to be reproduced by these models . \n zhang et al . \n ( 2005 ) have obtained large @xmath1([o  iii ] ) @xmath10 @xmath1(he  i ) differences for 48 pne that con not be explained by simple photoionization models . in section 4.2 we discuss their results . \n torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) presented seven mechanisms as possible sources of temperature variations , in what follows we will mention additional results in favor of some of these mechanisms .    _ \n deposition of mechanical energy : _ the central stars of pne inject mechanical energy into the expanding shells by means of stellar winds , bipolar flows , multipolar flows , and asymmetrical ejections , these processes produce shocks , turbulence , and an increase of the expansion velocity of the shell with time . \n these processes are more important for some objects than for others and might be responsible for the spread in the observed @xmath0 values . \n guerrero et al . \n ( 2005 ) and guerrero , chu , & gruendl ( 2006 ) found that the following pne are strong x - ray emitters : bd+30@xmath11  3639 , ngc  40 , ngc  2392 , ngc  3242 , ngc  6543 , ngc  7009 , and ngc  7027 , they also argue that this emission is due to shocks produced by fast winds or bipolar flows . \n rowlands , houck , & herter ( 1994 ) derived @xmath1([ne v ] ) @xmath12 50,000 k for ngc  6302 and ngc  6537 , they also computed photoionization models and were not able to produce temperatures higher than 20,000  k and reached the conclusion that these temperatures were indicative of shock heating . \n peimbert et al . \n ( 1995a ) found that the following pne with large velocity dispersions also show large temperature variations : ngc  2392 , ngc  2371 -

temperature regions relative to simple photoionization predictions ; while shadowed regions , the decrease of the local ionizing flux , and the presence of metal - rich inclusions will produce localized low - temperatures regions relative to simple photoionization predictions . \n abundances correspond to those derived from recombination lines , if forbidden lines are used a @xmath0 different from 0.000 has to be adopted . in what follows we present evidence in favor of chemical homogeneity for most pne .    from chemical evolution models of the galaxy \n it has been found that in the solar vicinity about half of the c enrichment of the ism is due to low and intermediate mass stars that end their lives as white dwarfs , and the rest is due to sn of type  ii ( e. g. carigi et al . \n moreover according to other models most of the c enrichment is due to low and intermediate mass stars ( e. g. matteucci 2006 ) . \n carigi ( 2003 ) has shown that the c / h values derived from c  ii recombination lines are in agreement with these models , while the c / h values derived from the 1906 and 1909 collisionally excited lines , under the assumption of @xmath1([o  iii ] ) and @xmath14 , imply lower c yields than those needed by the galactic chemical evolution models . \n .stellar and nebular abundances for ngc 6543 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath1([o  iii ] ) , @xmath1(he  i)@xmath15 peimbert et al.(1995b ) ; @xmath1(balmer ) zhang et al . \n ( 2004 ) ; @xmath1(he  i)@xmath16 zhang et al.(2005 ) ; a ) 3889,4471,7065 ; b ) 3889,4471,10830 ; c ) 6678,7281 ; d ) 4471,5876,6678 . \n we consider that our knowledge on the density and temperature distributions and on the chemical composition of pne will increase considerably from the study of the four following problems . \n the @xmath17(o  ii ) values derived from the o  ii lines of multiplet 1 , like those presented in table 3 , need to be determined again based on the atomic physics computations by bastin & storey ( 2006 ) . \n objects with small he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 fractions and with most of their o in the o@xmath4 ionization stage will be particularly useful , those objects of this group with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(o  ii ) @xmath20 @xmath17(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous . \n the idea that there are high density he@xmath5 regions embedded in low density h rich material might be tested by deriving @xmath1(he  i ) , @xmath17(he  i ) , and @xmath21(3889 ) based on accurate measurements of at least 10 different he  i lines in relatively low density pne without substantial he@xmath18 and he@xmath4 regions . those objects with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath19(balmer ) will be chemically homogeneous , while those with @xmath17(he  i ) @xmath22(balmer ) will be chemically inhomogeneous . \n there are at least seven possible mechanisms as sources of temperature variations . from the theoretical side , it is important to model the signature of each process on the temperature and density distributions . while , from the observational side , the combination of 3d kinematical models with high spectral resolution data , like those presented by barlow et al . \n ( 2006 ) , might permit to derive temperature and density distributions and consequently to single out the main mechanism responsible for the temperature variations in a given object . \n finally accurate h , he , c , and o abundances of h -

system p - nuclide abundance distribution , \n they however suffer from some shortcomings . \n one of them concerns their persistent underproduction of the light mo ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and ru ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) p - isotopes . \n some have tried to remedy this situation with exotic solutions , calling in particular for accreting neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. schatz et al . 1998 ) . \n the level of the contribution of such sites to the solar system content of the nuclides of concern here is quite impossible to assess in any reliable way . \n in contrast , it has been emphasized many times over the last decade that the problem might just be due to some misrepresentation of the production in the he - burning core of massive stars of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process ( e.g. arnould et al . \n 1998 ) . \n the aim of this letter is to scrutinize the latter , ` non - exotic ' , solution in a quantitative way by duly taking into account the uncertainties that still affect the rate of the @xmath1 reaction , as they appear in the nacre compilation of reaction rates ( angulo et al . \n clearly , these uncertainties in the key neutron producer in conditions obtained during central he burning in massive stars have a direct impact on the predicted abundances of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , as already analyzed quantitatively by meynet & arnould ( 1993 ) . another potential embarassment of the p - process predictions identified by rahpn is a snii overproduction of oxygen relative to the p - nuclides . we show that this problem might be cured along with the one of the underproduction of the light mo and ru isotopes if the @xmath1 rate is modified adequately within a range permitted by the nacre compilation . for the sake of illustration \n , we just discuss here the case of a 25 m@xmath6 solar metallicity ( @xmath7 ) star . \n a more complete study dealing in particular with a set of stars with different masses and metallicities , and analyzing the impact of the uncertainties in the rates of a variety of reactions , is currently under way . \n the adopted input physics is briefly described in sect . 2 , and some results are presented in sect . \n conclusions are drawn in sect . \n the calculations reported here are based on a model for a @xmath8 8 m@xmath6 helium star already considered by rahpn . \n it corresponds to a main sequence mass of about 25 m@xmath6 and is evolved from the beginning of core helium burning to the supernova explosion . \n details about this model can be found in hashimoto ( 1995 ) , and are summarized in rahpn . as in rahpn , \n 20 o / ne - rich layers with explosion temperatures peaking in the ( 1.8 - 3.3)@xmath9 k range are selected as the p - process layers ( ppls ) . \n their total mass is approximately 0.58  m@xmath6 . \n the deepest ppl is located at a mass of about 1.94  m@xmath6 , which is far enough from the mass cut for all the nuclides produced in this region to be ejected during the explosion . \n the p - process reaction network and its numerical solver are described by rahpn . \n a series of their selected nuclear reaction rates are updated , however . in particular , the nacre ` adopted ' rates are used for charged particle captures by nuclei up to @xmath10 . for heavier targets , \n the rates predicted by the hauser - feshbach code most ( goriely 1997 ) are used , except for the experimentally - based neutron capture rates provided by beer et al . \n ( 1992 ) .    as already pointed out in sect . 1 \n , we turn our special attention to the impact of the uncertainties remaining in the rate of @xmath1 . for temperatures of about @xmath11 k at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) , \n the nacre upper limit on this rate is 50 - 500 times larger than the ` adopted ' value ( see angulo et al . \n 1999 for details ) . in order to quantify the consequences of this situation for the predicted abundance distribution of the s - nuclide seeds for the p - process , and ultimately for the p - nuclide yields themselves \n , we perform nucleosynthesis calculations for five different rates ranging from the nacre adopted value to its upper limit . \n these rates , labelled r@xmath12 ( @xmath13=1 to 5 ) in the following , are defined and displayed in fig .  1 . \n cross section ( j.w . \n hammer & m. jaeger , private communication ) . \n rate estimates based on these new data are not available yet . \n it seems , however , that the revised upper limit might range somewhere between r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 they are used in the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star referred to above to calculate the abundances of the s - process nuclides at the end of core he burning . \n the results are shown in fig .  2 for the s - only nuclides . \n use of r@xmath17 leads to the classical ` weak ' s - process component pattern ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) , exhibiting a decrease of the overproduction ( with respect to solar ) of the s - nuclides by a factor ranging from @xmath18100 to about unity when the mass number @xmath19 increases from about 70 to 100 . in the heavier mass range , \n the s - process ` main component ' supposed to originate from low- or intermediate - mass stars takes over . \n this ` canonical ' picture changes gradually with an increase of the @xmath1 rate , more @xmath20 having time to burn , releasing more neutrons , before he exhaustion in the core . \n the direct result of this is a steady increase of the overproduction of heavier and heavier s - nuclides . \n for example , with the extreme r@xmath21 rate , the overproduction factor increases from @xmath22 to @xmath23 for @xmath19 varying from about 70 to 90 , before decreasing to a value around unity for @xmath24 only .    at first sight \n , it might be felt that the s - process abundance distributions obtained with large enough r@xmath12 values exhibit some unwanted or embarrassing features . \n one of these concerns the underproduction of the @xmath25 s - nuclides relative to the @xmath26 ones . \n another one relates to the fact that a more or less substantial production of heavy s - nuclides ( like in the ba region ) would screw up the pattern of the s - process main component ascribed to lower - mass stars . in our opinion \n , none of these predictions can really act as a deterrent to @xmath1 rates substantially in excess of r@xmath17 . on the one hand , \n the absence of ab initio self - consistent calculations of the s - process in low- and intermediate mass stars does not allow at this time to predict the exact shape of the main s - process component which is classically assigned to these stars . as a consequence , a contribution to the main component by massive stars can not be excluded , even if it may disturb some traditional views on the subject . on the other hand , \n the reduction of the light s - process nuclide production by massive stars could well be compensated by their increased synthesis by some low- or intermediate - mass stars when rates larger than r@xmath17 are considered ( goriely & mowlavi 2000 ) . \n the classical @xmath27 overproduction problem found in the massive star s - process ( e.g. rayet & hashimoto 2000 ) could also be eased with increased @xmath1 rates , as demonstrated by fig .  2 . \n for these same rates , note that @xmath27 is not overproduced either in some of the calculations of goriely & mowlavi ( 2000 ) which predict high yields of the other light s - nuclides . \n figure  2 also suggests that a discrepancy , if any , between the observed ba overabundance in the sn1987a ejecta and the model predictions could be cured in a natural way by increasing the adopted @xmath1 rate . \n the [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratio is observationally still quite uncertain , values between about 5 and 20 having been reported ( e.g. mazzali & chugai 1995 ) . \n prantzos et al . ( 1988 ) have calculated lower values of 2.6 to 4.7 with the @xmath1 rate of fowler et al . \n this rate is on average comparable to r@xmath17 in the temperature range of relevance to the s - process . \n we have not conducted any new s - process calculation in a specific sn1987a progenitor model . instead , some rough estimates based on the procedure of prantzos et al . \n ( 1988 ) in which their adopted s - process ba mass fraction is replaced by the one calculated for the model star adopted here have been made . \n assuming that the lmc metallicity is one third of the solar one , we predict [ ba / fe]@xmath28/[ba / fe]@xmath29 ratios from 3 to 14 for rates increasing from r@xmath17 to r@xmath30 . \n theory could thus account for quite substantial sn1987a ba productions with high enough @xmath1 rates ( compatible with the nacre data ) . \n as discussed by rahpn , it is a fair approximation to adopt the s - process abundance distributions of fig .  2 as seeds for the p - process . \n for the @xmath31 species , the initial abundances in the ppls are taken from the detailed stellar models . \n although these models have been obtained with rates that may differ from the nacre ones adopted here , this inconsistency is certainly not responsible for any intolerable distorsion in the predicted s - process seeds or p - process yields . \n the various seed abundances of fig .  2 are used to compute the production of the p - nuclides in the ppls of the @xmath8 25 m@xmath16 star considered here . as in rahpn \n , the abundance of a p - nuclide @xmath13 is characterized by its mean overproduction factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is its solar mass fraction ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass fraction of isotope @xmath13 at the mass coordinate @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the total mass of the ppls , the sum running over all the ppls ( @xmath38 corresponds to the bottom layer ) . \n an overproduction factor averaged over all 35 p - nuclei is calculated as @xmath39 , and is a measure of the global p - nuclide enrichment in the ppls . \n so , if the computed p - nuclei abundance distribution were exactly solar , the normalized mean overproduction factor @xmath40 would be equal to unity for all @xmath13 . \n figure 3 shows the normalised p - nuclide overproduction factors derived from the seed abundance distributions calculated with the @xmath1 rates r@xmath17 , r@xmath41 and r@xmath21 . \n changes in the shape of the p - nuclide abundance distribution are clearly noticeable , at least for @xmath42 . \n the use of r@xmath17 leads to a more or less substantial underproduction of not only @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , a ` classical ' result in p - process studies ( see rahpn ) , but also of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which was not predicted in previous calculations . \n this new feature directly relates to the larger abundances around @xmath45 used by rahpn ( dashed curve in fig . \n 2 ) , in contrast to the much flatter seed distribution obtained with r@xmath17 . \n this kr - sr - mo - ru trough is gradually reduced , and in fact essentially disappears , for @xmath1 rates of the order or in excess of r@xmath41 . \n this situation is most clearly illustrated by fig . \n 4 . in these very same conditions , \n @xmath40 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 comes much closer to unity as well . \n it has to be noticed that this situation does not result from a stronger production of these two nuclides by the p - process , but instead from their increased initial abundances associated with a more efficient s - process when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 . \n in contrast , the @xmath40 pattern does not depend on the adopted @xmath1 rate for @xmath48 . \n this is expected from a mere inspection of the s - nuclide seed distributions displayed in fig .  2 . \n in particular , @xmath49 and @xmath50 remain underproduced . \n this can not be considered as an embarassment as these two nuclides can emerge from the s - process in low- or intermediate - mass stars . \n in addition , the overall efficiency of the p - nuclide production substantially increases with increasing @xmath20 burning rates . \n more specifically , @xmath51 is multiplied by a factor of about 15 when going from r@xmath17 to r@xmath21 . \n this could largely ease , and even solve , the problem of the relative underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen identified by rahpn . \n for their considered 25 m@xmath6 model star calculated with the @xmath52 rate from caughlan et al . \n ( 1985 ) , they obtain @xmath53 and report a value of 4.4 for the ratio of the oxygen to p - process yields . \n this value would come close to unity for @xmath1 rates in the vicinity of r@xmath41-r@xmath14 , as the p - nuclides would be about 3 to 6 times more produced than in rahpn . \n this letter makes plausible that the long - standing puzzle of the underproduction with respect to solar of the p - isotopes of mo and ru in snii explosions could be quite naturally solved by just assuming an increase of the @xmath1 rate over its ` nominal ' value . \n more specifically , this could be achieved by multiplying the nacre ` adopted ' rate by factors of about 10 to 50 in the temperature range at which the s - process typically develops during core he burning in massive stars . \n these factors are well within the uncertainties reported by nacre . as an important bonus , \n this increased rate would also largely avoid ( i ) the underproduction of @xmath43 and of @xmath44 which we predict here for the first time to be concomitant to the light mo and ru one , ( ii ) the too low production of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and ( iii ) the overall underproduction of the p - nuclides with respect to oxygen noted by rahpn . in direct relation with an increased @xmath1 rate , more s - process ba \n could also be ejected by snii events . \n our predictions confortably overlap the range of ba overabundances reported for sn1987 . \n this array of pleasing features has of course not to be viewed as a proof of the validity of the assumption that the true @xmath1 rate is higher than usually thought . \n it may just be a hint that there might be ways around exotic solutions . \n this conclusion applies at least if one relies on the simplistic ( and the only ones to be available for our purpose ) supernova models used here and in previous p - process calculations ( see rahpn et references therein ) , as well as in a myriad of other explosive nucleosynthesis calculations .", "StartTimeOffset": 3200681381257, "RequestID": "e9a2b0fb2077438db1b0d4151ddb163e", "TotalTokens": 4052}

[ fig : fig1](a ) , we study a fabry - prot ( fp ) cavity with an oscillating mirror at one end , acting as a quantum - mechanical harmonic oscillator . the cavity is driven by a laser field with frequency @xmath0 . \n we first study an ideal case , without considering the losses of both the cavity field and the oscillating mirror . \n the total hamiltonian @xmath1contains three parts as    @xmath2    the cavity field with frequency @xmath3 is described by bosonic operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the symbols @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denote , respectively , the mass , frequency , displacement , and momentum of the oscillating mirror ( hereafter , we just call it the mirror \" ) . \n the coupling strength @xmath10 between the cavity field and the driving laser field is related to the input laser power @xmath11 and the decay rate @xmath12 of the cavity field via the relation @xmath13 . \n the interaction constant @xmath14 between the cavity field and the mirror stems from a very small change @xmath8 of the fp cavity length @xmath15 .     around their equilibrium positions.,width=307 ]    usually , the characteristic frequency of the cavity field is about  @xmath16 hz , which is much higher than the nanomechanical resonator frequency  @xmath17 hz achieved by current experiments . \n the cavity field would have _ no _ nonlinear effect under the bo approximation when there is no driving field ; nonlinear effects appear when a classical driving field is applied to the cavity . \n let us consider the case when the driving field frequency @xmath18 is close to the cavity field frequency @xmath3 . \n we also use the rotating frame of referencedefined by a unitary transformation @xmath19 , which is very similar to the nmr experiments used to demonstrate the berry phase  @xcite . in the rotating frame of reference , the effective form @xmath20 of the hamiltonian @xmath21 in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) reads    @xmath22    with the effective hamiltonians @xmath23and @xmath24here , the detuning @xmath25 is the effective frequency of the cavity field in the new frame . \n clearly , @xmath26 can be controlled by tuning the frequency @xmath27 of the driving field . \n therefore , the effective frequency @xmath26 of the cavity field can be tuned to be much smaller than that of the mechanical resonator . under such condition , \n the mechanical resonator can be treated as the fast variable and the bo approximation can be employed . \n we first study the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) of the fast variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the mirror ( in the rotating frame ) by taking the slow variables  @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the cavity field as constants ( in the rotating frame ) . \n then the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28where the creation operator @xmath29 of the cavity field is defined by @xmath30with @xmath31 . \n ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) shows that the mirror variables are shifted by the amount @xmath32 due to its interaction with the cavity field . \n it is clear that the ground state of the effective hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) can be obtained via the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath33 in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 2 - 1 ] ) for a harmonic oscillator with displacement operator @xmath34the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the mirror , corresponding to the hamiltonian  ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) , are , respectively , @xmath35and @xmath36eqs . \n ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) show that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are functions of the slow variables of the cavity field . \n ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) also shows that the ground state of the fast variables ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the mirror is a coherent state @xmath39 , resulting from radiation pressure .    according to the lowest - order generalized bo approximation \n , the total eigenfunction @xmath40 of the coupled system of the cavity field and the mirror can be factorized as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 satisfies the schrdinger equation with the effective hamiltonian @xmath43the bo adiabatic separation provides an effective potential @xmath44 for the slow  motion of the cavity field . \n this potential contains a typical @xmath45where the parameter @xmath46plays the role of _ the phenomenological third - order susceptibility _ as in usual kerr media . \n versus normalized detuning @xmath47 for the value @xmath48 . \n analytical results for the full hamiltonian are shown with a red dashed curve , while the bo approximation results are shown with a blue solid curve . \n note that squeezing occurs when @xmath49 , and the baseline @xmath50 is shown with a horizontal black dot - dashed line.,width=307 ]    we now verify the validity of the generalized bo approximation applied to the optomechanical system through the squeezing effect , which is induced by the kerr interaction . \n this squeezing effect can be demonstrated by the output intensity spectrum @xmath51 . following the definition of the @xmath51 in ref . \n @xcite and the linearization technique of the langevin equations governed by the hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 11 ] ) , we obtain the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation @xmath52where    @xmath53    with renormalized detuning @xmath54 and the steady - state value @xmath55 of the amplitude of the cavity field . here , the cavity loss @xmath12 has been taken into account . \n the bo approximation requires that the photons in the cavity can survive a sufficiently long time , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath56    if there is no kerr interaction induced by the radiation pressure ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 can be simplified to @xmath59 . \n when the kerr interaction is induced ( @xmath60 ) , the intensity spectrum can be less than @xmath61 , which displays a squeezing effect  @xcite of the cavity field . \n here , @xmath62 plays an important role in the reduction of the output intensity fluctuation . \n hence , the squeezing effect could be observed experimentally by measuring the intensity spectrum of the output laser \n .    fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] shows the squeezing of the cavity field in the intensity spectrum with a blue solid curve , where the maximum squeezing occurs in the vicinity of @xmath63 . \n we consider that the oscillating mirror has mass @xmath64 ng , frequency @xmath65 , and a normalized damping rate @xmath66 . \n [ fig : fig2 ] is plotted for the driving field frequency @xmath67 thz , the optical cavity length @xmath68 m , finesse @xmath69 , and decay rate @xmath70 s@xmath71 ; a driving laser wavelength @xmath72 nm , normalized frequency @xmath73 and power @xmath74 @xmath75 . \n the temperature @xmath76 of the cavity field and the mechanical resonator is assumed to be zero , as in ref . \n @xcite . then at a particular frequency @xmath77 ( chosen at the position where @xmath58 is minimum ) , the intensity spectrum has the squeezing effect shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] . \n now , we also study the intensity spectrum without the bo approximation . \n starting from the total hamiltonian in eq . \n ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , a full derivation shows that the intensity spectrum has a similar form as in eqs . \n ( 15 ) except that the renormalized detuning @xmath78 and the kerr interaction strength @xmath79 are replaced , respectively , by @xmath80 and @xmath81 here , @xmath82 is the steady - state value of the oscillation amplitude of the mirror and    @xmath83    is the mechanical susceptibility of the oscillating mirror . the maximum squeezing effect in the intensity spectrum , plotted by the red dashed curve in fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] , \n can also be observed in the vicinity of @xmath84 . \n we use the same parameters for calculating the intensity spectrum under the bo approximation . \n therefore , the bo approximation is valid when the frequency of the oscillating mirror @xmath85 is much larger than the frequency of the light field @xmath86    the effect of the bo approximation can also be understood via @xmath87 . \n if the mirror frequency @xmath7 is much larger than the detuning @xmath88 of the cavity field in the rotating frame of reference , @xmath89 plays an important role in the vicinity of @xmath90 . \n when the bo approximation is valid under the condition @xmath91 , and when the macroscopic displacement @xmath92 is extremely small , the mechanical susceptibility is approximately equal to @xmath93@xmath94 which leads the intensity spectrum to have the same form as in eq . \n ( 3 - 1 ) . \n within the bo approximation , the cavity field inside the flexible fabry - prot cavity , driven by an input laser , exhibits a kerr - like nonlinear property . \n it is not difficult to generate a two - mode induced kerr interaction , which is useful for quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements  @xcite .    as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1](b ) , we consider two fp cavities , referred to below as the left and the right cavities with subindexes @xmath15 and @xmath95 , sharing one common oscillating mirror . this mirror is assumed to oscillate with a very small displacement @xmath8 around its equilibrium position . \n thus two cavity fields , with frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the laboratory reference frame , indirectly interact with each other via this oscillating mirror .    in the rotating frame of reference , using the bo approximation discussed above , we can derive the induced effective interaction between the two cavity fields @xmath98where the @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 denote the photon number operator of the left and the right cavity fields . to perform a qnd measurement , the self - modulation term @xmath102 of the probe field \n can be ignored  @xcite . \n therefore , the system hamiltonian for the qnd measurement can be written as @xmath103where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the detunings of the left and right cavity fields , relevant to the frequency @xmath0 of the driving field . \n the kerr interaction in eq . \n ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) satisfies the qnd measurement conditions  @xcite . \n since this two - mode kerr interaction commutes with the free hamiltonians of both cavities , we can nondestructively measure the photon number by observing the other cavity s conjugate observable . \n we have studied the kerr nonlinearity in the vacuum induced by the radiation pressure in typical optomechanical systems . \n such nonlinear interaction can be explicitly obtained via a bo approximation for an ideal case . through a squeezing effect , which should be experimentally observable via the intensity spectrum \n , we verify the validity of the generalized bo approximation by taking into account the dissipation and fluctuation of the cavity field . \n furthermore , we propose a two - mode kerr interaction between two cavity fields for quantum nondemolition measurements , which can be realized by using two cavities sharing one oscillating mirror . \n it is possible to nondestructively measure a cavity photon number by observing another cavity s conjugate observable . \n we are grateful to dr . \n lan zhou for helpful discussions . \n sun was supported by the nsfc with grant nos.90503003 , nfrpc with grant nos . \n 2006cb921205 and 2005cb724508 . \n fn was supported in part by the nsa , lps , aro , and nsf grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 3224137040471, "RequestID": "ff27d21ce0204bb7a2ae3cdb5bcf3bb6", "TotalTokens": 3633}
{"ContextTokens": 3226, "GeneratedTokens": 129, "SynthesizedBody": "the question of measuring of the spatial non - commutativity effects , in physical processes , is under intensive interest . \n non - commutative qed ( ncqed ) seems to be a straightforward method to examine such effects . for this purpose \n , one needs a precise experimental data such as positronium hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) among the other processes . \n the basic difference between ncqed and qed is the existence of new interactions ( 3-photon and 4-photon vertices ) which complicate the calculations in ncqed . \n although the feynman rules of this theory are given in @xcite , to apply these rules to bound state , one needs special treatments like bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite or non - relativistic qed ( nrqed)@xcite . in our preceding letter @xcite , using bs equation , we have shown that up to the order @xmath4 no spin - dependent correction owing to the spatial non - commutativity appears in the positronium spectrum \n . therefore one should calculate the higher order corrections . in this letter \n we calculate the corrections to the positronium by using nrqed method . in section 2 , we introduce nrqed - vertices in the nc - space . \n consequently , in section 3 , we use the modified nrqed to determine hfs at the lowest order . in this section , we show that our calculations at the leading order lead to the corrections at the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the parameter of non - commutativity . at the end , we summarize our results . \n nrqed is an effective field theory which simplifies the bound state calculation . to apply this technique in non - commutative space one should modify the nrqed vertices by performing @xmath5 expansion on ncqed scattering amplitude . in doing so \n , one obtains an effective theory of non - relativistic particles which permits the direct application of well tested techniques based on schrdinger s equation . \n now , comparing ncqed scattering amplitudes with nrqed can completely determine the matching coefficients . \n some of the vertices with their appropriate matching coefficients , are shown in fig . \n 1 . they contribute to the tree level matching to get the leading order bound state energy shift . \n one should note that these coefficients apart from a phase factor are very similar to the standard nrqed @xcite . \n this similarity is owing to the fact that the scattering amplitude of @xmath6 in ncqed is independent of the parameter of non - commutativity of space @xcite . \n the other vertices which are not shown in fig . 1 and have not counterpart in the standard nrqed , due to the existence of the three and four photon vertices have contributions to higher order corrections to energy shift . \n now , by using the first graph of fig . 1 and expanding the vertices up to order @xmath1 , one can easily verify the results of refs.@xcite at the order @xmath7 as @xmath8 such an energy shift is spin - independent and therefore has not any contribution to hfs . \n by using the modified nrqed we can determine the diagrams which contribute to the lowest order of hfs ( fig . \n 2 ) .    we can now calculate each diagram separately as follows : @xmath9 with @xmath10_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{e({\\bf \n p}'+{\\bf p})}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the parameter of the non - commutativity is given as @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is shown that @xmath14 leads to some problems with the unitarity of field theory and the concept of causality @xcite , therefore in our calculations we consider @xmath15 . + after some algebra eq.([p1 ] ) yields @xmath16\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\alpha}{2m_e^2}\\left<\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l } } { r^3}\\right>-\\frac{3\\alpha } { m_e^2}\\int d^3 r ( \\theta .{\\bf l } \\psi^*)\\frac{{\\bf s}_1.{\\bf l}}{r^5}{\\psi}+o(\\alpha^7),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the third equality we used @xmath19 \n one should note that the first term in eq.([p4 ] ) is the usual term in nrqed which is of the order @xmath20 . \n but the second term which is appeared in eq.([p4 ] ) , owing to the spatial non - commutativity is of the order @xmath0 . \n nonexistence of the terms at the order of @xmath4 which carry @xmath1-dependence is a remarkable result which happens in all diagrams of hfs . \n indeed this fact is due to appearance of @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 in all energy - correction expressions . \n therefore , to obtain the energy corrections for hfs at the order @xmath23 one should once calculate the corrections up to the lowest order of nrqed ( i.e. fig . \n 2 ) . in the other words , the @xmath24-corrections in nrqed calculations of commutative space lead to the higher order of @xmath25 in non - commutative space . \n + now we work out the figs . \n 2(b - f ) as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28_i \\frac{-1}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\delta_{ij}-\\frac{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_i({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')_j}{({\\bf p}-{\\bf p}')^2}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{-ie({\\bf p}'-{\\bf p})\\times{\\bf{\\sigma_2}}}{2m_e}e^{i p\\wedge p'}\\right]_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which results in @xmath29\\frac{1}{4\\pi r}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( \\ldots)+\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3r\\psi({\\bf r})\\tilde\\gamma_e\\psi^*({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 means the usual part of the energy shift and @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . the final diagram ( fig . \n 2f ) has not any contribution at the order of our interest . for @xmath33 \n one can easily find @xmath34\\ell\\psi({\\bf r})\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_a+\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_b&=&\\frac{1}{2}(\\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_c+ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_d)\\nonumber\\\\ \\triangle e^{\\hbox{nc}}_e&=&\\frac{3e^2}{16\\pi m_e^2}\\int d^3 r \\psi({\\bf r})\\overline{\\gamma}\\psi^*({\\bf r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 the superscript nc in eq . \n ( [ p11 ] ) means the non - commutative part of the energy shift and three lines in the eq.([p12 ] ) are related to @xmath36 , respectively . \n meanwhile for the spin zero state ( @xmath37 ) , all contributions to the energy shift are zero . \n + the average of @xmath38 over the triplet is zero , which means the spin - spin interaction part carries no correction in average and therefore the hyperfine splitting due to the non - commutativity becomes @xmath39\\ell\\psi_{nlm}({\\bf r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the wave function of the positronium in the commutative space with the coulomb potential and we have defined @xmath41 . \n if the @xmath42-axis is chosen parallel to the vector @xmath43 , the above result simplifies into @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the compton wave length of the electron and @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 one should note that the divergence of @xmath48 at @xmath49 is owing to singularity of @xmath50 at @xmath51 , the region where @xmath1-expansion is not well - defined . \n actually , it is shown that @xmath1-expanded ncqed is not renormalizable @xcite . \n the @xmath1 expansion imply a cut - off @xmath52 while the validity of nrqed requires @xmath53 . \n since @xmath54 , the appropriate cut - off is @xmath55 . \n therefore the energy shift for @xmath2 , @xmath49 can be obtained as @xmath56\\alpha^6.\\ ] ]    the above result should be added to the values of hfs derived in nrqed at the order @xmath23 . \n the reported uncertainties on the experimental values of @xmath3 are about @xmath57 mhz @xcite , that give an upper bound @xmath58 . therefore determining the value of @xmath59 \n requires more accurate experiments . \n using nrqed method in the non - commutative space , we have obtained that there is not any correction at the order @xmath4 for the hfs of positronium , the order @xmath4 corrections are spin independent . \n the correction to the energy shift is started at the order @xmath23 , eqs . \n ( [ p13]-[p14 ] ) , and it depends on @xmath60 and @xmath61 quantum numbers . therefore it dosent have any contribution to the @xmath62 ( in the spectroscopic notation @xmath63 ) , while for @xmath64 there is @xmath65 different shifts . \n consequently , a closer look at the spacing between @xmath2 triplet excited levels ( @xmath3 ) , which has already been measured [ 14 - 17 ] can provide an experimental test on the non - commutativity of space . + * acknowledgement * + s.m.z . \n gratefully acknowledges research funding from shiraz university and ipm . \n the research of m.h . and \n f.l . was supported by isfahan university of technology ( iut ) and ipm . \n 99 m. hayakawa , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3869, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum entanglement ( qe ) is the central feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes a quantum system from its classical counterpart . \n it is also the corner stone on which many of the novel applications of quantum mechanics -to quantum computation , quantum information theory , quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation - are based . \n indeed , it is this promise that has led to a renewal of interest in qe in recent years . \n the simplest example of qe is afforded by a bipartite system of two spin half ( or pseudo spin half ) particles , where the hilbert space has the minimal dimension four . \n this system is also called a two qubit system ( 2qs ) in the context of quantum computations . for a 2qs , \n there is essentially only one measure of entanglement ;

the set \\{@xmath15 } does not _ necessarily _ form a basis - much less an orthonormal set . \n @xmath13 , which measures this eof is then defined as follows :    the concurrence for a mixed 2qs is given by @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the eigenvalues , arranged in decreasing order of magnitude , of the operator + @xmath18    the so called eof is itself given by    the entanglement of formation is given by + @xmath19    the above definitions are attractive , and have been used to estimate bipartite entanglement in spin systems @xcite . \n there are also reports that states with nonvanishing @xmath13 have been prepared experimentally @xcite . \n attempts have been made to generalise the definition to higher spin sectors @xcite . \n there is , thus , quite an interest in @xmath13 . \n the definition of @xmath13 , rather involved in its form , crucially hinges on the concept of eof . \n however , it is well known that there is no way of inferring how a system is prepared @xcite , no matter which property of the density matrix we look at , unless it corresponds to a pure state . \n thus the physical interpretation of eof is rather dubious , and does not seem to have any operational significance . indeed \n , suppose the expansion of @xmath20 in eq.1 is replaced by a more general decomposition @xmath21 p_{\\{\\alpha_i\\ } } \\vert \\psi(\\{\\alpha_i \\})><\\psi(\\{\\alpha_i\\ } ) \\vert$ ] , where the states are now labelled by a set of continuous parameters @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] being an appropriate integration measure . \n the parameters could be taken to be the coordinates of the associated compact phase space , for instance . \n the probabilities @xmath24 have as much physical significance as the discrete variables @xmath25 in eq.1 . \n but the new expansion would change the criterion for eof , leading to a different expression for concurrence .    with this critique of @xmath13 in mind \n , we propose an alternative definition of concurrence ( hereafter called @xmath26 ) , with a two fold aim : to attain conceptual and computational simplicity . \n @xmath26 is required merely to capture the entanglement of a 2qs which is a subsystem of a larger nqs , in a manner that suggests a generalisation to higher spin sectors . \n we take this up in the next section . \n as a warm up , and for motivation , consider a 2qs first . let a 2qs be in the state @xmath27 the key step in defining concurrence is in recognising that @xmath28 is a measure of entanglement , equivalent to the standard measures listed above . \n @xmath29 is much simpler to evaluate , though . \n our notion of concurrence is inspired by , and is very close in its definition to , @xmath29 . \n although @xmath29 does _ not _ carry any new information , it does exhibit a symplectic structure which is not apparent in the other two measures . \n further , as observed by hill and wootters @xcite , it can also be written in the form @xmath30 , the inner product of @xmath31 with its conjugate ( equivalently , time reversed ) state which we define thus : @xmath32 the main thrust of the paper is that this form of entanglement for a 2qs needs _ little _ modification in defining concurrence in nqs , @xmath10 . \n the definition will be given in steps , so as not to have a cluttered notation .        which is obtained by a partial conjugation  on the sector ( 12 ) . \n the definition of concurrences @xmath36 and @xmath37 follow similarly . by definition @xmath38 take values in the range \n @xmath39 $ ] . \n @xmath40 also has an in built symplectic structure ; to see this , consider the quadruplet of vectors @xmath41 the expansion is in the ordered basis @xmath42 . \n the concurrence is now simply written as @xmath43 which naturally generalises the definition of entanglement in a 2qs in a manner appropriate to our purpose @xcite . \n @xmath44 is the transpose of @xmath45 . \n one can straight away construct quadruplets for @xmath46 by inspection . \n it is also straight forward to generalise the definition when the parent state is an nqs in a pure state . \n we write the expression for the @xmath47 sector :      the computational simplicity of @xmath26 is evident , from its very form , if only we demonstrate its viability . \n a convenient method is to use @xmath13 as a benchmark to test the new definition against . \n for , the definition of @xmath13 is also motivated by the entanglement measure @xmath29 . \n figure 1 . gives a comparison of the two definitions , where the states are generated randomly . \n one sees an overall agreement so long as @xmath13 remains positve , without having to impose the minimality condition by hand . in those regions where @xmath13 has to be declared as vanishing ( when @xmath51 ) in _ definition 1 _ , @xmath26 differs from @xmath13 : indeed \n , these states are distinguishable , in the sense that each of them has a preferential proximity to one of the bell states which is more clear in fig.2 . \n the computational advantage is of course evident from the form of @xmath26 . for , \n if we start with a nqs , there are @xmath12 such concurrences . even in regions where @xmath13 has no interpretational problem , _ definition 1 _ requires an evaluation of three reduced density matrices , a determination of their partner states , and an evaluation of the eigenvalues of @xmath52 . \n the necessity of these computations gets obviated in the determination of @xmath26 . \n we proceed to enlarge the definition of concurrence to higher spin sectors . \n note that there is no analogue of @xmath13 here , since the criterion for eof which was evolved in @xcite is specific to a 2qs . \n the generalisation in our case is naturally suggested by the form for @xmath26 written above . \n indeed , let @xmath53 be the state in which an nqs is . \n we define the conjugate state @xmath54      the above definition is unfortunately restrictive ; it works only when the subsystem of the nqs is bosonic ; the fermionic states ( @xmath55 odd ) are always orthogonal to their conjugates . \n apart from this , there is generality with respect to the choice of the @xmath55 qubits since any @xmath55 qubits may be chosen to be in the order given , by a permutation . \n the number of independent concurrence measures is given by @xmath57 . \n figure 3 displays the 4q concurrences for states generated from a 6qs . as an illustration , and as an example of the discerning capability of the higher order concurrences which we have defined here , \n the shor code will be compared with the steane code , both of which are used in quantum error correction @xcite . \n the shor code @xmath58 is a nine qubit state , written as a direct product of three 3q states each of which have the form @xmath59 , in writing which we have employed the qubit notation : @xmath60 . this entangled state has vanishing concurrences in _ all _ orders . \n in contrast , the steane code , constructed with seven qubits has a more involved structure ; it is not seperable the way the shor state is . , and is given by @xmath61 . as a manifestation , although all the 2q concurrences vanish , the 4q concurrences survive in the sectors @xmath62 , and all of them attain the maximum allowed value 1 . \n the 6q concurrences vanish . \n these features highlight quantitatively the manner in which the two codes differ from each other . at this point \n , it is good to remember that a complete separability in the strong sense , where the multiqubit state is a direct product of single qubit states , necessarily implies a vanishing concurrence of all orders . \n the converse is not necessarily true , as exemplified by the state generating the shor code . \n finally , the question of handling mixed states still remain . \n not getting into the general case , only the 2q concurrence will be discussed . \n the general case only involves rewriting the argument with more indices . \n indeed , given a 2qs in a mixed state @xmath20 , the method is to look upon @xmath20 as having descended from a pure parent state of a higher dimension @xmath5 . \n significantly , @xmath63 . \n the determination of parent state is done by simple inspection . \n it also follows that if @xmath20 has only real components , then @xmath64 it is not difficult to check that although the parent state is not unique , the concurrence determined will be so - reflecting the fact that it is a property of the system , and not of the parent - introduced purely as an intermediate step . \n this final remark completes the programme undertaken .    in conclusion , \n we have redefined in this note the concept of concurrence which has a much simpler form , and is computationally trivial - compared to @xmath13 and its generalisations thereof . \n it is not based on the notion of eof . \n while concurrences do not completely characterise a system - which was not our aim - it appears that they do constitute an important subset of entangled states , especially in the two qubit sector . \n the higher order concurrences also have a significance , as illustrated by the concurrence properties of shor and the steane codes . \n the true import of entanglements of this kind would manifest with only a more geometric approach , which will be taken up in a subsequent publication . \n jian - wei pan _ \n et al _ phys . \n lett . * 86 * , 4435 ( 2001 ) . \n e. g. _ , n. meyer and n. r. wallach j. math . \n phys * 43 * , 4273(2002 ) and references therein ;

{"ContextTokens": 3659, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "space - based coronagraphs have observed thousands of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) since their discovery in the early 1970s . \n the observations show that hundreds of cmes can attain speeds of 1000 km / sec or more within a few r@xmath0 which exceed the local alfvn speed at those heights . \n hence , fast cmes can drive shocks which are detected sometimes in the radio wavelengths as drifting type - ii bursts @xcite . \n such indirect observations , however , provide only limited information about the shock ; namely , the driver speed and , the onset and duration of the radio emission .    fortunately , direct imaging and spectroscopic measurements of the density compression at the shock front have been made possible in the last ten years thanks to the lasco coronagraphs and uvcs spectrometer , both instruments aboard the solar heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) . as we will explain , the combination of white light and uv observations can provide the full range of physical parameters ( density , temperature , magnetic field ) across the shock in addition to spatial information about the shock shape and its relation to the driving cme . \n now , the physics of coronal shocks can be studied in detail . \n the off - limb spectroscopy and coronagraphy are , and will be , our only means for studying shocks where they can accelerate particles with the highest energies ( @xmath1 r@xmath0 ) . \n even the forthcoming _ solar probe plus _ mission will only reach to 9.5 r@xmath0 . \n ( @xmath2 ) on 03/07 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) on 06/07 , respectively . \n several streamers are clearly deflected by the shock . \n some examples are denoted with dfl. for the june 6 cme , the driver can not be readily distinguished from the deflected streamers . ] \n because we have reviewed many aspects of coronagraphic imaging of cme shocks in a recent volume of this conference series @xcite , we present here only a brief overview of the progress made over the last two years . the early work on shock detection @xcite has motivated an ever expanding number of detections of cme - driven shocks @xcite . \n these works are based mostly on observations by the secchi instruments which have higher sensitivites than the lasco coronagraphs . \n the white light shocks can now be routinely detected in the inner corona , \n @xmath4 r@xmath0 @xcite , and can be followed out to at least 0.5 au @xcite . \n the secchi and radio observations show that shocks tend to form at 1.5 r@xmath0 and can accelerate electrons out to 4 @xmath5 @xcite . \n the standoff distance between the shock and the driver appears to be 1 - 2 r@xmath0 within the coronagraph field of view @xcite . \n clear white light shock signatures were rare during 2007 - 2010 due to the prolonged activity minimum but there have been several fast events since february 2011 . \n we present two recent examples in figs .  [ \n fig : secchi]-[fig : shock ] . \n the three viewpoints afforded by the secchi and lasco telescopes easily reveal the global reach of cme - driven shocks in the middle corona . \n measurements of the shock longitudinal extent allow us to localize with better precision the injection of solar energetic particles ( seps ) along magnetic field lines @xcite and connect it to the cme source region @xcite . \n shocks can be identified in uv spectra by means of heating , density compression and high speeds associated with them . the first spectral detection of a cme driven shock was made by uvcs in 2000 @xcite . \n the authors measured enhancements in the o@xmath6 and si@xmath7 that were consistent with an mhd shock . \n more than a dozen of shocks have been identified since @xcite . \n a review of plasma physical parameters derived by uvcs across shocks is given in table  [ tab : a ] . \n the plasma heating and compression across the shock lead typically to strong brightening of the si@xmath7 ( si  xii @xmath8521 ) line , brightening or dimming of the o@xmath6 ( o  vi @xmath91032 - 1037 ) lines and dimming of the h  i ly@xmath10 @xmath81216 line . \n these differences are related to the different physical processes involved in the atomic excitations , because coronal ions are mainly excited by both collisions with electrons ( collisional excitation ) and/or by resonant scattering of photons emitted from the underlying layers of the solar atmosphere ( radiative excitation ) ; the latter process is also related to the doppler dimming effect ( see * ? ? ? \n 1032 - 1037 intensities observed during the transit of the cme - driven shock . \n top right : line profile broadenings observed at the shock transit ( average over the spatial region shown in the middle panel by the two solid white lines ; * ? ? ? \n bottom : same as top panels , but for the may 7 , 2004 event @xcite . ] \n the most evident signature of a shock in euv spectra is a broadening of the o  vi @xmath91032 - 1037 line profiles in close correspondence to the shock transit , as derived from shock speeds either measured in the lasco coronagraph images or derived from the frequency slope of accompanying type - ii radio bursts ( fig . \n [ fig : uvcsshock ] ) . \n spectral signatures of the shocks have been detected from about 1.7 r@xmath0 up to 4.3 r@xmath0 ( table  [ tab : a ] ) . \n the observed broadening is usually reproduced with superposition of a narrower component due to emissison from coronal plasma located along the line of sight ( los ) , and a broader component due to the shock emission ( e.g. , fig . \n [ fig : uvcsshock ] bottom right panel ) . \n the latter is often red- or blue - doppler shifted by up to 0.4  with respect to the coronal emission because of the los component of shock velocity , resulting in asymmetric observed profiles ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and fig . \n [ fig : uvcsshock ] , top right panel ) . \n fwhms of broad components typically correspond to post - shock o@xmath6 kinetic temperatures @xmath11k . \n .cme - driven shock parameters derived from uvcs data [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     there is a high degree of complementarity between the coronagraphic ( spatial distribution , speed of driver and shock ) and spectroscopic measurements ( pre- and post - shock plasma parameters ) . indeed , combined analyses of lasco and uvcs observations can obtain the full range of plasma parameters upstream and downstream of the shock , including the magnetic field in both regimes . \n the mhd rankine - hugoniot jump relations for an oblique shock provide not only the post - shock plasma parameters , but also the pre- and post - shock magnetic field strength when the pre - shock coronal plasma parameters , with the exception of the magnetic field , can be determined by spectroscopic measurements ( i.e. , electron density and temperature , pre - shock and shock velocity ) and the density compression ratio across the shock is determined by coronagraphic measurements . \n such results derived by @xcite are summarized in table [ tab : b ] . \n interestingly , the magnetic and kinetic energy density increases are nearly equal ( as expected for equipartition of energy ) , and are both more than two times larger than the thermal energy increase . \n this trailblazing study demonstrates the power behing off - limb spectroscopic observations when combined with coronagraphic cme images . \n in the short space of this article , we tried to demonstrate the ability of coronagraphic and spectroscopic instruments to remotely detect coronal shocks and measure their properties . despite a slow start during the 2000s , \n shocks are now detected and analyzed with increasing frequency . \n coronagraphs , especially the simultaneous observations from secchi and lasco , are capable of deriving the 3d structure of the shock , its standoff distance from the driver , its speed and even the density compression ratio across the shock boundary . \n but they do not measure magnetic field or temperature conditions . \n hence , coronagraphs can not directly discriminate between a shock or a fast mode wave since the observed density compression could be the same . \n however , shocks can now be followed to at least 0.5 au and possibly to earth thanks to recent imag processing developments @xcite . \n more details can be found in @xcite . \n the spectroscopic observations have both advantages and disadvantages compared to the obsevations in the radio or in the visible . on one hand , \n the narrow slits provide only one - dimensional spatial information and the results are quite sensitive to the orientation of the slit relative to the shock front \n . measurements of very fast shocks may also be compromised due to the relatively long integrations for the uvcs spectra ( @xmath12 s ) . \n spectroscopic detection of coronal shocks occurs only by chance , because the field of view of the 40 \n long uvcs slit covers only a limited latitudinal region ( e.g. 75@xmath13 when the slit is positioned at 1.7 r@xmath0 ) . on the other hand , \n spectral measurements are the only means to study the heating of individual ion species and electrons in the collisionless coronal shocks . \n measurement of physical properties in cme - driven shocks and their correlations with sep events will be very useful in establishing the necessary conditions for shocks to accelerate ambient solar wind or suprathermal ions to seps . \n fortunately , off - limb spectroscopic capability will be offered by the forthcoming _ solar orbiter _ \n mission with the metis ( multi - element telescope for imaging and spectroscopy ; see * ? ? ? \n * ) instrument , that will acquire simultaneously off - limb spectra at three heights , thus helping us to disentangle spatial and temporal evolution of plasma parameters across shocks . \n part of this work was funded by various nasa grants . \n soho is an international collaboration between nasa and esa . \n lasco was constructed by a consortium of institutions : nrl ( washington , dc , usa ) , mps ( katlenburg- lindau , germany ) , lam ( marseille , france ) and univ.of birmingham ( birmingham , uk ) . \n the secchi data are produced by an international consortium of the nrl , lmsal and nasa gsfc ( usa ) , ral and univ . \n bham ( uk ) , mps ( germany ) , csl ( belgium ) , iota and ias ( france ) . \n e. antonucci , _ mem . \n s.a.it._ , * 82 * , 412419 ( 2011 ) a. bemporad , & s. mancuso , _ astroph . j. _ , \n * 720 * , 130143 ( 2010 ) a. ciaravella , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 621 * , 11211128 ( 2005 ) a. ciaravella , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 652 * , 774792 ( 2006 ) c. deforest et  al . , arxiv:1104.1615 ( 2011 ) n. gopalswamy , et  al . , _ j. geoph . \n _ , * 110 * , a9 , a09s15 ( 2005 ) n. gopalswamy , et  al . \n _ , * 259 * , 227254 ( 2009 ) n. gopalswamy & s. yashiro , _ astrophys . j. _ , * 736 * , l17 ( 2011 ) s.  w. kahler , et  al . \n , _ solar wind nine aip conf . \n _ , * 471 * , 685 - 688 ( 1999 ) k.  e. korreck , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 659 * , 773 - 779 ( 2007 ) l.  c. lee , et  al . \n , _ geophys . \n _ , * 13 * , 209 ( 1986 ) s. mancuso , s. , et  al . , _ astron . astrophys . _ , * 383 * , 267274 ( 2002 ) s. mancuso , & d. avetta , _ astroph . j. _ , * 677 * , 683691 ( 2008 ) s. mancuso , & a. bemporad , _ adv . \n _ , * 44 * , 451456 ( 2009 ) s. mancuso , _ sol . \n _ , * 96 * ( 2011 ) s.  a. maloney , & p.  t. gallagher , arxiv:1106.1593 ( 2011 ) g.  noci , _ astrophy . \n j _ , * 315 * , 706715 ( 1987 ) v.  ontiveros , & a.  vourlidas , _ astrophy . j _ , * 693 * , 267275 ( 2009 ) n .- e . \n raouafi , et  al . \n , _ astron . \n _ , * 424 * , 10391048 ( 2004 ) j.  c. raymond , et  al . _ \n . j. lett . \n _ , * 27 * , 14391442 ( 2000 ) a.  p. rouillard , et  al . \n _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 735 * , 718 ( 2011 ) m. temmer , et  al . \n _ , * 75 * ( 2011 ) a. thernisien , a. vourlidas , & r. a. howard , _ sol . \n phys._,*256 * , 111130 ( 2009 ) a.  vourlidas , et  al , _ astroph . j. _ , * 598 * , 13921402 ( 2003 ) a.  vourlidas , & v. ontiveros , `` a review of coronagraphic observations of shocks driven by coronal mass ejections '' , in _ shock waves in space and astrophysical environments _ , aip conference proceedings , * 1183 * , 2009 , pp . 139146", "StartTimeOffset": 3274811674341, "RequestID": "767742b720864e18a23e5dddbb011866", "TotalTokens": 3933}

qcd calculation based on the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite . \n in contrast to the more conventional phase space slicing method there is no need to introduce any unphysical parameter to cut the phase space in soft , respectively collinear regions . also \n all cancellations of infrared singularities occur before any numerical phase space integration is performed . \n thus we may present numerically very stable predictions . \n the differential cross section for process ( [ eqep ] ) reads as a convolution with the parton densities and fragmentation functions as @xmath12 where , as usual , the variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with respect to the partonic momenta and the bar quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with respect to the momenta of the hadrons ( with @xmath22 ) . \n the angle @xmath23 denotes the azimuthal angle between the planes defined on one hand by the directions of the leptons and on the other hand by the momenta of final state hadron and virtual vector boson in the centre - of - mass frame of vector boson and initial parton . \n the sum is over the different initial ( @xmath24 ) and final ( @xmath25 ) state partons and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the corresponding parton density respectively fragmentation function . \n the hard scattering process may be written as a contraction of a lepton tensor ( @xmath28 ) with a hadron tensor ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 if we consider the centre - of - mass system of virtual photon and initial parton , both unpolarized , there can not be any dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath23 . integrating out this angle dependence we find a decomposition into a transversal and a longitudinal part of the virtual photon : \n @xmath31 the computation of the correction to process ( [ eqep ] ) were carried out in the subtraction formalism  @xcite . \n the general idea of the subtraction formalism is to subtract from the real correction an artificial counterterm which has the same pointwise singular behaviour in @xmath32 dimensions as the real correction itself . \n thus the limit @xmath33 can be performed and the real phase space integral can be evaluated numerically . \n the artificial counterterm is constructed in a way that it also can be integrated over the one - parton subspace analytically leading to @xmath34  poles . adding these terms to the virtual part of the correction these poles cancel all singularities in the virtual part analytically and the remaining integration over the phase space \n can be carried out numerically . \n the advantage compared to phase space slicing methods is that all singularities cancel _ before _ any numerical integration is performed . \n also there is no need to introduce an unphysical cut parameter which in phase space slicing methods separates soft , respectively collinear phase space regions from the remaining hard region .    in our case of a convolution of a partonic cross section with distribution functions \n additional kinematic constraints have to be taken into account . \n the momenta of the partons which enter the convolution have to be kept fixed ( called _ identified _ partons ) . \n this leads to modified artificial counterterms . \n its analytical integration gives collinear singularities which cancel the singularities of the non - perturbative distribution functions yielding scheme and scale dependent convergent parts . \n the whole calculation was done with help of the algebra package form  @xcite . at @xmath11 \n the real correction is given by the squared matrix elements of the diagrams    1 . \n @xmath35 2 . \n @xmath36 3 . \n @xmath37 ,    where in turn each final state parton serves as an observed hadron . in process ( c ) \n we have to consider two flavours in the fermion traces . \n this yields 4 diagrams for every pair of different flavours in contrast to 8 diagrams in the case of one uniform flavour . \n care must be taken to adjust statistical factors properly . \n the artificial counterterm was constructed as described by the subtraction formalism . \n the phase space integral over the 3 particle final state can be performed yielding a finite real contribution . \n the virtual contribution of the correction , i.e. the interference term of the born matrix elements and the one - loop matrix elements are computed . here \n we encounter 2-point , 3-point , and 4-point tensor integral contributions which were reduced to scalar integrals via tensor reduction @xcite . \n the scalar integrals , containing ultraviolet and infrared singularities , were computed analytically in dimensional regularization . \n the analytic expressions were compared with the literature @xcite . \n the virtual contribution was renormalized in a mixed scheme , where the wave functions were renormalized on - shell and the strong coupling constant in the @xmath38  scheme , yielding an ultraviolet finite virtual contribution . \n the infrared singularities cancel exactly the contributions given by the integrated artificial counterterm in the subtraction formalism .    from the subtraction of remaining singularities into the parton densities and the fragmentation functions we obtain also finite remainders which depend on the factorization scheme and on the factorization scale . \n in this context we choose the @xmath38  scheme . \n thus we end up with three contributions , the real part , the virtual part , and the part related to identified partons . \n all these finite parts have to be integrated over the 2 respectively 3 particle final state phase space . to this purpose \n a c - routine was written to perform these integrations numerically . \n in the convolution ( [ eqconv ] ) we use the parton densities published by the cteq collaboration @xcite . \n herein the parton distribution set , called cteq5 m , where m denotes the @xmath38 scheme , matches our conditions with the assumption of 5 light quarks . \n we adopt the kkp fragmentation functions to our calculation @xcite . \n since these fragmentation functions are fitted to @xmath39 data with high accuracy and applied here to a dis process the comparison with experimental data will serve as a good check of universality . \n we use the value of the strong coupling constant at the @xmath40-scale as given by the particle data group  @xcite @xmath41 and evolve this value with the nlo evolution equation . in the lo approximation \n we evolve this value with the lo evolution equation for consistency reasons .    in fig . \n [ diffcross ] we show the differential cross section @xmath42 as a function of @xmath10 for fixed values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  gev@xmath47 , where @xmath10 is defined in the centre - of - mass frame of vector boson and initial parton . \n we set the renormalization scale ( @xmath48 ) equal to both the initial ( @xmath49 ) and the final ( @xmath50 ) fragmentation scales @xmath51 , where the initial scale is related to the parton densities and the final scale to the fragmentation functions . \n the steep fall of the cross section over several orders of magnitude makes it hard to resolve the nlo contribution ( full line ) in contrast to the lo prediction ( dashed line ) graphically . \n the lower part of the figure shows the ratio of the nlo correction over the lo result and displays more clearly the higher order effects . \n the correction changes from @xmath52  % for small @xmath10 to @xmath53  % for large @xmath10 . for @xmath54 \n gev we get an even larger correction due to collinear configurations .     for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev@xmath47 . \n the lower part shows the corresponding k - factor @xmath55 of the differential cross sections at nlo and lo.,width=302 ]    the theoretical uncertainty of the predictions of a fixed order calculation is mainly given by the renormalization and fragmentation scale dependence . \n the theoretical uncertainties due to the parton densities and fragmentation functions are not considered here . \n another source of uncertainty lies in the factorization theorem itself since it predicts correct results with an error of @xmath56 which may be become large for very low @xmath10 . \n we check the scale dependence of the cross section for the kinematics already depicted in context with fig . \n [ diffcross ] but with a fixed transversal hadron momentum of @xmath57  gev . in fig . \n [ scaledependence ] the differential cross section is shown where we vary the common scale @xmath58 over two orders of magnitude with respect to the reference scale @xmath59 . \n the scale dependence varies in this range about + 33  % ( + 27  % ) for very low scales to -20  % ( -18  % ) for rather high scales at lo ( nlo ) . \n thus there is only an unexpectedly slight scale dependence reduction at nlo compared to lo .    , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev@xmath47 and a fixed @xmath57  gev . \n the scale @xmath60 is varied with respect to the reference scale @xmath61  gev@xmath47.,width=302 ] \n the calculation of single hadron production in deep inelastic scattering to @xmath11 was presented . owing to the factorization theorem this calculation \n was performed as a convolution of the hard scattering process with universal and process independent parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n this allows for meaningful predictions , directly comparable to experimental data .    results were shown for specific kinematic values . \n a correction of the order of several percent is predicted depending on the transversal momentum of the observed hadron . \n the scale dependence of the correction gives slightly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to lo predictions . \n varying the renormalization and factorization scales over two orders of magnitude yield theoretical uncertainties of about @xmath62  % at nlo . \n an extensive study of nlo effects will be published elsewhere which in particular will include a detailed comparison of predictions with experimental data from the hera experiments h1 and zeus . \n just after finishing the calculation , a preprint appeared on nlo calculations of hadron production with non - vanishing transversal momentum @xcite . in this paper matrix elements \n were adopted from the disent program package and the phase space slicing method was applied to handle singularities . \n thanks to gustav  kramer and bernd  a.  kniehl for proposing this project and collaboration . \n we are very grateful to michael klasen and dominik stckinger for many helpful discussions on the calculation . \n we want to thank michael spira for his advises to apply the subtraction formalism in the rather involved case of _ identified _ partons . for comments on the manuscript \n we thank ingo schienbein . \n j.  c.  collins , d.  e.  soper and g.  sterman , adv . \n high energy phys .   * 5 * ( 1988 ) 1 . c.  adloff \n _ et al . _ \n [ h1 collaboration ] , phys . \n b * 462 * ( 1999 ) 440 m.  derrick _ et al . \n _ [ zeus collaboration ] , z.  phys . \n c * 70 * ( 1996 ) 1 a.  mendez , nucl . \n b * 145 * ( 1978 ) 199 . \n p.  bttner , `` inklusive meson -

{"ContextTokens": 3792, "GeneratedTokens": 83, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum entanglement is one of the most mysterious quantum phenomena and has become an indispensable resource for quantum communication and quantum computation . in the past few years \n , there has been much effort devoted to the study of continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum communication @xcite , of which the basis is the multi - partite entanglement . \n multi - partite cv entanglement is essential and necessary for measurement - based quantum computation and controlled quantum teleportation . \n it was predicted theretically and demonstrated experimentally that multi - color cv entanglement can be produced by nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , optical superlattice and second - order nonlinearity media @xcite . \n alternatively , cv entanglement can also be produced in coherent atomic systems , whose entangled beams have narrower linewidths and longer coherence times ; in particular , they can be used for free - space quantum teleportation @xcite , such as , from a satellite to a ground station . such entanglement using four - wave mixing ( fwm ) \n has been predicted by ref . \n all those results above endow us the feasibility and necessity to realize our scheme . based on those processes , we extend the scheme to generate six - partite cv entanglement by intracavity four - wave - mixing cascaded with double such generations in a four - level atomic system . \n and we theoretically demonstrate such possibility of multy - partite entanglement using third - order nonlinearity according to the inseparability criterion for multipartite cv entanglement proposed by van loock and furusawa . \n this paper is arranged as follows . \n the physical model and its hamiltonian are discussed in sec . \n iii gives the equations of motion of the system and sec . \n iv provides a linearized fluctuation analysis to calculate the measurable output fluctuation spectra . \n these output spectra are further discussed in sec . \n v and they demonstrate the violation of the optimized vlf criteria and some entanglement characteristics . at last , \n we draw some brief conclusions in sec . vi . \n we consider an ensemble of independent four - level atoms inside a resonant optical cavity . the proposed experimental setup for this scheme is shown in fig . 1(a ) . \n a vapor cell containing a four - level atomic system is placed inside a fabry perot cavity , using lasers whose frequency are @xmath0 and @xmath1 as pumps , where the virtual energy level diagram of three cascaded fwm effects are shown in fig . \n 1(b ) . those generated six beams are transmitted out through the coupling mirror 2 with partial tramittion coefficient , then being splitted by the prism . \n spatially separated beams can be measured using method as ref . \n @xcite to determine the entanglement relationship .    as shown in fig . \n 1 , the lower levels , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of the atoms are coupled to the excited level @xmath5 by two driving lasers of frequencies @xmath0 , @xmath1 . \n there are three fwm processes which are indicated in fig . \n 1(b ) , that @xmath6 and @xmath7 compose the first fwm process , where @xmath6 implies @xmath0 and @xmath1 stimulated from @xmath2 and @xmath3 to virtual levels , @xmath7 implies @xmath8 and @xmath9 falling from virtual levels to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively . \n similar are to @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n and we suppose all the virtual levels are detuned with @xmath5 .    in present scheme , \n we only concentrate on the entanglement characteristics among optical fields instead of these between atoms and optical fields . \n so the interaction hamiltonian of the three cascaded fwm processes could be written as @xmath14 + \\textup{h.c . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( i=1,2,3 ) are the dimensionless nonlinear coupling coefficients and are commonly taken to be a real number , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are corresponding to the light field generation and annihilation operators repectively .    considering the driving fields in the cavity , \n the hamiltonian for the pump beams is given by @xmath18 + \\textup{h.c . } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 ( i=1,2 ) is the classical pump and coupling laser amplitude . \n the loss of the @xmath20th mode @xcite in the cavity can be written as @xmath21 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 stand for the damping rates for the corresponding cavity modes which are related to the amplitude transmission coefficients . \n we now consider the full physical system , where the four -

state solutions . \n @xmath42    in order to simplify the calculation , the same damping rate and the same classical pumping laser amplitudes in the cavity are assumed ( i.e. , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . \n similarly , the same nonlinear coupling coefficient are assumed ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) . \n threshold can be obtained if @xmath48 . \n the values of the two threshold are expressed as following respecively , @xmath49    when @xmath50 , there is only one set of nonzero solutions for all six modes . if @xmath51 , there will be two sets of nonzero solutions for all six modes . \n when there exists a threshold the analytical expressions of stationary solutions for different values of the pump amplitude are    \\(i ) @xmath52 @xmath53    \\(ii ) @xmath54 @xmath55    \\(iii ) @xmath56 @xmath57    if @xmath58 , there is no threshold in this system . on this condition \n the signal and the idler modes will not be excited no matter how large the pump amplitude is . thus , \n when a threshold does not exist the analytical expressions of the stationary solutions are @xmath59    in the following , we decompose the system variables @xmath60 into their steady - state values @xmath61 and small fluctuations around the steady - state values @xmath62 as @xmath63 \n . then equation ( 5 ) can be linearized as @xmath64 where @xmath65^{t}$ ] ; m , the drift matrix , is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68    if the requirement that the real part of the eigenvalues stay positive is satisfied , the fluctuation equations will describe an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite for which the intracavity spectral correlation matrix is @xmath69    all the correlations required to study the measurable extracavity spectra are contained in this intracavity spectral matrix . \n the output fields can be obtained along with the standard input - output relations @xcite . in particular , the output fields spectral variances and covariances have the general form @xmath70 similar expressions can be derived for the @xmath71 quadratures . \n in order to investigate multipartite entanglement , and particularly show that the system under consideration demonstrates true six - partite entanglement , we define quadrature operators for each mode as @xmath72 such that @xmath73=2i$ ] . \n the conditions proposed by van loock and furusawa @xcite , which are a generalization of the conditions for bipartite entanglement , are sufficient to demonstrate multipartite entanglement .    using the quadrature definitions , \n the six - partite inequalities are @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the variance and @xmath76 are arbitrary real parameters used to optimize the violation of these inequalities . \n it is important to note that in the uncorrelated limit these optimized vlf criteria approach 4 . \n hence , without optimization , some entanglement which is presented may be missed .    from now on , we numerically calculate the values of vlf inequalities , and these are the quantities that can be measured in experiments . \n note that in our symmetrical situation , inequalities i2-p1 and s2-p2 are equal ; the same are to p1-s1 and i1-p2 . to simplify , we write the subscript s1-i1 as a , p1-s1 and i1-p2 as b , i2-p1 and s2-p2 as c separately .    when below the threshold or without threshold , the powers of the pump are much higher than others and the steady - state values of the other output beams are all equal to zero . \n therefore , the quantum characteristics of the pump and other beams in such situation are not considered .     with + @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . + here @xmath79 and @xmath54 . ]     with + @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . + here @xmath79 and @xmath54 . ]    in fig 2 , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in this case , @xmath83 so that the two supposed thresholds coincide to be one threshold . \n it is obvious that the minimal values of inequalities are all less than 4 in a wide range of analysis frequencies , which is sufficient to demonstrate that all the six beams are cv entangled with each other . in general , the smaller the value of the inequality , the stronger the degree of entanglement and quantum correlation is . for large frequencies \n the inequalities approaches 4 , which is the result of our optimization . in fig . \n 2 , we can also see that the value of @xmath84 is comparatively smaller than @xmath85 , which indicates that the degree of entanglement of second - class output is bigger . \n it is similar to those situations in the four wave mixing process .    in fig . \n 3 , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 with @xmath86 and the other parameters remain unchanged . again , the minima of the inequalities are less than 4 when above threshold , and it verifies that the all field modes are entangled .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ] \n however , we are unable to decide the real entanglement when @xmath56 because of the two possible stationary solutions . because the solution of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) usually depends on the initial value of variables . while the variables of ode here are set initially as gaussian states and randomly generated at each specific situation . \n it should be expected that all those variables will fall into one of the stationary solutions as the time approaches infinity , with a certain distribution of these two stationary solutions . \n therefore , we calculate the minimum of the inequalities beyond the larger threshold @xmath88 using each stationary solution separately .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]    in the following , we plot the minimum of the inequalities as a function of frequency normalized to @xmath80 using each stationary solution at different @xmath89 , with other parameters unchanged . \n we find an interesting result . as shown in fig . 4 and fig . \n 5 , when @xmath89 is a little bigger than @xmath88 , the stationary solution @xmath90 shows a relatively competitive result , just as results in fig . 2 and fig . \n 3 . the stationary solution @xmath87 does not work effective and the minimum value of @xmath91 is almost near 4 . \n it is because the output beams other than the pump is so lightly occupied if @xmath87 . \n in other words , @xmath61 ( i = s1,i1,s2,i2 ) is close to zero .    on the other hand , in fig . \n 6 and fig . 7 , the situation is reverse . for solution @xmath90 \n , it seems that , as the intensity of the pump power increases , the gain of other beams begins to saturate . \n usually , when the intensity of the pump beams is higher than those of others , their quantum characteristics tend to vanish and the degree of quantum entanglement will be small \n . however the solution @xmath87 is greater at this time , which seems to be more effective in a wide range of @xmath89 .     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]     with + the parameters unchanged as in fig . \n we use the + stationary solution with @xmath87 . ]    in fig . 8 and fig . \n 9 , we numerically search the minimum of @xmath92 in all frequencies , as a function of the pump power parameter @xmath89 , also with other parameters unchanged . in these figures \n , we can see clearly that the stationary solution @xmath90 is valid when @xmath89 is small just like the usual cases , see ref . \n @xcite . and \n solution @xmath87 is effective even @xmath89 is tens of times larger than @xmath88 . \n this directly confirms previous idea . \n we hope this can be considered as an effect of optical bistability . \n although we can not confirm the proportion of photons resulting in the stationary solution @xmath87 , it really enlarges the range of @xmath89 to be effective . \n we propose a scheme to produce bright six - partite cv entanglement in an optical cavity operating above threshold in a four - level atomic system , which has been theoretically demonstrated using both vlf criterion of multipartite cv entanglement and the input - output relations . \n this result is experimentally feasible and can have a larger range of pump power to produce an effective multi - partite entanglement ; it is much well - developed , compared with a basic system using the third - order nonlinearity media . \n moreover , the bright six - partite entangled beams could be separated spatially , with narrow linewidths after generation , which have significant use in quantum network and free - space teleportation . \n this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( grants no . \n 601102053 ) , and shanghai jiao tong university prp ( grants no . t030prp19035 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3314989562705, "RequestID": "17318319eba64fda8b03832aaada66c0", "TotalTokens": 3875}

called magnetars , is also suggested observationally @xcite . \n the surface magnetic field of magnetars can reach as large as @xmath9 gauss , which is determined through the measurements of the rotational period and spin down rate of soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars @xcite . according to the population statistics of soft gamma repeaters , \n even @xmath10 of the neutron stars produced via supernovae are expected to be magnetars @xcite . \n the origin of such a strong magnetic field of neutron star is still uncertain . \n maybe , a simple model is caused by fossil magnetic field of progenitor star . \n that is , a small magnetic field in progenitor star would be amplified during the gravitational collapse with conserving the magnetic flux , which produces the strong magnetic field of neutron star @xcite . \n unfortunately , this hypothesis could be difficult to be accepted for magnetars , because the stellar radius with the canonical mass of @xmath11 should be less than the schwarzshild radius defined by @xmath12 to produce a strong surface magnetic field such as @xmath13 gauss @xcite . \n another possibility of the generation mechanism is due to the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism , i.e. , the rapidly rotation of protoneutron star with the rotational period smaller than 3 ms may amplify a seed magnetic field up to @xmath13 gauss @xcite . \n this scenario is also unfavorable from the observations of supernova remnants associated with the magnetar candidates @xcite . \n additionally , the possibility of the ferromagnetism of quark liquid inside the neutron star is suggested as an origin of a strong magnetic field @xcite . \n conceivably , the hint to solve the open question about the origin of strong magnetic field of neutron star , might lay behind the magnetized properties in the core region . \n furthermore , the exact structure of neutron stars is still unclear , because the eos of neutron star matter , especially for high density region , is not fixed yet . \n even so , it is believed that , under the surface ocean composed of molten metal , the neutron - rich nuclei form a lattice structure through the coulomb interaction , which is usually called a crust region @xcite . as the energy density increases up to @xmath14 , the nuclei in the crust region would melt into uniform matter . \n this region corresponds to the core of neutron stars . \n moreover , non - hadronic matter , such as quarks , might appear in deeper part of core region , depending on the theoretical model of neutron star matter @xcite . \n in particular , the neutron star having quark matter is referred to as the hybrid star . inside the hybrid star \n , one has only to consider three flavor quark matter composed of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 quarks , because the more massive quarks can not be produced under the typical energy density of neutron stars . \n since quark matter makes eos soft , the mass of hybrid star is usually expected to be small . in practice , \n most of the hybrid stars proposed up to now might be difficult to reach the observed maximum mass , which is about two solar mass @xcite . or , quark matter occupies very tiny region , even if the massive hybrid stars could be constructed .    along with the origin of magnetic field of neutron star , \n the strength of magnetic field inside the star is also uncertain . \n the dipole magnetic field must dominate outside the star , while the magnetic configuration inside the star may be more complex due to the magnetic instability . according to the virial theorem , the maximum magnetic field for the neutron star with @xmath18 km and @xmath19 could be in the order of @xmath20 gauss @xcite . on the other hand , the maximum magnetic field in the quark phase might reach @xmath21 gauss , adopting the condition that the magnetic energy density should not exceed the energy density of the self - bound quark matter @xcite . \n if the magnetic field inside the star would be so strong , one has to take into account the effect of magnetic field on the neutron star matter , where the quantum effects such as the landau levels may also play an important role to determine the stellar configuration . \n so far , there are a few literatures about the macroscopic structures of hybrid stars under the magnetic field @xcite . considering the effects of the magnetic field in hadronic and quark phases , we find two important differences . \n one is the population of the charged particles : neutrons dominate over charged particles in the hadronic phase , while all the quarks have net electric charge . \n the other one is the difference of the mass of particles : baryons have much larger mass than quarks . \n these two features suggest that the effect of the magnetic field should be more important in quark matter . in this paper \n , we will consider the landau level in the quark phase of hybrid star . \n we derive a critical magnetic field @xmath22 for given density , above which only the lowest landau level is occupied , and find the eos becomes stiffest as a causality limit for @xmath23 , independent of the magnetic field . \n in addition , we especially examine how massive the hybrid star can become with the effect of strong magnetic field . \n we demonstrate that the eos becomes _ stiff _ as a result of the hadron - quark phase transition in the strong magnetic field . \n then , we find that the hybrid star whose mass is more than two solar mass , can have a very large quark core , i.e. ,  _ hybrid quark star _ \" . \n unless otherwise noted , we adopt the geometric unit of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively . \n assuming the uniform magnetic field along the @xmath27 axis , the @xmath28-th energy level of quark with flavor @xmath29 in the strongly magnetic field is given by @xmath30 } , \\label{eq : en}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath17 denote the particle mass , the plank constant , the magnetic field strength , and the degree of freedom of spin , respectively , while @xmath34 with the electron charge @xmath35 . \n as shown later , the lowest landau level ( lll ) plays a primary role in our discussion , where quark matter settles only in lll , the quark number density @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the fermi momentum of quark . since the typical values of the number density and magnetic field are @xmath39 with the saturation density @xmath40 @xmath2 and @xmath41 gauss in this paper , the fermi momentum of quark can be estimated as @xmath42 gev , which is much less than @xmath31 . \n then , the mass term in eq . \n ( [ eq : en ] ) does not significantly contribute to the energy level , @xmath43 . in this case , the energy density of quark @xmath44 is @xmath45 and quark matter becomes flavor symmetric , i.e. , @xmath46 , which leads to @xmath47 . \n we remark that the baryon number density @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 . \n then , the total energy density @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 within the mit bag model , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant . from eqs . \n ( [ eq : nb ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , @xmath50 is @xmath53 while the pressure , @xmath54 , is calculated by @xmath55 as a result , one can express @xmath54 as a function of @xmath48 , such as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 gauss ) . \n although the pressure expressed by eq . \n ( [ eq : p ] ) depends on @xmath33 as well as the baryon number density , we can find that the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath50 becomes that @xmath59 , which is independently of the magnetic field strength . from this relationship \n , the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath60 , becomes equivalent to the speed of light @xmath25 . \n thus , this is corresponding to the limiting case of a stiff eos , because @xmath61 can not exceed @xmath25 to keep the causality . note that the eos of free quark matter gives @xmath62 . \n we also remark that our eos would reduce to the same as the eos of free quark matter in the limit of low magnetic field , where quarks occupy all the landau levels . \n the condition that quark matter can settle only in lll is that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the fermi energy of quark . with the relation of @xmath65 in lll \n , one can derive the critical strength of the magnetic field so that quarks only occupy lll for each flavor . \n we then find that the critical strength for @xmath15 quarks is weaker than that for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , due to the difference of electric charge @xmath66 . \n thus , the condition for all quarks only occupy lll is given by that the magnetic field should be stronger than the critical strength for @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks , i.e. , one can show that the magnetic field strength should be larger than the critical strength @xmath22 given by @xmath67{6\\pi^4}\\hbar c}{e}n_{\\rm b}^{2/3 } \\nonumber \\\\             & = & 1.62\\times 10^{19 } \\times\\left(\\frac{n_{\\rm b}}{n_0}\\right)^{2/3 } \\ \n \\rm{gauss}.     \\label{eq : bc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it may be interesting to see that this critical strength is not changed even in the non - relativistic limit . thus the critical strength can be drawn as a universal function of density ( fig . \n [ fig : lll ] ) . \n if the magnetic field exceeds @xmath22 at some density region in quark matter , eos is given by the causal limit there . \n note that eos becomes invariant for the increase of the magnetic field once @xmath23 holds . \n [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] \n some compact objects have a strong magnetic field , although the details of the distribution of magnetic field inside the stars are still uncertain . \n maybe , one should consider the effects of such strong magnetic field on the structure of compact objects . \n we particularly focus on the hybrid stars in this paper , i.e. , the core region of neutron stars is composed of quark matter . \n we estimate that the critical magnetic field strength above which quarks only occupy lll ( and the second landau level ) , which is shown that @xmath68 gauss . \n we also find that the equation of state ( eos ) in the phase of lll can be expressed as @xmath69 independently of the magnetic field strength , where @xmath52 denotes the bag constant . \n we remark that this is the limit of a stiff eos , i.e. , the sound speed becomes equal to the speed of light . \n we derive these results by using the mit bag model , where quarks move almost freely , so that our findings should be relevant especially in the core region due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , while there may be added non - perturbative effects in the moderate density region \n . further consideration on the eos of quark matter based on qcd is a future subject .    on the other hand , in general \n , the maximum mass of hybrid star comes to be smaller than the observed maximum mass , i.e. , @xmath70 , because the introduction of quark matter makes the eos soft . \n even if one can construct the massive hybrid star , the quark region is generally quite tiny . \n however , owing to the effect of the landau levels in the quark phase , we are successful to construct the massive hybrid quark stars occupied in large part by quark matter , which can be larger than @xmath70 . \n furthermore , in order to examine the qualitative behavior of hybrid stellar models , we simply consider three different connections of quark matter with the hadronic matter . as a result , we find that the stellar model constructed with eos connected to the hadronic matter at the lower energy density can realize more massive stellar model with smaller central energy density . in this paper \n , we consider simple stellar models as a first step , where we neglect the magnetic pressure and the deformation of stellar shape . \n such additional effects will be taken into account elsewhere . \n in addition , one might also have to consider the hadron - quark mixed phase in the more realistic stellar models @xcite . at any rate \n , one could see the properties of such phase modified by the strong magnetic field via the observations of the stellar oscillations @xcite , which tells us an additional information about the strongly magnetized compact objects . \n we are grateful to n. yasutake and t. takatsuka for their fruitful discussions , and also to our referee for reading carefully and giving valuable comments . \n this work was supported in part by grants -

current @xmath71 is considered , where the electromagnetic four - potential becomes very simple such as @xmath72 . from the maxwell equations \n @xmath73 with the expansions of @xmath74 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 one can obtain the elliptic equation describing the @xmath77-th order potential @xmath78 ; @xmath79 where a prime and @xmath80 denote the partial derivative with respect to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , while @xmath83 is the @xmath77-th order legendre polynomial . for a dipole magnetic field , \n i.e. , @xmath84 , the potential outside the neutron star , @xmath85 , is analytically determined by setting @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite ; @xmath88,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the magnetic dipole moment observed at infinity . on the other hand , \n the potential inside the neutron star , @xmath90 , is obtained by numerically solving eq . \n ( [ eq : da1 ] ) in such a way that @xmath90 should be connected to @xmath85 at the stellar surface , where the current distribution is determined by the integration condition , i.e. , @xmath91 @xcite . at last \n , the mantic field is determined via @xmath92 as @xmath93 which leads to the strength of magnetic field as @xmath94^{1/2}.\\ ] ] we remark that since @xmath92 becomes @xmath95 in the vicinity of the stellar center , one can show that the magnetic field strength at @xmath96 is @xmath97 . \n after the calculations of the dipole magnetic distribution for the stellar model constructed with the landau - a , -b , and -c eoss , we find that the magnetic field strength at the stellar center is proportional to the strength at the stellar surface as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface of the poles ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) , while @xmath102 is a proportionality factor . \n figure [ fig : beta ] shows the value of @xmath102 as a function of stellar mass , where the solid line with circles , broken line with diamonds , and dotted line with squares correspond to the stellar models constructed with the landau - a , -b , and -c eoss . from this figure , we can see that @xmath103 becomes at most five times larger than @xmath99 . \n that is , the central strength of magnetic field can not reach to the critical magnetic field strength to realize the landau effects in quark matter phase even for magnetar with @xmath104 gauss , if the magnetic field configuration inside the star would be simply dipole .", "StartTimeOffset": 3321204252683, "RequestID": "99240d0569cf4ec4b720a0d8e9a45628", "TotalTokens": 4203}
{"ContextTokens": 2867, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "in his two seminal papers , @xcite not only showed that two stars can exist in an envelope of a common equipotential and thus resolved the overall hitherto unexplainable properties of w  uma - type stars , but also very clearly indicated that such contact binaries must have very dissimilar components . \n as pointed out by @xcite , evolution can create this dissimilarity . \n the evolutionary state of contact binary stars remains unclear because their spectra can not be analyzed for abundances due to the extreme broadening and blending of spectral lines . \n indirect information though , such as their progressively increasing numbers with age in old open @xcite and globular @xcite clusters , as well as the kinematic characteristics @xcite , very strongly suggest an advanced age of @xmath0 gyr . \n recently , @xcite has developed a model with the currently less massive component being the more evolved one . \n such a model is conceptually very close to that used to explain the semi - detached algols . in his model , \n the current secondary ( less - massive ) components must be in some cases very low in mass to explain systems like aw  uma or sx  crv @xcite .    in this letter we present a summary of results on the component masses ( for 112 systems ) and system angular momenta ( for 93 systems ) for low - temperature contact binaries . \n the sample used was collected mainly from the list of contact binaries defined by @xcite . \n half of the systems have solutions published in the frame of the w  uma project ( papers i - vi ) @xcite . all the rest \n were collected from the literature , the physical parameters of which have been determined accurately , using photometric light curves and radial velocity measurements for both components . we also included the near - contact binaries ( ncbs ) and the detached close binaries ( dcbs ) listed in tables 2 and 3 of @xcite , in order to compare their physical parameters with those of our sample . \n we had to exclude the cases , where the third light and the low - amplitude light variation give unreliable solutions , such as v2150  cyg , v899  her , ht  vir , bl  eri and go  cyg . in some cases , \n close binaries in triple systems have led to spurious solutions and for this reason they were excluded from our sample . other cases with third light contribution do not seem to produce any problem . \n such systems , which are members in multiple systems , have better geometrical configuration and usually have very good spectroscopic determination of the third light contribution , allowing accurate determination of the orbital and physical parameters . \n two systems , v351 peg and v402 aur were very probably incorrectly classified as w - type binaries , although the shape of their light curves does not support such a classification . \n both systems have equal minima in their light curves , making it difficult to distinguish them from each other . \n since their physical parameters ( masses and periods ) were closer to those of a - type binaries , they were classified as a - type systems . \n only recently , good spectroscopic data has become available for more than a hundred contact binaries . since even small - mass secondaries \n can be observed spectroscopically in contact systems , most objects have been analyzed as double - lined binaries bypassing any need of inferences based on single - lined data or solely on sometimes highly unreliable photometric elements ( particularly mass ratios ) . \n in our study we consider component `` 1 '' as the more massive one . \n our assumption is based on the double - lined spectroscopic observations , where the mass ratio is taken as @xmath1 . \n in figure  [ fig1 ] we present the distribution of the component masses versus the orbital period . \n it seems that the secondary components in all systems are very similar in masses , regardless of the orbital period . \n masses of secondaries are between the values of 0 and 1 @xmath2 . \n the mean value of the mass of the secondaries is @xmath3 , while the primaries have masses between 0.5 and @xmath4 ( only hv  uma has @xmath5 ) . \n the same pattern of distribution appears when the masses of a and w - type systems are plotted in separate figures ( figures  [ fig2]a and  [ fig2]b ) . in this case , the average mass of a - type secondaries is equal to @xmath6 and that of w - type equal to @xmath7 . \n it is remarkable to see the similarity of the mass distribution of secondary components with that of white dwarfs @xcite . according to @xcite \n , mass exchange is taking place in the majority of contact binaries and the secondaries are helium - rich objects . in this case \n the masses of the secondary components are expected to be similar or smaller than those of white dwarfs , which could have been grown as cores of isolated stars . \n another interesting feature shown in figure  [ fig1 ] as well as in the upper and lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] is that there is a total absence of systems with periods between 0.5 and 0.6 d. this gap is rather caused by the selection effect of our sample of contact binaries . \n many contact binaries with equal minima and periods close to 12 h are difficult to be observed and can be mistaken as pulsating variables , with a period of 6 h ( i.e. @xmath8 variables ) , or remain unclassified . a recent study @xcite has also showed that many contact binaries are still undetected .    in our sample , \n all w - type systems have orbital periods shorter than 0.5 d , while the a - type systems can have all possible periods in the range considered , with a small preference in large values . \n seven systems ( ck  boo , fp  boo , sx  crv , gr  vir , tz  boo , aw  uma and fg  hya ) ( especially aw  uma , sx  crv and tz  boo ) are plotted with triangles in all figures , as they are low - q systems with very low - mass secondaries ( @xmath9 ) . in these systems \n the rotational angular momentum is mostly `` absorbed '' from the primary component and plays a significant role on the total angular momentum of the system . \n according to @xcite these very low - q systems can not exist , since @xmath10 . \n there is a co - existence of a and w - type systems with periods between 0.3 and 0.5 d. all systems with @xmath11 d are of w - type and all with @xmath12 d are of a - type . \n a very interesting feature is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the total mass of the above systems is plotted versus the period . \n it is obvious that a - type systems are in general more massive than w - type ones . for comparison , \n in the same graph , we plotted the total mass of our cbs with the total mass of the short - period ( @xmath13 ) ncbs and dcbs , taken from @xcite . \n one can see that most of the ncb and dcb systems have total mass similar to that of a - type contact binaries but larger than that of w - type contact binaries . \n these observational facts strongly support the evolutionary progress from near - contact into contact configuration of a - type , without the need of mass loss from the system , as proposed by @xcite . \n further progress in this direction , may transform the a - type systems into w - type , with a simultaneous mass loss , or can lead the a - type systems to become binaries with extreme small mass ratio . \n the opposite direction would require the total mass to increase , which is unreasonable . \n in figure  [ fig4 ] we present a plot of the orbital angular momentum versus the orbital period . in this plot \n we see that a - type systems generally tent to have larger angular momenta than the w - type systems . on the top of each point in the graph \n , a vertical line is added , representing the amount of the spin angular momentum of the two components . \n the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta will give the total angular momentum of each system . \n in this way it can be seen that the angular momentum of close binaries can be studied with either the orbital or the total angular momentum . \n the orbital angular momentum is not affected from observational or modeling errors , but only from masses and orbital periods . on the other hand , \n the spin angular momentum is affected from the errors in mass , radius and from the assumption we make for the radius of gyration , which is still under investigation @xcite . \n for example , a slightly smaller radius of gyration would shift the seven low - q systems of our sample in a stable state . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows that formation of w - type systems from a - type is possible to be done , but the opposite direction is not strongly supported . \n evolution from a - type to w - type systems seems to occure with a simultaneous mass and angular momentum loss , unless the evolutionary direction , after the ncbs evolve to contact systems , follows two separate tracks . \n however , we can not exclude the possibility that some a - type systems with small angular momentum have evolved from w - type systems , while others ( with large angular momentum ) have evolved directly from ncbs @xcite . \n do both a and w - type contact binaries have the same origin ? is the one type progenitor of the other ? \n the above questions are still open for investigation . \n the main result of the present study , taking into account the masses and angular momenta of contact binaries , is that the w - type systems can not produce a - type binaries , since angular momentum and mass can not be added to a system , but only lost from it . \n it seems more reasonable that a - type systems evolve to w - type systems by loosing mass and angular momentum . \n a similar evolutionary direction from long to short period binaries @xcite showed that systems with longer periods are kinematically young ( age 2 gyr ) in contrast to those with shorter periods ( age 8 gys ) . \n an interesting result extracted from our plots is that the secondary components in close binary systems are very similar in mass . \n scatter of the points in our plots is mainly due to inaccurate photometric and spectroscopic solutions and/or a possible undetected third light contribution . \n since the best of the available data is used in our sample , only the third light could produce a problem and this is why some solutions are excluded from our sample . \n a very recent study of @xcite about the formation of contact binaries in multiple systems , suggests that a large percentage of close binaries is formed into triple and multiple systems . \n in such a case , a small amount of unreliability is added to all the solutions , if they are affected from an undetected third light . \n our observational evidence ( figures 1 - 4 ) strongly supports the argument that the evolutionary process is from ncbs to a - type contact binaries , without any need of mass loss from the system . \n the next step in this scenario may lead either to a transformation of a - type to w - type systems with a simultaneous mass and angular momentum loss , or to a - type systems with extremely low mass ratio . \n these systems will eventually merge into a single , fast - rotating object . \n the opposite direction of evolution seems to be impossible , since it requires an increase of the total mass and angular momentum of the system . \n the authors gratefully acknowledge professor s. rucinski for his valuable help during the preparation of the manuscript and for many insightful discussions and new ideas about contact binary structure and evolution , as well as the anonymous referee for useful suggestions , which improved the article . \n this project was supported by the special account for research grants no 70/3/7187 ( hrakleitos ) and 70/3/7382 ( pythagoras ) of the national and kapodistrian university of athens , greece . \n rucinski , s. m. , 1998 , aj , 116 , 2998 rucinski , s. m. , 2000 , aj , 120 , 319 rucinski , s. m. , 2002 , pasp , 114 , 1124 stepien , k. , 2004 , in dupree a.k . , \n , eds , proc . iau symp . \n 219 , stars as suns : activity , evolution and planets . \n , san fransisco , p. 967", "StartTimeOffset": 3334378039892, "RequestID": "4e265f173e494ac2911837cfdaecd4e8", "TotalTokens": 3032}

[ 0326fig ] . \n the basic picture of jet deceleration with tranverse velocity gradients holds for both sources , but there are interesting differences in the field structures : 1553 + 24 ( like 3c31 ) has a dominant toroidal component but the outer part of 0326 + 29 ( fig .  [ 0326fig ] ) has roughly equal radial and toroidal components , but no longitudinal field ( cf . \n thus far , we have assumed that emissivity and field structure are independent of the velocity field . \n this is appropriate if we aim to deduce the internal parameters without imposing preconceptions about the underlying physics , but to make further progress , we need to make additional assumptions . \n the simplest approximation is that the jets are `` adiabatic '' in the sense defined by @xcite : the relativistic particles lose energy only by the adiabatic process and the magnetic field is convected passively with the flow . @xcite derived analytical relations for the surface - brightness of a relativistic jet with no transverse velocity gradient and either a transverse or longitudinal magnetic field . \n we have generalized their approach to include shear and arbitrary initial field geometry , using a formalism based on that of @xcite .      in fig . \n [ 3c31ad ] , we show the results of fitting adiabatic models to the outer regions of the jets in 3c31 , with initial conditions set as profiles of emissivity and field - ordering across the jet at the start of the region . \n the models fit reasonably well , but can not accurately describe the observed polarization at the jet edges . \n a likely possibility is that the velocity field is more complicated than the simple laminar flow we assume , and that some turbulent component is present , leading to changes in field ordering and strength which are not described by our model . \n in contrast , adiabatic models fail completely in the inner and flaring regions . \n this should not come as a surprise : the x - ray emission detected in these regions by @xcite is most likely to be synchrotron radiation , requiring significant particle acceleration .", "StartTimeOffset": 3339270583731, "RequestID": "bf1a3af91b0944df9852897fbe9e0d41", "TotalTokens": 1501}

? ? * and references therein ) . \n as such , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = is the fastest rotating accreting neutron star . \n if the pulsations are due to modulated emission from one hot spot on the neutron star surface , the 2.49 msec period corresponds to an equatorial speed of approximately 0.1c . with these high speeds , sax j1808.4 - 3658 + \n = offers an excellent system for studying relativistic effects . \n one such effect may be the observed lag of low - energy photons relative to high - energy photons in the pulse discovered by @xcite . \n @xcite suggest that the lags are due to comptonization in a relatively cool surrounding medium . \n alternatively , the lags may be the result of a relativistic effect : the high - energy photons are preferentially emitted at earlier phases due to doppler boosting along the line of sight . \n this possibility was suggested for the similar lags in the 549  hz oscillations in an x - ray burst of aql  x-1 @xcite , where a simple model showed that the delays roughly match those expected .    in the following , we present new measurements of the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = . \n we show that the energy - dependent phase lags are equivalent to a hardening pulse profile . \n we model this behavior in terms of a hot spot on the neutron star , including relativistic effects . \n we have used publicly available data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board rxte in an ` event ' mode with high time resolution ( 122@xmath2sec ) and high energy resolution ( 64 channels ) . \n the observations occurred from april 10 1998 to may 7 1998 , when the source was in outburst . \n we generate folded lightcurves in each pca channel . \n this is accomplished with the fasebin tool in ftools version 4.2 , which applies all known xte clock corrections and corrects photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de-200 ephemeris , yielding a timing accuracy of several @xmath2sec ( much less than the phase binning used here ) . as a check , \n we have applied this method to crab pulsar data and the results are identical to @xcite . to produce pulse profiles in the neutron star rest frame , we use the sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = orbital ephemeris found by @xcite . \n an example folded lightcurve is shown in figure  [ lc ] ( top ) for the observation of april 18 1998 14:05:40 to april 19 1998 00:51:44 utc . \n to study the energy spectra at each phase bin , we take the rates at pulse minimum and subtract it from the rest of the data at other phases . \n this effectively accomplishes background subtraction and eliminates the unpulsed emission which we do not wish to consider . \n note , however , that the pulsed emission may have some contribution even at the pulse minimum and this subtraction scheme represents only a best approximation to the true pulse emission . \n we generate detector response matrices appropriate to the observation date and data mode using pcarsp v2.38 , and use xspec v.10.0 to fit model spectra . \n we fit the spectrum here with a simple powerlaw function . \n though the function itself is not meant to be a physical description , the powerlaw index provides a good measure of the spectral hardness . \n fits in each phase bin have reduced @xmath3 of 0.7 to 1.6 . including an interstellar absorption does not substantially affect these results . \n the powerlaw index clearly increases through the pulse phase ( figure  [ lc ] , bottom ) , i.e. spectrum evolves from hard to soft . \n we also fit the profiles of the folded lightcurves in each channel using fourier functions at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics . from these fits \n we determine the phase lag in each channel relative to the fits in some baseline channel range . \n results for the 18 april 1998 observation are shown in figure  [ lags ] as solid symbols . \n note that negative numbers indicate that high - energy photons precede low - energy photons . \n we are also able to measure lags in the first harmonic , and find that they are opposite in sign to the fundamental , i.e. low - energy photons precede high - energy photons in the first harmonic . \n no lags are measurable in the other harmonics . \n another way to measure energy - dependent phase lags is by fourier cross - correlation analysis . \n this is the method used for sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = by @xcite and for other timing signals as well , e.g. kilohertz qpos ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n for a description of cross correlation analysis see e.g. @xcite . from the pca event mode data we calculate fourier spectra in various channel ranges with nyquist frequency of 2048 hz and resolution of 0.25 hz . \n we then calculate cross spectra defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the complex fourier coefficients for two energy bands at the pulsar frequency @xmath6 . \n the phase lag between the two energy bands is given by the argument of @xmath7 . \n we measure all phase delays relative to the unbinned channels range 5 to 8 , i.e. 1.83 to 3.27 kev for 5 detector units in pca gain epoch 3 ( april 15 1996 to march 22 1999 ) . \n the results for the 18 april 1998 observation , are shown in figure  [ lags ] by the open symbols . \n the phase lags are consistent with those calculated from the lightcurve fitting . from the cross - correlation spectra \n we are not able to measure lags in the much weaker harmonics . \n we have calculated phase lag spectra also for other rxte observations during the april 1998 outburst . \n these spectra are similar to that in figure  [ lags ] . \n to quantify the trends , we compute an average phase delay , @xmath8 , over all energies for each observation . \n we also fit a broken powerlaw function to each phase delay spectrum : @xmath9 below a break energy , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 above this energy . \n figure  [ lags_v_time ] shows the quantities @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 versus the time of each observation .    there is a clear connection between the results of the two analyses presented here . \n the phase resolved spectroscopy shows that the spectrum softens and correspondingly the peak of the pulse profile appears slightly earlier in phase for higher energies ( figure  [ lc ] ) . \n the method of measuring phase delays shows the same behavior : higher - energy photons preferentially lead lower - energy photons in the fundamental and the magnitude of this phase delay increases with energy ( figure  [ lags ] ) . in the following we discuss a model that can account for the phase delays / spectral softening measured here . \n we calculate the expected luminosity as a function of phase in a manner similar to @xcite but including doppler effects @xcite and time of flight delays @xcite . \n this treatment is based on a schwarzschild metric , where the photon trajectories are completely determined by the compactness , @xmath13 . \n the predicted luminosity as a function of phase from our code matches the results of @xcite and @xcite for the various choices of parameters . \n @xcite recently developed a model for pulse profiles using a slightly different approach . \n the parameters in the model are the speed at the equator of the neutron star , @xmath14 , the mass of the neutron star , @xmath15 , the compactness , @xmath13 , the angular size of the cap , @xmath16 , and the viewing angles , @xmath17 ( the angle between the rotation axis and the cap center ) and @xmath18 ( rotation axis to line of sight ) . \n another ingredient is the emission from the spot , which we take as isotropic and isothermal . \n the spectrum of energy emitted from the spot is another important input . \n note that if the emitted spectrum is power law like , the observed spectrum will not evolve with phase , since doppler transformation preserves the shape ( see * ? ? ? \n the intrinsic spectrum must therefore have some shape that transforms to match the observed hardening and phase lags ; we use a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath19 . \n a fit from the model is shown in figure  [ lags ] . \n this fit uses the following model parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath21\\c\\else\\if'\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\else\\if\\empty\\c\\else\\if\\space\\c\\else\\space\\fi\\fi\\fi}\\fi}}}$ ] , @xmath22 kev , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . to derive count rates , we use table models in xspec and the appropriate response files as discussed above . \n the fit for this single set of parameters is good ; we find @xmath26 from the fourier cross - correlation data or a reduced @xmath3 of 0.8 for all the parameters fixed . \n a full exploration of the parameter space of the model is beyond the scope of this letter . \n we note the following trends , however . \n the magnitude of the phase lags depends sensitively on @xmath14 and @xmath19 . \n larger delays result from higher speeds , because the pulses become increasingly asymmetric due to doppler boosting . \n this asymmetry is also energy dependent , so there is a dependence on @xmath19 as well ( see * ? ? ? \n the lags also depend on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , especially at higher energies where there is the turn - over noted above . \n the phase lags are less sensitive to @xmath13 and @xmath16 . \n we have tested the assumption of isotropic emission and found that the phase lags depend only weakly on the beaming . \n the pulsed emission from sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = evolves through its phase from a relatively hard to a soft spectrum , as shown by our phase resolved spectroscopy ( figure  [ lc ] ) . \n this evolution can also be thought of , and measured as , an energy - dependent phase lag in the fundamental ( figure  [ lags ] ) , i.e. higher - energy photons emerging earlier in phase than lower - energy photons . \n we have applied a model to the data which consists of a hot spot on the rotating neutron star under a general relativistic treatment . \n the dominant effect accounting for energy - dependent delays is doppler boosting , the larger boosting factors at earlier phases giving harder spectra . \n the model fits the data quite well . \n the model also provides a stable mechanism for generating the phase delays , which meshes with the fact that the characteristic delays remain stable in time to within 25% ( figure  [ lags_v_time ] ) even as there is a factor of two decrease in the x - ray flux , a possible tracer of accretion rate . as noted in @xcite , in addition to explaining the energy - dependent phase lags in sax j1808.4 - 3658 + = , this mechanism may also account for the lags in the burst oscillations of aql x-1 @xcite and kilohertz qpos @xcite . \n phase resolved spectroscopy has not yet been possible in these signals . \n the model offers a new means of measuring the neutron star mass and radius , a notoriously difficult problem in accreting binary systems . the radius is directly related to @xmath14 , the equatorial speed ( @xmath27 ) . \n the fits also depend on the model parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 , though the lag spectra are less sensitive to these quantities . \n the model could be independently constrained by future optical spectroscopy of the companion which could provide information on @xmath15 and the viewing angles , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n we acknowledge stimulating discussions with the participants of the august 1999 aspen workshop on relativity where an early version of this work was presented . \n we thank michiel van der klis , mariano mndez and luigi stella for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported by nwo spinoza grant 08 - 0 to e.p.j.van den heuvel , by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) under contract number 614 - 51 - 002 , and by the netherlands researchschool for astronomy ( nova ) . \n this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .", "StartTimeOffset": 3359024116294, "RequestID": "bfb6bf0f09d04f78af4e9c0c5989c448", "TotalTokens": 3520}
{"ContextTokens": 2336, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "european region is one of the most intensively studied areas of the earth from the point of view of regional geodynamics . \n there are more than 100 permanently operating gps receivers , about 10 permanent vlbi stations and more than 10 permanent slr stations . \n lately much attention has been devoted to comparison and combination of results obtained using different space geodesy techniques . \n this work is devoted to comparison of baseline length variations derived from gps and vlbi observations , continuing the cycle of works on this problem , see e.g. . \n it should be mentioned here that observed changes of the baseline length on the one hand are resulted by insufficient corrections for observational effects such as thermal deformations of vlbi antennas , for example , or errors in modeling of tropospheric refraction , but on the other hand they are subjected to a number of insufficiently studied or not taken into account properly geophysical effects that can result in the real changes of the baseline length , these effects may be atmospheric and snow loading , tides , postglacial rebound , and so on . \n it is important that the majority of these effects has both seasonal and secular components .    in this study \n we have analyzed vlbi and gps observations at 6 european stations carrying out both vlbi and gps regular observations and having long enough observational history . \n vlbi baseline lengths were computed with the occam package using all available 24h sessions for the period of 1983.92001.5 . \n details of the method used can be found in @xcite . \n linear trend in the baseline lengths was computed for the whole period of observations and , for more accurate comparison with gps data , for the period of 1996.0 - 2001.0 . \n only later results are presented in this study . in @xcite \n we compared linear trend in variations of baseline length derived from the observations over the period 1996.02001.0 with ones computed using all available vlbi sessions over a period 1990.02001.4 . \n differences of estimated rates are inside one sigma interval for all baselines analyzed here .    for more strict account for variation in baseline lengths due to thermal antenna deformations we used advanced model of this effect @xcite which allow to correct observed station position not only for vertical but also for horizontal displacement . \n at this stage of the research we used zero time delay between change of air and telescope construction temperature , because of lack of such a data for most of antennas . \n however , this mismodelling will effect only intra - day displacement of the telesope reference point , but not seasonal variations . \n it should be mentioned here that account for horizontal displacement is especially important for processing regional networks , whereas vertical displacement due to thermal deformations prevails in variations of global baselines length . in particular , errors in modelling of this effect \n may be a possible reason of seasonal baseline length variations found e.g. in @xcite . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from vlbi data are shown in figure  [ fig : vlbi ] . \n unfortunately , stations crimea and yebes are not equipped with gps receiver . \n =      for computation of baseline lengths between european gps stations we used weekly epn solutions distributed in sinex files . however , this solutions are not suitable for immediate use in geodynamical analysis because they can not provide homogeneous long - time coordinate time series due to periodic changes in reference coordinate system and set of fiducial stations . \n for this reason , direct use of the euref solutions shows jumps in baseline length variations @xcite . besides , method of computation of station \n coordinates used in epn is based on using tight constrains to fiducial stations which cause a distortion of the network , i.e. fictive variations in baseline lengths ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n so , variations of baseline lengths from gps data were obtained from analysis of coordinate time series for epn stations computed by the method described in @xcite . \n this computation is based on de - constraining of the official epn solutions with further transformation to itrf2000 . \n for this study we used 6-parameter helmert transformation to avoid loss of seasonal geophysical signal in baseline length . using our independent coordinate time series allows us to obtain realistic station displacement practically free of network distortion for all epn stations over the period 1996.02001.0 . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from gps data are shown in figure  [ fig : gps ] . \n unfortunately , madr coordinate time series is too short ( less than two years ) that does not allow to get reliable results . \n it should be mentioned that errors in gps baseline length significantly decrease during a period under investigation . \n e.g. , one can see abnormal trend in mate displacement in 1996 . \n however , that does not influence result very much due to relatively small weight of these data . \n =      one of the most important factor affecting variations of station coordinates derived from space geodesy observations is atmospheric loading . \n we investigated influence of this effect using 3-dimensional atmospheric loading time series provided by h .- \n scherneck @xcite . \n the data were averaged over a week interval corresponding to every gps week and variations of baseline lengths were computed from these weekly values . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from analysis of atmospheric data are shown in figure  [ fig : atmosph ] . \n =    it is interesting that baseline length variations contain not only seasonal but also secular component , even for short baselines , especially for continental - coastal ones , in particular baselines including wettzell stations which are often used in studies on european geodynamics , e.g. @xcite . \n the reason of that may be long - periodic or progressive weather and climate changes , but period of our investigation is too short to separate them .    since variations in height component of station displacement due to atmospheric loading prevail , this effect is especially significant for global baselines . for regional networks \n horizontal displacements yield main contribution to variation of baseline lengths . \n results of computation of variations in baseline lengths are presented in [ tab : result ] . \n one can see that values of rates obtained from vlbi and gps observations are in good agreement for most baselines . \n unfortunately , it is not the case for seasonal variations . \n obviously , interval of investigation is too short and number of used vlbi observations is too small for many baselines . \n indeed , it would be important to verify our results using data obtained from other space geodesy techniques , but only mate and wett stations are equipped with slr units , and only nyal station is equipped with doris beacon ( which is explained by difficulties in collocation of doris beacon and vlbi antenna due to radio frequency interference ) . \n .results of analysis of variation of baseline lengths : baseline length ( l ) , km , number of epochs ( n ) processed and found in the ivs data base , linear trend ( rate ) , mm , amplitude of annual term ( as ) , mm , amplitude of semiannual term ( asa ) , mm . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,>,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     it is also remarkable that influence of atmospheric loading on baseline length rate is significant for many baselines . \n evidently , this effect must be investigated more carefully and properly accounted during geodynamical analysis . \n figure [ fig : lbacc ] shows dependence of error in baseline length rate on length of baseline . \n it is interesting that for gps data error is practically the same for all baselines unlike vlbi data . \n 1em    further steps of our work will include new re - computation of epn coordinate time series based on new combination of individual epn analysis center solutions , reprocessing of vlbi data with new version of software , and more complete analysis of various factors effected variations of baseline lengths . \n analysis of variations in vertical component of station displacement is also planned . \n this research was partially supported by a grant of the st.petersburg scientific center of the russian academy of sciences . \n campbell j. the european geodetic vlbi project  an overview . in : p. \n tomasi , f.  mantovani , m.  prez -

{"ContextTokens": 3987, "GeneratedTokens": 264, "SynthesizedBody": "gravothermal oscillations are one of the most interesting phenomena which may arise in the post - collapse evolution of a star cluster . \n the inner regions of a post collapse cluster are approximately isothermal and are subject to a similar instability as the one found in an isothermal sphere in a spherical container , as studied by @xcite and @xcite . \n gravothermal oscillations , which are thought to be a manifestation of this instability , were discovered by @xcite whilst studying the post - collapse evolution of star clusters using a gas model . for a gas model of a one - component cluster \n it was found that gravothermal oscillations first appear when the number of stars @xmath0 is greater than 7000 @xcite . \n this value of @xmath0 has also been found with fokker - planck calculations @xcite and by direct @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . \n however , in a multi - component cluster the situation is more complicated . \n the presence of different mass components introduces different dynamical processes to the system such as mass stratification . \n multi - component systems try to achieve kinetic energy equipartition between the components , which causes the heavier stars to move more slowly and sink towards the centre . \n this can lead to the spitzer instability @xcite in which the heavier stars continuously lose energy to the lighter stars without ever being able to reach equipartition . \n @xcite found that the post - collapse evolution for multi - component models was stable to much higher values of @xmath0 than in the case of the one - component system and that the value of @xmath0 at which gravothermal oscillations appeared varied with different mass functions .    in order to gain a deeper understanding of gravothermal oscillations , it is desirable to work with simpler models in which some of the effects which are present in real star clusters are ignored or simplified . \n for example , real star clusters have a range of stellar masses present , but in the current paper , the stellar masses are limited to two . \n gaseous models are often used in this kind of research @xcite because they are computationally efficient . \n @xcite have already completed research in this area using fokker - planck models . \n however , their research was limited to mostly spitzer stable models and only a small range of stellar mass ratios . \n the study in the present paper looks at the more general spitzer unstable models using various stellar mass and total mass ratios . \n there is also evidence of gravothermal oscillations in real star clusters . \n @xcite modelled the cluster ngc 6397 using monte carlo models and found fluctuation in the core radius . \n their timescale suggests that they are gravothermal . \n subsequently , they confirmed these fluctuations using direct @xmath0-body methods with initial conditions generated from the monte carlo model @xcite . \n two - component clusters may seem very unrealistic but there is reason to believe that they may be a good approximation to multi - component systems . \n @xcite were able to find good approximate matches for half - mass radius @xmath1 , central velocity dispersion @xmath2 , core density @xmath3 and core collapse time @xmath4 between two - component models and eleven - component models which were designed to approximate a power law imf . \n also see @xcite for a discussion of the realism of two - component models . \n this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 \n , we describe the models which are used . \n this is followed by section 3 , in which the results concerning gravothermal oscillations are given . \n section 4 is concerned with the results of the core collapse times . in section 5 , \n the results of @xmath0-body simulations are given . \n finally section 6 consists of the conclusions and a discussion . \n in our model , we ignore primordial binaries and stellar evolution , and assume that the energy generating mechanism is the formation of binary stars in three body encounters and subsequent encounters of binaries with single stars . \n in a one - component model the rate of energy generation per unit mass is approximately @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the stellar mass , @xmath7 is the number density , @xmath8 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion of the core and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant . \n @xcite , whose results on the 1-component model we shall occasionally refer to , used a similar formula , with a coefficient which is , in effect , in the range 140170 ( depending on the value of @xmath0 ) . \n the equations of the two - component gas model @xcite are given below : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ( m_{3-i } \\sigma^2_{3-i } - m_i \\sigma^2_i )   \\big ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 . \n this model in turn is ultimately inspired by the one - component model of @xcite .    . \n subscript @xmath16 corresponds to the @xmath17 component , @xmath18 refers to the more massive component @xmath19 [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      vs time , where @xmath20 is defined as in nbody6 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath24 . ]    for the case of the runs with @xmath0 equal to @xmath25 and @xmath26 no behaviour was found which could be described as gravothermal oscillation . \n this is in agreement with the gas code , which gave @xmath27 . \n however , the @xmath24 case does show a cycle of expansion and contraction of the core over the time interval @xmath28 to @xmath29 units ( see fig . \n [ nbody32 ] ) . in order to check that the expansion was not driven by sustained binary energy generation \n , we consider the evolution of the relative binding energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total binding energy of the binaries and @xmath32 is the absolute value of the total energy of the cluster , over this time period . \n this is plotted in fig . \n [ nbody32gto ] along with the core radius . \n there are small changes in the binding energy of binaries over this period , decreases as well as increases , but this can not fully account for the expansion phase that is observed , as there are other periods with similar binary activity in which no sustained expansion occurs . \n also , the time scale of the expansion is much longer than the relaxation time in the core ( @xmath33 0.5 in time units ) . \n therefore , we assume that the expansion must be driven by phenomena outside the core , and gravothermal behaviour is a plausible explanation .    several other pieces of evidence point to this conclusion . fig . \n [ nbody32lagr ] shows the density in lagrangian shells of the heavier component . as discussed in section [ sec : doi ] ( e.g. fig . \n [ fig : pc1 ] , top ) the region further away from the core is seen to contract while the core expands . \n also , in the cycle of @xmath34 vs the core velocity dispersion @xmath35 , the temperature is lower during the expansion where heat is absorbed and higher during the collapse where heat is released ( fig . \n [ nbody32gto ] , bottom ) . \n this is similar to the cycles found by @xcite for one - component models and is another sign of gravothermal behaviour . \n the results from the @xmath24 gas run are shown in fig . \n [ gas32gto ] for comparison . \n the @xmath36 run shown in figs . \n [ fig:64k ] and [ fig:64 kb ] has large amplitude oscillations . \n there is a part of the expansion which is shown in fig . [ fig:64 kb ] between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in which the relative binding energy of binaries is nearly constant . \n therefore binary activity can not be what is driving the expansion . \n [ fig:64 kb ] ( bottom ) shows the evolution of the profile of @xmath39 over part of the expansion . \n a negative temperature gradient is visible towards the end of this expansion and this is what is driving the expansion . from the results of the @xmath24 and @xmath36 \n runs it seems that the value of @xmath40 obtained by the gas code is a reasonable indicator of stability for the case in the sense that none of the signs of gravothermal behaviour were found for @xmath41 . \n the main focus of this paper has been on the gravothermal oscillations of two - component systems . \n the critical value of @xmath0 for the onset of instability has been found for a range of stellar mass ratios and total mass ratios using a gas model . \n the case of @xmath22 and @xmath21 was further investigated using the direct code nbody6 . \n the value of @xmath42 obtained from the gas code seems to be a good indicator for stability in runs for this case . \n based on this , it is a reasonable assumption that the other @xmath42 values would give an indication of the stability for direct systems . \n the values of @xmath42 for the two - component model were found to be much higher than for the one - component case and were found to vary with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . however , the value of @xmath45 at the stability limit was found to vary much less than @xmath0 itself . \n this seems to suggest that instability depends on the properties of the heavy component ( see [ sec : lsm ] ) . a possible explanation of this is given in section [ sec : lsm ] . \n the physical manifestation of the oscillations was investigated for the case of small - amplitude periodic oscillations in the gas model . \n it has been pointed out that the collapse of the region between @xmath20 and @xmath1 is an important mechanism which can halt the expansion phase of a gravothermal oscillation . \n this mechanism should also be present in one - component models and it would be an interesting topic for future work to see how this mechanism would behave with different stellar mass functions . \n @xcite argued that two - component clusters may be realistic approximations of multi - component clusters , where the two components are neutron stars and main sequence stars and the effect of white dwarfs ( heavier than the turnoff mass ) was assumed to be negligible . \n they also only studied cases that were spitzer stable , which means that the components were able to achieve equipartition of kinetic energy . \n for the two - component case , it is only possible for it to be spitzer stable if there is only a small amount of the heavier component present . as there is a significant range of stellar masses in a real star cluster \n , it is likely that some form of the spitzer instability will be present .    to apply our ideas to a multi - component system \n , it may be possible to group the heavier components together if they are able to achieve approximate thermal equilibrium . \n this could be considered as a single heavier component which is spitzer unstable with respect to the remaining components . \n this would help to reduce a multi - component system to the two - component case studied in this paper .    nevertheless , it is not clear quantitatively how the considerations of this research are to be applied to a multi - component cluster . \n furthermore , we have ignored many things such as primordial binaries , tidal fields and stellar evolution and these are important in the evolution of a real star cluster . \n further study is needed in order to understand the phenomenon that is gravothermal oscillation . \n we are indebted to s. aarseth and k. nitadori for making publicly available their version of nbody6 adapted for use with a gpu . \n we thank the anonymous referee for helping us to clarify the paper . \n our hardware was purchased using a small project grant awarded to dch and dr m. ruffert ( school of mathematics ) by the university of edinburgh development trust , and we are most grateful for it . \n pgb is funded by the science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) . \n 99 antonov v. a. , 1962 , vest . \n leningrad gos . \n , 135 ( english translation in goodman j. , hut p. , eds , iau symp . \n 113 , dynamics of globular clusters . \n reidel , dordrecht , p. 525 ) bettwieser e. , sugimoto d. , 1984 , mnras , 208 , 493 bettwieser e. , sugimoto d. , 1985 , mnras , 212 , 189 binney j. , tremaine s. , 2008 , galactic dynamics , second edition ( princeton@xmath46 princeton university press ) chernoff d.f . \n , weinberg m.d . , 1990 , apj , 351 , 121 cohn , h. , hut , p. , wise , m. , 1989 , apj , 342 , 814 fregeau j.m . \n , joshi k.j . , portegies zwart s.f . \n , rasio f.a \n . , 2002 , apj , 570 , 171 giersz m. , heggie d.c . , 1996 , mnras , 279 , 1037 giersz m. , heggie d.c . , 2009 , mnras , 395 , 1173 goodman j. , 1993 , in structure and dynamics of globular clusters , asp conf . \n djorgovski , s.g . , meylan , g. , asp , san francisco , p. 87 \n goodman j. , 1987 , apj , 313 , 576 grkan m.a . , freitag m. , rasio f.a . , 2004 , \n apj , 604 , 632 heggie d.c . , aarseth s. j. , 1992 , mnras , 257 , 513 heggie d.c . , \n giersz m. , 2009 , mnras , 397 , 46 heggie d.c . , hut p. , 2003 \n , the gravitational million body problem ( cambridge@xmath46 cambridge university press ) heggie d. c. , mathieu , r. d. , 1986 in the use of supercomputers in stellar dynamics , ed . hut , p. , mcmillan , s. l. w. , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 3561, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "the spin field effect transistor ( spinfet ) proposed by datta and das @xcite and its various clones ( see , for example , @xcite ) all operate on the principle of modulating the transmission of electrons through the device by controlling the spin orbit interaction strength in the channel with a gate potential . here , we describe a different type of spinfet where the gate potential modulates transmission resonances in the channel , instead of the spin orbit interaction . by changing the gate potential \n , we can move the fermi level in the device from regions of maximum transmission ( pass bands ) to regions of minimum transmission ( stop bands ) , thus modulating the device conductance . \n an immediate benefit of this approach is a much reduced switching voltage . \n spin orbit interactions in technologically important semiconductors are typically weak and weakly sensitive to external potentials @xcite . as a result , a large swing in the gate potential ( few volts ) is often required to turn a short channel spinfet of the traditional type on or off @xcite . \n that results in considerable dynamic energy dissipation during switching . \n in contrast , our strategy is to modulate transmission resonances ( ramsauer and fano - type resonances ) that occur in the channel of traditional spinfets @xcite with a gate potential . \n since the resonance widths ( in energy ) are very small , a few mv change in the gate potential can take the device from on - resonance to off - resonance and switch it on or off . \n this approach results in a very small switching voltage ( a few mv instead of the few volts required in traditional spinfets ) resulting in much reduced dynamic energy dissipation @xcite . \n the downside of this strategy is that the temperature of operation must be low so that the thermal broadening in the electron energy remains much smaller than the widths of the transmission resonances . \n typically , this limits the temperature of operation to @xmath0 1 k for realistic device parameters @xcite . here \n , we show that this problem can be somewhat mitigated by using a dual - gate configuration ( inter - digitated gate ) which allows us to apply two different gate biases on different regions of the channel \n . this will allow us to engineer the conduction band profile within the channel in a way that will broaden the transmission resonances and extend the temperature of operation to higher temperatures . \n two additional benefits are : ( 1 ) the ratio of on - to - off conductance remains large over an extended temperature range , and ( 2 ) the device exhibits sharp turn - on or turn - off characteristics , making it ideal for application as an inverter . the inverter type behavior is much sought after in boolean logic circuits . \n the proposed spinfet with the dual - gate configuration is shown in fig . \n the structure consists of one or several quantum wires in parallel ( each with the lowest subband occupied ) sandwiched between two half - metallic ferromagnetic contacts . \n the use of parallel channels increases the overall conductance of the device . \n the potential on the outer gate ( @xmath1 ) is selected such that underneath this gate , the conduction band edge in the channel is at a location @xmath2 above the bottom of the majority spin band in the ferromagnets ( see fig . \n the bias on the inner gate ( @xmath3 ) is varied to modulate the conduction band edge underneath this gate by an amount @xmath4 around the quiescent value . \n accordingly , the conduction band profile @xmath5 along the channel will form the basic unit of a superlattice along the direction of current flow as shown in fig . \n the source and drain ferromagnets are magnetized along the channel ( x - direction ) and their magnetization vectors point in the same direction ( parallel magnetization ) . \n the superlattice potential causes miniband formation for majority spins entering from the source and exiting at the drain . \n when the fermi level is inside a miniband , the transmission through the device is relatively large and the transistor is on . by changing @xmath6 , one can move the miniband away from the fermi level ( or vice versa ) , thereby decreasing the transmission probability and turning the transistor off . \n the optimal device will require minimal change @xmath6 to turn the transistor on or off . \n furthermore , in order to reduce fabrication complexity , we also prefer fewest repetitions of the superlattice unit ( as few inter - digitated gates as possible ) . here , we show that even a single period of the superlattice unit , implemented with just a single pair of gates , is sufficient to yield a very low switching voltage of about 2.6 mv , and yet a large conductance on / off ratio of about 60 , up to a temperature of 10 k. the analysis described here can be easily extended to the case of multiple periods . \n use of multiple periods can enhance device performance by extending the temperature of operation to higher temperatures .    for simplicity \n , the conduction band diagram along the direction of current flow is modeled as shown in fig . \n the contact potentials are approximated by two positive delta - scatterers of strength @xmath7 at the contact / channel interfaces . \n this model is fairly accurate for heavy doping in the channel when the schottky barriers at the contact / channel interfaces become very narrow . \n the energy bands in the ferromagnets are modeled after the stoner - wohlfarth model which assumes that the majority and minority spin bands are split by an exchange energy @xmath8 . \n the fermi level is below the bottom of the minority spin band , so that the ferromagnets are 100% spin polarized at low temperatures ( i.e. they are half metallic ) . \n there is a rashba spin orbit interaction in the channel because of the symmetry breaking electric field at the heterointerface , but we assume that it is independent of the gate potential since the latter is never varied by more than a few mv and the spin orbit interaction strength is weakly sensitive to gate potentials @xcite . \n we calculate the conductance through the device using the ballistic model for spin transport developed in refs . @xcite . \n the @xmath9- and @xmath10-components of the wavefunction in the channel will be slightly different under the two gates for non - zero values of @xmath11 , but this subtlety is neglected here since @xmath12 is never any more than just a few mev , as we show later . for the same reason , \n any difference between the rashba - spin orbit coupling constants under the two gates is ignored . \n to calculate the linear response conductance of the spinfet under various gate biases , we first calculate the spin dependent transmission probability of an electron through the device following the recipe of refs . \n this technique is fairly involved and the reader is referred to refs . @xcite for the details . \n the results presented here are based on the assumption of the device parameters listed in table i.    fig . \n 3 is a plot of the zero temperature conductance ( in units of @xmath13 ) for the two following biasing configurations : ( a ) the curve labeled `` 1 '' corresponds to the case when the bias on the inner gate is fixed at @xmath14 = 4192 mev ( which corresponds to a transmission resonance when all gates are biased at the same potential ) , while the bias on the outer gate is varied by @xmath15 around the quiescent value of 4192 mev ; ( b ) the curve labeled `` 2 '' corresponds to the second biasing configuration when the bias on the outer gate is kept fixed at @xmath14 = 4192 mev and the bias on the inner gate is varied by @xmath15 around the quiescent value . \n a comparison of the curves labeled `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' reveals that it is advantageous to operate the device with @xmath16 = 2.58 mev , indicated by a vertical arrow in fig . \n 3 . with this value of @xmath16 , switching from the biasing configuration `` 1 '' ( @xmath17 ) to `` 2 '' ( @xmath18 ) switches the device from on ( @xmath19 ) to off ( @xmath20 ) . \n 4 is a plot of the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath21 in the two biasing configurations discussed above . \n hereafter , we label these two configurations `` on '' and `` off '' since they correspond to on and off states of the transistor . \n both in the on and off states , @xmath21 contains several peaks and troughs due to ramsauer and fano resonances in the conductance of the channel , features which we have analyzed thoroughly in the past @xcite . in the energy range [ 4198.5 - 4200.5 ] \n mev , the transmission coefficient reaches unity several times when the spinfet is biased in the on configuration but is close to zero when biased in the complementary scheme . \n therefore , the energy range [ 4198.5 - 4200.5 ] mev constitutes the `` pass band '' in the on configuration and also the `` stop band '' in the off configuration . \n consequently , if we place the fermi level within this energy range ( by appropriate channel doping , or even using a back gate ) , then we can switch the device on or off by going from the one gate biasing scheme to the other . since this requires changing the bias on any gate by at most 2.58 mv , \n the effective switching voltage @xmath22 is only 2.58 mv . \n we can estimate the dynamic energy dissipated during switching . \n assuming that the gate capacitance @xmath23 ( including interconnects ) is about 1 ff , the maximum energy dissipated during a switching event is @xmath24 = 3.3 @xmath25 10@xmath26 joules , which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller than what a typical transistor dissipates in the pentium iv chip today @xcite .    the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for @xmath21 in the on configuration ( distance between points @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig . \n 4 ) is roughly 1.5 mev . \n this is the effective width of the pass band . \n it is about three times the distance between the points @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which is the fwhm of the transmission coefficient versus energy curve when the inner and outer gates are biased at the _ same _ potential ( corresponding to @xmath31 under both gates ) . \n therefore , the use of a dual gate , as opposed to a single gate , has broadened the transmission resonance by a factor of 3 . \n 5 shows the transfer characteristic of the device ( conductance versus gate voltage ) at zero temperature . \n this plot displays the change in the conductance as the potential on the inner gate is gradually increased from 4192 mev to 4192 + @xmath32 mev while simultaneously reducing the potential on the outer gate from 4192 + 2.58 mev to 4192 + 2.58 - @xmath32 mev . \n we see that transistor has a fairly sharp switching characteristic  the transition width is only about 2 mv  which is the hallmark of a good inverter . \n the transistor performance obviously degrades at high temperatures because of thermal averaging over electron energy . \n thermal averaging can be viewed as a convolution of @xmath21 with a function of width roughly equal to 4 @xmath33 @xcite . \n therefore , the device performance is not expected to deteriorate substantially until @xmath34 , which is the distance between the points @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig . \n 4 . setting @xmath35 = 1.5 mev , we find that the upper limit on the temperature is about 5 k. over the energy range of 1.5 mev , the conductance in the off state stays very close to zero since @xmath21 remains approximately zero in this energy range . \n therefore , the dual - gate spinfet will retain a large on to off conductance ratio up to a temperature of at least 5 k.    the temperature dependence is shown in fig . \n 6 where the conductance of the device is plotted as a function of temperature for the two biasing configurations discussed above . \n table ii lists the values of the conductance on / off ratio calculated as a function of temperature for @xmath16 = 6 mev . \n the on / off ratio is about 60 at @xmath36 . \n this is comparable to what is typically obtained today with carbon nanotube transistors . \n one deleterious effect of high temperatures is that the maximum on conductance has dropped to @xmath37 . \n this can be remedied by using multiple parallel channels to increase the total device conductance , while still maintaining a large conductance on / off ratio . \n in conclusion , we have shown that using a dual gate configuration , it is possible to realize short - channel spinfets with large conductance on / off ratio at temperatures above that of liquid helium . \n these spinfets possess excellent inverter characteristics , making them ideal for low power logic circuits . \n the sharp turn - off behavior is conducive to good noise margin and restoration of logic levels at circuit nodes @xcite for fault - tolerant computing and signal processing . \n the very small power dissipation will also allow extremely high integration density . \n * figure 1 * : ( top ) cross -

{"ContextTokens": 3836, "GeneratedTokens": 117, "SynthesizedBody": "you might have suspected that my title is too timely , but as a matter of fact , it was a speculative one when it was proposed to one of the conveners in early may , much earlier than the announcement of @xmath1 appearance events at t2k @xcite . \n the resulted six clean events which fulfill the criteria for electron - like events in sk strongly suggest that @xmath0 has a nonzero value . \n their best fit value is around @xmath2 close to the chooz limit @xcite . \n it was soon followed by the minos collaboration which also obtained a relatively large value of @xmath0 @xcite . \n in fact , by taking account of these new data from t2k and minos into the global analysis the bari group concluded that it implies evidence for nonzero @xmath0 at confidence level ( cl ) higher than @xmath3 @xcite . \n the best fit value is @xmath4 . \n see also @xcite . \n i believe it an urgent matter to discuss what are the consequences of suggested large values of @xmath0 though it must be confirmed by the further running of these experiments as well as the ongoing reactor @xmath0 experiments @xcite . \n i stated in a talk in neutrino 2008 in christchurch that `` my personal prejudice is that @xmath0 is relatively large . \n if it is true it further encourages us to proceed to search for lepton cp violation and determination of the mass hierarchy '' @xcite . \n here is a brief recapitulation of the very simple reasoning which led me to the above statement . \n the lepton flavor mixing matrix , the mns matrix @xcite , @xmath5 , is a `` relative matrix '' @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the unitary matrices which diagonalize the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices , respectively . \n the mns matrix is composed of the three angles @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and a cp violating phase @xmath11 , the lepton analogue of the quark kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath12 @xcite . \n two of the angles are known to be large , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \n then , it is highly unlikely that only the remaining angle @xmath0 is extremely small , unless there is a good reason for tuning only @xmath0 into a small value . \n that is , if a symmetry exists such that @xmath0 vanishes at the symmetry limit , there is a natural reason why only @xmath0 is small among the three mixing angles . \n there exists many examples for such symmetry including @xmath15 symmetry and discrete symmetries . for a review \n see , e.g. @xcite . \n it is my prejudice that the large @xmath0 suggested by t2k and minos measurement , if confirmed , would give a tough time for these symmetries which aims at explaining small @xmath0 , unless a large correction to the symmetry limit is shown to be naturally induced . \n without having compelling reasons for large @xmath0 , one had to take into account the possibility that @xmath0 is small in thinking about ways for measurement of cp phase and determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy . \n that is why many of the existing proposals for such apparatus naturally include those that have sensitivities to a tiny value of @xmath0 with varying limiting values . \n they include , for example ( sorry for my arbitrary choice ) , neutrino factory @xcite , beta beam @xcite , superbeam enriched with two detectors @xcite , and their combination @xcite . for their sensitivities see e.g. , @xcite . \n i wonder , however , that racing for @xmath0 sensitivity could have produced an atmosphere that the better facility is the one which has sensitivities to smaller values of @xmath0 . in seeing the t2k and minos indication for large @xmath0 \n , i believe that it is the time to start thinking about changing the gear to more relevant things .    what is good if @xmath0 is as large as @xmath16 ? \n my first answer is that a wide range of possibilities becomes open for strategies and setups aiming at exploring lepton cp violation through neutrino oscillation . \n i believe that in the context of conventional superbeam @xcite unambiguous evidence for lepton cp violation requires a megaton scale water cherenkov detector , or a @xmath17 kton liquid ar detector @xcite . yet , the suggested large value of @xmath0 , still need to be confirmed and assumed here , stimulates to examine other possibilities such as reactor - accelerator combined method @xcite , combining different accelerator measurement @xcite , or the one adding one more new facility which may or may not require an extensive cost @xcite . \n some more exotic options are discussed in @xcite . \n it is notable that the cern - memphys project , despite an almost vacuum setting , has a reasonable sensitivity to the mass hierarchy to @xmath18 before combining with atmospheric neutrino data @xcite . \n sometime ago the cp sensitivity achievable by the reactor - accelerator combined method was examined in detail @xcite . \n the results obtained in this analysis indicate that combining data taken and to be taken by all planned experiments is not enough to guarantee discovery of cp violation in @xmath11 coverage of more than 30% in most of the allowed region of @xmath0 even though one assumes that the mass hierarchy is known . \n it should be noticed , as observed and emphasized in @xcite , that the cp sensitivity is severely damaged by the parameter degeneracy due to unknown neutrino mass hierarchies @xcite . \n for a recent overview of the parameter degeneracy see @xcite . \n i believe that the one of the most important implications of the assumed large value of @xmath0 is that one can think of `` all in one '' ( _ obento _ in japanese , everything in a lunch box ) approach . as we saw in the above , a traditional approaches for cp and the mass hierarchy entailed in aggressive proposals @xcite to include a very small value of @xmath0 within the scope . though powerful and \n the redundancy is of course welcome , they may not be the optimal cost - effective apparatus for large @xmath0 . \n to my opinion , what is good in living in the world with large @xmath0 is that one can achieve the same goal by less expensive `` all in one '' setting . \n more concretely , i mean by it a single detector ( such as a megaton water cherenkov detector ) assuming prior existence of intense neutrino beam . \n timely enough the loi of hyper - kamiokande ( hyper - k ) project has just appeared @xcite . \n therefore , let us briefly discuss the spirit of the `` all in one '' approach by taking this concrete setting .    with intense neutrino beam from 1.66 mw proton driver at j - parc it is demonstrated that hyper - k with 0.56 megaton fiducial mass has a superb performance for discovery of cp violation , which covers most of the region of @xmath0 allowed at 3@xmath19 cl @xcite . \n see fig . \n 24 of @xcite which assumes the known mass hierarchy and for 1.5 ( 3.5 ) years of neutrino ( antineutrino ) running . \n it shows a remarkable accuracy of determination of @xmath11 with 1@xmath19 error smaller than 20 degree for @xmath20 . \n however , if the mass hierarchy is unknown the analysis suffers from the sign-@xmath21 degeneracy @xcite . \n while allowing clean measurement of cp violation , a drawback of setting with such short baseline is that it is difficult to determine the mass hierarchy , another important goal of future neutrino experiments . \n that is why many proposals for determining all the unknowns in neutrino parameters exploit baselines of several thousand km . \n if @xmath0 is large , however , the mass hierarchy can be determined by high - statistics observation of atmospheric neutrinos , the idea discussed by many authors . \n see e.g. , @xcite for early references . \n the analysis presented in @xcite indicates that the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy depend very much on which octant @xmath22 lives but it can be carried out by @xmath23 years running of hyper - k for large @xmath0 . \n it should also be mentioned that having other capabilities such as proton decay discovery is of crucial importance . \n i emphasize that the realization of `` all in one '' approach is , of course , not limited to this particular version discussed above . \n but , it is certainly encouraging to see the concrete example appeared which is armed with the realistic simulations based on their long - term experiences at super - k . \n is theoretical treatment of neutrino oscillation well oiled when a large value of @xmath0 close to the chooz limit is established ? \n for example , does the well known treatment of the degeneracy @xcite need modification ? \n if yes , to what extent ?     computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _ \n _ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) . \n the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]   computed numerically as a function of energy ( green dashed line ) , the one calculated by the cervera _ \n _ formula ( blue dash - dotted line ) , and with our formula with large @xmath0 corrections ( red solid line ) . the left and the right panels are for baselines @xmath24 km and @xmath25 km for which the matter density is taken as 2.8 g/@xmath26 and 3.6 g/@xmath26 , respectively . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=241 ]    to answer these questions a framework dubbed as `` @xmath27 perturbation theory '' ( @xmath28 ) has been formulated @xcite by assuming @xmath29 , which roughly corresponds to the chooz limit . by doing \n so one can systematically compute the large-@xmath0 corrections to the cervera _ \n et al . _ formula @xcite \n . while large corrections arise in certain limited region of energy and baseline as indicated in fig . \n [ fpemu_1000 - 4000 ] , one can show on general ground that the correction terms are of order @xmath30 . \n ( by general argument one can show that they are the terms proportional to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 @xcite . ) therefore , the large-@xmath0 correction to the degenerate solutions obtained with the cervera _ \n _ formula , generally speaking , is not sizable . \n see @xcite for more detail . \n assuming that the t2k and minos hints for large @xmath0 will be confirmed , i argued that we are at the turning point of thinking of our strategy of how to explore the remaining unknowns in the lepton flavor mixing . in particular , it allows us to rely on `` all in one '' approach . \n i hope that the personal view can be strengthened by further exploration toward nufact 2012 . \n this work was supported in part by kakenhi , grant - in - aid for scientific research no . \n 23540315 , japan society for the promotion of science . \n 99      m.  apollonio _ et al . _ [ chooz collaboration ] , eur . \n j.   c * 27 * , 331 ( 2003 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0301017 ] ; see also , the palo verde collaboration , f.  boehm _ et al . _ , phys .  rev . \n d * 64 * , 112001 ( 2001 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0107009 ] . for \n a bound from accelerator experiment , see m.  h.  ahn _ \n et al . _ [ k2k collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 93 * , 051801 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0402017 ] . \n p.  adamson _ et al . \n _ [ the minos collaboration ] , phys .  rev . \n d * 82 * , 051102 ( 2010 ) [ arxiv:1006.0996 [ hep - ex ] ] . \n s.  geer , phys . \n d * 57 * , 6989 ( 1998 ) [ erratum - ibid . \n d * 59 * , 039903 ( 1999 ) ] [ arxiv : hep - ph/9712290 ] ; a.  de rujula , m.  b.  gavela and p.  hernandez , nucl . \n b * 547 * , 21 ( 1999 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/9811390 ] . \n p.  zucchelli , phys . \n b * 532 * , 166 ( 2002 ) . \n j.  bouchez , m.  lindroos and m.  mezzetto , aip conf . \n * 721 * , 37 ( 2004 ) [ arxiv : hep - ex/0310059 ] . \n j.  burguet - castell , d.  casper , j.  j.  gomez - cadenas , p.  hernandez , f.  sanchez , nucl . \n phys .   * \n b695 * , 217 - 240 ( 2004 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0312068 ] . \n m.  ishitsuka _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n d * 72 * , 033003 ( 2005 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0504026 ] . \n t.  kajita _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n d * 75 * , 013006 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0609286 ] . f.  dufour _ et al . \n _ , phys . \n rev .   * d81 * , 093001 ( 2010 ) . \n [ arxiv:1001.5165 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  bandyopadhyay _ et al . \n _ [ iss physics working group ] , rept .  prog . \n * 72 * ( 2009 ) 106201 [ arxiv:0710.4947 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n h.  minakata and h.  nunokawa , phys . \n b * 495 * , 369 ( 2000 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0004114 ] ; j.  sato , nucl . \n instrum . \n * a472 * ( 2001 ) 434 [ arxiv : hep - ph/0008056 ] ; b.  richter , arxiv : hep - ph/0008222 . \n see , e.g. , p.  huber , m.  lindner , m.  rolinec , t.  schwetz , w.  winter , phys . \n rev .   * d70 * , 073014 ( 2004 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0403068 ] . \n o.  mena , h.  nunokawa , s.  j.  parke , phys . \n rev .   * d75 * , 033002 ( 2007 ) . \n [ hep - ph/0609011 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 3411307708718, "RequestID": "c447ded194bd41f1b8b7b73dd154c6d5", "TotalTokens": 3953}
{"ContextTokens": 3342, "GeneratedTokens": 147, "SynthesizedBody": "generative adversarial nets were recently introduced as an alternative framework for training generative models in order to sidestep the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations . \n adversarial nets have the advantages that markov chains are never needed , only backpropagation is used to obtain gradients , no inference is required during learning , and a wide variety of factors and interactions can easily be incorporated into the model . \n furthermore , as demonstrated in @xcite , it can produce state of the art log - likelihood estimates and realistic samples .    in an unconditioned generative model \n , there is no control on modes of the data being generated . \n however , by conditioning the model on additional information it is possible to direct the data generation process . \n such conditioning could be based on class labels , on some part of data for inpainting like @xcite , or even on data from different modality .    in this work \n we show how can we construct the conditional adversarial net . and \n for empirical results we demonstrate two set of experiment . \n one on mnist digit data set conditioned on class labels and one on mir flickr 25,000 dataset @xcite for multi - modal learning . \n despite the many recent successes of supervised neural networks ( and convolutional networks in particular ) @xcite , it remains challenging to scale such models to accommodate an extremely large number of predicted output categories . \n a second issue is that much of the work to date has focused on learning one - to - one mappings from input to output . \n however , many interesting problems are more naturally thought of as a probabilistic one - to - many mapping . \n for instance in the case of image labeling there may be many different tags that could appropriately applied to a given image , and different ( human ) annotators may use different ( but typically synonymous or related ) terms to describe the same image .    one way to help address the first issue is to leverage additional information from other modalities : for instance , by using natural language corpora to learn a vector representation for labels in which geometric relations are semantically meaningful . \n when making predictions in such spaces , we benefit from the fact that when prediction errors we are still often ` close ' to the truth ( e.g. predicting table instead of chair ) , and also from the fact that we can naturally make predictive generalizations to labels that were not seen during training time . works such as @xcite \n have shown that even a simple linear mapping from image feature - space to word - representation - space can yield improved classification performance .    one way to address \n the second problem is to use a conditional probabilistic generative model , the input is taken to be the conditioning variable and the one - to - many mapping is instantiated as a conditional predictive distribution . \n @xcite take a similar approach to this problem , and train a multi - modal deep boltzmann machine on the mir flickr 25,000 dataset as we do in this work . \n additionally , in @xcite the authors show how to train a supervised multi - modal neural language model , and they are able to generate descriptive sentence for images . \n generative adversarial nets were recently introduced as a novel way to train a generative model . \n they consists of two ` adversarial ' models : a generative model @xmath1 that captures the data distribution , and a discriminative model @xmath2 that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than @xmath1 . \n both @xmath1 and @xmath2 could be a non - linear mapping function , such as a multi - layer perceptron .    to learn a generator distribution @xmath3 over data data @xmath4 , \n the generator builds a mapping function from a prior noise distribution @xmath5 to data space as @xmath6 . \n and the discriminator , @xmath7 , outputs a single scalar representing the probability that @xmath4 came form training data rather than @xmath3 . \n @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both trained simultaneously : we adjust parameters for @xmath1 to minimize @xmath8 and adjust parameters for @xmath9 to minimize @xmath10 , as if they are following the two -

player minimax game would be as eq [ eq : minimaxgame - definition - conditioned ] @xmath15 + \\mathbb{e}_{\\bm{z } \\sim p_z(\\bm{z})}[\\log ( 1 - d(g(\\bm{z } | \\bm{y})))].\\ ] ]    fig [ fig : diagram ] illustrates the structure of a simple conditional adversarial net . \n we trained a conditional adversarial net on mnist images conditioned on their class labels , encoded as one - hot vectors .    in the generator net , \n a noise prior @xmath16 with dimensionality 100 was drawn from a uniform distribution within the unit hypercube . \n both @xmath16 and @xmath13 are mapped to hidden layers with rectified linear unit ( relu ) activation @xcite , with layer sizes 200 and 1000 respectively , before both being mapped to second , combined hidden relu layer of dimensionality 1200 . \n we then have a final sigmoid unit layer as our output for generating the 784-dimensional mnist samples . \n the discriminator maps @xmath4 to a maxout @xcite layer with 240 units and 5 pieces , and @xmath13 to a maxout layer with 50 units and 5 pieces . both of the hidden layers mapped to a joint maxout layer with 240 units and 4 pieces before being fed to the sigmoid layer . \n ( the precise architecture of the discriminator is not critical as long as it has sufficient power ; we have found that maxout units are typically well suited to the task . ) \n the model was trained using stochastic gradient decent with mini - batches of size 100 and initial learning rate of @xmath17 which was exponentially decreased down to @xmath18 with decay factor of @xmath19 . \n also momentum was used with initial value of @xmath20 which was increased up to @xmath21 . \n dropout @xcite with probability of 0.5 was applied to both the generator and discriminator . and \n best estimate of log -

likelihood of the test set using the parzen window distribution . \n ( see @xcite for more details of how this estimate is constructed . ) \n the conditional adversarial net results that we present are comparable with some other network based , but are outperformed by several other approaches  including non - conditional adversarial nets . \n we present these results more as a proof - of - concept than as demonstration of efficacy , and believe that with further exploration of hyper - parameter space and architecture that the conditional model should match or exceed the non - conditional results . \n fig [ fig : mnist ] shows some of the generated samples . \n each row is conditioned on one label and each column is a different generated sample .    . \n parzen window - based log - likelihood estimates for mnist . \n we followed the same procedure as @xcite for computing these values .

tags . \n user - generated metadata differ from more ` canonical ' image labelling schems in that they are typically more descriptive , and are semantically much closer to how humans describe images with natural language rather than just identifying the objects present in an image . \n another aspect of ugm is that synoymy is prevalent and different users may use different vocabulary to describe the same concepts  consequently , having an efficient way to normalize these labels becomes important . \n conceptual word embeddings @xcite can be very useful here since related concepts end up being represented by similar vectors .    in this section \n we demonstrate automated tagging of images , with multi - label predictions , using conditional adversarial nets to generate a ( possibly multi - modal ) distribution of tag - vectors conditional on image features .    for image features we pre - train a convolutional model similar to the one from @xcite on the full imagenet dataset with 21,000 labels @xcite . \n we use the output of the last fully connected layer with 4096 units as image representations .    for the world representation \n we first gather a corpus of text from concatenation of user - tags , titles and descriptions from yfcc100 m dataset metadata . \n after pre - processing and cleaning of the text we trained a skip - gram model @xcite with word vector size of 200 . \n and we omitted any word appearing less than 200 times from the vocabulary , thereby ending up with a dictionary of size 247465 . \n we keep the convolutional model and the language model fixed during training of the adversarial net . and leave the experiments when we even backpropagate through these models as future work .    for our experiments we use mir flickr 25,000 dataset @xcite , and extract the image and tags features using the convolutional model and language model we described above . \n images without any tag were omitted from our experiments and annotations were treated as extra tags . \n the first 150,000 examples were used as training set . \n images with multiple tags were repeated inside the training set once for each associated tag .    for evaluation , we generate 100 samples for each image and find top 20 closest words using cosine similarity of vector representation of the words in the vocabulary to each sample . \n then we select the top 10 most common words among all 100 samples . \n table [ table : samples ] shows some samples of the user assigned tags and annotations along with the generated tags . \n the best working model s generator receives gaussian noise of size 100 as noise prior and maps it to 500 dimension relu layer . \n and maps 4096 dimension image feature vector to 2000 dimension relu hidden layer . \n both of these layers are mapped to a joint representation of 200 dimension linear layer which would output the generated word vectors . \n the discriminator is consisted of 500 and 1200 dimension relu hidden layers for word vectors and image features respectively and maxout layer with 1000 units and 3 pieces as the join layer which is finally fed to the one single sigmoid unit . \n the model was trained using stochastic gradient decent with mini -

{"ContextTokens": 3944, "GeneratedTokens": 298, "SynthesizedBody": "a fundamental challenge in nuclear physics is trying to understand the structure of hadrons in terms of their quark - gluon constituents , which are governed by the underlying theory of strong interaction called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n measurements of exclusive processes such as pion electroproduction make it possible to extract meson form factors and study the quark - gluon distributions in the nucleon . \n however , in order to develop a description of the atomic nucleus based on qcd , one also needs to understand how the properties and interactions of hadrons change in the nuclear medium . \n measurements of exclusive processes in the nuclear medium sometimes help one to understand the interactions because qcd has definite predictions for exclusive processes in the medium . \n one such prediction is the phenomenon of color transparency ( ct ) .    in the study of ct \n , we can observe the interplay between the creation of quark systems with small transverse size , as we would expect from qcd , and the possible suppression of interactions of such point - like configurations ( plc ) with the nuclear medium . \n a further complication is introduced by the formation time of the final hadron , which limits the lifetime of the plc . to understand this phenomenon , it is thus important to study the dependencies on the four - momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon , @xmath7 ( size of the initial plc , typically scales as @xmath11 ) , hadron momentum ( formation length ) , and target mass @xmath12 ( path length through the medium ) .    due to the higher probability to form a plc , a two - quark rather than a three - quark system \n is preferable , making pion electroproduction a natural choice for an initial study . \n however , pion electroproduction introduces the assumption of a quasi - free interaction of the photon with a virtual pion in the medium . \n the plausibility of this assumption can be addressed by comparing the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections from a nucleus with those obtained using a nucleon target , as differences in the behavior of this ratio would indicate effects of the nuclear medium resulting in the breakdown of the quasi - free assumption . \n nuclear transparency is a natural observable in the quest to identify the onset of color transparency . \n nuclear transparency is defined as the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a process on a bound nucleon inside a nucleus to that from a free nucleon . \n since the nuclear medium is not opaque to hadrons , color transparency will lead to an increase in nuclear transparency as a function of momentum transfer , hadron momentum and target mass . \n this simultaneous increase of nuclear transparency is distinct from those from other conventional processes such as rescattering . \n moreover , it illustrates the need for careful experiment design that simultaneously measures the @xmath7 and @xmath12 dependence of nuclear transparency and at the same time tests alternative reaction mechanisms that can produce potential increases in nuclear transparency .    with the availability of high - intensity , \n continuous electron beams up to 6 gev at jefferson lab it became possible for the first time to determine simultaneously the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependences of the differential pion cross sections for @xmath7 in the 1 - 5 gev@xmath2 range . \n these data were acquired in 2004 for @xmath1h , @xmath2h , @xmath3c , @xmath4al , @xmath5cu and @xmath6au targets . \n the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependence of the extracted transparency were published in  @xcite . \n the purpose of this work is to describe the experiment and analysis and to present and discuss additional results . \n the article is organized as follows : the next sections describe methods for extracting nuclear transparencies and discuss some earlier data . \n section  [ sec : formalism ] introduces the basic cross section formalism of pion electroproduction . in section  [ sec : experiment ] the experiment is described including the experimental setup . \n the data analysis is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] . \n the determination of the cross sections and the extraction of the nuclear transparencies and their associated uncertainties are described in section  [ sec : dettransp ] and section  [ sec : sys ] . \n the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . \n the global features of the cross section ratio and the nuclear transparencies are discussed and a comparison is made with results of recent calculations . \n in a simple picture of pion electroproduction from the nucleus , the electron exchanges a virtual photon with a proton which is moving due to its fermi momentum . \n the struck proton turns into a neutron ejecting a positively charged pion ( quasi - free approximation ) . in the quasi - free picture , \n the ejected pion may interact with the residual nucleons and the fraction of pions which can escape from the nucleus is the nuclear transparency of pions . in reality , the scattering process is more complicated and the deviations from this picture reveal much about the nucleus and their constituents . in the simple quasi - free picture , \n the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross section from a bound proton inside the nucleus is expected to be the same as that from a free proton . \n assuming the dominance of the quasi - free process , one can extract the nuclear transparency of the pions by taking the ratio of the acceptance corrected cross sections from the nuclear target to those from the proton . \n nuclear transparency quantifies the interactions of the outgoing pion with the residual nucleons on its way out of the nuclei , and is thus the key observable in searching for ct effects . \n color transparency was first proposed by brodsky and mueller  @xcite in 1982 , and refers to the vanishing of the hadron - nucleon interaction for hadrons produced in exclusive processes . at sufficiently high momentum transfers , where the hadron is produced with small transverse size , @xmath13  @xcite \n , the fast - moving hadron also has a compact longitudinal size due to lorentz contraction . \n such a reduced size quark - gluon state is called a point - like configuration ( plc ) . \n the formation length , the distance over which the plc travels before the hadron reaches its final size can be written , @xmath14    assuming a linear expansion in time , where @xmath15 is the speed of the hadron in the lab frame and @xmath16 is the life time of the plc in its rest frame . \n qcd predicts that the cross section for the interaction of a small @xmath17 dipole is proportional to @xmath18 in the leading order approximation , where @xmath19 is the transverse separation between the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 . \n if the @xmath17 dipole remains small ( pointlike ) over the range of the nuclear system , the nucleus will be transparent to the produced hadron . \n this can be accomplished at large momentum transfers where the formation length is sufficiently large .    at finite energies , however , the mechanism for the expansion and contraction of the interacting small system is more complex . \n the quantum diffusion model  @xcite assumes that quarks separate in the transverse direction at the speed of light and that their quark separation is proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the longitudinal distance from the production point to the position of the particle . \n the formation length in this model is determined from the average value of the dominant energy denominator . @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momentum and mass of the hadron , respectively , while @xmath27 is the mass of a typical intermediate state of the hadron . \n the precise value for @xmath28 is a matter of great uncertainty  @xcite with estimates between 0.25 and 1.4 gev@xmath2 . \n the onset of color transparency is expected at lower energies for production of mesons , for instance of pions , than for production of baryons , because the quark - antiquark pair is more likely to form a small size object  @xcite .    in pion electroproduction , \n the coherence length , defined as the distance over which the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath17 pair , is smaller than the nucleon radius at jlab energies , and for the present experiment it is essentially constant . \n this removes any coherence length dependence through t - channel @xmath29 exchange , in which the incident electron scatters from a virtual photon bringing it on - shell . such a coherence length dependence can mimic a ct - like energy dependence . \n color transparency has recently been put into the context of a qcd factorization theorem for longitudinally polarized photons in meson electroproduction . \n it predicts that for sufficiently high values of @xmath7 , at fixed @xmath30 and fixed momentum transfer to the nucleon , @xmath31 , the amplitude can be expressed in terms of a short - distance ( hard ) process , a distribution amplitude describing the final state meson , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite . \n the latter describe the long - distance ( soft ) physics . \n the factorization theorem has been proven at asymptotically high @xmath7 , but showing its validity at finite , high @xmath7 requires stringent tests of all necessary conditions . \n the unambiguous observation of the onset of ct is a critical precondition for the validity of the factorization theorem . \n this is because where ct applies the outgoing meson retains a small transverse size ( inter - quark distance ) while soft interactions like multiple gluon exchange between the meson produced from the hard interaction and the baryon are highly suppressed . \n factorization is thus rigorously not possible without ct . \n the first experiments designed to search for color transparency used the @xmath32 reaction and were performed at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the elastic @xmath33 cross section in the nucleus and hydrogen . \n this ratio initially increased as a function of the beam energy and then decreased , with a peak near 9 gev . though this behavior was not predicted by traditional nuclear physics calculations , it is currently not attributed to ct . \n instead it is associated with nuclear filtering  @xcite , which is related to the suppression of the long range components in the wave function , or to the threshold for charm resonance production  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was also measured using the a(@xmath34 ) reaction at stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )  @xcite and at jefferson lab  @xcite . in this case \n , the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the experimental yield and the one obtained from plane wave impulse approximation . \n the ratio was found to be energy independent from @xmath7 @xmath35 2 gev@xmath2 to 8.1 gev@xmath2 for deuterium , carbon , iron , and gold targets , thus indicating no significant ct effect . \n the absence of the ct effect in this channel has been interpreted as an indication that the proton formation length may only have been as large as internucleonic distances , rather than the size of the nucleus in these experiments  @xcite . \n ct measurements using coherent and incoherent @xmath36 production have been performed at fermilab  @xcite and more recently at desy  @xcite . \n the nuclear transparency was defined as @xmath37 . \n the results from fermilab were parametrized with a function @xmath38 , and at a first glance , the observed positive slope of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath7 appeared to contradict the flat @xmath7 dependence predicted by the glauber multiple scattering mechanism . \n however , the results have since been interpreted as a coherence length effect  @xcite , in which for kinematics with large coherence length , the virtual @xmath17 pair may undergo interactions with the nucleus before the hard interaction that puts it on - shell . \n the kinematics of the fermilab experiment were not at a constant @xmath40 , and thus the variation of @xmath39 with @xmath7 was attributed to a reduction in the initial state interactions rather than to a reduction in final state interactions . \n the more recent measurements from desy , ranging between @xmath7=0.9 - 3 gev@xmath2 and at constant @xmath40 , showed a rise in nuclear transparency with @xmath7 consistent with theoretical calculations of ct  @xcite . \n the most convincing evidence for the existence of color transparency comes from an experiment performed at fermilab  @xcite . \n there , the cross section of diffractive dissociation of 500 gev/@xmath41 pions into dijets was measured and parametrized with @xmath42=@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 cross section in free space . \n the free parameter , @xmath39 , was fit to the data with the result @xmath461.6 . \n this result was in agreement with calculations assuming 100% color transparency and was very different from the normal @xmath45 cross section , which has a dependence @xmath42=@xmath47 .    at low energies , hints of ct effects \n have also been observed from pion photoproduction from helium , @xmath48 , at jefferson lab  @xcite . \n ct can be measured in these reactions where @xmath7=0 by measuring the cross section vs. the four momentum transfer squared , @xmath49 to the hadron system . \n the data showed 2@xmath42 deviations from the traditional glauber calculations and the slope of the data vs. @xmath31 was in better agreement with calculations including ct . \n the kinematics of the pion electroproduction reaction studied here are shown in figure  [ fig : eepi_kinematics ] . \n the incident electron has a three momentum of @xmath50 . \n the scattered electron has a three momentum @xmath51 and travels at a polar angle @xmath52 in the laboratory frame with respect to the direction of the incident beam . \n the three momentum vectors of the incoming and outgoing electron define the scattering plane . \n the corresponding four -

dynamics method is that it does not assume a mean field . nor \n does it assume a long - time average potential for the scattering of any two charges , which is necessary in the statistical way to solve poisson s equation to obtain the mean potential in a plasma . \n shaviv and shaviv attribute the differences between their simulations and salpeter s theory to dynamic effects . \n since their claims have been met with skepticism , we have conducted independent molecular - dynamics simulations to confirm the existence of dynamic effects . \n * for consistency , we developed molecular - dynamics simulations using the same basic numerical methods as shaviv and shaviv . to quell the skeptics , we evaluated the validity of each assumption and approximation before implementing it in our own simulations . \n previous publications @xcite describe this process and show that we did not find any errors in the methods used by shaviv and shaviv . \n once we validated their techniques , we used our independently developed simulations to examine dynamic effects in screening . * \n our numerical simulation consisted of a 3-dimensional box with 1000 particles ( half protons and half electrons ) interacting via the coulomb potential . the temperature and density of the solar core ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) provided the velocity distributions and inter - particle spacing . \n we applied periodic boundary conditions and the minimum - image convention . in order to deal with the long - range nature of the coulomb potential \n , we implemented a cut - off radius . with this method , particles separated by a greater distance than the cut - off radius \n were not included in the potential sums as explained in section [ sect : long - range ] . \n quantum effects were included through the use of effective potentials as desribed in section [ sect : qm_effects ] . \n detailed analysis of the use of a cutoff radius and effective quantum potential as well as tests of our simulations can be found elsewhere @xcite . \n the long - range nature of the coulomb potential introduces additional challenges to a molecular - dynamics simulation . for many of the materials \n commonly modeled using molecular dynamics , short - range potentials such as the lennard - jones potential of a simple fluid @xmath9\\ ] ] are appropriate . \n this potential decreases drastically with the separation of the two particles . \n therefore it can be truncated quite reasonably at a distance of @xmath10 . \n the coulomb potential , on the other hand , decays slowly with particle separation . \n particles at much greater distances must be included in order to accurately compute the force on each particle . \n ideally , the contribution of each of the infinite image particles should be included in the potential sums and the potential should never be truncated . \n unfortunately this would take infinite computing time and is therefore impractical . \n fortunately , more efficient techniques have been developed to compute long - range interactions ( see , for example , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) .    in their simulations , \n shaviv and shaviv took advantage of the screening of the plasma to shorten the effective range of the potential . \n they assume that interactions between particles that are farther apart than a few debye lengths will be screened by the surrounding plasma . \n we have tested the truncation of the potential and determined that this assumption is appropriate for our simulation @xcite . \n this enables us to truncate the interactions beyond a few debye lengths , reducing the infinte - range potential to a manageable long - range potential . \n when particles in a two - component plasma are closer than the thermal debroglie wavelength @xmath11 the effects of quantum diffraction and symmetry become significant . \n the thermal debroglie wavelengths for our system are shown in table [ table : debroglie_wavelengths ] . \n .thermal debroglie wavelenghts at @xmath12 [ table : debroglie_wavelengths ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the average interparticle distance in our model is @xmath13 . since @xmath14 , \n a classical treatment is generally sufficient for the protons . \n however , it will be common to have two electrons that are separated by a distance less than @xmath15 , requiring quantum mechanical treatment . \n we therefore include the quantum approximations used by @xcite , i.e. the effective pair potentials derived for a hydrogen plasma by @xcite . \n quantum diffraction effects are described by @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the pair . @xmath19 \n the exclusion principle between electrons is included by adding @xmath20 these potentials only differ from the classical coulomb potential at short distances , where quantum effects are relevant . \n [ plotone ] shows the contribution to the effective potential from quantum corrections to the electrons and protons . \n it is clear that quantum effects for electrons can not be neglected at the high temperature of the solar core . \n the correction for proton - proton pairs is negligible , but electron - proton pairs do experience diffraction effects at close distances . \n therefore we include quantum corrections for both electron - electron and electron - proton interactions . \n 0.5 cm      the goal of this work is to compute the energy exchanged between a pair of approaching protons and the surrounding plasma in order to evaluate the screening energy and the dependence of the screening energy on the relative kinetic energy of the pair . in order to accomplish this goal \n , we use a method similar to that of shaviv and shaviv . the technique for tracking approaching proton pairs and the energy they exchange with the plasma \n is described below . \n \\1 . for each proton @xmath21 , find all protons approaching it . \n choose the closest approaching proton and call it the partner of proton @xmath21 . \n track the pair as they approach and then move apart . \n record their distance of closest approach , @xmath22 , and the energy of the pair at their closest point @xmath23    \\3 . \n continue tracking the pair until they are separated by a distance @xmath24 . for our simulations \n , @xmath25 is a sufficient distance to represent the separation of the pair . at this point , \n record the far - apart energy of the pair @xmath26 beyond this point , the pair is no longer tracked . \n find a new partner for proton @xmath21 , and repeat the process for @xmath21 and its new partner . \n since a proton pair s departure from their closest point to a distance @xmath24 is symmetric to an approach from @xmath24 to @xmath22 , we use the information obtained from the departure to examine the dynamic effect of the plasma on the screening enhancement for interacting proton pairs as they approach a separation at which nuclear reactions are possible . the dynamic information of each proton and its partner _ du jour _ are recorded at each time step . \n first we examine the distribution of the distance of closest approach of proton pairs . fig . \n [ plottwo ] shows the number of pairs that achieved each closest distance @xmath22 . \n we see that most pairs are able to get at least as close as the average distance of neighboring protons @xmath27 . \n .,width=566 ]    -0.2 cm    0.3 cm    as seen in fig . \n [ plotthree ] , pairs of protons with higher far - apart kinetic energy @xmath28 are more likely to get closer to each other than pairs with lower far - apart kinetic energy .     and the closest separation of the pair @xmath22.,width=566 ]    the screening energy is the energy exchanged between a pair of protons and the surrounding plasma . \n it represents the combined effect of the neighboring protons and electrons on the interacting pair . \n salpeter s mean - field theory gives an expression for the average screened coulomb potential that includes the energy exchanged between interacting protons and the plasma during their approach @xmath29 salpeter s theory averages the effect of the kinetic energy of each particle so that the screening energy only depends on distance . \n however , our simulations show that the screening energy also depends on the kinetic energy of the protons . \n protons with high kinetic energy tend to gain less energy from the plasma during the interaction , while protons with low kinetic energy gain more energy from the plasma . \n @xcite refer to this as the dynamic effect .    for the purpose of comparison \n , we define the screening energy in the simulations to be the difference in the energy of the pair when they are far apart and when they are close together . \n @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 since all pairs have the same far - apart distance @xmath24 , @xmath33 this yields a screening energy of @xmath34    a key ingredient in this equation for the screening energy is the difference in the kinetic energy of a pair when the partner protons are far apart and when they are at their closest separation . \n @xmath35 here we examine the relationship between the average change in the kinetic energy of a pair and their distance of closest approach , shown in fig . \n [ plotfour ] . \n this energy change is compared with the coulomb potential and the screened coulomb potential from debye - hckel theory . \n we see that at the distance of closest approach , the average kinetic energy exchanged between a pair of protons and the surrounding plasma has the form of the screened coulomb potential . \n @xmath36 on average , the protons interact in a mean field potential of @xmath37 as salpeter s theory states . \n we can rewrite the average screening energy as @xmath38 as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , leaving us with @xmath41 the average screening energy in the simulation is the same as the average screening energy derived in salpeter s theory . \n this confirms that _ on average _ , the system can be described by the screened coulomb potential of the debye - hckel theory as salpeter contends .     on the closest distance @xmath22 , \n compared with the coulomb potential and screened coulomb potential.,width=566 ]    -0.4 cm    .3 cm    in order to see the dynamic effect on screening , we must look at the relationship between the screening energy and the far - apart kinetic energy of proton pairs . \n [ plotfive ] shows the average energy gained from the plasma by pairs of protons with a given far - apart kinetic energy in the simulation . for comparison , \n the debye - hckel screening energy computed at a distance equal to the average closest - approach disance of pairs of protons with each far - apart kinetic energy is also shown . \n the screening energy of a pair of interacting protons depends on the relative kinetic energy of the pair . \n pairs with far - apart kinetic energy greater than the thermal energy tend to gain less energy from the plasma than the mean - field screening energy , while pairs with lower far - apart kinetic energy gain energy more energy from the plasma than the mean - field screening energy . \n @xmath42    @xmath43    when the screening energy from the simulation is averaged over pairs with all @xmath44 , the result is the same as in salpeter s theory . \n this reaffirms that salpeter s theory is appropriate as a mean - field treatment . \n however , the dynamic effect becomes relevant when pairs with high relative kinetic energy are singled out , as in solar nuclear reactions . \n pairs with far - apart kinetic energy near the gamov energy of p+p reactions ( @xmath45 ) will , on average , lose energy to the plasma rather than gaining energy . \n because of this dependence of the screening energy on the relative kinetic energy of a pair of interacting particles , we conclude that the mean - field approach is not appropriate for computing nuclear reaction rates . \n ( squares ) on the far - apart kinetic energy @xmath46 . \n the debye - hckel screening energy computed at the averege closest - approach distance of pairs of protons with a given far - apart kinetic energy is shown ( circles ) for comparison.,width=566 ]    -0.4 cm    .3 cm \n our simulations confirm that the static debye screening potential describes the average behavior of the plasma as a whole . \n therefore it remains the appropriate treatment for mean - field properties of the system . \n however , dynamic effects are important when particles are singled out based on their velocities . \n pairs of particles with greater relative velocities experience less screening than pairs of particles with lower relative velocities . \n this effect is relevant in nuclear reactions in the sun because they occur at energies that are several times greater than the thermal energy . \n the fast protons from the high - end tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution are most likely to take part in these reactions . \n thus the mean - field approach is not valid in this case . \n we agree with shaviv and shaviv that the formalism for screening in solar nuclear reaction rates should be amended to account for this dynamic effect .", "StartTimeOffset": 3505281389276, "RequestID": "a177634016d24b9591cc628706cdb9d6", "TotalTokens": 3872}
{"ContextTokens": 1810, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery that the _ cos - b _ gamma - ray source was a pulsar ( psr b1706 - 44 ) was made by johnston et al ( 1992 ) . \n mcadam , osborne , & parkinson ( 1993 ) published a map made by the most telescope at 843  mhz of the area around the gamma - ray source . \n it showed a semicircular arc of emission , which has subsequently been denoted as the supernova remnant ( snr ) g343.1 - 2.3 , with the pulsar seemingly embedded in a small feature at its south eastern extremity . \n it was argued that the approximate distance of 3  kpc for the remnant , derived from the surface brightness - diameter relationship ( @xmath0-d ) was not incompatible with the pulsar s dispersion measure , although the distance indicated by the widely used interstellar electron density model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) would be only 1.8  kpc . \n the @xmath0-d relationship was based on the flux values from single dish observations , as both the vla and the most integrated flux fell short of what would be expected from these ( mcadam et al 1993 ) .    if the association of the pulsar and the supernova remnant were real a transverse velocity of @xmath1  kms@xmath2 \n would be required for the pulsar to have moved from the approximate geometric centre of the snr arc in the characteristic spin down time of 17  kyr . \n this is a high value but not the highest measured value for a pulsar nor as high as that implied for some seemingly well - established pulsar - snr associations . \n frail , goss , & whiteoak ( 1994 ) mapped the area around the pulsar at 20  cm and 90  cm with the vla and cast some doubt on it s association with g343.1 - 2.3 based on the morphology , and the argument that the dispersion measure and @xmath0-d distance were discrepant . \n the latter was subsequently countered by a 21  cm hydrogen line absorption measurement of the pulsar by koribalski et  al . \n ( 1995 ) which gives a distance range of 2.4 to 3.2  kpc . \n nicastro , johnston , & koribalski ( 1996 ) also argue against the association . \n they report a maximum value only 27  kms@xmath2 for the magnitude of the transverse velocity of the pulsar calculated from the interstellar scintillation . \n however in both dodson ( 1997 ) and then their later paper ( johnston , nicastro , & koribalski 1998 ) this estimate is revised up to 100  kms@xmath2 . \n the possibility of a direct determination of the proper motion of psr b1706 - 44 has been investigated , but no phase reference sufficiently strong for the current australian vlbi network ( the lba ) could be found . \n we have made a number of radio images of the remnant to determine its full extent . \n these are with mrt at 150  mhz , with the atca at 1400  mhz and at 6.6  ghz with the 26 m dish at mt pleasant observatory , hobart . \n the object as seen at 150  mhz , and at 6.6  ghz are shown in figure [ fig : mrt+mtp ] . \n the 150-mhz map is a preliminary result from the mrt all sky survey . \n the 6.6-ghz image was produced as part of the honours thesis of m. howlett ( howlett 1998 ) , a survey along the galactic plane using the 26 m antenna run by the university of tasmania . \n both contain all spatial frequencies up to their resolution . \n they both show broad extended structure to the south of the bright arc seen by most . \n the australia telescope compact array has been use to re - observe g343.1 - 2.3 , with a nineteen pointing mosaic . \n mosaicing was required to cover the extent of the source , but also to assist in the recovery of the flux on the shortest _ uv _ spacings , which were missed in the most and the vla observations . \n the images in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) , look very much like those of most and indeed have very similar resolution ( @xmath3 ) ( the longer baselines , to the 6 km antenna , were not used due to their poor support ) . \n we have included as a constraint in the deconvolution the observed total flux for the snr , 30 jy , as seen with the 26 m single dish in hobart . \n figure [ fig : at_i ] b ) shows the polarisation angle overlaid on the polarised intensity . \n the polarised fraction is typically about 20 per cent and the polarisation angle is randomly orientated and changes rapidly around the bright ring . \n wisps of polarised emission can be seen to extend beyond the ring as originally defined , and throughout the region with broadscale emission . \n this confirms that the broadscale emission is associated with the synchrotron emission from the snr . \n it is instructive to compare the vla maps of figure 4 in frail et al ( 1994 ) with the map in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) . \n the spur of emission on which the pulsar lies is clearly a continuous feature covering more than @xmath4 . \n this makes it extremely unlikely to be a cometary tail from the pulsar . \n furthermore the width of the spur , @xmath5 , is unlikely to be that due to ram pressure of a moving pulsar . \n it is intriguing this approximately the size that would be expected from a static pulsar wind , i.e. the sedov equations with a continuous input of energy , with the @xmath6 of psr1706 - 44 ( rees & gunn 1974 ) . \n the arguments against the association were based around kaspi s critia ( kaspi 1996 ) . \n these were that the pulsar dm distance and the snr @xmath0-d distance did not match , and the pulsar was at the edge of the snr and had too low a velocity to have travelled from the geometric centre of the snr . \n also there was no morphological evidence to imply a velocity direction . \n it has turned out that it is the dm distance is incorrect , and the extent of the snr has been underestimated . \n it is clear from both the low total flux values found by the most and vla maps that there is a smooth broad component to this snr . \n the atca observations confirm the extent of the broad emission , and that this is syncrotron in character . taking this smooth component as the true limits of the snr enlarges the extent and moves it southwards . \n this places the pulsar psr1706 - 44 within the snr shell , rather than on the rim . \n we expect a snr to be associated with psr1706 - 44 because of its youth . \n the association was rejected in the past , and we have shown that the grounds for the rejection are not compelling as previously believed . the question of the pulsar velocity could be resolved by finding a phase reference for vlbi observation , with either the ska or an upgrade to the current lba . \n we will be able to rule out the upper velocity limits with the atca within the next few years but will not be able to measure to the lower limits for a few decades .", "StartTimeOffset": 3520090694892, "RequestID": "9ef8fd69673e47d0a67ace5d065431da", "TotalTokens": 1980}

[ fig1 ] . ) 2 . \n the density of the center vortices is represented in fig . \n the fractal dimension of center vortices which is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of plaquettes and @xmath56 is the number of links on the string , is represented in fig . \n the center monopoles are condensed in the confinement phase , but not condensed in the deconfinement phase . \n this follows from a consideration of the probability that two points are connected by a monopole worldline . \n we find for this quantity : @xmath57 at @xmath52 . \n we observe , that @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59 in the deconfinement phase , and different from @xmath59 in the confinement phase . \n the condensate as a function of @xmath60 is represented in fig . \n [ fig1 ] by the dashed line . \n in addition we notice here , that according to the percolation properties , the center vortices and center monopoles are distributed homogeneously . \n this follows from the fact that the probability of two points to be connected by the worldsheet or the worldline of these objects is constant for all distances for center monopoles and center vortices . \n the maximal abelian projection which has been used actively lately in the investigation of strong interaction physics , leads to the existence of two monopoles within su(3 ) gauge theory . \n thus the dual superconductor mechanism of confinement becomes complex and unnatural . in our work \n we use the maximal center projection and find that after applying this procedure a new interesting object arises . \n we call it the center monopole . \n it turns out that this monopole is condensed in the confinement phase and is not condensed in the deconfinement phase . \n thus we believe this object to be a good candidate for the monopole that works in the dual superconductor mechanism . \n the authors are grateful to m. chernodub , j. greensite , m. polykarpov , t. suzuki and and e. tomboulis for useful discussions . \n we are very grateful for su(3 ) computer code given to us by s. kitahara . \n this work was supported by the jsps program on japan  fsu scientists collaboration , by the grants intas 96 - 370 , intas - rfbr-95 - 0681 and rfbr-97 - 02 - 17491 .", "StartTimeOffset": 3553945585454, "RequestID": "c4b742572e8844b8ae482d99ccbeac83", "TotalTokens": 2788}
{"ContextTokens": 2677, "GeneratedTokens": 272, "SynthesizedBody": "the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) is the only square kilometre array ( ska : @xcite ) precursor telescope at low radio frequencies . \n an ska precursor is a recognised ska technology demonstrator located at one of the two sites that will host the ska , the murchison radio - astronomy observatory ( mro ) in the murchison region of western australia and the karoo region of south africa s northern cape . \n the mwa is sited at the mro , along with a second ska precursor , the australian ska pathfinder ( askap : @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n the meerkat ska precursor will be located at the south african site . \n the mwa is sited at the mro due to the extremely low levels of human - made radio frequency intereference in this area of western australia , particularly within the fm band ( 87 - 108 mhz ) which is encompassed by the mwa at the low end of its operating frequency range . \n the technical capabilities of the mwa are described in detail by @xcite and the full science case for the mwa is described by @xcite . \n broadly , the mwa science goals include : 1 ) detection of fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the diffuse redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen from the epoch of reionisation ; 2 ) studies of galactic and extragalactic processes based on deep , confusion - limited surveys of the full sky visible to the array ; 3 ) time domain astrophysics through exploration of the variable radio sky ; and 4 ) solar imaging and characterisation of the heliosphere and ionosphere via propagation effects on background radio source emission . \n the mwa has reached the point of practical completion and will be available to the global user community from mid-2013 , based on an `` open skies '' policy ( http://www.mwatelescope.org ) . \n users will be able to propose observational programs with the mwa in the first half of 2013 , including for solar science . \n considerable data have been obtained in advance of completion of the full instrument . \n a prototype array was operated for approximately 2 years , from 2009 to 2011 , and during construction of the full array , science commissioning observations were undertaken . \n this paper will briefly describe the capabilities of the mwa for solar physics and summarise some of the solar results thus far obtained . \n the results to date have been obtained with arrays four times less sensitive than the final array that will be available in 2013 , and generally with lower angular resolution and image fidelity than will be available with the final array . \n low radio frequency imaging of the sun was pioneered in australia under the leadership of paul wild @xcite . \n wild and others imaged the sun at frequencies similar to the mwa frequencies for the first time , revealing the nature of type ii and type iii bursts ( these types were defined by the same group based on high quality dynamic spectra ) and monitoring their evolution as a function of time and frequency @xcite . \n this work used the culgoora solar heliograph , built by wild and his team in the late 1960s .    since the closure of culgoora in 1984 \n , there has been no low frequency solar imaging capability in australia . \n the mwa will therefore renew this capability in australia using modern instrumentation on a radio quiet site . \n important capabilities of the mwa for solar physics are the time and frequency resolution of imaging . \n the mwa can produce images at a rate of two per second , for each of the four stokes parameters and for each frequency channel across the bandwidth . \n the bandwidth is 30.72 mhz , tunable in the range 80 to 300 mhz , with the 30.72 mhz broken up into a maximum of 3072 channels of 10 khz each . \n thus , in one minute it is possible for the mwa to produce almost 1.5 million images ( number of frequency channels @xmath0 number of stokes parameters @xmath0 number of time steps ) , allowing a comprehensive exploration of the evolution of the radio emission as function of both frequency and time . \n the angular resolution of the mwa at these low frequencies is of order 1 arcminute , likely within a factor of a few of the expected scattering size due to the intervening plasma , at the top end of the mwa frequency range . \n approximately 1000 resolution elements will cover the disk of the sun , at the top end of the mwa frequency range ( fewer resolution elements at lower frequency ) . \n in novemnber 2012 the mwa reached a major milestone in practical completion of the full instrument as described by @xcite and in early 2013 the full capabilities of the mwa will be exercised for the first time , leading to commencement of the first science operations phase from mid-2013 . during the period 2009 - 2011 , \n a 32 tile prototype array was operated and used as a science and engineering testbed . \n this was decommissioned in early 2012 , to make way for the construction of the final instrument . in the final stages of construction , from approximately september 2012 , science commissioning of the final instrument commenced , overlapping with construction ; 32 tile subsets of the final instrument were commissioned and tested as they were completed . \n the 32 tile sub - arrays ranged from configurations with only short baselines ( low angular resolution ) to configurations with close to the maximum length baselines ( high angular resolution ) .    during both the prototype phase and science commissioning phase , \n scientific observations were performed across all mwa science themes . in the prototype phase \n , @xcite performed the first demonstration of the spectroscopic imaging capabilities of the mwa ( albeit with relatively low angular resolution ) , revealing a rich variety of phenomena in the observed frequency range of 171 - 202 mhz , consisting of many short - lived , narrow - band , non - thermal emission features . \n while the @xcite images are of low angular resolution , they show a number of these events to be marginally resolved . a somewhat surprising feature of these first serious solar observations with the mwa was the rich variety of weak transient events , showing that to effectively study the sun at these frequencies a surperb radio quiet location is required . \n even to study the sun , one of the brightest radio objects in the sky , very low levels of human - made interference appear critical to success . \n other mwa prototype observations of type iii flares from 2011 are currently being analysed in conjunction with sdo and rhessi data ( cairns et al . \n 2013 , in preparation ) . \n even the prototype phase of the mwa development was scientifically productive in terms of solar science .    in the science commissioning phase of the final mwa instrument , since approximately september 2012 , \n almost 100 tb of solar imaging data have been collected ! \n this vast store of data covers observations with five different 32 tile sub - arrays , generally during quiet periods for the sun . \n the most effective sub - array was the so - called `` gamma '' array , since the configuration of 32 tiles used included long baselines and therefore produced high angular resolution images ( few arcminute angular resolution ) . \n an example is shown in figure 1 , from data obtained on october 29 , 2012 ( 03:35:44 ut ) . \n this image represents a single 1 second integration and a 40 khz channel at a frequency of approximately 150 mhz in a single linear polarisation . \n the disk of the sun is well - resolved . \n the sun on this day was rated as quiet . however , even in this state weak transient events are clearly seen when a series of images are made over a period of several minutes ( tingay et al . \n 2013 , in preparation ) . \n a limb brightening effect could be expected for the data presented in figure 1 @xcite . \n however , with an angular resolution of only @xmath14 arcminutes ( @xmath210% of the solar disk diameter ) , the brightening is likely to be smeared into the disk emission . at 150 mhz , \n the altitude of the resonant plasma lies at a distance of around 1.2 rs , which gives a diameter of around 38 arcminutes at the earth . \n this is approximately the diameter of the sun seen figure 1 . \n we take this as evidence for additional limb emission due to the corona and the absence of an apparent change in the surface brightness at the limb because of the smearing due to limited angular resolution . \n in addition to the capabilities of the final instrument described above , the mwa will have the ability to record the raw voltage streams from each tile . \n this capability makes it possible to produce dynamic spectra and images at very high time and frequency resolution , sub - millisecond and sub-10 khz ( but not at maximum time and frequency resolution simultaneously ) . \n such high resolution imaging will open up the ability to study the temporal and frequency sub - structure of both strong flares and the weak features seen by @xcite . \n the mwa data will be of most use if they can be combined with data from other solar observation platforms in other wavelength ranges . \n part of the motivation for attending this conference and providing an update on the capabilities of the mwa was to make contact with other instrument teams and to start to coordinate mwa solar observations with multi - wavelength campaigns . \n as described in @xcite , the mwa could play a significant role in tracking large coronal mass ejections and making early predictions regarding collisions with the earth . \n it is thus timely that the mwa will come into full operation in the first half of 2013 , presumably the year of maximum activity during cycle 24 . \n this scientific work makes use of the murchison radio - astronomy observatory . \n we acknowledge the wajarri yamatji people as the traditional owners of the observatory site . \n support for the mwa comes from the u.s . \n national science foundation ( grants ast-0457585 , phy-0835713 , career-0847753 , and ast-0908884 ) , the australian research council ( lief grants le0775621 and le0882938 ) , the u.s . \n air force office of scientic research ( grant fa9550 -

countermeasures '' also appeared @xcite . \n some other protection schemes were designed @xcite . \n an interesting and apparently efficient countermeasure is the wddl  @xcite which duplicates each signal in the circuit so that whatever the value is , one of the lines will toggle . \n this countermeasure was enhanced by an improved routing of related signals @xcite , which reduces the differences between the power consumptions of a 1 and a 0.    * asynchronous circuits * , the history of which dates back to 1950 , are nowadays increasingly considered as a viable alternative to classical synchronous designs . \n indeed they feature some very useful properties such as flexibility , robustness , high speed and low power . \n this article brings another good reason to consider asynchronous designs : a greater resistance against _ side - channel attacks_.    some industrial applications of asynchronous asic and fpga begin to appear both in the academic world  @xcite and in the industry  @xcite .    at the same time \n synchronous circuits are suffering from problems arising from the distribution of the clock signal through the ic and the excessive power consumption ( and thus dissipation ! ) . \n as an asynchronous circuit has no centralized clock , the problems associated with the clock distribution , clock skew and power consumption do not exist . \n in addition this circuits offers advantages like :    * average - time performance , * lower electromagnetic radiation , * better robustness towards variations of the power voltage , * better robustness towards fabrication process variations  @xcite , * better composability and modularity because of the simple handshake interfaces and the local timing  @xcite and * better scrambling of the _ side - channel _ information  @xcite . \n asynchronous circuits thus seem to be a viable alternative which would remove these limiting factors  @xcite . \n due to these advantages , there has been a resurgence of interest in asynchronous design , especially in the reprogrammable field . \n there have been several recent successful design projects such as aspro-216  @xcite , aes crypto - processor  @xcite , many of philips designs targeting low power  @xcite , projects focused on designing an asynchronous fpga from a synchronous one , like montage  @xcite and pga - stc  @xcite or targeting asynchronous application - specific fpgas , locally synchronous , like galsa  @xcite and stacc  @xcite or completely asynchronous like papa  @xcite , and other recent works  @xcite . \n pga - stc was developed to implement two - phase bundled - data systems such as micro pipelines , galsa for massively parallel computing architecture , stacc for reconfigurable computation and papa was mainly created and optimized for pipe - lined processes . \n * this article * describe the design of the plb of a new asynchronous fpga with security as the main requirement , even at the expense of performance . indeed in the particular case of cryptography performance is second to security even if it can not be ignored . \n the fpga must be able to implement various styles of asynchronous protocols and different representations of data so as to enable comparisons between these representations and protocols as for their ability to thwart the side - channel attacks . \n section [ asynchronous - representation ] describes the representation of data and the different asynchronous protocols used in the fpga . \n we also discuss their suitablity for trusted computing . \n section [ 4-phase - protocol ] shows the construction of the plb to implement the 4-phase protocol using both binary and ternary representations of data . \n section [ 2-phase - protocol ] shows the necessary additions to the plb to accommodate the 2-phase protocols . \n section [ programming - the - fpga ] shows how the fpga is programmed . \n finally section [ conclusion ] concludes the article . \n as opposed to synchronous data , whose validity is guaranteed by the timing of some global `` clock '' signal , the asynchronous computations are synchronized by the availability of data and , when necessary , by a request / acknowledge handshake signalling .    a formal description of delay insensitive representation of data can be found in  @xcite . in the * * q**uasi-**d**elay * * i**nsensitive ( qdi ) protocols the request is carried by the data itself . \n this allows to obtain a reliable design , independent of the routing . \n the data are transmitted together with the availability information and thus a logic signal or , shorter a `` * * signal * * '' , must be represented by more than a single electrical signal or , shorter , a `` * * wire * * '' representation on a single wire per signal would be acceptable in some cases but we shall restrict ourselves in the following pages to standard cmos levels : @xmath0and @xmath1 . ] . in this article , \n a wire is able to take one of two values , which we denote * 0 * and * 1 * regardless of their actual electric implementation .    in order to avoid glitches \n , a sufficient condition is that _ given a signal @xmath2 represented by @xmath3 wires , the transmission of a new value of @xmath2 must consist in * exactly one * of the @xmath3 wires changing its electrical state_. this means that the number of wires is greater than or equal to the number of the states of @xmath2 . as silicon and routing is a precious resource , the number of wires representing a given signal will thus be equal to the number of possible values of this signal . \n the most frequently used kind of signal is the binary signal , which carries a \\{*`1'*,*`0 ' * } information . \n such a signal is encoded with 2 wires . \n this representation is called `` * * dual - rail * * '' or `` 2 '' \n . however ternary signals , which carry a \\{*`0'*,*`1'*,*`2 ' * } information , can also be thought of . \n such a signal is represented by 3 wires and one speaks of `` 3 '' representation . \n this representation is more compact than the _ 1-out - of-2 _ as for arithmetic : 6 wires in 2 represent 3 2 signals which can take 8 valid values , compared to two _ 1-out - of-3 _ signals , which can take 9 valid values . \n however due to the greater complexity of gates in 3 representation , the binary signals are most of the time preferred . \n an asynchronous design may need additional signals , which are specialized to synchronisation . \n these signal carry no _ data _ information and can thus be coded on a single wire . \n they will be referred to as _ acknowledge_signals . \n the inputs of the gates which receive such a signal will be denoted @xmath4and those driving these signals will be called @xmath5 . \n there are two main families of qdi asynchronous communication protocols , which differ by the nature of the signalling information : the  protocols and the  protocols .      under a  protocol , \n valid values of a signal are separated by a special value , denoted @xmath6 . \n the transmission of a value @xmath7 from an emitter to a receiver proceeds as follows :    [ cols=\">,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ [ synchronization ] ] synchronization + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the synchronization is performed by a device called `` @xmath8-decision - wait '' ( or , shorter : ) . \n [ 2phe-1x2 ] depicts the schematic of the . \n the works as follows :    1 .   in the initial state , \n the following relations hold : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which imply @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n ( because @xmath14 , idem for @xmath15 ) ; 2 . \n assume @xmath16 toggles and thus becomes equal to @xmath17 , the c - elementtransmits the common value of its inputs to @xmath18 , 3 . \n as @xmath18 toggles , @xmath19 toggles too and becomes equal to @xmath20 . \n 4 .   until @xmath4toggles , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 : even if one of the inputs toggles , the c - elements will remain stable ; 5 .   when @xmath4toggles , @xmath15 and @xmath23 toggle and the system is back in the initial state . \n if one wants to combine the computation stage with the , it can not be done in 2 lut . \n it is not because of the complexity of the functions : each of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a function of 2 feed - backs , 1 @xmath4and at most 3 @xmath26 , at least if one does not want to implement trivial , constant functions . \n however , the set of 2 luttogether would need 2 feed - backs , 1 @xmath4and 4 @xmath26 , which is one more than the number of available wires . \n thus we must use a full plb . \n if we use the full plb , the memory element will provide the necessary c - elementand the lutbecome purely combinatorial . \n the inputs will be assigned following eq . \n [ edge-2x1-in - eq ] and depicted on fig . \n [ 2008-edge - all-2x1dw ] : @xmath27    then the lutare programmed as by eq . \n [ edge-2x1-lut -

{"ContextTokens": 3243, "GeneratedTokens": 145, "SynthesizedBody": "stochastic resonance ( sr ) is a nonlinear phenomena where the combined effect of noise and nonlinearity ( bistable systems or threshold systems ) leads to an enhanced response of a weak periodic signal with addition of noise of optimal intensity . \n this counter intuitive phenomena has been observed experimentally and in numerical and analog simulations  @xcite . \n however , there has been a lot of discussions in recent years regarding the validity of sr as bona fide stochastic resonance  @xcite . \n the archetype of sr models is represented by a simple symmetric bistable potential driven by a zero mean gaussian white noise and an external sinusoidal bias . \n the response of such system has been mainly characterized by the response amplitude ( ra ) of the periodic component of the process @xmath0 or the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) . \n both these response functions show typical resonance type feature with increasing noise amplitude @xmath1  @xcite . \n this resonance has been attributed to the matching of escape rate across the barrier and the frequency of the external periodic drive . \n an obvious conclusion is the occurrence of a similar peak with increasing frequency of the bias . \n but such nonmonotonic behaviour has not been observed in spite of exhaustive numerical and analytical studies on snr and ra \n . however , ref . \n @xcite shows the existence of peak in snr with increasing frequency for a system with rectangular potential barrier and for a special type of driving . \n other criteria have been proposed to study the resonance behaviour as function of frequency , thus characterizing sr as a bona fide resonance . \n gammaitoni et . \n al . have shown that residence time distribution n(t ) has a resonant behaviour as function of forcing frequency . \n marchesoni et . \n al . recently showed numerically that in a schmitt trigger n(t ) shows a peak with frequency for both weakly and strongly driven system . \n the relationship between sr and synchronization of passages from one well to another can also be characterized by hysteresis loop area  @xcite . \n this loss can be taken as a measure of sr and sr is shown as a bona fide resonance . \n recently it is argued that input energy is also a good measure of sr  @xcite . \n this energy is equivalent to the work done by the external agent which drives the potential periodically . \n the input energy not only shows peaking behaviour with temperature ( noise strength ) but also takes into account only the interwell behaviour . in the conventional snr both intrawell as well as interwell motion is taken into account and hence for small driving frequency and noise strength the motion is predominantly dominated by the intrawell oscillations  citeiwai . \n hence the peak in the input energy is a better indicator of matching of escape rate and the external driving frequency . \n this assertion has been made by taking into account the detailed comparison between various measures of sr .    in this work \n we show that input energy not only correctly shows the matching condition for noise induced escape rate and the external periodic drive , but resonance type behaviour is also obtained as function of @xmath2 ( frequency of external drive ) , a signature of bonafide sr . \n bonafide sr is a relatively new term in stochastic dynamics , by which one means the actual matching of the time scales @xmath3 ( barrier escape time ) and @xmath4 ( period of external drive , @xmath5 ) . \n this is manifested as a peak in the plot of input energy with @xmath6 . \n the existence of sr in supra - threshold regime has also been demonstrated . \n we make an exhaustive study throughout the parameter regime of our problem and show the detailed behaviour of sr peak as function of @xmath7 in our model . \n we consider an overdamped brownian particle moving in a bistable potential @xmath8 under the influence of a zero mean white gaussian noise @xmath9 with correlations @xmath10 . \n the langevin equation for such system is @xmath11 and the corresponding fokker planck equation ( fpe ) is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability density of the particle at position @xmath14 at time @xmath15 . \n the barrier height @xmath16 . \n we consider both weak forcing @xmath17 as well as strong forcing @xmath18 limit . \n depending on the parameter regime , the brownian particle is either dominated by intra well or inter well oscillations . for small driving force the motion \n is mostly dominated by intrawell oscillations . at certain optimal noise strength the interwell motion \n is enhanced due to the combined effect of noise and weak periodic modulation . such resonant enhancement of interwell motion is termed as stochastic resonance ( sr ) . in this particular case \n the oscillatory driving force keeps the system away from equilibrium . \n the energy required to drive the system ( @xmath19 ) can be calculated from sekimoto s stochastic energetics formalism  @xcite and its has been shown that @xmath19 depends nonmonotonically on the noise strength @xmath1 . \n since the mean current in the system is zero , hence no work is done by the system and all the input energy is dissipated into the bath . \n this suggests that input energy is related to dissipative loss or hysteresis loss in the system  @xcite . \n our effort is to find the signatures of sr in the input energy of the system as function of system parameters @xmath20 .    the input energy per period(@xmath4 ) \n is defined as  @xcite @xmath21    the average @xmath22 is done over an ensemble of particles . \n the asymptotic probability distribution @xmath13 is calculated by solving the fpe ( [ fpe ] ) . \n the input energy @xmath19 can be rewritten in terms of asymptotic distribution as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 . \n this distribution is obtained after the initial transients have died down and asymptotically probability density assumes a unique limiting periodic distribution in time . \n the maxima of @xmath19 as function of @xmath1 is taken as a signature of sr . \n we numerically solve eqn . \n ( [ fpe ] ) by method of finite difference to obtain the asymptotic distribution @xmath25 . \n @xmath19 is obtained by numerically integrating eqn . \n ( [ main ] ) . throughout this work \n all the physical quantities are in dimensionless unit  @xcite . \n the input energy shows a rich structure as function of @xmath26 . \n we mainly concentrate on low amplitude drive , @xmath27 . in this regime input energy \n shows a sharp maxima both as function of @xmath28 . in fig . \n [ ein - d ] we plot @xmath19 as function of @xmath1 for @xmath29 and different values of @xmath2 . \n the peak in the input energy can be attributed to the synchronization of escape from the potential well and the external periodic drive as has been extensively discussed in previous literatures @xcite . \n with increasing @xmath2 the temperature at which @xmath19 peaks increases as shown in fig . \n [ ein - d ] . \n the most favourable condition for hopping to other potential well is when the barrier height is minimum . \n when @xmath2 is increased the brownian particle spends less time in the most favourable condition and hence stronger fluctuations are needed to cross the barrier . \n barrier height also decreases with increase in amplitude of external drive . \n hence for reasons similar to above the resonance peak shift towards lower temperature as shown in the inset , where we have plotted @xmath19 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for various values of @xmath30 as mentioned in the caption . however , our main motive is to check whether these resonance features are also observed when the frequency of the external drive is varied . in fig . \n [ ein - omg ] we plot @xmath19 as function of @xmath2 for @xmath31 and different values of temperature . \n unlike other response function like snr , ra which characterize sr and has monotonic dependence on @xmath2 , input energy shows a nonmonotonic and a peaking behaviour with @xmath2 . for small amplitude drive and at low temperature the resonant frequency is very close to half the kramer s rate for the unperturbed system ( the resonance condition being @xmath32 ) . for @xmath33 , the kramer s rate ( @xmath34 ) \n is @xmath35 , which is very close to @xmath36 . with higher amplitude the resonance peak shifts to higher frequency for a given temperature as shown in the inset . \n thus sr as a bona fide resonance is established . \n it is known that for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dynamical threshold above which deterministic switch events take place driven by the periodic signal alone ( absence of noise ) , sr is not observed . \n the dynamical threshold depends on both the modulation frequency and the wave form @xmath39 . for the form given in eqn . \n (  [ langv ] ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the smallest zero of the airy function @xmath43 , is order of unity @xcite . \n we investigate the marginal supra - threshold regime ( @xmath44 ) and show that sr is observed with increasing temperature provided @xmath30 is not very large compared to @xmath38 . \n the occurrence of sr in this regime is related to noise induced stability  @xcite . in fig . \n [ supra ] we plot input energy for four different valued of @xmath30 at @xmath45 . \n figure  [ trajec ] shows the corresponding deterministic trajectories . as shown in fig . \n [ trajec ] , @xmath46 is the threshold , i.e , the particle is just able to cross the barrier at @xmath47 . \n hence higher values of @xmath30 is above dynamic threshold . for @xmath48 \n the input energy shows a resonance peak with increasing temperature . \n this peak in @xmath19 in supra - threshold regime is shown for a very small window of @xmath30 . \n for the specific parameter values as above , the peak vanishes for @xmath49 . \n this peak can be ascribed to resonant trapping as discussed in previous literature  @xcite . however , in supra - threshold regime @xmath19 clearly exhibits peaking behaviour as function of @xmath2  @xcite for all values of @xmath30 . \n this is more akin to conventional resonance ( absence of barrier ) . \n in conclusion we have calculated that the input energy pumped into the system by an external drive using the method of stochastic energetics . \n this input energy is shown to be a good quantitative measure of sr . \n moreover sr is shown to be a bona fide resonance . \n l. gammaitoni , p. hanggi , p. jung , and f. marchesoni , rev . \n phys . * 70 * , 223 ( 1998 ) . \n l. gammaitoni , f. marchesoni , and s. santucci , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 1052 ( 1995 ) ; m. h. choi , r. f. fox , and p. jung , phys . \n e * 57 * , 6335 ( 1998 ) ; g. giacomelli , f. marin , and i. rabbiosi , phys . rev . \n 82 , 675 ( 1999 ) ; f. marchesoni , l. gammaitoni , f. apostolico , and s. santucci , phys . rev . \n e * 62 * , 146 ( 2000 ) . v. berdichevsky amd m. gitterman , j. phys . a * 29 * , l447 ( 1996 ) . \n m. c. mahato and s. r. shenoy , phys . \n e * 50 * , 2503 ( 1994 ) ; m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , phys . \n e * 55 * , 6266 ( 1997 ) . \n m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , mod . \n b * 11 * , 815 ( 1997 ) ; m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , physica a * 248 * , 138 ( 1998 ) . \n k. sekimoto , j. phys . \n . jpn . * 66 * , 6335 ( 1997 ) ; f. takagi and t. hondou , phys . \n e * 60 * , 4954 ( 1999 ) . \n t. iwai , physica a * 300 * , 350 ( 2001 ) ; t. iwai , j. phys . soc . jpn . * 70 * , 353 ( 2001 ) . \n f. apostolico , l. gammaitoni , f. marchesoni , and s. santucci , phys . \n e , * 55 * , 36 ( 1997 ) ; r. n. mantegna and b. spagnolo , phys . \n lett * 76 * , 563 ( 1996 ) . \n a. l. pankratov , phys . \n e * 65 * , 022101 ( 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3610240887952, "RequestID": "3229184f49324a008c8bdebef1b1a9e4", "TotalTokens": 3388}

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , is believed to power the observed @xmath0-ray flash ( prompt emission ) and the subsequent `` afterglow '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n traditionally , grbs have been divided in two main categories , long and short ones ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , depending on the duration of their prompt @xmath0-ray emission ( @xmath1s for the short bursts , @xmath2s for the long ones ) . \n these two populations of bursts are thought to be related to two different progenitor models : `` collapsars '' for the long - soft bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) , and the merger of binary systems of compact objects such as neutron star ( ns)-ns or black - hole ( bh)-ns systems , for the short - hard ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n despite the recent issues raised in the classification of short and long grbs based solely on their prompt emission properties ( e.g , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the general picture of two classes of bursts related to two main progenitor models , still holds . \n the collapsar scenario is observationally supported by the fact that long grbs occur in galaxies with high specific star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and that at least some long grbs have been observed to be associated with core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) of rare type @xcite . \n indeed , the question of what makes some stars die as sne and some other as relativistic grbs , is not solved yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n indications that progenitors of short bursts belong , on average , to old stellar populations with a typical lifetime of several gyr @xcite , provide support to the binary merger scenario . \n collapsars and binary mergers leading to the formation of a bh plus an accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , have the potential to power the grb fireball via the energy released from the accretion of the disk onto the newly formed bh . while the formation of a bh plus disk system is common to both progenitor models , the more compact scale of the ns - ns ( or bh - ns systems ) , and the less massive debris left over after merger , are invoked to explain the shorter duration and the smaller isotropic energies of these bursts with respect to long ones .    within the standard fireball model , \n once the fireball is launched from the central engine , the observed radiation is explained as synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission from electrons accelerated in internal and external shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , taking place at distances @xmath3 cm from the central source . \n high - energy ( gev ) tails observed in some grbs have challenged the internal - external shock fireball model in its simplest formulation @xcite . \n however , it remains true that the electromagnetic emission from grbs , being produced at large distances from the central engine , provides indirect information on the progenitor . on the other hand , gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted from the progenitor \n could directly probe its nature . \n being related to catastrophic events involving stellar - mass objects , grbs are good candidates for the detection of gws @xcite . coalescing binaries , thought to be associated with short bursts , are one of the most promising gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) for detectors like the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; * ? ? ? * ) and virgo @xcite . \n for such systems , a chirp signal should be emitted in gws during the in - spiral , followed by a burst - type signal associated with the merger , and subsequently a signal from the ring - down phase of the newly formed bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n the last , initially deformed , is expected to radiate gws until reaching a kerr geometry @xcite .    in the collapsar scenario , \n relevant for long grbs , the high rotation required to form the centrifugally supported disk that powers the grb , should produce gws via bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) or fragmentation instabilities that might develop in the collapsing core ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for recent reviews ) and/or in the disk @xcite \n . moreover , asymmetrically infalling matter is expected to perturb the final bh geometry , leading to a ring - down phase @xcite . \n ligo and virgo have been carrying out electromagnetically triggered searches for gws @xcite over the past decade ( for bar detectors electromagnetically triggered searches , see e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the ligo scientific collaboration operates two ligo observatories in the u.s . \n along with the geo600 detector @xcite in germany . \n together with virgo , located in italy , they form a detector network capable of detecting gw signals arriving from all directions . \n grb - triggered searches for gws by ligo and virgo have targeted both the chirp signal expected in the case of short grbs during the ns - ns or bh - ns in - spiral , and short unmodeled pulses of gws that may be expected during the merger / collapse , and ring - down phases of short / long grbs @xcite . \n these searches have adopted on - source time windows of few minutes ( long grbs ) or few seconds ( short grbs ) around the grb trigger time . \n in fact , for long grbs , the time delay between the gw signal and @xmath0-ray trigger is thought to be dominated by the time necessary for the fireball to push through the stellar envelope of the progenitor ( 10 - 100s ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , for short grbs , \n the ns - ns / bh - ns merger is believed to occur quickly , and be over within a few seconds ( naturally accounting for the short nature of these bursts ) . \n it is estimated that triggered searches for gws in few minutes time - windows yield a factor of @xmath4 improvement in sensitivity with respect to untriggered ones @xcite . \n the most exciting results from ligo grb - triggered searches of gws are probably represented by the cases of the short grbs 070201 @xcite and 051103 @xcite , whose error boxes overlap with nearby galaxies ( m31 for grb070201 ; m81 for grb051103 ) . a ns - ns binary merger scenario occurring in such hosts \n was excluded by ligo with rather high confidence @xcite . \n however , the possibility that grb070201 and grb051103 are related to ( extra - galactic ) soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) giant flares ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , could not be ruled out . \n indeed , ligo upper - limits for short unmodeled pulses of gws from grb070201 and grb051103 , are above the maximum gw energy emissible in sgr giant flares @xcite . \n a very appealing prospect is represented by the possibility of using gws to trigger electromagnetic ( radio , optical , x - ray ) follow - ups of gw sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the discovery of off - axis optical or radio afterglows @xcite triggered via the ( non - beamed ) gw emission from the grb progenitors , would yield a dramatic confirmation of the `` jet model '' , map out the beaming distribution , and provide fundamental inputs to models of relativistic outflows . \n radio follow - ups , in particular , are an effective tool to identify relativistic and mildly relativistic outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) in the absence of a @xmath0-ray trigger . \n finding electromagnetic counterparts to gw triggers is technically challenging due to imperfect localization of the gw signal and uncertainty regarding the relative timing of the gw and electromagnetic emissions . \n the localization of ligo - virgo triple - coincidence gw triggers can yield error - areas of @xmath5deg@xmath6 , possibly spread over different patches of the sky ( see e.g. fig . 3 in * ? ? ? \n * ) . the problem of following - up with optical ( or radio , or x - ray ) telescopes such a large error - area can be partially mitigated by : ( i ) restricting the search for electromagnetic counterparts to transients in nearby galaxies ( within the ligo - virgo horizon distance ) ; ( ii ) by noticing that the most promising electromagnetic counterparts of gw events detectable by ligo and virgo \n are expected to be `` exotic '' ( rare ) ones ( e.g. , the orphan afterglow of a grb , and/or the  kilonova  from a binary merger - see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n in 2009 - 2010 , ligo and virgo , together with partner electromagnetic observatories , performed their first `` looc - up '' - locating and observing optical counterparts to unmodeled pulses of gravitational waves - experiment ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at the time , there were two operating ligo interferometers @xcite , each with 4-km arms ( one near hanford , washington , the other in livingston parish , louisiana ) . \n the virgo 3-km arms detector @xcite located near cascina ( italy ) , was also operating . \n the looc - up search has established a baseline for low - latency analyses with the next - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo and advanced virgo ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the collaboration between gw and electromagnetic observatories is likely to continue to develop over the next few years , as the scientific community gets ready for a global network of advanced gw detectors . \n the forthcoming years may see the development of new gw searches in coincidence with grbs , aimed at answering some of the questions opened by recent observations . \n in particular , a compelling result from _ swift _ has been the discovery that the `` normal '' power - law behavior of long grb x - ray light curves is often preceded at early times by a steep decay , followed by a shallower - than - normal decay ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . \n the steep - to - shallow and shallow - to - normal decay transitions are separated by two break times , @xmath7  s and @xmath8  s  @xmath9  s. it has been suggested that the shallow phase may be attributed to a continuous energy injection by a long - lived central engine , with progressively reduced activity @xcite . \n newborn magnetars , besides being candidate grb progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , have also been proposed to account for shallow decays or plateaus observed in grb light curves @xcite . \n independent support for the magnetar scenario comes from the observation of sn2006aj , associated with the nearby sub - energetic grb060218 , suggesting that the sn - grb connection may extend to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought , possibly involving two different mechanisms : a `` collapsar '' for the more massive stars collapsing to a bh , and a newborn ( highly - magnetized ) ns for the less massive ones @xcite . \n several studies have shown how magnetars dipole losses may indeed explain the flattening observed in grb afterglows @xcite . @xcite \n have explored a scenario in which the newly born magnetar left over after the grb explosion undergoes a secular bar - mode instability @xcite , thus producing a bar - like gw signal associated to the electromagnetic plateau , potentially detectable by the advanced ground - based interferometers like ligo and virgo ( up to distances of @xmath5mpc ) . compared to current analyses that gw detectors are carrying out ( see section [ triggered ] ) , \n this scenario @xcite involves a new class of gw signals , with a longer duration ( @xmath10 s ) and a different frequency evolution . \n data analysis techniques for the search of longer duration gw signals possibly applicable to grb searches , are being developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the ligo interferometers are being upgraded to the next - generation advanced detectors @xcite , that are expected to become operational around 2015 . \n virgo will also be upgraded to become advanced virgo @xcite . \n additionally , the new lcgt detector @xcite is being built in japan . \n these advanced detectors are expected to detect compact binary coalescences , possibly at a rate of dozens per year after reaching design sensitivity @xcite , so that the short - grb progenitor scenario may finally be probed directly . \n long - standing open questions ( e.g. , is the jet model for grbs correct ?

from a simple theoretical consideration , one could guess that the fundamental and overtone frequencies of radially pulsating sx phe stars change in the same direction and at about the same rate . \n however , the star we study in this paper , ae uma , has the fundamental and first overtone frequencies changed neither in the same direction nor at the same rate ( @xcite,@xcite ) . \n therefore , it is interesting to investigate pulsation behaviors of this star with the extended data of improved photometric precision . \n + the star ae ursae majoris ( hereafter ae uma)(= hip 47181 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , a9 ) , was discovered by @xcite . \n the spectral type of ae uma was classified by @xcite as a9 in accordance with the type of variability . until 1973 \n , it was shown that the star had significant light - curve variation with the determination of the period of the light variation and the type of variability as dwarf cepheid ( @xcite ) . \n then , the 1974 konkoly observations found the beat phenomenon ( @xcite ) . in 1995 , \n the star is listed as an sx phe star in @xcite . \n however , @xcite showed strong evidence against this classification , and reclassified it as a normal population i , high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti star . according to the calculation of @xcite , \n ae uma had such fast period decreasing ( @xmath23 ) only if it was a pre - ms star , but there exists no evidence that it is a pre - ms star . \n at last , both @xcite and @xcite analyzed pulsations of the star with better and longer data sets , and the results rejected the outcomes from @xcite . \n ae uma was classified as a pop . \n ii , post - ms sx phe star once again , with the fundamental frequency stable and the first overtone decreasing with a rate of about @xmath24 . + in the following sections , we present a detailed study of the period changes of ae uma , mainly based on extended time - series ccd observations from 2009 to 2012 collected at the xinglong station of national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) . \n the organization of the paper is : section 2 describes observations and data reduction ; section 3 introduces the pulsation analysis of the new data ; section 4 discusses the variations of the periods ; section 5 calculates the models with the constraints of the frequencies and their variations ; section 6 lists our conclusions . \n photometric observations for ae uma were made with the 85-cm telescope located at the xinglong station of naoc between march 2009 and may 2012 . \n the 85-cm telescope is equipped with a standard johnson - cousin - bessel multicolour filter system and a pi1024 bft ccd camera mounted on the primary focus ( @xcite ) . \n the ccd camera has @xmath25 pixels , corresponding to a field of view of @xmath26 . since march 2012 \n , the ccd camera has been replaced by a pi512 bft , which has @xmath27 pixels corresponding to a field of view of @xmath28 . \n the observations were made through a standard johnson @xmath29 filter with the exposure time ranging from 15 to 120 seconds , depending on the atmospheric conditions . \n a journal of the new observations is listed in table [ tab1 ] . \n .journal of observations with the 85-cm telescope . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can see that the results were in agreement with the values in @xcite , except the mass . with their observations and the method used , \n onecan believe that the @xmath30 $ ] and the @xmath31 values were in great reliability ( @xcite ) . \n so , we decided to use the value @xmath30 = -0.3 $ ] and @xmath32 . \n we used the fomula @xmath33 = \\log(\\frac{z}{x } ) - \\log(\\frac{z}{x})_{\\odot}\\ ] ] and the fomula @xmath34 to calculate the initial z. in @xcite , the model was calculated with the couple of value @xmath35 , which accord with the values in our previous calculation ( derived by mesa astero with the value of @xmath30 $ ] ) . \n at last , integrating all the informaiton about the value of @xmath36 , we decided to choose @xmath37 as the unique initial value for the subsequent calculation . \n not like the solar - like stars for which many frequencies are detected , hads exits only one or two frequencies . as a result , \n the period variation becomes a very important constraint on the model calculation of these stars . \n detection of high precision of period variation may offer strong constraints on ae uma . \n it is interesting that ae uma exits two frequencies with period variations in different scales and signs . \n but with the linear pulsation theory , variation of the period along with the stellar evolution should have values in the same sign and the same scale in most time . \n we used two different ways to calculate the period variations of ae uma theoretically . \n the vatiation rate of the fundamental period derived from long intervals of observations of ae uma shows a positive period change . from the theoretical point of view , the period changes caused by stellar evolution in and across the lower instability strip permit an observational test of stellar evolution theroy ( @xcite ) .    assuming that the stellar mass @xmath38 for the @xmath8 scuti stars during the observation interval with mass of @xmath39 and that the variation of pulsation constant is negligible as a very small quantity , @xcite got @xmath40 where p is the period of a radial pulsation \n , @xmath41 is the bolometric absolute magnitude , @xmath42 is the effective temperature . \n as indicated by @xcite , the sx phe variables locate on or near the main sequence of the h - r diagram . \n consequently , the evolutionary models are constructed from the pre - main - sequence hayashi phase to the end of the post main sequence . \n as mentioned , the parameters we used are @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . \n in addition , we do not take the effect of rotation into account since ae uma is a low - speed rotator . \n the evolutionary tracks we constructed from @xmath46 to @xmath47 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] , and the corresponding variation of the period were marked in the figure . \n to @xmath47 for @xmath43 . \n the rectangle shown on the h - r diagram is determined from the observed parameters of ae uma . \n marks on the tracks indicate the evolutionary period changes of @xmath48 with the value inside the interval @xmath49 $ ] in units of @xmath50 . ]    as shown in the figure [ fig6 ] , the state which are consonant with the observed period change values derived from the @xmath2 analysis appear before the first turn - offs and after the second turn - offs on the evolutionary tracks when they leave the ms .      adipls ( the aarhus adiabatic oscillation package ) is a programme for calculation of adiabatic oscillations of stellar models ( @xcite ) . \n we used it to calculate the frequencies of the model at each step of our evolutionary state . \n as a result , we got the frequencies of the model of @xmath51 and @xmath52 then deduced the variation of the frequencies of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the calculation \n , we assumed that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the frequencies with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n we calculated the evolutionary tracks from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , getting the frequencies on each tracks , as shown in figure [ fig7 ] .    in figure [ fig7 ] \n , one can see that the models with appropriate frequencies for ae uma could appear ( a ) just before the first turn - offs , ( b ) after the first and before the second turn - offs , ( c ) just after the second turn - offs . \n in addition , we also calculated the variation of the frequencies of the models using adipls . \n the results are shown in figure [ fig8 ] . \n it was not surprising that figure [ fig8 ] was in accord with figure [ fig6 ] , which showed also the variation of the fundamental frequency . \n in figure [ fig9 ] , we show the models with variation of the first overtone frequency @xmath52 in accord with the observed values . for the adiabaticity of the code adipls \n , we get the variation of @xmath52 almost as that of @xmath51 , with the same scale and the sign , even though they may not be equal to each other exactly in every points . \n the @xmath55 values from literatures have a low reliability , but the @xmath31 values have a high reliability are not sensitive to the evolutionary effect . as a result , we show the figures both of them ( @xmath55 vs @xmath56 , @xmath31 vs @xmath56 ) .    integrating the results of calculation of the frequencies and the variation of frequencies and comparison with the observed values , we can conclude that ae uma should locate on either before the first turn - offs or after the second turn - offs of the evolutionary tracks leaving the ms . \n we assume that ae uma is a regular radial pulsator with two frequencies . \n the variation of the fundamental frequency of ae uma is caused by the evolutionary effect . \n the rate of the variation is consistant with the theoretically predicted values by @xcite .    on the other hand \n , we would discuss the variation of the first overtone period which puts another constraint on the models . \n but once we put these constraints ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 ) together , we can not find any overlap on the evolutionary tracks ( superimposing figure [ fig7 ] , figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) . considering with the adiabaticity of adipls \n , we can just obtain the different pulsation modes period changes with same signs and scales . \n as we know , the evolutionary effect is originated from the core nuclear reaction , and propagate from inner to outer of the stellar . \n so we can conclude the evolution of the exterior is later than it of interior . \n in the theory of stellar pulsation , the domain of fundamental mode pulsation is deeper ( more close to the core ) than first overtone mode pulsation . or \n we can say that the fundamental mode is more sensitive than the first overtone mode to the effect of evolution .    hence , when the evolution state of the interior of the star pass through the second turn - off on the tracks ( figure [ fig8 ] ) , the exterior of the star is still in the state between the two turn - offs and preparing to pass through the second turn - off .    with the discussion above \n , one can explain the different signs of the period changes of the two pulsation modes , and conclude that ae uma is located just after the second turn - off on the evolutionary tracks ( see figure [ fig8 ] and figure [ fig9 ] ) . \n its corresponding mass ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath58 , age from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . \n with the photometric observation data from 2009 to 2012 obtained at xionglong station of naoc , we analyed the pulsations of ae uma and resolved up to 37 frequencies , 25 of which are newly detected . \n all these frequencies are shown to be harmonics or combinations of the two main frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath61 , corresponding to the fundamental and the first overtone modes . \n a new @xmath2 diagram was constructed with the 84 times of maximum light determined from our new observations and those listed in the literature , leading to the updated value of period @xmath62 . \n the new ephemeris with a quadratic solution suggests that the fundamental period change rate of ae uma @xmath3 and the first overtone period change with a rate of @xmath63 . \n the first value is different from the result obtained by @xcite , but the second is consistent with the value obtained by @xcite and @xcite . \n we calculated models of stars with masses between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . with the constraints of the values of @xmath51 , \n @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 , we concluded that ae uma locate near the second turn - off of the post - ms evolution tracks with the mass @xmath6 and the age @xmath7 . \n the results of our calculation support the hypothesis that the period variations derived from the observations are mainly a result of the stellar evolution . \n more precise spectroscopic observations are needed , with which one can get more accurate values of @xmath42 and @xmath31 , and stronger constraints on the stellar models . as a result , one can study details of the evolutionary effect propagating from the inner to the outer layer of the star . \n jsn and jnf acknowledeges the support from the national natural science foundation of china ( nsfc),through the grants 10878007 and u1231202 . \n the research is partially supported by the national basic research program of china ( 973 program 2013cb834900 ) and the fundamental research funds for the central universities .                          , a. , rodriguez , e. , rolland , a. , & lopez de coca , p. 1990 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 11 , confrontation between stellar pulsation and evolution , ed . c.  cacciari & g.  clementini , 481", "StartTimeOffset": 3633773932354, "RequestID": "d55144abf22e4181b9d591fa71253053", "TotalTokens": 4110}
{"ContextTokens": 2093, "GeneratedTokens": 312, "SynthesizedBody": "present work is the follow - up on part i of this paper @xcite , discussing a relatively simple model capable of describing the behavior of a massive structure until the point of  localized failure . \n the model contains all the ingredients for taking into account both the  diffuse damage mechanism , which leads to the appearance of microcracks , as well as  the  failure process characterized by the propagation of macrocracks . \n perhaps the most important advantage of the proposed model is the fact that all its parameters have a clear physical interpretation and can be straightforwardly visualized in terms of the shape of a stress - strain diagram . \n in addition , influence of each parameter is dominant only for a specific , easily recognizable , stages of material behavior . \n this kind of a priori knowledge has a potential to greatly simplify the model calibration and will be systematically used throughout the  paper . \n in part ii of this paper , we discuss the identification of the model parameters from experimental measurements made on a structural level . generally speaking , the complexity of the identification procedure is determined by the choice of experimental setup . solely from the identification point of view , the simplest experiment to execute is the uniaxial tensile test . in this case \n , the strain field stays mostly homogeneous during the whole procedure and the global response represented by the load - displacement diagram is very similar to the stress - strain curve for one material point ; see section [ tensile ] for more details . \n the  model parameters can be then directly determined from the shape of the load - displacement curve . \n such a uniform loading is , however , very difficult if not impossible to impose in a laboratory test , especially for quasi - brittle materials . \n therefore , other tests are often used in  experimental practice .    the three - point bending test , in particular , \n is considered to be much simpler to perform and its results are well - reproducible . \n therefore , we focus on the identification procedure for the proposed model parameters directly from results of three - point bending test . \n main difficulty is in this case imposed by heterogeneity of the stress and the strain fields , which is present since the very start of the experiment . \n the macro - scale measurements provide the load - deflection curve that integrates data from different parts of the specimen experiencing different regimes of ( in)elastic behavior . \n for that reason , the possibility of a simple determination of model parameters from load - deflection curve is lost and an advanced calibration procedure needs to be applied .    to take advantage of the model specific structure , \n already mentioned above , the identification procedure should be divided into three sequential stages discussed in detail in  section  [ tpb ] . from the algorithmic point of view \n , the material calibration can then be understood as  a  sequential optimization problem . \n such approach has two main advantages : first , solving three simpler identification steps in a batch form is typically much more efficient then the full - scale problem ; second , it allows to use only a subset of simulations for initial stages of identification process . \n a variety of techniques is available to identify material parameters via optimization methods , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? \n * and reference therein ) . \n the gradient - based methods are usually considered to be the most computationally efficient optimization algorithms available and  as  such have been successfully used in a variety of identification problems , e.g. @xcite . for the  current model , however , analytic determination of sensitivities is fairly difficult , mainly due the history dependency of the model as well as complex interaction of individual parameters . \n the accuracy of numerical approximation to the exact sensitivities , on  the  other hand , is driven by the choice of pseudo - time step used in numerical simulations . \n clearly , to reduce the computational time , the pseudo - time step should be used as large as possible . \n therefore , the response - based objective function will not be smooth and gradient - based methods are unlikely to be very successful . \n as an alternative , techniques of soft - computing can be employed for optimization of complex objective functions . \n for example , stochastic evolutionary algorithms have been successfully used for solution of identification problems on a level of material point @xcite or  on  a  level of simple structures @xcite . for the current case , \n however , complexity of  the  optimization can be attributed rather to its non - smooth character than to the appearance of multiple optima ; the family of problems where evolutionary algorithms are the most successful methods . \n this opens the way to more specialized tools , which deliver higher efficiency when compared to usually time - consuming evolutionary algorithms . \n the approach adopted in the present work is based on an adaptive smoothing of the objective function by artificial neural networks  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for alternative ann - based solutions to identification problems ) . in particular , the approximated model is provided by the radial basis function network , described in section  [ rbfn ] , dynamically evolved by  minima located by a real - encoded genetic algorithm , briefly reviewed in section  [ grade ] . the proposed sequential numerical strategy is systematically verified in section  [ results ] with  attention paid to a detailed assessment of the proposed stochastic algorithm reliability . \n final remarks and conclusions can be found in section [ conclu ] . \n in the present section , we give a brief description of  the model on which the identification procedure is based . \n for the readers interested in more details , the complete description of  the  model is given in part i of this paper . \n as already mentioned , the proposed model is capable of taking into account two different types of dissipation ( e.g. see @xcite ) :    * a bulk dissipation induced by the appearance of uniformly distributed microcracks . \n this bulk dissipation is taken into account by the use of a classical continuum damage model ; * a surface dissipation induced by the development of macrocracks responsible for  the  collapse of the structure . as presented in part \n i of this paper , this phase is taken into account by the use of a strong discontinuity model . \n the surface dissipation is taken into account by the introduction of a traction / displacement jump relation . \n therefore , two different models are involved in the constitutive description : the one associated with the bulk material and the one associated with the displacement discontinuity . \n both are built on the same scheme considering the thermodynamics of continuous media and interfaces . \n the key points of the construction of each of the two models are summarized in table [ tab : tab_continuum ] and table [ tab : tab_discrete ] . \n .main ingredients of the continuum damage model [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n we have proposed a sound identification procedure for material parameters of the constitutive model for representing the localized failure of massive structures . \n the most pertinent conclusions can be stated as follows :    \\i ) the sequential identification approach employed for the uniaxial tensile test can be extended to the three - point bending test . \n the resulting algorithm is very straightforward and has a clear link with the structure of the constitutive model . \n moreover , each of three stages uses only a part of the test simulation , which leads to substantial computational time savings . \n \\ii ) due to the physical insight into the model , it was possible to construct simple objective functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a high sensitivity to the relevant parameters \n . this led to  non - smooth and non - convex objective functions , which were optimized by robust soft - computing methods . \n \\iii ) the proposed identification procedure was verified on @xmath6 independent optimization processes executed for each objective function . in the worst case , the reliability of  the  algorithm is @xmath7 due to very small number of objective functions calls set in the termination condition . from our experience with evolutionary algorithms @xcite , such a result is rather satisfactory . \n \\iv ) as the result of a sequential character of the identification procedure , the errors in  identified parameters accumulate . therefore , the values need to be determined with higher accuracy then usually required in applications ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and achievable by neural network - based inverse analysis @xcite . \n \\v ) the major difficulty of the proposed methods is to properly identify the three stages of structural behavior . from the point of view of method verification , where the reference load - deflection diagram is not noisy , \n the problem was successfully resolved . to fully accept the procedure \n , however , the experimental validation of the method appears to be necessary . \n the financial supports for this work by the czech ministry of education ( research project msm  6840770003 ) and the french ministry of research are gratefully acknowledged . \n jz acknowledges the support of the ens - cachan invited professor funding program . \n d.  brancherie and a.  ibrahimbegovic . \n novel anisotropic continuum - discrete damage model capable of representing localized failure . \n part i : theoretic formulation and numerical implementation . , accepted for  publication ( 2008 ) . \n a.  kuerov and m. lep and j.  zeman . \n back analysis of microplane model parameters using soft computing methods . \n , * 14*(2):219 - 242 , 2007 ( special issue of the international symposium on neural networks and  soft computing ( nnsc-2005 ) )", "StartTimeOffset": 3636735537383, "RequestID": "c5edb2cc2b8f4c868e399490f8e8af2d", "TotalTokens": 2405}

e.g. rocha - pinto et al . \n the mean amrs estimated for our glos show the expected trend with high metallicity stars forming at more recent times in agreement with observations . \n the dispersion found in the simulations indicates the existence of coeval sf sites of different metallicities at a given time . \n the values and trend of these relations depend on the particular evolutionary history of each glo , and the sf and sn model parameters ( see tissera et al \n . 2000 for details ) . \n the chemical abundances in the ism in gas - rich galaxies allows to trace the evolution of individual galaxies , being hii regions and early b - type main sequence objects the most accesible probes of interstellar abundances . \n fairly steep negative gradients are found : @xmath25 dex kpc@xmath26 within @xmath27 kpc for oxygen ( smartt & rolleston 1997 ) . \n figure 2 shows abundance gradients of the oxygen for glos 596 and 325 as examples . \n the curves represent the mass - weighted averages of the metal abundances at each particle position : they clearly show negative abundance gradients . \n the slopes of the calculated gradients range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 dex kpc@xmath26 , in agreement with observations . \n the differences in the abundance gradient slopes for a given glo are due to the sf mechanism and sn parameters , and the fact that we are only including gas in hybrid particles . \n the slopes of glo 325 are less pronounced than those of glo 596 . \n the different behaviour may be due to the fact that the gas in glo 596 forms a well - defined disk , while glo 325 is a clear spheroid , indicating that their histories of formation and evolution have been very different .    to sum up , in our simulations \n , glos have different evolutionary history in consistency with a hierarchical clustering scenario that affect their sf rates and chemical evolution . \n this chemical model can take all these physical processes into account , resulting in a powerful tool to study galaxy formation . \n barton , e. j. , geller , m. j. , & kenyon , s. j. 1999 , , 195 , 2104 chiappini , c. , matteucci f. , & gratton , r. 1997 , , 477 , 765 gratton , r. , cannetta , e. , matteucci , f. , & sneden , c. 1996 , in formation of the galactic halo , inside out , ed . \n h. morrison & a. sanajedini , 92 , 307 mosconi , m. b. , tissera , p. b. , lambas , d. g. , & cora , s. a. 2000 , , submitted raiteri , c. m. , villata , m. , & navarro , j. f. 1996 , , 315 , 105 rocha - pinto , h. j. , maciel , w. j. , & flynn , c. 2000 , , submitted ( astro - ph/0001383 ) smartt , s. j. , & rolleston , w. r. 1997 , , 481 , l47 steinmetz , m. , & mller , e. 1994 , , 281 , l97 thielemann , f. k. , nomoto , k. , & hashimoto , m. 1993 , in origin and evolution of the elements , ed . \n n. prantzos , e. vangoni - flam , & m. cass ( cambridge university press ) , 299 tissera , p. b. , lambas , d. g. , & abadi , m. g. 1997 , , 286 , 384 tissera , p. b. 2000 , , 534 , 636 tissera , p. b. , mosconi , m. b. , cora , s. a. , & lambas , d. g. 2000 , in preparation woosley , s. e. , & weaver , t. a. , 1995 , , 101 , 181", "StartTimeOffset": 3681405411826, "RequestID": "70a4a7d464b24de58ff91e48a6d6a3c3", "TotalTokens": 2360}
{"ContextTokens": 3280, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique which has become one of the optical workhorses in analytical chemistry where it is used to detect and quantify a variety of chemical substances including biomolecules absorbed to a substrate . \n the 1974 report by fleischmann _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite on surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) created an avalanche in surface - enhanced spectroscopies  @xcite . \n localized surface plasmons may dramatically enhance the otherwise intrinsically weak raman scattering [ see panel ( a ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] ] and this has paved the way for chemical detection in very dilute solutions , reaching the limit of single - molecule detection  @xcite . \n initially , there was a strong emphasis on disordered and rough metal surfaces  @xcite ; however during the past decade the use of highly engineered surface plasmonic structures has been envisioned  @xcite . \n the latter development has to a large extent been fueled by the rapid development of a variety of nanofabrication technologies , including high - resolution electron - beam lithography on the true nano scale . as a consequence , \n surface plasmon subwavelength optics has in general developed tremendously  @xcite , and in particular sers has been observed for a large variety of nanostructures , such as nanorods , nanorings , triangular nanoprisms , nanocubes , nanocrescents , and nanorice  @xcite . \n field localization is the key to understanding and further enhancing sers . \n structures with pronounced bends in their surface @xmath2 will tend to localize the field also in the plane of the surface  @xcite . \n singular points , such as sharp kinks and corners , may lead to nonanalytic or even mathematically divergent electric fields . \n real structures are smooth , of course , at least on some microscopic length scale . \n all fabrication processes have their inherent upper bounds on the sharpness that can be fabricated reproducibly . as an example \n , state - of - the - art groove waveguides have sharp features down to a 10  nm scale  @xcite . in an ensemble of nanostructures \n there will always be a size dispersion or structure - to - structure fluctuations in some details of the geometry , for example the nanoscale rounding @xmath3  @xcite will differ from structure to structure , with possibly far - reaching effects on the sers . \n fluctuations between repeated features and variations in the smoothness of individual features have previously been addressed for fractal structures in a number of papers by snchez - gil _ et al . \n _ , see e.g. refs . \n the pronounced sample - to - sample fluctuations are potentially a serious challenge to the development of a technology for reliable use in quantitative sensing applications and bio - chemical analysis .    in this paper \n we address another crucial issue : how are the high enhancement factors found for highly ideal surface structures affected by round - off effects ? \n by means of numerical examples we shall illustrate the extreme precision needed in the fabrication of nanostructured surfaces , if one aims at sers in the excess of ten orders of magnitude . \n specifically , we consider the simple model geometry in panel ( b ) of fig .  [ fig1 ] . \n historically , this was the first structure considered theoretically to explain the large enhancement occurring for rough metal surfaces  @xcite . today , we may easily envision realization of groove structures  @xcite closely resembling the geometry considered in panel ( c ) , though state - of - the - art structures may still be somewhat larger in scale . as mentioned above \n , the points of intersection of neighboring cylinders may lead to a singularity in the electric field , and consequently arbitrarily large enhancement factors [ see eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) below ] . \n in the context of sers it is customary to estimate the surface - enhancement factor @xmath4 from  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position of the molecule . to a first approximation \n the surface - enhancement factor is independent on the intrinsic properties of the molecule . here , \n @xmath2 is the surface bounding the volume @xmath7 occupied by metal , @xmath8 is the incident field , and the total field is @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the scattered component that arises in the presence of the metal surface . \n the surface - averaged enhancement factor applies to the case of a spatially uniform surface - coverage of molecules . \n our theoretical study takes the wave equation for the electrical field as a starting point @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angular frequency and @xmath13 is the vacuum velocity of light . for structures as in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the spatially dependent relative dielectric function is of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dielectric function of the metal . to make our simulations mimic a real material we use the bulk dielectric constant of silver ( thus neglecting spatial dispersion near the metal surface ) , illustrated in fig . \n [ fig2 ] which shows standard handbook data for @xmath15  @xcite along with a numerical fit to the drude expression @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the plasma frequency and @xmath18 the damping rate . \n this simple model accounts very well for the real part , however some deviations are seen in the visible for the imaginary part . \n the spectral position of resonances will thus be accurately predicted by using the drude fit while we shall see that even small deviations in the imaginary part of @xmath19 may influence the enhancement factor , eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , by orders of magnitude . \n in the following we use a finite - element approach ( comsol multiphysics ) to solve eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) in a unit cell resembling panel ( c ) in fig \n .  [ fig1 ] . \n we apply periodic boundary conditions in the direction parallel to the surface . \n deep inside the metal and far out in the free space we employ perfectly - matched layers in the perpendicular direction  @xcite , so that the domain has an extension @xmath20 , i.e. significantly exceeding the free - space wavelength . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) is solved for a normal incident electrical field polarized perpendicular to the groove axis , see panel ( b ) in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , which strongly polarizes the surface by excitation of a surface - plasmon resonance . with the resulting scattered field , and hence @xmath21 \n , we subsequently evaluate eq . \n ( [ eq : gamma ] ) by a boundary integration routine . \n our meshing is chosen to ensure convergence of the enhancement factor ; this requires a particularly fine mesh in the groove region . as an example , resolving the peak in @xmath4 at resonance has typically required a sub - nanometer meshing . on a standard - equipped pc \n the calculation of a single near - resonance frequency point typically takes around 30 seconds . \n figure  [ fig3 ] shows the wavelength dependence of the surface - averaged enhancement factor in the case of @xmath22  nm and @xmath23  nm . \n the solid line shows results based on the drude model , eq . \n ( [ eq : drude ] ) , while the points are obtained from a simulation using the discrete frequencies where handbook data is available , see fig . \n first , we note that these geometrical parameters easily lead to surface - averaged enhancement factors in excess of @xmath24 , i.e. twelve orders of magnitude , in the visible . \n second , when inspecting the peak around @xmath25  nm and comparing the two simulations , it is also clear that the drude model , eq . \n ( [ eq : drude ] ) , overestimates the enhancement by perhaps up to three orders of magnitude . \n this overestimation may be traced back to the imaginary part of @xmath19 shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] where the drude model seriously underestimates the broadening of the surface - plasmon resonance . finally , when approaching the ultra - violet , resonances predicted by the drude model are barely visible when employing the handbook data directly . \n while general trends can be extracted from a drude description , these results emphasize the need for an accurate material - dispersion law for even semi - quantitative predictions of sers . \n in particular , the surface - plasmon damping is crucial in the vicinity of resonances as clearly seen in the dashed traces where we for illustrative purposes have increased the damping rate @xmath18 by a factor of two , five , and ten .    while previous studies  @xcite have reported a spectrally broadened enhancement , our detailed finite - element simulations suggest the existence of highly peaked enhancement factors associated with the formation of a surface - plasmon resonance strongly localized in the groove . \n a related transverse localization has recently been reported experimentally for groove waveguides  @xcite and subsequently confirmed numerically  @xcite . obviously , spatial localization is the route to high enhancement and especially one should minimize the overlap with the lossy metal causing ohmic broadening of resonances . \n the nanoscale cutoff @xmath3 is the geometrical knob that controls the strength of localization and the overlap with the metal . a stronger localization ( @xmath26 ) \n will usually be expected to squeeze up the resonance in frequency space . however , when increasing @xmath3 we actually observe a blue - shift which can be understood within the quasi - static framework of ref . \n @xcite [ see their eq . \n ( 4 ) ] where an increase in metal volume @xmath7 causes modes at @xmath12 to blue - shift to a frequency @xmath27 with a less negative dielectric function , i.e. @xmath28 . in fig . \n [ fig4 ] we illustrate this point for varying values of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath22  nm . for simplicity \n the results are based on the drude model . \n our results show that even for a relatively conservative value of the ratio @xmath29 the enhancement has already dropped to @xmath30 compared to @xmath31 in the case of @xmath32 . \n another geometric factor affecting the field enhancement is the radius of cylinders . in fig . \n [ fig5 ] we illustrate this point for varying values of @xmath33 at fixed @xmath34  nm , again using the drude model . \n our results show a red - shift of the resonance when increasing the radius while the magnitude decreases slightly . \n the red - shift may be understood qualitatively from the scale invariance of eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) in the absence of material dispersion \n [ fig4 ]  and  [ fig5 ] together illustrate how the enhancement is influenced by both length scales @xmath33 and @xmath3 in a nontrivial interplay . \n in conclusion , we have presented finite - element simulations of the sers enhancement factor for an example of a nanostructured surface , which represents the state - of - the - art technology . \n we find that a well - defined structure , with mathematically sharp boundaries [ see eq . \n ( [ eq : eps ] ) ] , may exhibit huge enhancement factors , @xmath35 . \n but any geometric smoothening rapidly decreases the enhancement , and even though a computational optimization may be possible by a painstaking survey of the parameter space ( _ given _ that the dielectric function of the material is known very accurately - no small feat by itself ! ) , it is doubtful whether the extremely high theoretical enhancement factors can be reached in practice and in a reproducible manner . \n we acknowledge stimulating discussions with s.  i. bozhevolnyi . this work is financially supported by the _ danish council for strategic research _ through the _ strategic program for young researchers _ ( grant no : 2117 -

the 7 mm data recover all the flux observed in the most compact vla configuration ( melis et al . \n the deconvolved sizes are 062 and 026 at 870  and 7 mm , respectively , demonstrating that this disk has a smaller apparent radius at 7 mm . \n we have further verified the more compact 7 mm emission using visibility amplitude profiles . \n thus , 8 mm disk sizes may be lower limits . \n the smaller extents at longer wavelengths have been seen toward more - evolved class ii objects ( prez et al . 2012 ) and this is interpreted as the inward radial drift of the dust grains due to aerodynamic drag ( weidenschilling 1977 ) . \n models of dust growth and migration by birnstiel et al . \n ( 2010 ) show that this effect may happen quickly enough to be apparent while still in the protostellar phase . \n we can not , however , rule - out grain growth alone in the inner disk being responsible for this effect . \n multi - wavelength modeling will be necessary to assess the difference in dust emission from short to long wavelengths . \n with the ability to resolve multiples down to separations of 15 au , the vandam survey represents a significant evolution in our knowledge of protostellar multiplicity . \n we show examples of a few multiples systems from the vandam survey in figure 3 . \n the companion of iras 2a , with a 142 au separation , was first discovered in the vandam survey and is the apparent driving source of the east - west outflow from the system ( tobin et al . \n the svs13a multiple was first detected by anglada et al . \n ( 2000 ) and iras 4a by looney et al . \n note that the brighter source in iras 4a ( 4a1 or se ) is well resolved at 8 mm , possibly tracing a massive inner envelope or disk . from the 8 mm data , we have also detected linear polarization of the dust emission toward iras 4a1 ( cox et al . \n 2015 ) , tracing an apparent toroidal magnetic field in this system . \n the full multiplicity results of the vandam survey are shown in tobin et al . \n ( submitted ) , where we observe a clear bi - modal distribution of companion separations ; one peak is at 75 au and another is at @xmath03000 au . \n the 75 au separation peak had not been previously detected due to limited resolution , and we suggest that the 75 au peak may result from disk fragmentation . \n the 3000 au separation peak may result from turbulent or jeans fragmentation . \n the key to the success of the vandam survey was in its unbiased nature and the superb sensitivity of the upgraded vla , obtaining as complete a characterization of protostellar disks and multiple systems as possible . \n 99 adams , f.  c. , ruden , s.  p. , & shu , f.  h.  1989 , _ apj _ , 347 , 959 allen , a. , li , z .- y . , & shu , f.  h.  2003 , _ apj _ , 599 , 363 anglada , g. , rodrguez , l.  f. , & torrelles , j.  m.  2000 , _ apjl _ , 542 , l123 birnstiel , t. , dullemond , c.  p. , & brauer , f.  2010 , _ a&a _ , 513 , a79 burkert , a. , & bodenheimer , p.  1993 , _ mnras _ , 264 , 798 chen , x. , arce , h.  g. , zhang , q. , et al .  2013 , _ apj _ , 768 , 110 cox , e.  g. , harris , r.  j. , looney , l.  w. , et al .  2015 , arxiv:1511.00685 enoch , m.  l. , evans , n.  j. , ii , sargent , a.  i. , & glenn , j.  2009 , _ apj _ , 692 , 973 offner , s.  s.  r. , kratter , k.  m. , matzner , c.  d. , et al .  2010 , _ \n apj _ , 725 , 1485 padoan , p. , nordlund ,  . , \n kritsuk , a.  g. , et al .  2007 , _ \n apj _ , 661 , 972 prez , l.  m. , carpenter , j.  m. , chandler , c.  j. , et al . \n 2012 , _ apjl _ , 760 , l17 tobin , j.  j. , hartmann , l. , chiang , h .- f . , et al . \n 2012 , _ nature _ , 492 , 83 tobin , j.  j. , dunham , m.  m. , looney , l.  w. , et al .  2015 , _ apj _ , 798 , 61 weidenschilling , s.  j.  1977 , _ mnras _ , 180 , 57", "StartTimeOffset": 3727702208881, "RequestID": "7305b912429141b0a9770caa3fc7cd7e", "TotalTokens": 2411}

the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . \n on the other hand , the ns - ns binaries show relatively stable statistics ; the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in all of these binaries , the mean masses do not exceed @xmath10 , and one may conclude that most of ns masses lie in the range of @xmath11 , which can be regarded as a canonical range of ns masses . note that nss with larger masses have relatively larger measurement errors except for a few exceptions for the large ns masses , which were measured with high accuracy , e.g. , psr j1614 - 2230 , @xmath12 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 , @xmath13 @xcite .    by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation \n , one can see that the ns with large mass can have a high - density region in the core , providing a room for the existence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom such as hyperons , bose - einstein condensation , free quark phase and etc . \n these exotic states relieve the pressure exerted by the fermionic nature of nucleons , make the equation of state ( eos ) soft , and eventually reduce the mass of ns . among diverse possibilities , \n hyperons have been playing a key role in reducing the maximum mass of ns to the canonical range . \n however , recent observations of nss with @xmath12 and @xmath13 initiate a challenge to the existence of hyperons at the core of ns ( so called  hyperon puzzle \" ) .    in order to solve the hyperon puzzle , \n some studies based upon both relativistic and non - relativistic mean field ( rmf and nrmf , respectively ) models have been conducted so far . \n the modern version of these models shows great accuracy in reproducing the properties of known nuclei . \n however , the maximum mass of ns calculated with these models shows drastic fluctuations , ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 even without including any hyperon yet @xcite . \n main uncertainty comes from the extrapolation of models to the high density where no experimental data available . \n therefore , the measurement of the @xmath16 ns from psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 can rule out some of rmf or nrmf models that predict the maximum mass less than @xmath3 . \n when the effect of hyperons is included in the rmf models , the coupling constants of hyperons are fitted to the depth of hyperon - nucleus optical potentials at the nuclear saturation density in most of the rmf models . \n ( note that the hyperon - nucleus optical potentials are obtained from the single - strangeness hypernuclei . ) with this method , the rmf models show the similar effect of hyperons on ns mass regardless of the differences among various rmf models ; the mass of ns is depending on the background nuclear models @xcite . in order to solve the hyperon puzzle , some recent works introduced repulsive forces caused by the vector - meson exchange in the rmf models @xcite . in ref . \n @xcite , by assuming a hard core of hyperons , one of the authors ( chh ) obtained the maximum mass of ns close to @xmath3 . \n however , the parameterization used in these approaches is not directly compatible with hypernuclear data and relies partly on the theoretical arguments . \n dealing with the interactions between hyperons is in a worse situation because of statistically insufficient data from the double - hypernuclei experiments . in most cases , \n the coupling constants between hyperons are determined from the symmetry arguments . \n the coupling constants obtained in this manner show very minor effects on the mass of ns @xcite , so in many works the interactions between hyperons are justified to be omitted for simplicity . \n the purpose of this work is to explore the effect of the @xmath1 interactions on the eos and the resulting bulk properties of ns by employing a few skyrme - type models and a finite - range model that reproduce the empirical binding energies of the double-@xmath17 hypernuclei . for the nucleon and single-@xmath17 interactions and the nucleon - nucleon interactions \n , we also use the skyrme - type models that are consistent with the experimental data . \n we find that our results with these models turn out to be quite different from those of the rmf models , suggesting a possible solution to the hyperon puzzle . \n we find that some of our models both predict the maximum mass of @xmath3 and are in good agreement with the observationally - constrained mass - radius relation @xcite . \n we organize this paper as follows . \n ii explains the skyrme - type models for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interactions and the nucleon-@xmath17 ( @xmath0 ) interactions . \n as mentioned above , we use both the skyrme - type models and a finite - range force model for the @xmath1 interactions . sect . \n ii also contains some details of these models . sect . \n iii is devoted to the results about the properties of ns matter , and the consequent mass - radius relation of ns . \n we summarize our work and give some discussions in sect . \n we employ the standard skyrme - type forces for the @xmath18 interactions given in the form @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + t_2(1+x_2 p_\\sigma ) \\bm{k}'_{ij } \\cdot \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) \\bm{k}_{ij } + \\frac{1}{6 } t_3(1+x_3 \n p_\\sigma ) \\rho_n^\\epsilon ( \\bm{r } ) \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + i w_0 \\bm{k}'_{ij } \\cdot \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) ( \\bm{\\sigma}_i + \\bm{\\sigma}_j )   \\times \\bm{k}_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the spin exchange operator @xmath24 , and the nucleon density @xmath25 . \n we choose three models sly4 , ski4 , and sgi for the parameters of @xmath18 interactions . as shown in ref . \n @xcite , these models are in reasonable agreement with the mass - radius constraints of the observed ns presented in ref . \n the basic properties of the models are summarized in table [ tab : nnforce ] . \n we note that the models also satisfy the maximum mass constraints given by psr j1614 - 2230 or psr j0348 + 0432 . \n .nuclear matter properties and the maximum mass of ns calculated from the @xmath18 skyrme force models . \n @xmath26 : saturation density in unit of @xmath27 , @xmath28 : binding energy of the symmetric nuclear matter in unit of mev , @xmath29 : symmetry energy at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath30 : slope of the symmetry energy at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath31 : compression modulus of the symmetric matter at the saturation density in unit of mev , @xmath32 : ratio of the effective mass of the nucleon at the saturation density ( @xmath33 ) to the free mass of the nucleon ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 : maximum mass of ns in unit of the solar mass ( @xmath36 ) .

{"ContextTokens": 3836, "GeneratedTokens": 306, "SynthesizedBody": "in the standard big bang model , the primordial abundance of deuterium is a sensitive function of the baryon to photon ratio , ( e.g. walker et al . 1991 ) making it a quantity of great cosmological interest . \n further , since all known astrophysical processes ( apart from the big bang itself , of course ) result in a net destruction of deuterium , the currently observed value of the deuterium abundance is a strict lower limit to its primordial abundance . \n hst observations of the di lyman@xmath5 line in the local solar neighborhood ( linsky et al . \n 1993 ) yield a deuterium abundance of @xmath6 . \n conversion from this local current abundance to the primordial abundance depends on less well understood details of the history of the stellar reprocessing of matter in the local ism . in order to circumvent this problem \n a number of groups have been attempting to measure the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman - limit systems . \n since these systems are less chemically evolved than the local ism , conversion from the measured to the primordial abundance should be more straightforward . \n however , the results of these observations are conflicting , with different groups ( carswell et al . \n 1994 , songalia et al . \n 1994 , tytler et al . \n 1996 ) measuring abundances which differ by more than an order of magnitude . \n part of the problem is that the di lyman@xmath5 line is separated from the hi lyman@xmath5 line by only 82  km  s@xmath7 , making the chance of contamination of the di line by absorption from a small parcel of hi at a slightly different velocity from that of the main lyman - limit system non - negligible . \n there have also been several attempts to observe the hyperfine transition of di at radio frequencies . \n since the frequency of this line is more than a factor of 4 lower than the frequency of the corresponding transition in hi , the question of hi contamination does not arise . \n two kinds of lines - of - sight have been favored in the past , the first towards bright radio sources ( sgr  a & cas  a ; weinreb 1962 , anantharamiah & radhakrishnan 1979 , heiles et al . \n 1993 ) , where the hydrogen column density is known to be high . \n the disadvantages of these lines of sight are that : ( i )  the bright radio sources contribute significantly to the system temperature , making detection more difficult ; ( ii )  any measurement refers only to the thin pencil beam subtended by the absorber ; and ( iii )  the molecular column density is also high , making it likely that most of the deuterium is in molecular rather than atomic form ( heiles et al . 1993 ) . \n anantharamiah & radhakrishnan ( 1979 ) placed an upper limit of @xmath8 on the di abundance towards sgr  a. heiles et al . \n ( 1993 ) reached similar limits towards sgr  a as well as cas  a.    the other promising direction for a search for the radio emission from di is that towards the galactic anticenter , where one expects the line to be in emission . \n the advantages of this direction are that ( i )  the high optical depth of hi is due to velocity crowding along a long pathlength rather than a high volume density ; ( ii )  the molecular column density and metallicity are low ; and ( iii )  the observations are sensitive to the di abundance within the entire telescope beam , and not just a narrow cone towards the background source as in the case of absorption observations . \n the results of a long integration in the direction @xmath9 using the hat creek telescope were presented by blitz & heiles ( 1987 ) , who found an upper limit ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 for @xmath1 . here \n we report on a long integration towards a partially overlapping line - of - sight , @xmath12 , with the westerbork synthesis array . using the 14 wsrt telescopes as independent single dishes allowed us to significantly increase the effective integration time . \n the observations were conducted at the wsrt during 29 sessions between 9  march and 14  may 1989 , and used a special correlator configuration which provided 28 auto - correlations ( 14  telescopes @xmath13 2  polarizations ) in addition to a number of cross - correlations between the different telescopes . \n the cross - correlation data were not used in the data analysis . \n the observations were done in a frequency switched mode , with the magnitude of the frequency throw equal to the total bandwidth of 0.156 mhz ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath7 ) . \n each spectrum had 256 uniformly tapered channels . \n the on spectrum was centered on @xmath15  km  s@xmath7 . \n either before or after each source observation ( which typically lasted a few hours ) a standard calibrator was observed in the same frequency switched mode for about an hour . \n the data reduction was done in wasp ( chengalur 1996 ) , a package suited to the automated reduction of large quantities of spectral data . for each observation , \n the data for each polarization of each telescope were reduced separately . \n every 60 second on spectrum was baselined using the corresponding off spectrum . \n next the following flagging and baselining operations were done iteratively , until the the rms of the remaining unflagged data converged ( which it typically did within 3 iterations ) . \n the rms over all channels and all time was computed , all points which exceeded 6 sigma were flagged . \n a linear baseline was then fit and subtracted from each spectrum ( excluding these flagged points ) . \n spectra whose rms ( over channel numbers ) exceeded 2.5 times the global rms were flagged , and finally channels whose rms ( over time ) exceeded 3 times the global rms were flagged . for all but the first iteration , the previously fit baseline was first added back to each spectrum . \n these criteria were selected after trial runs on a few sample observations and were tailored for efficient removal of narrow - band emi and of spectra in which the emi was strong enough to cause ringing effects . \n the data from telescopes 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 ( which are the closest to the control building ) showed a large amount of emi , and are almost entirely flagged out . \n finally , all the unflagged data were averaged together to produce one average spectrum per polarization per telescope per observation . \n since low - level intermittent emi sometimes survived this flagging process , this average spectrum was inspected visually and telescopes with broad multi - channel emi or with low - level ringing were flagged . \n all the remaining data were averaged together , separately for each polarization of each telescope . \n these processing steps were carried out separately for the source and the calibrator observations . \n a 4@xmath16 order polynomial baseline was then fit to the _ calibrator _ spectrum and then this _ same _ baseline was removed from the source observations ( after allowing for a small scaling difference between the source and calibrator observation ) . \n the spectra from two telescopes ( both polarizations of rtd and one polarization of rt3 ) showed substantial baseline structure even after this correction and were dropped from further processing . \n the spectra from the remaining telescopes were then averaged together and smoothed with a gaussian smoothing function of 11.2  km  s@xmath7 fwhm . \n a few channels which still showed unresolved peaks , presumably due to emi , were blanked before smoothing . since the smoothing length was @xmath17 channels , this had very little effect on the spectrum . \n the final spectrum ( excluding about 10% of the band on either edge for which the noise level is higher and the calibrator baseline is more poorly determined ) is shown in figure  1 . \n the peak - to - peak variation is about 4  mk , approximately a factor of two smaller than that of the spectrum in blitz & heiles ( 1987 ) . \n it is interesting to note that similar to blitz & heiles , there is a feature of low significance ( @xmath18 peak brightness ) at the velocity @xmath19  km  s@xmath7 . \n we have overlaid a gaussian profile with peak brightness 2.4  mk and the same velocity centroid , @xmath20  km  s@xmath7 and fwhm of 18.7  km  s@xmath7 as the hi emission feature in this direction . excluding this possible feature , the noise level is 0.85  mk over 11.2  km  s@xmath7 , again about a factor of 2 lower than the 1.6  mk quoted in blitz & heiles 1987 ( who also appear to have excluded the putative feature before computing the noise level ) . including this feature in the calculation of the noise \n gives an rms of 1.06  mk , while the expected thermal noise is 0.8  mk . \n the galactic anticenter region , near @xmath21 , is particularly well - suited to a search for the di hyperfine emission feature at @xmath2292-cm . \n the hi emission brightness in this region peaks smoothly into a plateau extending spatially over several degrees with a brightness temperature 135@xmath233  k , as can be seen in burton ( 1985 ) . \n conditions should therefore be reasonably constant over the @xmath24 beam of the wsrt dishes . \n the extended region of line brightening is paired with a line narrowing due to velocity crowding . \n the hi emission - line profile from this region is relatively narrow , with a fwhm of 18.7  km  s@xmath7 . \n the line core is rather flat - topped , strongly suggesting a high line opacity . \n it also displays shallow self - absorption , indicating a modest amount of temperature substructure along the line - of - sight . \n based on the depth of the self - absorption features and assuming a substantial line opacity , the spin temperature of the atomic gas appears to be in the range 125135  k.    direct measurements of the hi opacity along many lines of sight in this region have not yet been carried out . \n the typical sky density of moderately bright extragalactic background sources suitable for such a measurement suggests that a few tens of lines of sight could , in principle , be observed . \n the closest line of sight that has been observed in hi absorption ( dickey et al . \n 1983 ) is at @xmath25 . \n this is near the edge of the plateau in emission brightness , where the line profile is already somewhat broader than in the direction of maximum velocity crowding , with a fwhm of 23.4  km  s@xmath7 . \n the absorption profile extends smoothly over the entire velocity extent in which the emission profile exceeds a brightness of about 510  k , with a uniform high opacity of about 2 across the line core . \n this is consistent with the expectation for a gas distribution in which the column density is dominated by an approximately isothermal gas with kinetic temperature in the range 125135  k. an absorption equivalent width , @xmath26  =  33.68  km  s@xmath7 is found . \n the very smooth nature of the hi emission suggests that it is plausible to expect a comparable equivalent width in the direction @xmath12 .    assuming that the di emission is either mixed with , or lies behind , most of the galactic continuum emission , ( which has the substantial brightness of about 70  k at 92  cm wavelength ) the equation of radiative transfer yields simply :      where @xmath28 is the differential brightness temperature on and off the line , @xmath29 is the spin temperature of the di and @xmath30 is the optical depth of the di . for @xmath31 \n this yields @xmath32 , or @xmath33 for an approximately isothermal gas . \n the line integral of the gaussian overlaid on the possible feature in figure  1 is @xmath34  k  km  s@xmath7 . assuming that the spin temperature of the di is the same as that of hi ( i.e. 130  k ) , this corresponds to @xmath35  =  3.7@xmath3610@xmath37  km  s@xmath7 . \n hence the estimate of the ratio of the optical depths is @xmath38 . \n the relationship between the ratio of the optical depths and the ratio of the column densities of di and hi is ( anantharamiah & radhakrishnan 1979 ) @xmath39 , hence the estimated abundance of di is @xmath2 . \n this is comparable to the inferred pre - solar abundance ( kunde et al . \n 1982 , courtin et al . \n 1984 ) , and about a factor of 2 above the current di abundance in the local solar neighborhood ( linsky et al . 1993 ) . \n as discussed in the introduction , the lack of detection of di towards the inner galaxy suggests that most of the di has been converted into hd within molecular clouds ( heiles et al . 1993 ) . towards the outer galaxy , however , the molecular column density is low along many sight lines . \n in fact , the survey by dame et al . \n ( 1987 ) detected very little co emission in the galactic plane between 180 and 185 degrees longitude except for a small concentration at @xmath40  km  s@xmath7 . \n the high optical depth in hi seems to be due to velocity crowding in diffuse gas along a pathlength of several kpc , and does not appear to arise in a single physical entity like a giant molecular cloud . \n it seems plausible , therefore , that a large fraction of the deuterium in this direction is still in atomic form . \n further , the metallicity gradient in the galaxy suggests that the di abundance in the outer galaxy would be higher than the inner . \n calculations by prantzos ( 1996 ) show that the deuterium abundance gradient is in general steeper than ( and of course opposite in sign to ) the oxygen gradient ( because of the late ejection of metal - poor but deuterium - free gas from low mass stars formed at early times ) . \n while the exact gradient is sensitive to the assumed infall model , the current di abundance within diffuse atomic gas in the inner and outer galaxy could well differ by a factor of two . \n another useful comparison to make is with the range of measured di abundances , @xmath41 , in high redshift lyman limit systems ( carswell et al . \n 1994 , songalia et al . \n 1994 , tytler et al . 1996 ) . \n if a high primordial abundance turns out to be correct , our results indicate that even in regions with reduced star formation , the current deuterium abundance is about a factor of 6 lower than primordial . \n in contrast , recent model calculations of astration of deuterium suggest that the abundance evolution is modest , with current abundance only a factor @xmath42 less than primordial ( galli et al . \n 1995 ) . on the other hand , the low value of d / h measured by tytler et al . \n ( 1996 ) , @xmath43 , is consistent with our own possible detection and the inferred pre - solar value . \n direct imaging of di emission in the outer regions of nearby galaxies may provide a very effective means of addressing this issue comprehensively , once the capability for achieving sub - mk sensitivity on arcmin scales becomes available with the next generation of radio telescopes . \n the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) should already allow a robust detection of di emission from the galaxy within the next few years , while di imaging of nearby external galaxies should become possible with construction of the square kilometer array interferometer ( skai ) early in the mext millenium . \n we would like to thank hans van someren grve and the wsrt staff for carrying out these non - standard observations , and bauke kramer , tony foley and geert kuiper for assistance in retrieving the data from the wsrt archive .", "StartTimeOffset": 3835614350494, "RequestID": "eed180d2b8de4caf87b7c007a17ebe03", "TotalTokens": 4142}
{"ContextTokens": 3420, "GeneratedTokens": 189, "SynthesizedBody": "neyman and scott ( 1952 , 1953b ) , using statistical techniques based on counts - in - cells , showed that the galaxy distribution is statistically clustered rather than statistically uniform , and on the other , abell actually identified from palomar sky survey plates , 2712 operationally well - defined rich clusters of galaxies ( abell 1958 ) . to better describe the clustering property , the two - point correlation function ( peebles 1973 ) and continual high order correlation functions ( croton et al 2004 ) are widely used . \n high density regions , such as filaments ( wu et al . 2012 ) , superclusters ( connolly et al . 1996 ) and low density regions , such as voids ( danny et al . 2012 ) , are discovered and well discussed . at the same time , people begin to have interest for the comparison of high density and low density region . \n if the early universe is grown from quantum fluctuations , then positive and negative fluctuations will have the same probability and a sponge - like structure ( high density regions have the same topology with low density regions ) is doomed ( gott 1986 ) . with the evolution dominated by gravitational instability , \n the sponge - like structure is most likely remained whatever the growth stays in the linear regime or is damped ( bond & szalay 1983 ) . \n gott ( 1986 ) found that both two regions have similar properties from the measured density contours , such as sponge - like shape , connectedness . \n however , gott ( 1986 ) mentioned a direct test more than measuring density contours is needed . \n here we use the hexagon cell method to investigate the equivalent of high density and low density regions . \n our hexagon cell method is inherited from the dodecahedron cells ( kiang 2003 , kiang et al 2004 ) ; it is actually a 2-d application of dodecahedron cells method . \n different cells have been applied to analyze the topology of galaxy distribution , such as truncated octahedrons ( coxeter 1937 ; gott 1967 ; gott 1986 ) , voronoi foams ( icke and weygaert 1987 ) , dodecahedron cells ( kiang 2004 ) ; 2d topological structure of the observed universe has been investigated by variety of methods , such as genus method ( davies & coles 1993 , colley 1997 , hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) , percolation and ? \n lamentarity ( pandey & bharadwaj 2008 ) . \n colley ( 1997 ) found that the 2d genus of the las campanas redshift survey is very close to a gaussian random field , hoyle claimed the genus of 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey team ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) reveals a smaller number of isolated voids than clusters ( hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) .    the motivation of this paper is to investigate the topological relation between low density regions ( such as voids ) and high density regions ( such as clusters ) to get more understanding of the early universe . \n our article is organized as follows . in section 2 \n we present the hexagon cells method . in section 3 \n we study the data from the 2mass . \n we summarize the results in section 4 and have conclusions in section 5 . \n if we partition the 2-d space into cells with the shape of hexagon , we can get hexagonal lattice . \n hexagonal lattice is one of the five 2d lattice types and is the only lattice which can fill the 2d space inseparably with more edges than square . in the natural world \n , honeycomb is an interesting example of hexagonal lattice . for bees , hexagon is the most efficient shape for the bees living and storing of food . in the reality , \n the hexagon structure provides the maximum strength and that it is used in designing airplane wings and satellites walls . \n the reason of using hexagon cells in this paper is that we want to have the direction detection as many as possible for our unit cells . \n hexagon cells could detect the neighbors in six directions and provide us the rich topology information , and at the same time fill in the space without overlap or missing region . \n for an application of hexagon method on galaxy distribution , similar with the definition of rhombic cell in kiang ( 2003 ) , if a hexagon cell contains no galaxies , then we call it an empty cell ; otherwise , it is a filled cell . automatically empty cells represent the low density region and filled cells represent the high density region . by this definition \n , we could discover if the filled and empty regions have the same morphology and give us a quantitative description of the topology . \n we know the hexagons have 6 neighbors and 6 edges shared with neighbors . \n if two neighbor cells are both filled or both empty , then we define their common edges as inner edge ; otherwise we call it as outer edge . \n we use n to define the number of inner edges . \n the physical meaning of n is to find the same kind of neighbors for each hexagon and investigate the aggregation pattern for filled and empty cells . in this way \n n is the approximation of the two point correlation function in a specific small scale . \n if filled cells are not distributed in space randomly , we can expect the distribution of n will be depart from the well - known binomial form , same thing for empty cells . \n this in turn will tell us the morphology similarity and difference of high density and low density regions . \n based on the definition of @xmath0 , we could divide the six edges into inner edges and outer edges two groups and consider the connectedness of inner edges or outer edges . \n we use @xmath2 to represent the number of connected inner edges group and use @xmath3 to represent the number of connected outer edges group , that is @xmath1 ( see fig . \n 1 ) . so @xmath4 means a single cell surrounded by 6 unlike neighbors ( same with @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 means a single cell surrounded by 6 like neighbors ( same with @xmath7 ) . \n @xmath8 means likely that the cell is on the boundary of the clusters or voids , so its two kind of neighbors are connected separately . \n @xmath9 represents a string - like structure and the string penetrates the cell and results in two groups for each of kind neighbors . \n @xmath10 is complicated and its special shape possibly implies a mesh structure . \n to better understand the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distribution difference between observed and random sample , similar with the method mentioned by kiang ( 2003 ) , we define statistic @xmath12 as a measure of the degree to which the observed frequency of cells exceeds its random expectation for each different structure defined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n @xmath13 is for observed sample , @xmath14 is for random sample .      to investigate the uncertainties of the results , we use same method which kiang ( 2004 ) used in rhombic cell analysis . \n obviously the present application of hexagon cell analysis revealed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 results are highly sensitive to the exact placing of the grid of hexagon cells . because when the galaxies are fixed , if the cells are moved it will get same galaxies to lie in different cells , we call it as the zero offset . \n we start our calculations by placing the centre of our zeroth cell ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) at galactic coordinates ( 0,0,0 ) . \n what we found was that if we displace our entire grid of cells by an amount up to and including one unit of a0 , in any combination of the three directions , then the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath15 will generally be different , but slightly . \n if we define the length of cell is 1 , we simply consider 4 shifts which are ( 0 , 0.5 ) , ( -0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0.5 ) . \n the four shifts will be combined with the origin gridding to get average @xmath0 and @xmath15 value with stand deviation . \n generally the shift will result in the unequal number of filled and empty cells , but it is very tiny ( around 1/1,000 ) , moreover , it makes more sense for us to keep the length of the cell rather than adjusting it to get equal number of filled and empty cells , so we fix the length of cells when we shift . \n the 2mass ( xsc , jarrett et al . 2000 ) data we use is provided by cao et al ( 2006 ) , detailed information can be found in their paper . simply speaking , they select galaxies inside an elliptical isophote with surface brightness of 20 mag @xmath16 in ks band . to have 2-d plane data , they subject the 2mass data to an equal - area projection by the lambert azimuthal algorithm :    @xmath17    where @xmath14 is a relative scale factor , @xmath18 is the galactic latitude and @xmath19 is the galactic longitude . \n this hemisphere scheme projects the whole sky into two circular planes , a northern and southern sky . \n we select a square with @xmath20 in the central part of each circular plane . \n we have two fields of @xmath20 in the northern and southern skies . \n the northern square has 323,000 galaxies and the southern includes 342,000 galaxies . \n before we analyze the data , we could get the binomial distribution for reference . \n the binomial distribution gives the discrete probability distribution @xmath21 of obtaining exactly @xmath22 successes out of @xmath23 bernoulli trials ( where the result of each bernoulli trial is true with probability @xmath24 and false with probability @xmath25 , as given by eq.4 below : ) . \n @xmath26    since for any neighbors of a cell , the probability of a filled or empty cell is the same ( we have the same number of filled and empty cells ) , so @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for an @xmath0 distribution , @xmath29 ( 6 walls for hexagon ) , and n=(0,1,2,4,5,6 ) . from eq . ( 4 ) the probability function of a binomial distribution is ( 1/64 , 6/64 , 15/64 , 20/64 , 15/64 , 6/64 , 1/64 ) for n= ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . for @xmath1 , since this is related to specific arrangements , it is better to list all combinations and calculate the probability than using eq.(4 ) . \n since there are 6 walls , each wall could be inner wall or outer wall , so the total combinations give @xmath30 arrangements . \n if we use `` 1 '' for inner wall , and `` 0 '' for outer wall , we could write number 0  63 with 6-digits binary format , such as 000000 , 000001 .... then the 64 binaries are exactly all possible arrangements of @xmath1 . \n we list the results in table 1 :    . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath31 from @xmath0=6 ( or @xmath6 ) filled cells have a much stronger ( 21@xmath32 for northern sky and 15@xmath32 for southern sky ) aggregation property than empty cells . \n this is consistent with hoyle ( 2002 ) who found that the number of isolated voids is smaller than the number of clusters in the 2df survey . \n @xmath31 the most general case is @xmath33 ( 20/64 probability for standard distribution ) ; however , we can see the @xmath0 value at @xmath33 is smaller than standard distribution . \n this can be explained as that aggregation makes filled and empty cells have more probability on @xmath34 than standard distribution , hence reduce the probability at @xmath33 . \n @xmath31 for @xmath0=1 , filled cells are closer ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 6@xmath32 for southern sky ) to standard distribution than empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less or longer fiber structure than filled cells as the end of fiber always has @xmath0=1 . \n @xmath0=1 must result in a @xmath8 structure , we do not see much difference between filled and empty cells for @xmath8 in table 1 . \n this suggests @xmath0=1 structure is the minority in most @xmath8 structures , in other words , @xmath8 includes much more cells on the boundary of filled and empty cells than of the end . \n @xmath31 @xmath9 has also significant difference ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 8@xmath32 for southern sky ) between filled and empty cells . \n empty cells have much more frequently penetrated by filled cells than filled cells penetrated by empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less fiber structure than filled cells and is consistent with @xmath0=1 results . \n with a direct measurement by the hexagon cell method , we found there are significant differences in topology between high density regions and low density regions in 2mass data . \n the accuracy is assured by the zeroshift technique . \n we found low density regions have less fiber structure and are less clustered than high density regions to high accuracy . \n the difference could be caused by the evolution , which suggests that evolution might include more things other than gravitational instability ( bond @xmath35 szalay 1983 ) ; or caused by the original asymmetry of quantum fluctuation in the early universe ( turner 1998 ) . overall speaking , \n low density regions have slightly closer topology to random distribution than high density regions . \n we also found the topology of 2mass southern sky map is slightly closer to random distribution tan northern sky . \n our work provides a supplement for genus analysis , which shows that high density and low density regions have almost identical properties ( park et al , 2001 ; gott 1986 ) or are slightly different ( hoyle et al 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3854772386535, "RequestID": "8cc2d8329a6f4cddb9a6a01fded70527", "TotalTokens": 3609}
{"ContextTokens": 3713, "GeneratedTokens": 452, "SynthesizedBody": "optical tweezers have seen deployment in a wide range of applications in biology , soft materials , microassembly , and other fields . as well as being used for the trapping and manipulation of a wide range of natural and artificial objects , \n optically trapped probes are used to measure forces on the order of piconewtons . \n compared with this diverse range of experimental applications , theory and accurate computational modelling of optical tweezers has received much less attention and has remained relatively undeveloped , especially for non - spherical particles and non - gaussian beams . \n this is unfortunate , especially when we consider the growing fields of controlled rotation of complex microparticles  prototype optically - driven micromachines  and fully three - dimensional manipulation using complex optical fields , where the application of theory and modelling provide insight into the physics , and allow engineering and optimisation . \n since optical forces and torques result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle via scattering , the theory and computational modelling of optical tweezers is , in essence , the theory and computational modelling of the scattering of light or electromagnetic radiation . since typical particles that are optically trapped or manipulated \n are on the order of the wavelength in size , approximate methods such as geometric optics or rayleigh scattering are inapplicable , and solution or either the maxwell equations or the vector helmholtz equation must be resorted to . as scattering by particles in this size range \n is of interest in many fields , a wide variety of analytical and computational methods have been developed . \n thus , there is a solid foundation on which to develop computational modelling of optical micromanipulation . \n there are , however , complications that prevent simple direct application of typical light - scattering codes . the first , but not necessarily the most important , \n is that optical tweezers makes use of a highly focussed laser beam , while most existing scattering codes assume plane wave illumination . \n perhaps more fundamental is the need for a large number of repeated calculations to characterise an optical trap  even for an axisymmetric ( but nonspherical ) particle trapped in a circularly polarised gaussian beam , we already have four degrees of freedom . \n clearly , this places strong demands on computational efficiency .    due to this requirement for repeated calculation of scattering by the same particle \n , we employ the _ t_-matrix method  @xcite . \n below , we outline the employment of the _ t_-matrix method for the calculation of optical forces and torques . \n while most implementations of the _ t_-matrix method are restricted to simple geometries , this is not a limitation inherent in the method ; fundamentally , the _ \n t_-matrix method is a _ description _ of the scattering properties of a particle , not a method of calculating the scattering properties . \n therefore , in principle , any method of calculating scattering can be used to obtain the _ \n t_-matrix for a scatterer . \n we discuss such `` hybrid '' methods , where a computational method not usually associated with the _ t_-matrix method is used to calculate the _ \n t_-matrix of a scatterer , and hence the optical force and torque . \n a further important consideration is that optical micromachines , while complex , are likely to possess a high degree of symmetry ; this can be exploited to reduce computation times by orders of magnitude . \n we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by modelling the optical trapping and rotation of a cube . \n the two principal symmetries of such shapes  mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about the normal to the mirror symmetry plane  are exactly the symmetries that typify the ideal optically - driven rotor . \n the _ t_-matrix method in wave scattering involves writing the relationship between the wave incident upon a scatterer , expanded in terms of a sufficiently complete basis set of functions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a mode index labelling the functions , each of which is a solution of the helmholtz equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the expansion coefficients for the incident wave , and the scattered wave , also expanded in terms of a basis set @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the expansion coefficients for the scattered wave , is written as a simple matrix equation @xmath7 or , in more concise notation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the elements of the _ t_-matrix . \n t_-matrix formalism is a hilbert basis description of scattering . \n the _ t_-matrix depends only on the properties of the particle  its composition , size , shape , and orientation  and the wavelength , and is otherwise independent of the incident field . \n this means that for any particular particle , the _ \n t_-matrix only needs to be calculated once , and can then be used for repeated calculations . \n this is the key point that makes this an attractive method for modelling optical tweezers , providing a significant advantage over many other methods of calculating scattering where the entire calculation needs to be repeated .    the natural choice of basis functions when describing scattering by a compact particle is to use vector spherical wavefunctions ( vswfs )  @xcite . \n the optical force and torque are given by sums of products of the modal amplitudes  @xcite . \n notably , neither how the vswf expansion of the incident field nor how the _ t_-matrix can be calculated has entered the above description of scattering . \n a variety of methods exist for the former  @xcite , and the latter task is generally the more challenging computationally . \n most implementations of the _ t_-matrix method use the extended boundary condition method ( ebcm ) , also called the null field method , to calculate the _ t_-matrix . \n this is so widespread that the _ t_-matrix method and the ebcm are sometimes considered to be inseparable , and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . \n however , from the description above , it is clear that the _ t_-matrix formalism is independent of the actual method used to calculate the _ \n t_-matrix  @xcite . \n a number of alternative methods have been used for the calculation of _ t_-matrices . \n notably , such `` hybrid '' methods , for example the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) method used by mackowski  @xcite can be used for the calculation of _ \n t_-matrices for particles of arbitrary shape , internal structure , and electromagnetic properties . \n complex internal structure will generally require a discretisation of the internal volume of the particle , rather than a method based on surface discretisation . \n we are working on both finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) and dda based hybrid _ t_-matrix solvers . \n the _ t_-matrix elements are strongly dependent on the symmetry of the scatterer  @xcite . \n we can deduce the principal features from floquet s theorem , relating solutions to differential equations to the periodicity of their boundary conditions . \n if we have a scatterer with @xmath1th - order rotational symmetry about the @xmath10-axis , an incident mode of azimuthal index @xmath11 couples to scattered modes with azimuthal indices @xmath12 and so on . for scatterers that are mirror - symmetric , upward and downward coupling must be equal , in the sense that , for example , a mirror - symmetric scatterer of 2nd order rotational symmetry ( such as a long rod ) , t - matrix elements coupling from @xmath13 modes to @xmath14 modes will have the same magnitudes as the elements coupling from @xmath14 to @xmath13 modes . for chiral scatterers , these _ \n t_-matrix elements will , in general , be different . \n this directly affects the optical torque ; the vector spherical wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n essentially , the radial mode index @xmath1 gives the magnitude of the angular momentum flux , while the azimuthal mode index @xmath11 gives the @xmath10-component of the angular momentum flux . \n therefore , the coupling between orders of different @xmath11 describes the generation of optical torques about the beam axis .    for the case of a rotationally symmetric scatterer , this means that there is no coupling between modes with differing angular momenta about the @xmath10-axis@xcite . \n therefore , it is not possible to exert optical torque on such scatterers except by absorption ( or gain)since the incoming and outgoing angular momenta per photon are the same , the only optical torque can result from a change in the number of photons . \n in general , the use of absorption for the transfer of optical torque is impractical , due to excessive heating . \n therefore , a departure from rotational symmetry is required . \n this can be either at the macroscopic ( the shape of the particle ) or microscopic ( optical properties of the particle ) level . \n birefringent and elongated or flattened particles are simple examples of introducing such asymmetry ; notably , such particles were the first to be controllably optically rotated through means other than absorption , for example by beth in the first measurements of optical torque  @xcite . \n particles with these properties have also been rotated in optical traps  . as such particles can still be axisymmetric about one axis , rapid calculation of optical forces and torques is still possible  @xcite    more complex particles have also been fabricated and rotated  @xcite , but in these cases , there are few results from computational modelling  @xcite . \n as such structures typically possess discrete rotational symmetry , the restrictions on coupling between azimuthal orders can be used to reduce the number of _ \n t_-matrix elements that need to be calculated . \n this can greatly reduce the time required . \n this is also the case for the hybrid methods described above . for a scatterer with @xmath17th - order discrete rotational symmetry , \n it is only necessary to perform calculations for a @xmath18 portion of the entire structure . \n if , in addition , there is mirror symmetry about the @xmath19 plane , the parity of the vswfs will be preserved . \n therefore , an odd-@xmath1 te mode will only couple to odd-@xmath1 te modes and even-@xmath1 tm modes . \n this halves number of non - zero _ t_-matrix elements , and halves the portion of the structure that needs to be modelled . \n a simple example illustrating both the relationship between optical torque and symmetry , and the exploitation of particle symmetry for more efficient calculation of optical forces and torques , is the optical trapping of a cube . \n the cube embodies both of the symmetries  mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about the normal to the mirror symmetry plane  that typify the ideal optically - driven rotor . \n as the cube has 4th - order rotational symmetry , and mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath20 plane , each incident modes only couples to approximately @xmath21 the number of significant scattered modes . \n although the column - by - column calculation of the _ t_-matrix still requires the same number of least - squared solutions , each of this is of a smaller system of equations , and much faster . \n for example , the two wavelengths wide cube used in our example below required 30 minutes for the calculation of the _ t_-matrix on a 32 bit single -

{"ContextTokens": 1947, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "radio galaxies display a wide range of structures in radio images . \n the most common large - scale structures are called lobes : these are double , often fairly symmetrical , roughly ellipsoidal structures placed on either side of the active nucleus . a significant minority of low - luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated . \n some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes . \n hence , the radio galaxies morphologically are divided into fri and frii types . \n the fri objects ( ` edge - darkened doubles ' ) generally contain prominent , often two - sided jets , with the lobe emission trailing off into intergalactic space . whereas , the frii objects ( ` edge - brightened doubles ' , ` classical doubles ' ) contain hot spots in one or both lobes . \n it seems that frii radio galaxies ( see fig .  [ fig:3c98 ] ) are usually isolated field sources and form a remarkably homogeneous set . on the other hand , the fri radio galaxies are much more varied . \n they are not only found as isolated field sources , they are also often found in clusters @xcite . \n for example , head - tail galaxies , which are fri objects , are almost always associated with clusters of galaxies and are characterized by a highly elongated radio structure with the associated optical galaxy at one end . a classical example ( see fig . \n [ fig:3c129 ] ) is 3c129 ( a narrow - angle - tail ) which , along with its companion 3c129.1 ( a wide - angle - tail ) , is a member of an x - ray cluster . in the canonical picture , \n the characteristic shape is explained by the kinematics of the source , which is governed by the dominant gravitational force in the cluster and the properties of the beams and jets @xcite . \n similarly , wide - angle - tail galaxies are intermediate between standard fri and frii objects , with collimated jets and sometimes hotspots , but with plumes rather than lobes , found at or near the centres of clusters . here again , the characteristic shape is mainly due to the dominant gravitational force in the cluster . \n therefore , the general morphology of radio sources lends encouragement to ideas of confinement , or at least radio morphology partly governed by an external gas ( @xcite , and see hardcastle in this proceeding ) , but some objects persist in complicating the simple picture . \n for example , b1059@xmath0169 ( fig . \n [ fig : b1059 ] ) which shows x - shaped structure . \n such sources are characterized by two axes , the ` wing ' axis oriented at an angle to the ` active ' axis , giving the total source an ` x ' shape . \n these two sets of lobes usually pass symmetrically through the centre of the associated host galaxy , and the majority of these sources are frii and the rest are either fri or mixed . \n these have been modelled via backflow from the lobes along with buoyancy - driven outflow . \n precession of the radio axis also comes to mind . \n they have also been put forth as derivatives of central engines that have been reoriented , perhaps due to a minor merger . \n alternatively , they may also result from two pairs of jets that are associated with a pair of unresolved agns ( see  @xcite for a detailed summary ) . \n the key point is that interpretation of radio source morphology , in general , is not necessarily simple . \n * spectral ageing * under the standard model of a frii source evolution , the source grows longer as the jet pushes back the external medium . \n if there s no significant re - acceleration within the lobes and no significant transport of particles since the last acceleration , then the central regions are ` older ' than the outer regions , in the sense that particles located in the central regions were processed through the hot spot shock at a time before those currently radiating at the ends of the radio source . \n hence , the spectral index of the radiation from the central regions should have a steeper spectral index than that at the ends . \n whereas , in the case of fri sources , e.g. , in almost all head - tail and wide - angle - tail galaxies , the radio spectrum has been found to steepen with distance along the tail and has been interpreted in terms of ageing of electron population . \n finally , in several of the formation scenarios mentioned above for x - shaped sources , the wings are interpreted as relics of past radio jets and the active lobes as the newer ones . \n hence , the wings are expected to show steeper spectra than the active lobes in standard models for electron energy evolution . \n in recent years we have used the gmrt ( @xcite ) to study morphology of several radio galaxies at 240  mhz and 610  mhz , with a resolution of about 10  arcsec  and  5  arcsec , respectively . \n the gmrt visibility data were analyzed using aips in the standard manner . \n all details of the analysis procedures used are given in @xcite . \n the gmrt has a hybrid configuration with 14 of its 30 antennae located in a central compact array with a size 1.1 km ( comparable to the vla d configuration ) and the remaining antennae distributed in a roughly ` y'-shaped configuration , giving a maximum baseline length of 25 km ( comparable to the vla b configuration ) . \n hence , a single observation with the gmrt samples the ( @xmath1 ) plane on both short and long baselines , and can map detailed source structure with a reasonably good sensitivity . \n i bring together two remarkable results obtained using gmrt .    * similar / dis - similar radio morphologies * it is remarkably unusual that any frii source has a morphology at low radio frequency ( less than a few hundred mhz ) that is different from its high radio frequency ( ghz ) morphology . \n [ fig:3c98 ] shows 3c98 as an example showing similar radio morphologies at 240 mhz and 1.5  ghz . \n in addition the 74  mhz and the 4.9  ghz radio morphologies are also identical . \n the observations of some 3c radio galaxies at 151mhz and 1.4ghz @xcite show that the lobe lengths at these different frequencies are the same and they also suggest that the particles responsible for the low - frequency emission are entirely co - spatial with those responsible for the high - frequency emission . \n this suggests that synchrotron - emitting particles of all energies permeate the lobe magnetic field in the same way , despite the fact that the higher energy particles have shorter radiative lifetimes than the lower energy ones . \n this hints that low - frequency synchrotron emission fades ( nearly ) as rapidly as high - frequency synchrotron emission @xcite ; and so , are the observations really inconsistent with the idea that synchrotron cooling is not the dominant energy - loss mechanism for the synchrotron plasma ? @xcite note that by the time we get to 100 ghz there really are fairly obvious morphological differences in lobes , although the sensitivity of those observations is not great . whereas , the fri sources , in particular the head - tail galaxies and wide - angle - tail galaxies show signs of synchrotron cooling in spectral index images @xcite made using narrow frequency spacing ( 240 mhz and 1.4 ghz ) and often show the presence of steep spectrum diffuse emission at low radio frequencies , which is not seen at high radio frequencies ( fig . \n [ fig:3c129 ] ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ] \n presently the gmrt observations have provided several high resolution , high sensitivity images , and it is now possible to probe , statistically , the morphological properties of radio sources . \n i have presented above two unusual results , but it will still be important to obtain observations using gmrt of complete , unbiased samples of radio galaxies to draw general conclusions about the population of radio galaxies as a whole . \n we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible . \n gmrt is run by the ncra of the tifr . \n i warmly thank my collaborators m.j . \n hardcastle , r.p . \n kraft and a.p . rao and especially a.l . \n roy for a careful reading of this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 3888179191197, "RequestID": "5ac4c32f9cd2437bbfe07094ddb0851a", "TotalTokens": 2126}

inertial observers by discussing how the unruh or hawking effect will influence the degree of entanglement [ 1322 ] . \n most of the investigations in non - inertial frames are focused on the study of the quantum information in bipartite qubit system with one subsystem as an accelerated . since , it is  not possible to completely isolate a quantum system from its environment . \n therefore , one needs to investigate the behavior of entanglement in the presence of environmental effects . \n a major problem of quantum communication is to faithfully transmit unknown quantum states through a noisy quantum channel . \n when quantum information is sent through a channel , the carriers of the information interact with the channel and get entangled with its many degrees of freedom . \n this gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence on the state space of the information carriers . \n implementation of decoherence in non - inertial frames have been investigated by different authors [ 23 , 24 ] . \n peres - horodecki [ 25 , 26 ] have studied entanglement of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit states and established separability criterion . according to this criterion , the partial transpose of a separable density matrix must have non - negative eigenvalues , where the partial transpose is taken over the smaller subsystem for qubit - qutrit case . for nonseparable states , \n the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose gives the degree of entanglement of a density matrix also termed as negativity . \n ann et al . \n [ 27 ] have studied a qubit - qutrit system where they have shown the existence of esd under the influence of dephasing noise .    in this paper \n , we study the effect of decoherence on a qubit - qutrit system in non - inertial frames by considering different noise models , such as , amplitude damping , depolarizing and phase damping channels . \n we consider different couplings of the system and the environment where the system is influenced by global , local , or multi - local noises modeled in a number of scenarios . \n we show that entanglement degradation occurs for various coupling of the system and the environment . \n it is shown that different environments degrade the entanglement of the hybrid system differently . \n we consider a composite system of a qubit @xmath0 and a qutrit @xmath1 that is coupled to a noisy environment both collectively and individually . \n local and multi - local couplings describe the situation when the qubit and qutrit are independently influenced by their individual noisy environments . whereas , the global decoherence corresponds to the situation when it is influenced by both collective and multilocal noises at the same time . \n the term collective coupling means when both the qubit and qutrit are influenced by the same noise . \n the state shared by the two parties is an entangled qubit -

local environments is given in kraus operator form as @xmath22and the evolution of the system when it is influenced by global environment is given in kraus operator representation as @xmath23where @xmath24 @xmath25 are the kraus operators of the multilocal coupling of qubit and qutrit individually and @xmath26 are the kraus operators of the collective coupling of the hybrid system . using equations ( 5 -

{"ContextTokens": 2723, "GeneratedTokens": 278, "SynthesizedBody": "higher x - ray emissivity arcs , termed ripples , are observed in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the perseus cluster ( fabian et al . \n 2003 , 2006 ; sanders & fabian 2007 ) , as well as in a2052 ( blanton et al . 2007 ) . \n the ripples are thought to be sound waves that are excited by the inflation of bubbles near the cluster s center . \n some of the ripples are observed on the outer edge of bubbles ; they are compressed icm that will turn into shock waves , and later to sound waves . \n it is possible that some of the other ripples are compressed by weak jets ( soker & pizzolato 2005 ) , rather than being sound waves detached from their parent bubble . beside being interesting by their own merit \n , the sound waves can heat the icm and partially offset the radiative cooling of the icm ( e.g. , brggen et al . 2005 ; fabian et al . 2005 ; fujita & suzuki 2005 ; graham et al . 2008 ) .    to obtain repeated sound waves previous numerical simulations assumed repeating bubble inflation episodes ( e.g. , ruszkowski et al . \n 2004a , b ; sijacki & springel 2006a , b ) . \n this had to be done because these simulations used _ artificial bubbles _ , \n i.e. , numerically injected spherical bubbles at off - center locations , as is commonly done ( e.g. , brggen 2003 ; brggen & kaiser 2001 ; gardini 2007 ; jones & de young 2005 ; pavlovski et al . 2008 ; reynolds et al . 2005 ; robinson et al . 2004 ; ruszkowski et al . \n 2004a , 2004b , 2007 , 2008 ; scannapieco & brggen 2008 ) . \n this of course is not the way bubbles are formed in clusters . \n bubble are formed by jets [ a different approach of injecting magnetic energy instead of a jet ( nakamura et al . \n 2008 ; xu et al . \n 2008 ) requires further study ] . \n when large , almost spherical bubbles ( termed _ fat bubbles _ ) are inflated by jets , some phenomena appear , that are not revealed when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) . among these \n are : ( 1 ) more stable bubbles , and ( 2 ) bubble - icm boundary that is stochastically vibrates due to the vortices inside the bubble and the back flowing icm .    in previous works we found that in order for the jets to inflate fat bubbles they should have a large opening angle , or they should rapidly precess ( soker 2004 , 2006 ;

blondin et al . 1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ) , as described in sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) . in this paper \n we mention only the important features of the code . \n the unperturbed icm temperature is set to @xmath6 . \n gravity is included , but radiative cooling is not included . \n we study a three - dimensional axisymmetric flow with a 2d grid ( referred to as 2.5d ) . \n we simulate half of the meridional plane using the two - dimensional version of the code in spherical coordinates . \n the symmetry axis of all plots shown in this paper is along the x ( horizontal ) axis . \n we run two cases . in the wide jets case , \n the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 , with constant mass flux of @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 , inside a half opening angle of @xmath10 . \n the total power of the two jets is @xmath11 . \n the jets were active for a period of @xmath12 , from @xmath13 until @xmath14 . \n for more detail on the numerical code and the properties of the bubbles see sternberg & soker ( 2008b ) .    in the case of the precessing jets \n the two opposite jets were injected at a radius of @xmath7 with @xmath8 per one jet , and a constant radial velocity of @xmath9 ( the same parameters of the wide jets ) , but within a half opening angle of @xmath15 . in our axisymmetric code \n the jets are precessing very rapidly around the symmetry axis ( i.e. , in 3d we actually inject a torus ) . \n we vary the angle between the symmetry axis and the jets axis @xmath16 in a random way . \n namely , the jet axis has the same probability to take any direction within an angle of @xmath17 . \n this is done by changing @xmath16 periodically and taking @xmath18 to be constant . \n the precession period , i.e. , the time the jet returns to the same angle @xmath16 , is @xmath19 . \n the jet s interaction with the icm is similar to that of a wide jet with a half opening angle of @xmath20 . \n the jets were active for a duration of @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath14 . \n gravity was included as was in the wide jets case . \n in fig . [ fig : jeti ] we show the density and velocity map of the wide - jet - inflated bubble at @xmath23myr , and at @xmath14 when the jet is shut off . \n there are some flow structures which characterize the jet - inflated bubble that are not present when artificial bubbles are used ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) . \n most relevant for us are the following : ( 1 ) the bubble and the dense shell around it have radial momentum . \n in particular , the shell s front is relatively dense and has an outward velocity . \n this will form the ripple observed at the front edge of the bubbles in perseus . \n ( 2 ) as the bubbles grow their shapes change . \n this relative motion of the bubble - icm boundary excites sound waves . \n ( 3 ) there is a circular flow , a vortex , around the lowest density region in the bubble . \n this vortex and the back flow of the icm along the boundary of the bubble change the shape of the bubble , a processes leading to excitation of sound waves . \n we also note the back flow of the icm around the bubble , and that at early times the bubble expands supersonically , e.g. , an average mach number of @xmath24 between @xmath23myr and @xmath14 , and the shell is a weak shock . at later times the bubble moves subsonically . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ] \n we followed the response of the icm to the inflation of bubbles by jets . \n the inflation of a bubble by a jet results in vortices inside the bubble and a backflow of the icm around the bubble ( sternberg et al . 2007 ; sternberg & soker 2008a , b ) . \n both processes cause the bubble - icm to change shape with time and to become corrugated . in the case of a precessing jet ( section [ sec : precessing ] ) , the changes in the jet axis cause a more prominent change in the bubble - icm shape . \n this motion of the bubble - icm boundary sends shocks and sound waves into the icm . \n this effect can not be reproduced by artificial bubbles , i.e. , by numerically inserting spherical bubbles at off - center locations . \n our main result is that one episode of a bubble pair inflation can excite several sound waves along each radial direction . \n these form high - density arcs , the ripples . \n the front ripple is actually a weak shock . \n there is no need to introduce periodic ( or semi - periodic ) episodes of bubble inflation . \n nonetheless , multiple episodes will make more ripples , and make the ripple structure more complicated . \n this is the case in perseus , where the main central bubble pair was formed by jets that changed their direction and intensity ( dunn et al . \n 2006 ) . \n we also observe a dense arc at the bubble s front that is apparent part of the time . \n the dense arc is the excitation of a new sound wave at the compression phase . \n part of the time the region at the bubble s front is at the rarefaction phase , the wave trough , and no dense arc is observed there . \n our results can be incorporated into a broader scope . in a previous paper ( sternberg & soker 2008b ) we found \n that to follow the evolution of bubbles in the icm one must inflate them by jets , rather than introduce them artificially . \n the evolution of bubbles and their influence on the icm , e.g. , sound waves , is crucial for the deposition of heat from the central active galactic nuclei to the icm . \n our works show that in order to understand the heating of the icm one must properly inflate bubbles . \n we thank john blondin for his immense help with the numerical code . \n this research was supported by the asher fund for space research at the technion , and by the israeli science foundation ( grant no . \n 89/08 ) . \n blanton , e. l. , douglass , e. m. , sarazin , c. l. , clarke , t. e. , & mcnamara , b. r. 2007 , in heating versus cooling in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , eso astrophysics symposia ( springer - verlag , berlin heidelberg ) , 109", "StartTimeOffset": 3920925118264, "RequestID": "b488fdc75b0b474483d466ecbf4427d4", "TotalTokens": 3001}

eddy simulations ( les ) to provide grid - converged results @xcite . however , in order to study large wind farms and the associated large - scale properties of coupling with the atmospheric boundary layer , wind farms consisting of many turbines must be considered @xcite . \n when many turbines must be included in the computational domain , fine spatial resolution on each rotor is often not affordable , especially if one wishes to repeat the les varying flow conditions , rotor designs , etc . \n it is thus of interest to study and better understand the performance of the alm approach when using very coarse discretization ( on the order of 10 les grid - points per rotor diameter ) . \n it has been seen that power extracted from an alm in les is very dependent on the grid resolution and the width of the kernel used to smear the forces @xcite . \n the wake structures are also affected by means of the spatial filter in the velocity field which is not able to resolve the structures smaller than the grid size . \n the subgrid - scale closure of the les models the smaller scales of the flow , but because of the spatially filtered velocity may differ from the real unsmoothed velocity , differences of predicted forces and power at the rotor blade can exist \n . the axial induction can be affected by the smearing of the velocity field .    here , we study the implementation of an alm in coarse simulations ( 14 les grid -

stokes equation , see eq . \n [ eq : ns ] , as a body force term @xcite . \n this body force is calculated dynamically depending on the local velocity at the location of each actuator point . \n the actuator points are used to calculate the blade forces with a high accuracy before they are projected on the computational grid used to calculate the flow field . \n lift and drag are calculated based on tabulated airfoil data and then smeared onto the flow field as body forces by means of a gaussian kernel @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance from the actuator point , and @xmath14 establishes the width of the kernel . \n the two turbines used for this study are the turbine used in the experiments from the group at cole polytechnique fdrale de lausanne ( epfl ) which has a 0.15 m diameter , @xcite and the nrel 5mw reference , which has a 126 m rotor diameter @xcite . \n the turbine used by the group at epfl is a gws / ep-6030 . \n @xcite . the chord and pitch angle along the blades are found in their previous work @xcite . \n the lift and drag coefficient tables were obtained by using a cambered airfoil , i.e. we used airfoil ( 9 ) from the work by sunada et al . \n @xcite in order to match the wake profiles close to the center of the wake , a nacelle has to be included in the model . \n power and thrust coefficient curves have been obtained using blade element momentum theory and are shown in figure [ fig : cpct ] . \n it can be observed that this turbine provides a poor performance in terms of power , i.e. low @xmath15 value , compared to a large scale turbine which operates on a range closer to the betz limit . \n the thrust coefficient , however , is closer to typical values observed for operational large scale turbines . \n we now present simulation of a wind turbine with turbulent inflow . \n we use the experiment from the epfl group @xcite , here focusing on the single - turbine case . \n the inflow condition is matched by using a concurrent - precursor simulation matching the given roughness height and friction velocity of the experiment @xcite . \n the tip speed ratio of the turbine is set to @xmath16 as in the experiment . as a first step \n we compare the current implementation of the actuator line model ( alm ) with and without the effects of the nacelle . here \n the les uses a coarse discretization , 14 points across the rotor . \n the alm has been tested with and without a nacelle and tower modeled as drag objects with @xmath17 coefficients of 1.0 and 0.5 respectively . \n is the mean velocity at hub - height at the inflow location ( -1d ) . ] \n figures [ fig : multiplotu ] and [ fig : multiplotupup ] show streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity profiles across the wake for a single turbine in a turbulent boundary layer . \n the non - dimensional scale used is the hub - height velocity @xmath18 . \n it is to be noted that in order to obtain good agreement between the experiments and simulations a nacelle model needs to be included . \n the current implementations provides excellent agreement for the velocity profiles of the wake . \n the turbulence intensity computed in the les under - predicts the experimental measurements . \n this is expected from les , since some of the scales are filtered , thus reducing the fluctuations . \n the overall trends agree quite well , and it can be observed that at 2 - 3d downstream the wake of the nacelle and tower have a big influence in both the mean velocity and turbulence intensity . \n the wake profiles obtained agree very well with the experiments . \n however , quantities at the turbine , such as power and thrust , are very dependent on the grid resolution and the value of the kernel width @xmath14 . \n @xcite the power coefficient obtained from the simulation for this turbine is @xmath19 . \n this power coefficient is significantly higher than what is predicted by the turbine design using bem ( figure [ fig : cpct ] ) . while the overall thrust may be realistic ( since the wake profiles agree well ) , the differences between the predicted @xmath15 and the expected @xmath15 from bem points to possible problems due to the smearing of velocity inherent in alm with very coarse les resolutions . in order to better understand the discrepancy \n , first we perform a simulation under uniform inflow , and then present some initial thoughts of how the model inaccuracies may be remedied . \n we consider the simulation of the nrel wind turbine with laminar uniform inflow . \n we use les with a grid resolution of @xmath20 4 m in each direction , an inflow velocity of 8 ( m / s ) , a prescribed tip - speed ratio of @xmath21 , and vary the gaussian kernel width @xmath14 . \n it is known that wind turbine loads along the blades depend significantly on the filtering size of the gaussian kernel used to smear the forces of the turbine . \n figure [ fig : bem ] shows angle of attack , axial velocity , lift and drag along the blade for an nrel 5mw reference turbine modeled as an actuator line with different kernel widths ( @xmath14 ) .            from this figure \n we can see that the largest difference is in axial velocity . \n this difference will cause differences in the lift and drag curves , that are more pronounced as we move further towards the tip . \n these differences change the total power that the turbine is extracting from the flow . \n next , we present some analytical considerations focusing on the effects of the spatial filtering inherent in les and its impacts on the alm computations of forces . \n we take the lift component of the body force term per unit width in a 2d frame and write it ( simplifying ) as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the chord , @xmath4 is the density , @xmath24 is the lift coefficient , and @xmath25 is the magnitude of the local velocity on the reference frame of the moving airfoil section . the @xmath24 coefficient is a function of @xmath25 through its dependence on angle of attack . for small angle of attack , @xmath26 and thus the angle of attack \n can be expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the axial velocity . \n the lift coefficient for small angles of attack is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath31 is an offset . \n we will assume @xmath32 so that @xmath33 the filtered body force can be defined as @xmath34 now we can also write a similar equation for the unfiltered force : @xmath35 and from here : @xmath36 if we use the argument that the velocity magnitude @xmath25 is dominated by the rotational component of the velocity vector ( which is valid for high tsr s ) then we can take the velocity magnitude out of the filtering operation and we obtain @xmath37 the relationship in eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] enables us to interpret the results shown in fig . \n [ fig : bem ] ( top right ) in the sense that the ratio of unfiltered force equals the ratio of unfiltered to filtered _ axial _ velocity . \n we wish to determine the unfiltered force but only know the filtered force . \n if we can model ratio of unfiltered and filtered axial velocity , eq [ eq : ratio ] would enable us to determine the correct ( unfiltered ) force .    while the derivation of eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] was based on spatial filtering , we now interpret variables filtered at a scale @xmath14 as the variables one obtains by running les and alm with a kernel width @xmath14 . \n while this assumption can not be firmly established on theoretical grounds , in practice it is a useful assumption and is commonly made in les . \n for example , if we denote the axial velocity and force obtained in a simulation with a kernel @xmath14 as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and associate the scale @xmath14 with the filtering scale , then @xmath40 and @xmath41 . as a next step , \n we filter eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] at another filter scale @xmath42 and assume that the @xmath14-variables are not affected by this smaller - scale filtering \n . then one can rewrite eq . [ \n eq : ratio ] according to @xmath43 we can use simulations performed at various @xmath14 s to test this relationship , as a first step in establishing possible correction strategies for the alm approach .    returning to our simulations of the nrel case , we consider @xmath44 m , and attempt to use the results from the other 4 runs with @xmath45 to rescale the force @xmath46 . if eq . \n [ eq : ua2 ] holds , the distribution of @xmath47 should coincide with the rhs of eq . \n [ eq : ua2 ] , i.e. with @xmath48 , regardless of @xmath45 chosen . \n the first region of the blade is made of cylindrical sections which produce no lift , thus the approach presented is not used in this section . as seen in figure [ fig : ua ] the curves collapse through most of the blade except close to the tip . \n the reason for this is that near the tip , the 3d effects of the kernel become more noticeable \n .     values ( left ) and re - scaled axial velocity ( right ) to @xmath49 8 m case as a function of blade length , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 m. the data points coincide with the actuator points used in the simulation.,title=\"fig : \" ]   values ( left ) and re - scaled axial velocity ( right ) to @xmath49 8 m case as a function of blade length , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 m. the data points coincide with the actuator points used in the simulation.,title=\"fig : \" ] \n the alm has been validated on a relatively coarse resolution with experimental measurements from the group at epfl @xcite . \n the les provides good agreement with the experiments , but a nacelle and tower model are required to obtain the proper wake deficit . \n when analyzing power output computed by the alm , the values are higher than those predicted by blade element momentum theory . a theoretical analysis is presented that attempts to relate filtered forces to filtered velocities , highlighting the impact of filtering of the axial velocity on the force distribution . \n the derived relationship is tested based on simulations done at various @xmath14 values and is seen to hold rather well , except when approaching the tip of the blade . \n the results imply that one may be able to predict the fine - grained force corresponding to an @xmath14 smaller than that of the simulation , if one were able to deduce the corresponding axial velocity from the data at coarser @xmath14 . \n such a model - based defiltering operation is the focus of ongoing investigations . \n lamt was supported by nsf ( igert ) , while international travel and cm were supported by nsf ( iia 124382 , the windinspire project ) . \n rjams is supported by the research program fellowships for young energy scientists ( yes ! ) of the foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) supported by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 3956263922417, "RequestID": "3dd3eec0564d4f5c9c13d6b22c7d94ca", "TotalTokens": 3707}
{"ContextTokens": 3632, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "the gravitomagnetic clock effect ( synthetically gclock effect ) is in a sense a phenomenon announced since the early days of relativity@xcite . \n it is due to the fact that the proper time measured by a clock is indeed the four dimensional  length  of the world line of the clock between two given events : different allowed four dimensional paths between the same pair of events correspond to different proper time intervals and produce desynchronization of initially synchronous clocks .    when treating rotating systems ( and clocks ) \n an additional feature one finds is that a global splitting between space and time is no more possible : time on a rotating platform becomes polytropic@xcite in the sense that the space hypersurface of a rotating observer is a helicoid and it intercepts the world line of the observer in an infinite number of events : these are all nominally  simultaneous  though corresponding to different proper times of the observer . \n this fact does not really affect the nature and geometric interpretation of the clock effect . \n the revolving  clocks  used to measure proper times may in fact be various types of particles , such as electrons@xcite , neutrons@xcite , cooper pairs@xcite , calcium atoms@xcite , which have been used to test the sagnac effect for quantum objects . \n of course one can use light as a  clock  finding an asymmetry between pro- and retrograde rotation manifested in a phase difference rather than a difference in proper times , now identically null . \n this is the very sagnac effect , known since 1913 or even before and named after g. sagnac@xcite , who interpreted it with an antirelativistic and  etherial \n ( in the sense of the ether theory ) attitude . \n the sagnac effect is nothing else than a specialization of what we are speaking about since the beginning of this section and earned a whole literature for itself during many decades@xcite ; the simplest and most complete description of it is indeed the geometrical one@xcite@xcite . \n an effect with actual clocks , and in particular the synchrony defect due to the time polytropy , has been evidenced for the first time with satellites in 1985@xcite . \n the introduction of nonspinning or spinning masses in the empty space time does not in principle modify the situation , but for computational complications . the latter case ( spinning sources of gravity ) \n is however the one to which the expression \n gravitomagnetic clock effect  has been reserved . \n the name comes from the fact that , in weak field approximation , the gravitational field may be decomposed into a gravitoelectric ( radial ) field and a gravitomagnetic ( solenoidal ) field in analogy with electromagnetism : the gclock effect is determined by the gravitomagnetic component . \n this description and treatment has been particularly emphasized by mashhoon and others@xcite @xcite , but a general treatment is in principle rather simple and can be given before any approximation@xcite . \n the importance of the gclock effect is in the hope that it can be used to test the influence of the angular momentum of the source on the gravitational field . \n in fact the revolution time of a freely orbiting clock on a circular trajectory around a spinning mass is different according to whether the orbit is prograde or retrograde . \n the difference between the two periods expressed as the times needed to recover a fixed azimuth in the inertial frame of a distant observer is@xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a length given by the ratio between the angular momentum of the source @xmath2 and its mass @xmath3 multiplied by @xmath4 : @xmath5 . \n the result ( [ assoluto ] ) is true for any axisymmetric metric with an @xmath1 value independent from time@xcite . \n the independence of ( [ assoluto ] ) from the radius of the orbit is a remarkable feature ; furthermore the numerical value of @xmath6 for the earth is rather promising being in the order of @xmath7 s.    when adopting the viewpoint of an observer in the vicinity of the central mass the situation worsens ; then one should use proper times of the clocks and refer for instance to specific events , such as the conjunctions of counterorbiting objects . in that case the time difference on the clocks around the earth , @xmath8 , is in the order of @xmath9 s @xcite@xcite . \n besides the actual numbers that should be measured ( which , at least in the case of @xmath6 , are indeed big ) , a real experiment around the earth encounters a series of difficulties not easy to be surmounted@xcite @xcite , one of them is the stability and coincidence between opposite orbits . considering this specific problem \n electromagnetic waves come again on stage as probes more interesting than actual clocks . \n in fact a single ring of orbiting mirrors could be used to reflect at the same instant both prograde and retrograde  light \n beams in a sort of sagnac experiment in space . the influence of gravity on the issue of such an experiment can be worked out as a general relativistic correction of the classical effect@xcite , but the problem can be better solved in principle and in general using the method outlined in ref . \n this is precisely the aim of this paper ; in sect . ii the essence of the method is recalled ; in sect . \n iii the specific case of the sagnac effect is treated ; sect . \n iv contains the approximated results valid for the earth environment ; finally in sect . \n v some conclusions will be drawn . \n the method proposed is based on the fact that in any axially symmetric and stationary space time any constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 world line is drawn on the surface of a cylinder which is indeed flat , no matter what the global curvature is : on that surface simple minkowskian geometry works . in particular when the coordinate angular velocity @xmath12 is fixed the world line on the cylinder s surface is a helix , which becomes a straight line in the development of the cylinder in a plane . \n the situation is most simply described graphically : see fig . \n 1 , which shows the opened cylindrical world tube . \n the world lines of steadily rotating objects are helices which in turn become straight lines when opening the cylinder on a plane . when a line reaches the boundary of the cut at @xmath13 or @xmath14 it bounces back or forth by @xmath15 continuing on the other side . \n considering a pair of objects revolving in opposite directions with the same coordinate speed , their world lines are symmetric with respect to a static observer at the origin ( vertical straight line there ) and cross each other again at the same event for such observer : the revolution times both in the objects proper times and in the observer s time are exactly the same for both . \n if however the observer is in turn steadily rotating his world line is an oblique straight line and the intersecting events with the world lines of the objects do not coincide any more : the revolution times measured by the observer differ from each other and so do the proper times of the two objects . \n the interval between _ a _ and _  b , _ in fig . 1 _ , \n _ is then proportional to the proper time lapse ( for the observer ) between the completions of one revolution started simultaneously by the two probes . \n this description is valid for light beams too : in this case the @xmath16 interval is an actual measure of the sagnac effect . \n when the central body possesses an angular momentum , the equivalent in its vicinity of the static inertial observers of the previous case are the so called locally non rotating observers ( lnro)@xcite , i. e. the observers to whom radially infalling matter appears locally as non rotating . \n the lnro s themselves are indeed rotating as seen by a distant inertial observer ; their coordinate angular speed is : @xmath17 ( the @xmath18 s are elements of the metric and the use of polar coordinates is understood ) . in practice \n the considerations about the flatness of the cylindrical surface containing the world lines of constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain unchanged , but now the world lines of co - rotating and counter - rotating light rays have a different inclination to cope with the role of an lnro and his skew world line ; in other words after leaving the lnro at @xmath19 the two beams must cross each other again on the ( oblique ) world line of the lnro , in order it to be equivalent to the static observer of rotation free space times . \n graphically the situation is the one shown in fig . \n the entity of the sagnac effect is measured by the interval between @xmath20 and @xmath21 which is clearly different from the one between @xmath22 and @xmath23 in fig . 1 , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath1 which is hidden in the @xmath24 element of the metric tensor . \n what is visually determined by the simple graphic treatment of the previous section can be put in analytical form by the use of minkowskian geometry in two dimensions . \n let us restrict our study to light rays and the sagnac effect in axisymmetric metrics . \n events @xmath22 and @xmath23 in fig . 1 ( @xmath25 and @xmath21 in fig . \n 2 ) are localized as the intersections of two straight lines : the world line of the observer and the world line of a light beam . when an angular momentum is absent \n the former s equation is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the observer s angular coordinate speed . \n the equation of the world line of a light ray constrained to move along a circular trajectory is in turn @xmath28 for the counter - rotating beam and @xmath29 for the co - rotating one ;

this comes from a null interval at constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. from @xmath32 , posing @xmath33 . \n the intersections between the straight world lines of the observer and the beams identify points @xmath22 ( counter - rotating beam ) and @xmath23 ( corotating beam ) with their @xmath34 and @xmath35 coordinates : @xmath36 the @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) sign corresponds to event @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . the proper time corresponding to the interval @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) in fig . \n 1 is in practice the length ( divided by @xmath4 ) of the hypotenuse of a right - angled triangle in a two dimensional flat minkowski space time , whose other sides are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . \n the explicit result is : @xmath43 and the sagnac delay turns out to be @xmath44 the @xmath45 term has been eliminated thanks to the explicit expression of @xmath46 . \n when @xmath47 the coordinate angular speed of light on a circular path is obtained from @xmath48 . \n there are two solutions : @xmath49 ( @xmath37 is for prograde motion , @xmath38 is for retrograde motion ) . \n now the intersection method leads to : @xmath50    the proper observer s intervals of time are obtained as before , but for the fact that now we have to use the equivalent of carnot s theorem of euclidean geometry rather than the equivalent of pythagora s : @xmath51    finally the sagnac delay is : @xmath52 the parameter @xmath53 has been eliminated using the explicit expression for the coordinate angular speed of an lnro . \n if now we pose @xmath54 , we consistently verify that it is : @xmath55 a truly inertial observer ( @xmath56 ) would find : @xmath57    formula ( [ deltatau ] ) treats @xmath27 and @xmath10 as independent parameters ; the situation changes when the observer is freely orbiting . for a circular geodesic trajectory in the equatorial plane \n there are two solutions for @xmath27 @xcite ( again @xmath37 is pro- and @xmath38 is retrograde motion of the observer ) : @xmath58 commas denote ordinary partial differentiation .. correspondingly ( [ deltatau ] ) becomes : @xmath59 \n considering the situation in the surroundings of our planet the appropriate metric is the one corresponding to a weak axisymmetric field . \n actually this means that : @xmath60    consequently it is : @xmath61    now using ( [ deltatau ] ) we obtain :    @xmath62    for not too high observer s velocities and radii of the order of the size of the earth ( [ detauearth ] ) becomes : @xmath63    one easily recognizes , in the order , the traditional sagnac term , then a purely special relativistic correction , a \n correction and finally an angular momentum correction which is independent from the velocity of the observer . \n when the observer is freely orbiting on a circular trajectory the starting point is formula ( [ completo ] ) ; developing and keeping only the lowest order terms up to the one containing the angular momentum , the result is @xmath64 now summing the time differences for the two rotation directions we obtain @xmath65    the order of magnitude of this quantity is @xmath9 s. \n we have given a general geometric treatment of the problem of the phase shift of electromagnetic waves moving in a closed circular path about a massive spinning body . \n applying the general methodology to the terrestrial environment reproduces approximate results obtainable by various alternative techniques . in terms of time differences accumulated during round trips around the earth \n the numbers remain extremely small and partly smaller than some values typical of the gclock effect . \n the idea of using electromagnetic waves in some orbital sagnac type experiment deserves however some attention because of a few advantages light has .    to begin with , \n if a chain of orbiting mirrors or transponders are considered it is possible to use them simultaneously for prograde and retrograde rays , thus ensuring the coincidence of the two trajectories and the significance of the time of flight difference . \n next we can notice that , even for an  experimental apparatus  as big as the orbit of a satellite , the time of flight of light for a round trip is @xmath66 @xmath67 s. in that time the observer on a spacecraft could move for a few hundred meters at most and an observer on the surface of the earth would move much less than that ; this fact in principle allows for experiments at different values of the equivalent angular velocity @xmath27 , to be maintained for a few seconds at most . \n in fact in the time delay ( [ approssi ] ) three terms depend on @xmath68 and one is independent from it : in principle determining the values for positive or negative @xmath27 close to zero could allow for the detection of the invariant @xmath1 term . \n the scheme one can imagine is an observer on the earth moving westward at variable linear speeds of the order of @xmath69 m / s and sending and receiving signals to and from a ring of orbiting mirrors . \n finally , varying the wavelength of the waves could in principle allow to tune the phase difference originated by the @xmath1 term , making it correspond to a predefined number or fraction of interference fringes and evidencing its presence with respect to the special relativistic or purely gravitational shifts .", "StartTimeOffset": 3971842900577, "RequestID": "3273eb31c7c84ef5b7e5c637a46234b3", "TotalTokens": 3773}

[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      thanks to our high - resolution images we have been able to unambiguously identify almost all the mir sources with counterparts in deep nir and optical ( hst / wfpc2 and ground - based ) images . the relative astrometric accuracy is found to be better than 1@xmath17   in both filters . in only a few cases \n we suspect that two sources are blended . \n there is one obvious case in the 7map , where the _ straight arc _ ( pell et al . , 1991 ) \n is blended with the nearby elliptical galaxy . \n 30 sources are detected at 7 . \n half of them are easily identified as cluster member galaxies ( pell et al . , 1991 , leborgne et al . , 1992 , abraham et al . , 1996 ) . \n the 5 - 8.5emission of the cluster galaxies corresponds to 4.5 - 6.9restframe emission . for e / s0 galaxies \n it corresponds mostly to the rayleigh - jeans tail of their old stellar population as in the virgo cluster ( boselli et al . , 1998 ) . \n two stars are identified , and at least ten sources are lensed distant galaxies . \n these lensed sources are all detected at 15 .    at 15 , \n 34 sources are detected in the central 2.25@xmath62.25 field . \n only three sources are identified as cluster members : the cd galaxy ( lmonon et al . , 1998 , edge et al . , 1998 ) and two star - forming galaxies . \n based upon spectroscopic or photometric redshifts , all the other sources are identified as faint lensed galaxies . \n almost all sources for which we have spectroscopic redshifts are background objects . although , we can not rule out some of the targets being in the cluster , the probability is very small . \n the detection of almost exclusively background sources in the cluster images demonstrates that at 15the cluster - core becomes _ transparent _ ( as in sub - mm / uv bands ) . \n therefore the key feature is that the cluster - core acts as a natural gravitational telescope amplifying the flux of background sources , typically by a factor of 2 .      by correcting for the lens magnification and surface dilution effects , contamination by cluster galaxies , and non - uniform sensitivity of our maps \n , we can derive number counts at 15to compare with _ \n blank _ sky counts ( e.g. in the hubble deep field and lockman hole ) . \n the 7number counts are more difficult to derive due to the larger contamination by the cluster and because of the small number statistics . \n the number density of sources is high with respect to the size of the fwhm ( @xmath20 6@xmath17   diameter at 15 ) , but the psf is well sampled on the final maps , and its shape can be used to separate the sources ; only two 15sources lie at the location of pairs of suspected high - z galaxies . \n our counts are not significantly affected by confusion . \n the occasional blending of the sources has not been taken into account , but the surface area occupied by bright sources is subtracted for the computation of the surface density of the fainter ones ( ie . other faint sources could be hidden by brighter ones ) . \n we used the completeness of the detection at 15given in \n this correction is negligible to the 7counts and was not applied .    due to the non - uniform sensitivity of our maps ( because of observation strategy ) and the lensing effect , \n the object density per flux bin was computed using gain - dependant surface areas , and only the central 2@xmath62 area was taken into account for the faintest fluxes . \n a detailed lensing model of a2390 has been produced by kneib et al . , ( 1998 ) . \n the lensing acts in two ways on the background population of galaxies : + _ i ) _ an amplification of the source brightness , typically by a factor of 2 , but up to 10 near the caustic lines . \n + _ ii ) _ a surface dilation effect of the area probed , which itself depends on the redshift ; the space dilation is stronger towards the centre ( core of the cluster ) and increases with source - plane redshift .    to estimate these factors we used : the spectroscopic redshift for 7 objects ( pell et al . , 1991 , bzecourt & soucail 1997 ) , and \n for the rest we use the best redshift estimate obtained with photometric redshift techniques ( pell , private communication ) , and/or lensing inversion techniques ( kneib et al . , 1998 ) . by analysing the case with all background galaxies at a mean redshift @xmath21 \n , we checked the dependence of the results on redshift uncertainties . \n the source counts , corrected for cluster contamination and lensing effects , in both the lw2 and lw3 bands , are presented in figs . 3 and 4 . \n we have used only 5@xmath11 sources ( i.e. @xmath2060 @xmath0jy before lensing amplification correction ) . according to hogg & turner ( 1998 ) , \n this is sufficient to avoid the positive flux - estimate eddington bias which occurs for faint source counts .    at 7 , \n we find that the source density is greater than that of taniguchi et al . , ( 1997 ) by a factor of 2 . \n we suggest that their observations are incomplete below 50@xmath0jy , whereas our 7map is 80% complete down to 30@xmath0jy .    at 15the number counts \n are compatible with the results of aussel et al . \n ( 1998 ) in the hdf . \n however , with the help of gravitational lensing we are able to extend the counts in both bands down to 30@xmath0jy . putting all background sources at @xmath22 \n only slightly decreases the faintest counts , at the faintest end , because a few suspectedly high - z faint sources would be less amplified . \n this shows the small dependency of our derived counts on the models . \n the very small positive magnification bias in the lensing - uncorrected counts is consistent with the measured slope of the source counts , while the general shift of the points towards higher flux follows from the loss of the lensing gain . \n the 15 @xmath0 m counts show a steadily increasing excess ( by more than a factor of 10 ) with respect to the prediction of a no - evolution model ( dotted line , franceschini et al . , \n this confirms the steeper count slope below 1  mjy found on the lockman hole ( elbaz et al . , 1998 ) and is in good agreement with the iso hdf counts ( aussel et al . , 1998 ) . \n the counts are a factor 2 - 3 higher than the boundaries of the counts coming from an early analysis of the background fluctuations in the isocam 15map of the hdf ( oliver et al . , 1997 ) . \n in particular , we do not seem to detect any sign of flattening of the counts at the faintest levels , as expected from evolutionary models ( franceschini et al . \n , 1997 , oliver et al . , 1997 ) . \n the slope stays close to -1.5@xmath29 down to 30 @xmath0jy . \n this source density at faint levels favours extreme evolution models , needed to fit the counts at brighter fluxes , as shown by elbaz et al . \n ( 1998 ) .    integrating the number counts over the whole flux range and extrapolating the counts we find that respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 wm@xmath4sr@xmath8 is emitted at 15and 7 . \n this implies that a larger fraction of the uv / optical background is re - radiated in the mir than in the local universe . \n the absolute astrometry of mir sources is difficult in deep surveys because of the lack of any obvious optical - nir counterparts . in the a2390 field , \n unambiguous cross - identification of more than 90% of the sources was possible thanks to a large density of sources and a good sampling of the psf . \n a number of these sources are well correlated with faint galaxies in the visible , some of them having very red colors in the nir . \n 15isocam deep imaging is a good way to select star - forming galaxies and dusty agns which are not easy to identify in uv / optical surveys . \n a more detailed analysis of the sed of these mir detected galaxies will be necessary to determine the nature of these sources and give an estimate of their sfr . \n our observations confirm that abundant star formation activity occurs in very dusty environments at @xmath32 . \n great caution must therefore be taken to infer global star formation activity based only on uv - continuum or optical luminosities of high - z galaxies . \n the global star formation history can be traced fully only if the effect of dust is taken into account in a consistent way . \n ( _ e.g. _ blain et al . , 1998 ) . \n further , detailed analysis of our selected sample is needed to unveil the nature of these mir galaxies .", "StartTimeOffset": 3989835618203, "RequestID": "8a621dfde8154671811d1f173406d4c2", "TotalTokens": 4009}
{"ContextTokens": 1873, "GeneratedTokens": 114, "SynthesizedBody": "codex (= cosmic dynamics experiment ) is a concept for an extremely stable , high - resolution optical spectrograph for the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) . \n the science case for codex encompasses a large range of topics , including the search for exo - planets down to earth - like masses , primordial nucleosynthesis and the possible variation of fundamental constants . however , its prime science driver is the exploration of the universal expansion history by detecting and measuring the cosmological redshift drift using qso absorption lines . \n this is also one of the 9 ` prominent ' science cases chosen by the e - elt science working group to be among the highlights of the entire e - elt science case . \n a description of the codex project as a whole was given by @xcite . \n the recognition that an ultra - stable , high - efficiency , high - resolution optical spectrograph would not only be an extremely valuable instrument for the e - elt but also for the vlt led to the development of the espresso concept (= echelle spectrograph for precision super stable observations , see l.  pasquini s contribution to these proceedings ) . \n again , there are a large number of applications for such an instrument , as several other contributions to these proceedings have highlighted . \n hence , there is also a very strong science case for espresso , including e.g.  detailed studies of the intergalactic medium and of stellar abundances . \n however , apart from these scientific drivers , espresso will also fulfil another role : codex will represent a major development in high - resolution optical spectrographs compared to existing instruments such as uves and harps . in order to achieve its science goals codex will have to deliver an exceptional radial velocity accuracy and stability , i.e.  @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 over a timescale of @xmath2  yr . \n although the basic design concepts are already in place , several of the sub - systems needed to achieve the codex requirements do not currently exist . \n however , they will be implemented in espresso for the first time . \n hence , in many respects espresso will be a codex precursor instrument that will allow us to test and gain experience with the novel aspects of these instruments . here \n we will discuss espresso in the context of its codex precursor role , both in a technical sense as well as with respect to the main codex science driver , which we briefly describe next . \n the discovery from type ia sne that the universal hubble expansion appears to have begun accelerating at a relatively recent epoch , and its profound implications for fundamental physics have sparked an intense interest in the observational exploration of the universe s expansion history . \n several methods for measuring the hubble parameter @xmath3 already exist but all of them are either geometric in nature or use the dynamics of localised density perturbations . \n the simplest , cleanest and most direct method of determining the expansion history , however , is to observe the dynamics of the global robertson - walker metric itself . \n one way to achieve this is by measuring the so - called redshift drift , i.e.  the tiny , systematic drift as a function of time in the redshifts of cosmologically distant sources ( fig.[vdot ] ) . \n this effect is directly caused by the de- or acceleration of the universal expansion and can hence be used to determine its history . \n a measurement of this effect would be able to provide evidence of the acceleration that is entirely independent of the snia results or any other cosmological observations , and that does not require any cosmological or astrophysical assumptions at all . \n it would also provide @xmath3 measurements over a redshift range inaccessible by other methods . \n recently , @xcite found that a @xmath4-m telescope would indeed have the photon collecting power to detect the redshift drift by monitoring the redshifts of qso absorption lines over a timescale of @xmath2 years ( fig . \n [ vdot ] ) , providing a strong motivation for a codex - like instrument at the e - elt . \n the uves and harps experiences have allowed us to identify a number of properties that a spectrograph must feature in order to deliver exceptional radial velocity accuracy and long - term stability , including : simultaneous wavelength calibration , a fully passive instrument with zero human access , located inside a vacuum tank which is itself located inside a nested environment in an underground facility that allows progressively more precise temperature and pressure control , and the flux - weighted timing of observations with sub - second precision . \n temperature control of the ccd will be particularly important , while high system throughput will also be of the essence . \n some of these concepts are already established . \n however , two of the most critical aspects are also those requiring the most r&d : light scrambling and wavelength calibration .    at a resolution of @xmath5 a typical pointing accuracy of @xmath6  arcsec corresponds to an error of @xmath7  m  s@xmath1 necessitating a scrambling gain of @xmath8 in order to reach @xmath0  cm  s@xmath1 accuracy . hence , in addition to any fibre we will require a dedicated scrambling device to ensure that a photon s position on the ccd only depends on its wavelength but not on its position on the entrance aperture . \n current wavelength calibration sources such as thar lamps and i@xmath9 cells are sub - optimal in several respects , their non - uniformity and lack of long - term stability being among the concerns . however , a new concept for wavelength calibration has recently emerged . a ` laser frequency comb ' \n system provides a series of uniformly spaced , very narrow lines whose absolute positions are known a priori with a relative precision of @xmath10@xmath11 ( see a.  manescau s contribution ; @xcite ) . \n neither of the two systems above currently exist , but they would be developed for espresso . \n being able to test and validate them ` on the sky ' would provide valuable experience and input for further improvements . \n the scientific goals of codex are sufficiently removed from current observational reality to require validation and demonstration of feasibility of all aspects of data handling and analysis . \n this includes data acquisition strategies ( e.g.  minimum and maximum viable exposure times ) , the tracking of ccd distortions , and the accuracy of flat - fielding , sky subtraction and scattered light corrections . \n the extraction of the cosmological signal from the data will also require testing . \n issues include how to deal with qso variability and the accuracy of the conversion to the cosmological reference frame . \n in addition espresso will allow us to determine the currently unknown intrinsic widths of the narrowest metal absorption lines in order to reassess their usefulness for the drift experiment , and to look for any sources of astrophysical noise so far overlooked . \n data on qsos collected with espresso for other scientific purposes would allow us to address all of the above issues . \n we estimate that @xmath12 hours of observations of the brightest known qsos would provide an end - to - end system verification , from data acquisition to signal extraction , at the level of @xmath13@xmath14  cm  s@xmath1 . \n since espresso will have characteristics similar to those of codex the question arises whether espresso can be used to make a start on the redshift drift experiment . \n the idea is that since espresso would be available several years before codex data appropriately collected with espresso could serve as a ` zeroth ' epoch measurement , effectively extending the time baseline of the experiment for a few years , thereby improving the final result without delaying it . \n [ ol_om ] shows the comparison of the cosmological constraints in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane expected from a drift experiment using codex only ( coloured ellipses ) and codex + espresso ( solid contour ) , where we have assumed that espresso would take up operation @xmath18 years before codex . \n evidently the extension of the time baseline by @xmath18 years is not enough to offset the lack of the vlt s photon collecting power compared to the e - elt : the improvement of the constraints is only quite modest , with the lower limit on @xmath16 increasing by @xmath2 per cent .", "StartTimeOffset": 4002789210546, "RequestID": "2134d63014744deaac7f93bf9439baa2", "TotalTokens": 1987}

ngc  3516 : @xcite ; ngc  5548 : @xcite , @xcite ; mrk  509 : @xcite , @xcite ; ngc  7469 : @xcite ) . \n the x - ray absorbing gas itself contains material spanning a large range of ionization parameters @xcite , and it is likely that this broad range of physical conditions can also include the uv - absorbing ions . \n this is a natural prediction of the thermally driven wind model of @xcite , and would also be likely in disk - driven winds .    to address some of these questions , \n we have been conducting a survey of the @xmath5 brightest agn using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. the short wavelength response ( 9121187  ) of _ fuse _ @xcite enables us to make high - resolution spectral measurements ( @xmath6 ) of the high - ionization ion o  vi and the high - order lyman lines of neutral hydrogen . as of november 1 , 2002 , we have observed a total of 87 agn . of these , \n 57 have @xmath7 , so that the o  vi doublet is visible in the _ fuse _ band . \n the o  vi  doublet is a crucial link between the higher ionization absorption edges seen in the x - ray and the lower ionization absorption lines seen in earlier uv observations . \n the high - order lyman lines provide a better constraint on the total neutral hydrogen column density than ly@xmath8 alone . \n lower ionization species such as c  iii and n  iii also have strong resonance lines in the  band , and these often are useful for setting constraints on the ionization level of any detected absorption . \n the lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen also fall in the  band , and we have searched for ( but not found ) intrinsic @xmath9 absorption that may be associated with the obscuring torus . \n as shown in the left panel of figure 1 , absorption is common at all luminosities , and over 50% ( 30 of 53 ) of the low - redshift type 1 agn observed using  show detectable o  vi  absorption , comparable to those seyferts that show longer - wavelength uv @xcite or x - ray @xcite absorption . \n none show intrinsic @xmath9 absorption . \n we see three basic morphologies for o  vi  absorption lines : ( 1 ) * single * : 13 of 30 objects exhibit single , narrow , isolated o  vi  absorption lines , as illustrated by the spectrum of ton  s180 @xcite . \n pg0804 + 761 , shown in the top panel of figure 2 , is another example . \n ( 2 ) * blend * : multiple o  vi  absorption components that are blended together . \n 10 of 30 objects fall in this class , and the spectrum of mrk  279 is typical @xcite . \n the middle panel of figure 2 shows mrk 478 as another example . \n ( 3 ) * smooth * : the 7 objects here are an extreme expression of the  blend \" class , where the o  vi  absorption is so broad and blended that individual o  vi  components can not be identified . \n ngc  4151 typifies this class @xcite . \n the mini - bal qso pg1411 + 442 is another example of this class , shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 . \n individual o  vi  absorption components in our spectra have fwhm of 50750 , with most objects having fwhm @xmath10 . \n the multiple components that are typically present are almost always blue shifted , and they span a velocity range of 2004000 ; half the objects span a range of @xmath11 . \n as shown in the right panel of figure 1 , the maximum outflow velocities show a tendency to increase with source luminosity , perhaps indicating that radiative acceleration plays some role in the dynamics . \n note also that there is a population of low - velocity absorbers present at all luminosities . \n the multiple kinematic components frequently seen in the uv absorption spectra of agn clearly show that the absorbing medium is complex , with separate uv and x - ray dominant zones . in some cases \n , the uv absorption component corresponding to the x - ray warm absorber can be clearly identified ( e.g. , mrk  509 , @xcite ) . in others , however , _ no _ uv absorption component shows physical conditions characteristic of those seen in the x - ray absorber ( ngc  3516 , @xcite ; ngc  5548 , @xcite ) . \n one potential geometry for this complex absorbing structure is high - density , low - column uv - absorbing clouds embedded in a low - density , high - ionization medium that dominates the x - ray absorption . \n disk - driven winds are a possible explanation for some cases of agn outflows . by analogy to stellar winds , one would expect the terminal velocity of an agn outflow to reflect the gravity of its origin . \n disk - driven winds should therefore have velocities in the range of several thousand . \n objects with broad , smooth profiles might fall in this category . \n the geometry proposed by @xcite suggests that these objects should have only modest inclinations . \n however , two prime examples of seyferts with broad smooth absorption troughs , ngc 3516 @xcite and ngc 4151 @xcite , are likely the highest inclination sources in our sample given their extended , bi - conical narrow emission - line region morphologies @xcite and their opaque lyman limits @xcite . \n the lower velocities we observe in objects like ngc 3783 and ngc 5548 are more compatible with thermally driven winds from the obscuring torus @xcite . in these thermally driven winds , \n photoionized evaporation in the presence of a copious mass source ( the torus ) locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to total gas pressure ( the ionization parameter @xmath12 ) at a critical value . for agn \n spectral energy distributions lacking a strong extreme ultraviolet bump , such as the composite spectra of quasars assembled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the ionization equilibrium curve exhibits an extensive vertical branch . \n thus , at the critical ionization parameter for evaporation , there is a broad range of temperatures that can coexist in equilibrium at nearly constant pressure . \n for this reason , the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous . \n outflow velocities are typical of the sound speed in the heated gas , or several hundred , comparable to the velocities seen in many agn .    in summary , we find that o  vi  absorption is common in low - redshift ( @xmath7 ) agn . \n 30 of 53 type 1 agn with @xmath7 observed using  show multiple , blended o  vi  absorption lines with typical widths of @xmath13 that are blueshifted over a velocity range of @xmath14 1000 . \n those galaxies in our sample with existing x - ray or longer wavelength uv observations also show c  iv absorption and evidence of a soft x - ray warm absorber . \n in some cases , a uv absorption component has physical properties similar to the x - ray absorbing gas , but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between the uv and x - ray absorbing components .", "StartTimeOffset": 4018870371512, "RequestID": "4d6a2226a470450ca4cc727a5c4fc5c7", "TotalTokens": 3052}

rotating stellar disks . \n many other cases of counter - rotation are now known in ellipticals and also in spirals , but what makes the case of ngc 4550 particular ( kuijken , fisher , & merrifield 1996 ) is that the mass ratio of the counter - rotating disks is nearly @xmath0 . in the case of ellipticals counter - rotation \n is so frequent ( e.g.  schweizer 1998 ) that the merger or accretion origins seem the most likely explanations for such kinematic misalignments . \n the difficulty with a merger scenario for ngc 4550 is that strong disk mergers usually lead to ellipticals and the destruction of the disks , a `` truth '' often believed to be general since the seminal paper of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) . \n thakar & ryden ( 1996 ) have shown that over several gyr a series of well correlated small _ gaseous _ merger events can lead to a massive counter - rotating gaseous disk . \n but then this scenario requires to preserve special correlations over several gyr , contrary to a single event . \n thus , it remains open whether a single merger of two equal mass spirals can result in some circumstances to a galaxy like ngc 4550 .    in a forthcoming paper ( pfenniger & puerari 1998 ) we will present in more details the general conditions leading to moderate heating . \n in addition to mass and energy , one must also consider the angular momentum in the final budget . \n an input of specific angular momentum tends to cool the system , while inputs of specific energy and mass tend to heat it . \n since ngc 4550 is a rare object , a generic process is not required ; exceptional conditions can be acceptable and should be expected . \n after various considerations we have retained : * 1 . * a nearly circular orbit of the initial disks , supposing that the excess energy of galaxies coming from infinity has already been absorbed by some outer matter . \n * initial disks with opposite spins ( see fig.1 ) . \n counter - rotating disks are ideal for minimizing shocks in outer gaseous disks . also the retrograde disk is less affected by tidal interactions . \n nearly or exactly coplanar disks in the orbital plane . \n this may look a rather improbable situation , but a favorable factor to align the disk spins is to have initially flattened dark matter ( the torques on misaligned disks is then high ) . \n several arguments , such as the high frequency of warped outer hi disks with straight line of nodes , do suggest flattened dark mass distributions in spirals ( see pfenniger & combes 1994 ) . \n the simulations presented here were run in geneva . \n independently , puerari run similar simulations in mexico . \n we intend to publish jointly both sets of simulations since they lead to the same conclusions despite different choices of initial parameters . in particular puerari s simulations include round massive halos , showing that the shape of the halos does not change the qualitative results , and his disks start on more elongated orbits .    in view of the poor understanding of gaseous processes in galaxies leading to exaggerate viscosity with the sph technique ( see thakar & ryden 1996 ) , we simulate first only the collisionless gravity part . \n obviously the resulting heating is enhanced with respect to simulations including gas . \n our two initial disks are identical , except for the initial coordinates . \n they consist of a bulge , with a scale - length of 1kpc , an exponential disk with horizontal and vertical scale - lengths of 3 and 0.5kpc , and a flaring ( @xmath1 ) massive `` dark '' disk with a constant surface density up to 10kpc , decreasing as @xmath2 between 10 and 30kpc , and as @xmath3 between 30 and 60kpc \n . the mass ratios of the three components are respectively ( 0.25:1:5 ) , and the particle masses are all equal . the particle velocities are found by solving the jeans equation for each component in the total potential , assuming velocity dispersions ellipsoids parallel to cylindrical coordinates . \n the potential of the mass distribution is calculated with a set of @xmath4 particles on the geneva pm polar grid code .    a rapid run of coplanar counter - rotating disks merger is performed with the pm code with @xmath5 particles . \n the result is positive but not fully convincing since during the merging process substantial changes of positions of the mass distribution occur within the grid , which has a position dependent resolution . \n therefore , we select out a subset of @xmath6 particles , the mass of which is multiplied by a factor 20 to keep the same total mass \n . the particle subset is then run with the barnes - hut ( 1989 ) treecode ( with an opening angle of @xmath7=0.5 ) , which does not imply any geometrical assumptions . in several experiments we verify that slight initial disk inclinations with the orbital plane ( 5@xmath8 ) \n still lead to counter - rotating coplanar disks . \n here we just describe the strictly coplanar disk merger . \n 1 , left , shows the initial particle distribution with the senses of rotation . \n the disks are on a prograde near circular orbit . \n the tidal perturbation creates immediately ( at @xmath9200myr ) a bar in each disks , persisting until the disks merge . \n the merging process conserves the disks fairly well , the less damaged one being the retrograde one . \n fig .  1 , \n middle , shows the inner remnant disk at @xmath10=1500myr , still containing 80% of the initial total mass , almost circular and barless . \n fig .  1 , right , shows the large - scale particle distribution , at @xmath10=1500myr . \n the excess angular momentum is transported by 10 - 20% of the mass , mostly of the prograde disk , to large distances , 100500kpc . \n fig .  2 shows how the average line profiles as seen in the edge - on disks change from unimodal to bimodal . \n the bimodal distribution is crucial in order to distinguish counter - rotating disks from a hot population with a zero net rotation \n . the ratios of final to initial velocity dispersion amount to @xmath92.4 in the radial direction , and @xmath92 in the vertical direction . \n the final mass distribution follows well a @xmath11 profile . with a relatively limited heating the final disk resembles both in shape and kinematics a typical s0/e7 galaxy , with \n , in addition , marked counter - rotating populations .    at some moments during the merging process the system as seen edge - on looks like a single galaxy but with two bulges \n such a case of `` two - bulge '' looking galaxy is pgc 57064 in the hercules cluster . \n we have shown that counter - rotating co - spatial disks can be made by a single spiral - spiral merger . \n the required initial conditions are somewhat peculiar , but favored if the dark matter distribution is flat ; however , this is not a necessary condition . \n the strong reaction of the disks , expelling 1020% of the mass to 100500kpc , means that dark matter in such systems must be distributed in a pronounced asymmetric way for several gyr . \n thus , in many spirals the outer ( dark ) mass distribution should still be chaotic .", "StartTimeOffset": 4060206493421, "RequestID": "843eb41e554c4e13b70653bfa827c598", "TotalTokens": 1955}
{"ContextTokens": 3939, "GeneratedTokens": 143, "SynthesizedBody": "the theoretical treatment of time observables is one of the important loose ends of quantum theory . among them \n the time of arrival ( toa ) has received much attention lately @xcite , for earlier reviews see @xcite . \n a major challenge is to find the connection between _ ideal _ toa distributions , defined for the particle in isolation , formally independent of the measurement method , and _ operational _ ones , explicitly dependent on specific measurement models and procedures . \n it is important to know , for example , what exactly a given operational procedure is measuring , or if and how a given ideal quantity may or may not be obtained with a particular experiment . \n modern research on the quantum toa owes much to the seminal work by allcock @xcite . looking for an ideal quantum arrival - time concept \n , he considered that arrival - time measuring devices should rapidly transfer any probability that appears at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the `` arrival position '' ) from the incident channel into various orthogonal and time - labeled measurement channels . \n as a simple model to realize this basic feature he proposed a pulsed , periodic removal , at time intervals @xmath2 , of the wave function for @xmath0 , while the @xmath3 region would not be affected , see fig . \n a similar particle removal would provide the distribution of first arrivals for an ensemble of classical , freely - moving particles as @xmath4 . \n the difficulties to solve the corresponding mathematical problem lead allcock to study instead a different , continuous model with an absorbing imaginary potential in the right half - line , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , to simulate the detection . \n he argued that the two models should lead to similar conclusions with a time resolution of the order @xmath2 in the chopping model or @xmath7 in the complex potential model . \n he then solved the schrdinger equation with the complex potential and noticed that for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a maximum relevant energy in the wave packet ,     at times @xmath10 , @xmath11 separated by @xmath2 . \n figures ( a ) and ( b ) represent two instants immediately before and after the elimination of norm at @xmath0 . \n [ f0],width=226 ]    the apparatus response vanishes , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , because of quantum mechanical reflection . \n this is one of the first discussions of the quantum zeno effect , although it was not known by this name at that time . \n eight years later misra and sudarshan @xcite generalized this result studying the passage of a system from one predetermined subspace to its orthogonal subspace : the periodic projection method in the limit @xmath4 was presented as a natural way to model a continuous measurement , however it did not lead to a time distribution of the passage but to its suppression @xcite . \n this lack of a `` trustworthy algorithm '' to compute toa and related distributions prompted them to put in doubt the completeness of quantum theory and has been much debated since then , see @xcite for review . \n for the specific case of a projection onto a region of space , as in the toa procedure proposed by allcock , several works have later emphasized that , in the limit of infinitely frequent measurements , the resulting `` zeno dynamics '' in the original subspace corresponds to hard wall ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions @xcite . \n allcock discarded the short @xmath2 ( or high @xmath14 ) limit as useless , and examined the other limit where the measurement may be expected to be @xmath14-independent , @xmath15 , later on . \n we shall not treat this limit hereafter but , for completeness , let us briefly recall that he got the current density @xmath16 by deconvolution of the absorbed norm with the apparatus response function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the wavenumber and position operators , @xmath20 is the mass , and the average is computed with the freely moving wave function @xmath21 . \n this result makes sense classically , but in quantum mechanics @xmath16 is not positive semidefinite even for states composed only by positive momenta @xcite . \n he also got , within some approximation , a positive distribution , @xmath22 , which has been later known as `` kijowski s distribution '' @xcite , @xmath23 in this paper , instead of disregarding the zeno limit because of reflection , as it is customary , we shall look at the small amount of norm @xmath24 detected , i.e. , eliminated in the projection process , and normalize , [ pizeno ] _ \n zeno=_t0 . in this manner \n , a rather simple ideal quantity will emerge : there is , in other words , interesting physical information hidden behind the zeno effect , which can be disclosed by normalization . to fulfill this program \n we shall put the parallelism hinted by allcock between the pulsed measurement and the continuous measurement on a firmer , more quantitative basis . \n we shall now define formally the pulsed and continuous measurement models mentioned above and also an intermediate auxiliary model @xcite that will be a useful bridge between the two . \n @xcite is followed initially although the analysis and conclusions will be quite different . \n the `` chopping process '' amounts to a periodic projection of the wave function onto the @xmath3 region at instants separated by a time interval @xmath2 . \n there is nothing here beyond standard measurement theory @xcite . \n each chopping step eliminates interference terms in the density operator between right and left components , and the right component is separated from the ensamble ( detected ) so that it can not come back to the left . \n the wave functions immediately after and before the projection at the instant @xmath10 , are related by @xmath25 the wave at @xmath0 may also be canceled with a `` kicked '' imaginary potential @xmath26 where the subscript `` k '' stands for `` kicked '' and @xmath27 , = -i_i =- iv_0 ( ) , [ v ] provided [ v0 t ] v_0 t . \n the general ( and exact ) evolution operator is obtained by repetition of the basic unit [ ue ] _ \n k(0,t)= e^-i _ 0t / e^-it/ , where @xmath28 . for the continuous model , the evolution under the imaginary potential ( [ v ] ) is given by [ uot ] ( 0,t)&= & e^-i(_0+)t/=e^-i_0t/ e^-it/ + & + & o(t^2[,_0]/^2 ) . \n [ condi ] comparing with eq . \n ( [ ue ] ) we see that the kicked and continuous models agree when t^2||/^2 1 . \n [ kc ] at first sight a large @xmath29 , see eq . \n ( [ v0 t ] ) , seems to be incompatible with this condition so that the three models would not agree @xcite . \n in fact the numerical calculations give a different result and show a better and better agreement between the continuous and pulsed models as @xmath30 when @xmath2 and @xmath14 are linked by some predetermined ( large ) constant @xmath31 , @xmath32     (

in any case quantum reflection breaks down the linear dependence , see fig . \n [ f1 ] . \n a similar relation between pulsed and continuous measurements was described by schulman @xcite and has been tested experimentally @xcite . \n the simplest model in @xcite may be reinterpreted as a two - level atom in a resonant laser field , with the excited state decaying away from the 2-level subspace at a rate @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 . \n the relation between pulsed and continuous measurements follows by comparing the exponential decay for the effective 2-level hamiltonian with rabi frequency @xmath73 and excited state lifetime @xmath74 , with the decay dynamics when @xmath75 and the system is projected every @xmath2 into the ground state . \n it takes the form @xcite @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( weak driving ) . in our toa model \n we have a different set of parameters but a comparison is possible by taking into account that the imaginary potential ( [ v ] ) may be physically interpreted as the effective interaction for the ground state in the weak driving regime , for a localized resonant laser excitation with subsequent decay , @xmath78 . \n this gives @xcite @xmath79 , so that @xmath68 becomes t 2 , different from schulman s relation , as it may be expected since the pulsed evolution depends on @xmath73 in schulman s model but not in our case , where it is only driven by the kinetic energy hamiltonian @xmath80 . \n the first discussions of the zeno effect , understood as the hindered passage of the system between orthogonal subspaces because of frequent instantaneous measurements , emphasized its problematic status and regarded it as a failure to simulate or define quantum passage - time distributions . \n we have shown here that in fact there is a `` bright side '' of the effect : by normalizing the little bits of norm removed at each projection step , a physical time distribution defined for the freely moving system emerges . \n ( there are other `` positive '' uses of the zeno effect , such as reduction of decoherence in quantum computing , see e.g. @xcite . ) in the case of the projection measurements to determine the toa , this distribution is given by eq . \n ( [ pz ] ) . \n this result is fundamentally different from the current density or from kijowski s toa distribution , ( operational approaches to measure them by fluorescence are described in @xcite ) and corresponds to a classical time - distribution of local kinetic energy density @xcite , rather than a classical toa distribution . \n could in principle be obtained in the zeno limit for states with positive momentum support by transforming the initial state @xmath81 , with @xmath82 a constant , as in the operator normalization technique @xcite . ] \n experimental realizations of repeated measurements will rely on projections with a finite frequency and pulse duration that provide approximations to the ideal result . \n feasible schemes may be based on pulsed localized resonant - laser excitation @xcite , or sweeping with a detuned laser @xcite . \n a challenging open question for further research is the possibility to devise alternative ( non periodic ) pulse sequences to enhance the robustness of the zeno effect in a toa measurement , similar in spirit to the ones proposed in the context of quantum information processing @xcite . \n nevertheless , the ordinary ( periodic ) sequence has successfully been applied in quantum optical realizations of the quantum zeno effect @xcite . \n the proposed normalization method may be applied to other measurements as well , i.e. not only for a toa of freely moving particles , but in general to first passages between orthogonal subspaces , and it will be interesting to find out in each case the ideal time distribution brought out by normalization . \n b. misra and e. c. g. sudarshan , j. math \n 18 * , 756 ( 1977 ) . \n d. home and a. whitaker , ann . phys . * 258 * , 237 ( 1997 ) . \n p. facchi and s. pascazio , prog . in optics \n * 42 * , 147 ( 2001 ) . \n k. koshino and a. shimizu , phys . rep . * \n 412 * , 191 ( 2005 ) . \n p. facchi , s. pascazio , a. scardicchio , and l. s. schulman , phys . \n a * 65 * , 012108 ( 2001 ) . \n e. w. streed , j. mun , m. boyd , g. k. campbell , p. medley , w. ketterle , and d. e. pritchard , phys . \n lett . * 97 * , 260402 ( 2006 ) . \n h. nazakato , t. takazawa , and k. yuasa , phys . \n lett . * 90 * , 060401 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 4071354025472, "RequestID": "b2f25deb26894e229a00790e10c25720", "TotalTokens": 4082}

on damage . \n this makes low energy tem necessary for atomic resolution studies of samples such as single atomic layers of carbon in graphene or carbon nanotubes  @xcite and in biology . \n there are two main issues to be considered for imaging with low energy electrons . \n the first is the large fluctuations in the energy deposition . \n the second is the degradation of the point spread function ( psf ) due to the @xmath3 increase of the electron multiple scattering in the detector .    in an earlier paper  @xcite \n , we presented the design of a radiation tolerant cmos pixel cell and investigated the response of 10  @xmath1 m and 20  @xmath1 m pixels to electrons in the energy range 120  kev up to 300  kev for tem . in this letter \n we extend that study to lower energies , by investigating the response to 80  kev and 100  kev electrons . \n we perform a detailed simulation of the charge deposition and signal formation in the cmos pixel sensor based on the geant-4 program  @xcite using the low energy electromagnetic physics models  @xcite . \n the cmos sensor is modelled according to the detailed geometric structure of oxide , metal interconnect and silicon layers , as specified by the foundry . \n electrons are incident perpendicular to the detector plane and tracked through the sensor . for each interaction within the epitaxial layer , \n the ionisation point position and the amount of energy released are recorded . \n charge collection in the sensor is simulated with pixelsim , a dedicated digitisation module  @xcite , developed in the marlin c++ reconstruction framework  @xcite , originally deployed for the international linear collider particle physics project . \n the processor starts from the ionisation points generated along the particle trajectory by geant-4 and stored in lcio format  @xcite . \n the pixelsim simulation models diffusion of charge carriers from their production point in the epitaxial layer to the collection diode . \n this provides us with full simulation of the response of each individual pixels in the detector matrix , including sensor geometry and electronics noise effects , which can be processed through the same analysis chain as the experimental data . \n the simulation has a single free parameter , the diffusion parameter @xmath4 , used to determine the width of the charge carrier cloud . \n its value is extracted from data by a @xmath5 fit to the pixel multiplicity in the clusters of 1.5  gev electrons since , at this energy , the multiple scattering contribution to the charge distribution is negligible . \n we find @xmath4 = ( 16.3 @xmath0 1.4 )  @xmath1 m , which agrees well with the diffusion length estimated from the doping in the epitaxial layer and the charge collection time  @xcite . \n the detector charge - to - voltage conversion is 0.98  kev / adc count or 26.7  @xmath6/adc count at 6.25  mhz readout frequency , obtained by recording the position of the 5.9  kev full energy peak of a collimated 2.2  mci @xmath7fe source . \n we use the titan test column at the national center for electron microscopy ( ncem ) to characterise the detector response to 80  kev and 100  kev electrons and validate the simulation . the signal pulse height in a 3@xmath83 matrix around each seed \n pixel having a signal - to - noise in excess of 4.5 is shown in figure  [ fig : landau ] for data and simulation . \n the broadening of the energy distribution compared to electrons of higher energy is evident , however the ratio of the landau width to the landau most probable value does not increase significantly compared to that for electrons of higher energy . \n we estimate the uncertainty on the number of electrons per pixel that can be reconstructed from the measured pulse height in a single pixel . we simulate a flat field illumination by generating multiple electrons hitting each pixel and reconstruct the pixel pulse height . \n this accounts for cross - feed between neighbouring pixels due to charge diffusion and multiple scattering . \n we determine the number of electrons on each pixel by dividing the simulated pixel pulse height by the average pulse height induced by a single electron and study the distribution of the reconstructed number of electrons as a function of that simulated . \n we find that the relative uncertainties on this number scale from 0.17 ( 0.14 ) for 10 @xmath6/pixel to 0.12 ( 0.10 ) for 20 @xmath6/pixel and to 0.08 ( 0.06 ) for 50 @xmath6/pixel at 80  kev ( 100  kev ) , respectively . \n these results are comparable to relative uncertainties of 0.15 , 0.11 , 0.07 obtained for 200  kev electrons .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : psfsim ]    we describe the measured pulse height on the pixel rows across the image projected by the wire with a box function having the same width as the measured wire diameter smeared by a gaussian term , which describes the point spread function . \n the contrast factor , i.e.  the ratio of maximum to minimum pulse height levels , for the pixels away from the wire shadow and for those exactly below the wire centre , respectively , are set to those observed in data and we perform a simple 1-parameter @xmath5 fit to extract the gaussian width term , which gives the estimation of the psf . \n results are given in table  [ tab : psfsim ] . \n a good agreement is found between the measurement and the prediction from simulation . \n these results are compared with those obtained at higher energies , presented in  @xcite . \n it is interesting to observe how the degradation of the psf at decreasing energies , caused by multiple scattering , reaches a plateau around 120  kev . \n this is due to the decrease of the electron range with the particle energy , which limits the distance over which charge can be spread . \n in fact , we measure a point spread function value for 80 and 100  kev electrons which is compatible with that measured at higher energies , as predicted by the simulation . \n this result is quite encouraging for extending the application of cmos pixel sensors to fast tem imaging of organic and biological samples with low energy electrons . \n we wish to thank thomas duden , rolf erni and zhongoon lee . \n this work was supported by the director , office of science , of the u.s . \n department of energy under contract no . \n de - ac02 - 05ch11231 . \n m.  battaglia _ et al . \n _ , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 598 * ( 2009 ) 642 [ arxiv:0811.2833 [ physics.ins-det ] . s.  agostinelli _ et al . \n _ , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 506 * ( 2003 ) 250 . \n s.  chauvie , g.  depaola , v.  ivanchenko , f.  longo , p.  nieminen and m.  g.  pia , _ prepared for chep01 : computing in high - energy physics and nuclear , beijing , china , 3 - 7 sep 2001 _    m.  battaglia , nucl .  instrum . \n a * 572 * ( 2007 ) 274 . \n f.  gaede , nucl . \n instrum . \n meth .  a * 559 * ( 2006 ) 177 . \n f.  gaede , t.  behnke , n.  graf and t.  johnson , in the _ proc . of 2003 conf . for computing in high - energy and nuclear physics _ \n ( chep 03 ) , la jolla , california , 24 - 28 mar 2003 , pp tukt001 , [ arxiv : physics/0306114 ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 4083170163650, "RequestID": "199dd407b9004ba3aa6769b309a9f864", "TotalTokens": 2291}
{"ContextTokens": 1417, "GeneratedTokens": 72, "SynthesizedBody": "most computer simulations on biological ageing use the penna model @xcite . \n this model , motivated by the accumulation mutation hypothesis , provides a population of bit - strings that exhibits many features known for real senescence @xcite . \n recently stauffer @xcite in a general review of the penna model has suggested a simpler alternative with less parameters . \n this new attempt is based on the postulate of a minimum reproduction age and a maximal genetic lifespan . \n only these two numbers are transmitted from generation to generation , with certain mutations , by asexual reproduction . \n this simple model shows the basic features required for senescence . \n the age distribution shows an increase of mortality with age . \n the model reproduces successfully the catastrophic senescence of salmon @xcite and some specific human aspects like the social structures of technological societies @xcite or a transition between extinction and survival if a minimal population for survival is required @xcite .    in the following we examine the other modification to the basic model . \n the privilege conditions are introduced to earlier and then to late reproduction . by doing this , in case of late reproduction \n , we achieve the exponential growth of mortality in agreement with the gompertz law . \n the increase of fertility with age exists in nature . \n some fish , lobsters and trees share this feature @xcite and therefore this life strategy has been considered by the penna model also @xcite . \n the population consists of @xmath0 individuals @xmath1 @xmath2 initially . \n each individual is characterized by three integers : its age @xmath3 , its minimum reproduction age @xmath4 and its maximal genetic lifespan @xmath5 with @xmath6 . \n the maximal lifetime is restricted to 32 time units ( called years ) , the minimum reproduction age may be chosen between zero and @xmath7 . within these constraints \n the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are randomly mutated for an offspring by @xmath8 , away from the maternal values , and for each child separately . \n after an @xmath1th individual has reached its minimum reproduction age , it gives birth to one offspring with probability @xmath9 , chosen as @xmath10 thus during its whole mature life any individual gives one offspring at the cumulated probability equal to 1 . \n independently of the genetic death , which happens automatically and unavoidably if @xmath11 , at each time interval an individual can also die `` accidentally '' , with the verhulst probability @xmath12 . \n @xmath13 is called the carrying capacity to account for the fact that any given environment can only support populations up to some maximal size @xmath13 . \n otherwise the individuals die because of food and space limitations .    in this paper differently than in the standard model we consider populations in which the cumulated birth rate is not uniformly distributed among years of reproduction : @xmath14 . \n instead we propose to consider :    1 . \n privilege to younger third part of a reproduction period : @xmath15 2 . \n privilege to older third part of a reproduction period : @xmath16    in the following figures we present characteristics of populations developed when three ways of reproduction are considered : standard , ( a ) and ( b ) models . to avoid possible divergence \n we follow the stauffer recipe @xcite and shift the birth rate accordingly : @xmath17 with @xmath18 . in figure 1 \n we show the population volumes in percentage of the @xmath13 capacity . \n the population where the reproduction of older individuals is privileged , i.e. , model ( b ) , is the smallest one and varies in time by @xmath19 . \n figures 2 , 3 compare the distribution of @xmath20 the minimal reproduction age and @xmath21 the maximal genetic lifespan , respectively , in the three models considered . a significant change in the length of life of individuals \n is observed when the reproduction at old age is favorable , see figure 4 for the distribution of age @xmath22 in a stationary population . \n finally figure 5 shows the mortality in the populations simulated . \n the mortality is calculated according to the formula @xmath23 and plotted on log - scale to extract the gompertz law . \n in stauffer s new proposition of a model for biological ageing , by considering the privilege conditions for time of reproduction we can easily manipulate the mortality in a population . \n when reproduction at old age is preferred then the model provides the mortality in agreement with the gompertz law .    in the simple ageing model discussed here the maximal genetic lifespan for each individual is limited to 32 years \n this limitation was introduced to the model to make results better comparable with many penna model results . \n but one could ask if discarding this assumption would help in getting a nice gompertz law within the standard model . \n this useful suggestion pointed out to us by the referee has motivated us for investigations on the simple ageing model . \n specially we were interested in where the model ( b ) would drive a population . \n preliminary studies show that this model simulated without the limitation for the maximal genetic lifespan leads to the stationary state such that the distribution of @xmath21 is concentrated around age of 50 . \n the mortality in this population is presented in figure 6 . \n one can notice that the gompertz law of the exponential increase of mortality holds for adult individuals at age lower than about 35 . \n m.  argollo de menezes , a.  racco and t.  j.  p.  penna , physica a * 233 * 221 ( 1996 ) ; + m.  argollo de menezes , a.  racco and t.  j.  p.  penna , int \n .  j.  mod . \n c * 9 * 787 ( 1998 ) ; + t.  j.  p.  penna , a.  racco and a.  o.  sousa , physica a * 295 * 31 ( 2001 )", "StartTimeOffset": 4096499949135, "RequestID": "3317b52323ea4cdea036f55d6ee737bb", "TotalTokens": 1489}
{"ContextTokens": 2197, "GeneratedTokens": 61, "SynthesizedBody": "with the advent of the lhc era it was decided to completely rewrite the general purpose event generator herwig @xcite in c++ under the name , based on the package @xcite . \n the goal is not only to provide a simple replacement of herwig but to incorporate physics improvements as well @xcite . from 2001 until now \n has been continuously developed and extended@xcite . \n the current version is 2.2.1 , cf . \n the physics simulation of the current version is more sophisticated than the one of fortran herwig in many respects . in this report \n we will briefly summarize the status of the different aspects of the simulation . \n these are the hard matrix elements available , initial and final state parton showers , the hadronization , hadronic decays and the underlying event . \n we conclude with an outlook to planned future improvements . \n the event generation begins with the hard scattering of incoming particles or partons in the case of hadronic collisions . \n we have included a relatively small number of hard matrix elements . \n these include @xmath0 annihilation to @xmath1 pairs or simply to @xmath2 bosons and deep inelastic scattering . \n in addition there is the higgsstrahlung process @xmath3 . for hadron \n hadron collisions we have the qcd @xmath4 processes including heavy quark production . for colourless \n final states we have the following matrix elements , @xmath5 we also provide matrix elements for processes with additional jets in the final state , like @xmath6 in addition , there are matrix elements for perturbative decays of the top quark , which will be simulated including spin correlations ( see below ) \n . there will be some more matrix elements added in future versions , e.g.  for @xmath7 . despite the rather small number of matrix elements \n , there is no real limitation to the processes that may be simulated with . in practice \n , one may use any matrix element generator to generate a standard event file @xcite which in turn can be read and processed by .    for processes with many legs in the final state \n we follow a different strategy . when the number of legs becomes large \n typically larger than 68 particles in the final state  it will be increasingly difficult to achieve an efficient event generation of the full matrix element . for these situations \n we have a generic framework to build up matrix elements for production and decays of particles in order to approximate any tree level matrix element as a simple production process with subsequent two or three body decays . \n this is a good approximation whenever the widths of the intermediate particles are small . \n the spin correlations among these particles can be restored with the algorithm described in @xcite . also finite width effects are taken into account @xcite . \n the full simulation of several processes of many models for physics beyond the standard model ( mssm , ued , randall  sunrum model ) is thus possible in @xcite . here \n , all necessary matrix elements for production and decay processes are constructed automatically from a model file . \n after the hard process has been generated , typically at a large scale @xmath8gev1tev , the coloured particles in the process radiate a large number of additional partons , predominantly gluons . as long as these are resolved by a hard scale of @xmath9gev \n this is simulated with a coherent branching algorithm , as outlined in @xcite which generalizes the original algorithm @xcite used in herwig . \n the main improvements with respect to the old algorithm are boost invariance along the jet axis , due to a covariant formulation , and the improved treatment of radiation off heavy quarks . \n we are using mass \n dependent splitting functions and a description of the kinematics that allows us to dynamically generate the dead  cone effect . \n in addition to initial and final state parton showers there are also parton showers in the decay of heavy particles , the top quark in our case .    when extrapolating to hard , wide \n angle emissions , the parton shower description is not sufficiently accurate in situations where observables depend on large transverse momenta in the process . in these cases we supply \n so  called hard matrix element corrections that describe the hardest parton emission , usually a hard gluon , with the full matrix element for the process that includes that extra parton . in order to consistently describe \n the whole phase space one has to apply soft matrix element corrections . \n matrix element corrections are available for drell  yan type processes , higgs production in @xmath10 fusion and @xmath0 annihilation to @xmath1pairs . \n in addition , we apply a matrix element correction in top \n quark decays @xcite .    from the point of view of perturbation \n theory , the hard matrix element correction is only one part of the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) correction to the born matrix element . \n the full nlo calculation also includes the virtual part with the same final state as the born approximation . \n when trying to match nlo calculations and parton shower algorithms systematically , we have to avoid double counting of the real emission contributions . \n two systematic approaches are being successfully discussed and applied in event generators : mc@nlo @xcite and the powheg approach @xcite . in \n we have included working examples of matching in both approaches . \n the mc@nlo method , adopted to is described in @xcite . whereas the powheg method has already been applied for several processes in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite and also for drell  yan production @xcite . \n parts of these implementations will become available in future releases . \n another viable possibility to improve the description of qcd radiation in the event generation is the matching to multiple tree \n level matrix elements , that describe the radiation of @xmath11 additional jets with respect to the born level . \n theoretically most consistent is the ckkw approach @xcite which has been studied in the context of an angular ordered parton shower in @xcite . \n the hadronization model in is the cluster hadronization model which has not been changed much from its predecessor in herwig . \n after the parton shower , all gluons are split nonperturbatively into @xmath1 pairs . \n then , following the colour history of the parton cascade , all colour triplet  antitriplet pairs are paired up in colourless clusters which still carry all flavour and momentum information of the original partons . while these are heavier than some threshold mass they will fission into lighter clusters until all clusters are sufficiently light . \n these light clusters will then decay into pairs of hadrons . \n the hadrons thus obtained are often heavy resonances that will eventually decay on timescales that are still irrelevant for the experiment . \n these hadronic decays have been largely rewritten and are modeled in much greater detail in . while in herwig they were often simply decayed according to the available phase space only , we now take into account more experimental information , like form factors , that allow for a realistic modeling of decay matrix elements @xcite . in a major effort , a large fraction of the decay channels described in the particle data book @xcite \n have been included into . \n the underlying event model of is a model for multiple hard partonic interactions , based on an eikonal model , similar to jimmy @xcite . \n in addition to the signal process there are a number of additional qcd scatters , including full parton showers , that contribute to the overall hadronic activity in the final state and eventually also give rise to a ( relatively soft ) jet substructure in the underlying event . \n the model has two important parameters , one parameter @xmath12 , describing the spatial density of partonic matter in the colliding protons . \n secondly , there is one cut off parameter @xmath13 that gives a lower bound on the differential cross section for qcd @xmath4 jet production . \n the model has been carefully tuned to tevatron data @xcite . \n further possible bounds on the model parameters have been studied in @xcite . \n an alternative modeling of the underlying event on the basis of the ua5 model @xcite is also available for historic reasons . \n currently , the multiple partonic interaction model is limited to hard scattering while a soft component is simply not present . for a realistic simulation of minimum bias events \n a soft component is , however , very important . \n an extension into the soft region , allowing us the simulation of minimum bias events is currently being studied and is likely to be included in the next release of . \n the latest version of is always available from hepforge :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

{"ContextTokens": 2891, "GeneratedTokens": 137, "SynthesizedBody": "the internet has revolutionized science and society in many ways . \n studies of human communication networks nowadays deal with data sets of thousands people or more . gone are the days when one had to rely solely on interview surveys and observational studies . these new and larger data sets open up new possibilities \n one does not only get higher precision in the measurement of network structure , one can also rid the structural quantities of finite size effects that would hinder the prediction of phenomena such as large - scale information spreading . \n the accessibility of large data sets has also drawn the interest of statistical physicists , habitually working in the large - scale limit , to this traditionally sociological field . \n the sociologists themselves , naturally , contribute to the development , and make the study of communication networks a thriving interdisciplinary arena . \n internet has , of course , changed other aspects of society than science . in the perennial human quest to find a partner , romantic or \n otherwise , the internet provides a new _ modus operandi_. in this paper we study a swedish internet community , pussokram.com , intended for romantic communication among adolescents . \n the methods we propose do not only work for dating communities , but for internet communities in general . \n our definition of an internet community is a set of html - pages facilitating some type of directed messages ( i.e.  not all messages are broadcasted to the whole community ) , and where each member is associated with a home page . \n this definition includes social networking sites @xcite but excludes , for example , news groups @xcite . \n the data we use , the same as in ref . \n @xcite , are anonymized lists of contacts \n triples @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the id - number of the sender , @xmath2 is the id - number of the receiver , and @xmath3 is the time ( in seconds ) since an arbitrary start time . \n the ids are integer numbers with no relation to the users of the real community . \n we do not have access to the messages themselves , nor the individual presentations on the user homepages ( or any other text or images either ) . \n researched data sets of electronic communication have often been constructed from email exchange  , and to a lesser extent from communication within internet communities  @xcite . \n the advantage with internet communities is that they are a closed system  all communication can be recorded . the network of emails is a much larger and more important phenomenon . but studies of email networks are plagued by statistical biases due to the openness of the system . for email communication one typically samples a set of individuals and either restricts the data to messages sent within the group ( which leaves the message set incomplete )  @xcite or one includes contacts to outer vertices , which does not include contact between outer vertices . \n for this reason the study of internet communities may not only be of interest _ per se _ , but is also illuminating towards the general structure of electronic communication .    the goal of this paper is to say something about what makes a user successful in the community . given our very restricted data \n needless to say , the most relevant information is in the text and imagery we do not have  is there anything that can be said ? \n we propose simple measures for attractiveness and activity and observe that they are positively correlated in the contact sequences . \n more than that , these two quantities are more strongly correlated for the real - world data than for the null model we propose . \n it thus pays off , directly or ( more likely ) indirectly , to be an active community member . \n .[tab : sizes ] the sizes of our three data sets : the number of vertices @xmath4 , edges @xmath5 and contacts @xmath6 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the previous section we defined three vertex - specific measures for internet community contact sequences . \n we measured the probability distribution and the correlations between the measures . \n the design of the measures does not exclude that correlations may be induced by the growth of the community . to frame the correlations associated with the psychology of the community members \n , we need something to compare the values with , i.e.  a null model . \n in fact , we propose two null models , one more and one less restricted . we follow the general approach of ref . \n @xcite and sample randomizations of the real - world data set rather than constructing parametric null models . in both these models \n we will keep the sizes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the same as in the original contact sequences . not only that \n , we assume the growth of @xmath4 is unrelated to the psychology of the community members , we also keep the time evolution of @xmath4 the same as in the real data . furthermore , \n as the community grows with time the communication rate in the data should also be growing . with a parametric null model \n this would be hard to implement , but we just keep the set of times from the real data and the communication rate exactly the same as in the real - world contact sequence .    in the first , less constrained , model we apply the restrictions above . \n a randomized contact sequence is constructed as follows :    1 . \n [ enu:1c ] for each vertex @xmath1 add one contact to or from ( with equal probability ) at time @xmath7 . \n the other vertex of the contact is chosen with uniform randomness among the vertices present in the data at this time . \n [ enu : rest ] draw @xmath8 times randomly from the set of non - first contacts . \n ( i.e.  contacts @xmath0 , such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 . ) \n add contacts between vertices present in the community at these times . \n step [ enu:1c ] ensures that the number of active members is the same in the randomized sequence as in the real - world data . \n step [ enu : rest ] makes the set of times almost equal to the empirical set of times . \n note that , contacts between two vertices @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath11 will give rise to two contacts in the randomized sequence ; so the set of non - first contacts used in step [ enu : rest ] will be slightly ( @xmath12 ) larger than @xmath8 .    as mentioned in the previous section \n a broad activity distribution has been observed in many data sets similar to ours . \n one may argue that activity is a rather independent trait , little connected to the contact dynamics . whether or not this is true \n , we construct a null model to test how the reality differs from such a scenario . to generate a random sequence realization for this model we loop over all contacts @xmath0 and replace @xmath2 ( the vertex the message is sent to ) by a random vertex @xmath13 present in the community at time @xmath3 . \n clearly this procedure conserves @xmath6 . \n it may result in a few isolated vertices ( vertices of zero out - degree who looses their incoming links ) , and a slightly altered time evolution of @xmath4 ( vertices whose first contact is incoming may appear later in the randomized community than in the real - world data ) . for our data these effects are small , and we assume them to be negligible . \n values of the linear ( pearson s ) correlation coefficient between attractiveness , activity and participance rates for the real and null model networks can be found in table  [ tab : corr ] . \n first we note that the attractiveness and activity are more strongly correlated in the real community than in both models , and that this holds for all three networks . \n this means that the correlation between attractiveness and activity is not an artifact of the growth of the community ( by comparison with model 1 ) , neither is it a result of a skewed distribution of a ( hypothetical ) intrinsic activity ( by comparison with model 2 ) . unlike the attractiveness vs.  activity correlation \n , the correlation between activity and participance rate seems to a large extent to be an effect of the growth of the network . \n we see that model 2 induces a very high correlation between activity and participance rate . \n model 2 randomizes the recipients but keeps the rest of the communication the same as in the original data . \n the fact that the users engage in dialogs is an explanation for the lower correlation in the real world data  two users sending contacts to only each other , but frequently is active but have low participance ratio . \n the correlation between the participance rate and attractiveness of the real data is even more different from the null model than the attractiveness - activity correlation . \n this means that the vertices of highest degree in the social network generated by the communication are also the one that most frequently get incoming new contacts . \n another interesting observation is that the messages data have higher attractiveness correlations than the guest book and all contacts data . \n since the messages are not publicly visible one can assume that the real romantic communication takes place here rather than in the guest book writing . \n this strengthen the conclusion that active users are attractive in internet dating . \n we note that ( spearman type ) rank correlations are typically a little stronger than the linear correlations , but since they add little new information to the discussion we do not include them in our tables . \n in this paper we have introduced three measures to characterize users in online communities : attractiveness , activity and participance rate ( measuring how fast a user get to know others in the community ) . \n while these three measures are sensible in general internet communities , we evaluate them for an internet dating community  @xcite . how and why people end up as partners is well studied in an off - line setting  @xcite ; attractiveness in terms of body shape  @xcite , facial characteristics  @xcite and body odor  @xcite are all well - known . with internet communities playing an increasingly important role on the dating scene \n @xcite one need to complement the studies of in - real - life attractiveness with investigations of online romantic preferences . in this paper \n we find that the attractiveness ( the number of incoming new contacts per time ) is positively correlated with activity ( the number of contacts taken per time ) , and that this correlation is significantly stronger than for our two null models . \n we find this heightened correlation in the real - world data even stronger in the dataset of e - mail - like messages than in the other data sets ( including messages visible to the whole community ) . \n since the activity , as we measure it , is rather invisible to other members , this correlation has to be a secondary effect . \n ( writing in guest books increases ones visibility and is a , presumably small , direct effect . ) \n it is natural to assume that the users that send many messages , and thus invest much time into their community , also spend comparatively more time embellishing their homepages . \n the conclusion is thus that it pays off to spend effort on one s personal presentation . \n another factor is that highly active users are most likely logged in more often than low - activity users . \n since currently logged in users are displayed , the increased visibility of frequently logged in members may boost the attractiveness of active users . \n we also find highly skewed , power - law - like distributions of attractiveness , activity and participance rate . \n the mechanisms behind electronic communication and offline behavior are presumably very different . nevertheless , similar quantities in off - line relationships , such as the number of partners per time , are also known have this feature  @xcite . \n research on the structure and dynamics of internet communities is still a young field . \n their statistical advantages ( being closed systems ) compared to e - mail exchange make us anticipate much future work with both data analysis and modeling approaches . \n d.  i. perrett , k.  j. lee , i.  s. penton - voak , d.  r. rowland , s.  yoshikawa , d.  m. burt , s.  p. henzi , d.  l. castles , and s.  akamatsu . \n effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness . , 394:884887 , 1998 . \n j.  r. tyler , d.  m. wilkinson , and b.  a. huberman . \n email as spectroscopy : automated discovery of community structure within organizations . in m. \n huysman , e.  wenger , and v.  wulf , editors , _ communities and technologies _ , pages 8196 . \n kluwer , deventer , 2003 . \n s.  whittaker , l.  terveen , w.  hill , and l.  cherny . \n the dynamics of mass interaction . in s. \n poltrock and j.  grudin , editors , _ proceedings of the 1998 acm conference on computer supported cooperative work _ , \n pages 257264 , new york , 1998 . \n association for computing machinery .", "StartTimeOffset": 4119182235407, "RequestID": "b49197184a2042c08bc3533df8eae1e2", "TotalTokens": 3028}
{"ContextTokens": 3851, "GeneratedTokens": 221, "SynthesizedBody": "generally , the aim of our study is to analyze the possibility of the microscopic optical potential to give a physical interpretation of the total reaction cross sections of @xmath0he ,  @xmath1li on @xmath2si ( see refs . \n @xcite-@xcite ) including some preliminary data on the @xmath3li+@xmath2si reaction at the energies e=5 - 50 a mev ( see fig .  1 ) , and at present we study only the @xmath3he,@xmath3li @xmath4si cross section . \n there is the following motivation of this task . \n first , an interpretation of experimental data with a help of usually applied phenomenological optical potentials does not answer questions both on the nuclear structure of colliding nuclei and on the mechanism of their scattering . \n moreover , such kind of fitting is , in fact , only the parametrization of data by introducing a set , say , of the six or more free parameters , which are different for different energies and kinds of interacting nuclei . \n otherwise , the microscopic models do not contain free parameters and provide the possibility to test the models of nuclear structure . \n particularly , in this paper we use the current models of the projectile nuclei @xmath5he and @xmath5li to estimate a sensitivity of total cross sections to a behavior of their densities in the peripheral region . in calculations \n , we use the tanihata model @xcite and the cluster - orbital shell - model approximation ( cosma ) @xcite of density distributions of bare protons ( z ) and neutrons ( n ) in nuclei @xmath6 where @xmath7 are parameters of the models . \n also , densities of the large - scale shell - model ( lssm ) @xcite is also presented together with the @xmath5li density from tables of  @xcite . in fig .  2 one sees the visual distinction of shapes of the proton , neutron and the nuclear matter densities obtained in these models . \n between these densities only the lssm has the realistic exponential behavior at large distances while the others have the gaussian shape of tails .    in sec .  2 , \n the double - folding model ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , including the exchange term , is applied to calculate the real part of the microscopic optical potential whereas for its imaginary part we takes the form obtained in @xcite basing on high - energy approximation ( hea ) theory of scattering . \n applications of the microscopic potentials are made in sec . \n the role of the coulomb potential is also analyzed by comparison of cross sections calculated with the traditional coulomb potential of the uniform charge density distribution , and with that obtained in the framework of folding procedure accounting for the realistic nuclear charge density distributions . \n then , we discuss the method of adding free parameters to account for influence of collective modes of nuclei . \n summary and conclusion are done in sec . \n the double - folding nucleus - nucleus potential ( the real one ) consists of the direct and exchange parts : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the one - particle projectile ( p ) and target ( t ) matrices of densities . \n the modern calculations are usually apply the effective paris nucleon - nucleon cdm3y6 potential @xmath13 having the form @xmath14 where the energy and density dependencies are given as @xmath15,\\,\\,\\ , { \\rho}={\\rho}_p+{\\rho}_t,\\ ] ] @xmath16 and the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are done in @xcite . \n the energy dependence of @xmath19 arises primarily from the contribution the exponential in the integrand , where @xmath20\\}^{1/2}$ ] is the local nucleus - nucleus momentum , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the nucleon mass , and therefore there occurs the typical non - linear problem . \n here we paid an attention on the important role of the exchange effect in calculations of nucleus - nucleus real potentials . \n this is depicted in fig .  3 where the double - folding @xmath23-potential for the @xmath5he+@xmath2si scattering at e=25 mev / nucleon is calculated with a help of two different every so often kinds of effective @xmath13 potentials , the paris cdm3y6 and the reid ddm3y1 potentials . \n they have different sets of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) . \n it is seen , that their direct parts has different signs , and thus the exchange part plays the crucial role in forming the whole nuclear potential . \n note that when constructing microscopic optical potentials people usually use only the real double - folding potential ( [ eq2.1])-([eq2.4 ] ) while the imaginary part is taken in a phenomenological form with free parameters fitted to experimental data for each specific energy individually . \n instead , in our calculations we use below the imaginary part as it is done in the microscopic optical potential ( hea - potential ) obtained in @xcite basing on the hea theory . \n its imaginary part is as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the form factor of a pointlike nuclear density , and @xmath28 is the total nucleon - nucleon cross sections that is parametrized in @xcite as a function of the nn collision energy . \n the superscript h indicates the hea roots of the potential . \n fig .  4 exhibits microscopic calculations of the total reaction cross sections based on the given folding potentials ( [ eq2.2],[eq2.3],[eq2.6 ] ) and using density distributions of the projectile nuclei @xmath5he and @xmath5li . \n it is seen that they exceed the experimental data and their shapes follow to the data at energies higher than 15 mev / nucleon . \n numerical calculations of cross sections were made by using the code dwuck4 @xcite . \n on the next step of our study , to fit cross sections to the data we renormalize strengths of the real and imaginary parts of the potential @xmath29 this procedure is commonly used for the real double - folding potential when one adds the phenomenological imaginary part having itself several free parameters . \n contrastingly , in our study , on the first stage , we introduce only two parameters to renormalize strengths of the real @xmath23 and imaginary @xmath30 parts , calculated microscopically . \n 5 shows the results for the @xmath5he+@xmath2si cross section when the most realistic lssm projectile density of @xmath5he was taken in calculations . \n one sees that the renormalization makes it possible to agree calculations to experimental data at larger energies , whereas a significant discrepancy between the theory and experimental data at lower energies is still unchanged . \n we also mention that there exist some kind of ambiguity when comparing calculated cross sections with the data . here \n we show two nearby curves , the solid one has renormalization parameters n@xmath31=n@xmath32=0.5 , and the dashed one n@xmath31=1.0 , n@xmath32=0.4 . \n so , we conclude that in the framework of microscopic `` volume potentials '' ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , the simultaneous explanation of the data in the whole region of measurements is not possible . in this connection , at lower energies , the coulomb interaction can be thought play a pronounced role in the nuclear reaction mechanism . \n so , to get more precise results we computed the coulomb potential using the microscopic folding formula ( [ eq2.2 ] ) with the realistic charge lssm density and the @xmath33 charge interaction potential @xmath34 . \n such coulomb potential and corresponding cross sections was calculated for the @xmath5he@xmath4si system and compared to that obtained traditionally with a help of the uniformly distributed charge in the sphere of the radius of the sum of radii of colliding nuclei . on the left side of fig . \n 6 we exhibit the both potentials . \n one sees the visible difference of them in the interior region and their small separation in the peripheral band , while at larger distances they coincide to one another . \n however this changes do not reveal themselves in behavior of cross sections ( right side of fig . \n 6 ) , and the `` bump '' of the @xmath5he+@xmath2si total reaction cross section at e@xmath35 mev is not explained by correcting the coulomb potential . \n going step by step in the framework of our goal to study an applicability of microscopic potentials , at this stage we intend to simulate an influence of nuclear collective modes on the mechanism of nucleus - nucleus scattering . \n it is known from the theory of inelastic scattering that excitations of nuclear collective states can be understood by introducing transition potentials in the form of the derivative of an elastic scattering potential . with respect to this prescription , \n we add the derivatives @xmath36 of our microscopic template potentials ( `` surface terms '' ) to construct optical potentials @xmath37\\,+\\ , i{\\left}[n_{im}w^h - n_{im}^{(1)}r{dw^h\\over dr}{\\right}],\\ ] ] @xmath38\\,+\\ , i{\\left}[n_{im}v^{df}-n_{im}^{(1)}r{dv^{df}\\over dr}{\\right}],\\ ] ] thus , when fitting cross sections to the data we have two else free parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 responsible to the contribution of collective terms . \n in fig.7 we demonstrate result of calculations obtained for two kinds of nucleus - nucleus potentials . \n one of them ( left panel ) is calculated for the paris effective nn - potential cdm3y6 with the lssm density of @xmath5he , and the other one ( right panel ) is for the reid bdm3y2 nn - potential @xcite with the fdm - model ( functional density method ) @xcite of density of @xmath5he . \n the fitted coefficients are @xmath41=0.7 , @xmath39=0.4 , @xmath42=0.5 , @xmath40=0.03 ( cdm3y2 case ) , and @xmath41=1 , @xmath39=0.212 , @xmath42=0.3 , @xmath40=0.038 ( bdm3y2 case ) . \n it is seen that by introducing derivatives one can get the fairly well agreement with the experimental data in the first case , and the qualitative description for the second potential . \n these potentials with the `` surface terms '' have more smooth diffuseness layers as compared to `` the volume potentials '' ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , and this behavior is in correspondence with the models of collective motions of a nuclear surface .    by the way , such semi - microscopic optical potentials need in further improvements to exclude free parameters and to give their fully microscopic interpretation . in this connection , \n the problem of the physical nature of an enhancement in the @xmath5he+@xmath2si total reaction cross section at about 10 mev over the coulomb barrier is still calls for experimental and theoretical investigations . \n in particular , the study of angular distributions in elastic channel can decrease an ambiguity of parameters of semi - microscopic optical potentials . \n microscopic models of nucleus - nucleus optical potentials have no free parameters . \n they are constructed by using physical characteristics of structure of colliding nuclei and of effective nucleon - nucleon forces in nuclear medium . \n we considered a possibility of the microscopic folding potentials to study the total cross sections of reactions @xmath5he+@xmath2si and @xmath5li+@xmath2si . \n it was shown that a little renormalization of strengths of this potentials by introducing two parameters allow for explain the data at comparably higher energies @xmath43 mev / nucleon . in this region , the cross sections , calculated with the help of several developed models of the projectile nuclei , are closely related to each other . \n simultaneously , it is seen the visible disagreement of these calculations with the lower - energy data , and so that this is the subject of further investigations . \n our treatment to use the microscopically calculated coulomb potential does not improve results at these energies . \n this turn us to remind that , in general , the ordinary folding potentials take into account only one - particle density distributions of colliding nuclei , and thus effects of another channels , connected with nuclear collective excitations and the nucleon removal reactions , can also play a role in collisions of nuclei . \n these effects were approximately accounted for by adding the derivatives of the folding potentials to the basic microscopic `` volume potential '' , and as a result , the fairly well agreement was obtained with the data at lower energies . \n thus one can conclude that the more developed theory of reactions with exotic beams is called rather than the use of some kind of phenomenological constructions of averaged optical potentials based only on methods of double - folding calculations . \n 99 -1.mm i.v.kuznetsov , e.bialkowski , m.p.ivanov , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n * 65 * 1569 ( 2002 ) . \n m.k.baktybaev , a.duisebaev , b.a.duisebaev , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 66 * , 1615 ( 2003 ) . \n v.yu.ugryumov , i.v.kuznetsov , k.b.basybekov , _ et al _ , _ nucl . \n a _ * 734 * , e53 ( 2004 ) . \n v.yu.ugryumov , i.v.kuznetsov , e.bialkowski , _ et al _ , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 68 * , 16 ( 2005 ) . \n yu.g.sobolev , a.budzanowski , e.bialkowski , _ et al _ , _ bull . \n acad.sc . , \n physics _ * 69*,(2005 ) 1790 . \n i.tanihata , _ et al _ , _ phys . \n b _ * 289 * , 261 ( 1992 ) . \n m.v.zhukov , b.v.danilin , d.v.fedorov , _ et al _ , * phys . rep . * * 231 * , 151 ( 1993 ) . \n s.karataglidis , p.j.dortmans , k.amos , and c.bennhold , _ phys . \n c _ * 61 * , 024319 ( 2000 ) . \n j.d.patterson and r.j.peterson , _ nucl . \n a _ * 717 * , 235 ( 2003 ) . \n d.t.khoa and g.r.satchler , _ nucl \n a _ * 668 * , 3 ( 2000 ) . \n v.k.lukyanov , e.v.zemlyanaya , k.v.lukyanov , _ phys . at . \n nucl . _ * 69 * , 240 ( 2006 ) . \n r.j.glauber , _ lectures on theoretical physics _ ( interscience , new york , 1959 ) , p.315 . \n a.g.sitenko , _ ukr . fiz . journal _ * 4 * , 152 ( 1959 ) . \n s.charagi and g.gupta , _ phys . rev . \n c _ * 41 * , 1610 ( 1990 ) . \n p.d.kunz and e.rost , _ computational nuclear physics _ v.2 ( eds : langanke k.et al . , springer verlag , 1993 ) p.88 . \n o.m.knyazkov , i.n.kukhtina , s.a.fayans , _ phys . at \n _ , * 61 * , 533 ( 1998 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 4144536551277, "RequestID": "80dc9e5df7a54a75bbfdd2acc2650e12", "TotalTokens": 4072}
{"ContextTokens": 2710, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "evolutionary population synthesis predictions depends strongly on the stellar inputs . \n one of them is the library of stellar spectra used to compute the integrated population spectrum . to interpret the integrated light of post - starburst galaxies in the near - ir , where the bulk of the energy of luminous evolved stars is emitted \n , one needs to introduce in some way the spectral signatures of such stars ( essentially molecular absorption bands ) . \n asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb stars ) are characterized by low temperatures as well as high luminosity . \n the third dredge - up phenomenon on the agb , due to the recurrent penetration of the convective envelope into the carbon - rich layers , brings the products of the helium burning nucleosynthesis to the surface ( see mowlavi , 1998 , for a review ) , and is responsible for the eventual conversion of some m stars to carbon stars . \n this process is highly efficient in metal - poor systems , where the c stars can dominate the agb stars population luminosity at low metallicity ( groenewegen 1998 ) . \n another particularity of the most evolved agb stars is their high rate of mass loss ( @xmath2 , zijlstra 1998 ) . \n these stars , surrounded by a dusty envelope , emit most of their energy at wavelengths from a few to a few hundred microns . \n they can be missed in optical surveys , and accounting for circumstellar extinction reduces the predicted emission of the agb population even in the near - ir spetral region ( see habing , 1996 , for detailed review ) .    for intermediate age populations one must take into account all the agb properties pointed out above . \n the different librairies used in the literature , empirical or synthetic ones , ( terndrup et al . \n 1990 , lanon & rocca - volmerange 1992 , fluks et al . \n 1994 , lejeune et al . \n 1998 ) have introduced cool static giant stars , but they are not appropriate to distinguish between red giant stars and agb stars . \n bressan et al . \n ( 1998 ) have taken the presence of the agb stars into account in their modelling of the intermediate age population by assigning , to each point of an isochrone , parameters of a dusty envelope model and performing radiative transfer calculations to correct the spectra of static giant star . \n this method is promising but it takes into account only the effects of the circumstellar shells around agb stars . our principal motivation is to recognise the presence of agb stars in the integrated near - ir spectrum of a stellar population and to introduce all the effects pointed out above to be able to interpret accurately the spectrophotometric propreties of intermediate age stellar populations . \n the scope of this paper is to construct a new stellar library taking into account the relevant processes affecting the near - ir spectra of agb stars . \n the spectra of our sample ( lanon & wood , 1997 ) cover a broad spectral range ( 0.52.5@xmath3 m ) quasi - instantaneously , i.e. with no phase mixing . \n this sample consists of a wide range of cool objects : @xmath4 o - rich miras and @xmath5 c - rich miras , with various periods ( between @xmath6 and @xmath7 days , corresponding to different luminosities ) , observed @xmath8 times or more on different phases ( up to @xmath9 times ) . for reference and comparison , \n the sample also includes spectra of non - variable m - type giants , supergiants , lmc and galactic bulge variables , and oh / ir and c / ir . the near - ir spectra , taken at 2.3 m anu telescope at siding spring observatory , have a resolution of @xmath10 and are connected with overlapping low resolution optical spectra , taken at mt stromlo observatory . \n the quality of the spectra is good ; the s / n per resolved element usually reaches @xmath11 in atmospheric windows and the typical uncertainty on ( i - k ) is @xmath12mag . \n + the data confirm that the long period variables display much deeper near - ir molecular absorption bands than the cool and luminous static stars ( bessell et al . \n to estimate the luminosity of our spectra , we have used the l@xmath13-p relation of kanbur et al . \n ( 1998 ) , and an instantanous bolometric correction , obtained from the individual spectra themselves ( mouhcine et al . in preparation ) . \n + the effective temperature ( t@xmath14 ) determination is more problematic ( see haniff et al . \n 1995 for the essential reasons , which we can not discuss in enough detail here ) , and will strongly affect in the synthetic integrated spectra . \n the shape of the spectral energy distribution of the o - rich long - period variables ( lpvs ) is similar at most phases to that of static m giants ( fig.1 ) . \n alvarez et al . \n ( in preparation ) find that the optical spectra of lpvs can be fitted well with static giant model atmospheres . \n this might be interpreted as an indication that the t@xmath14 scale of the lpvs and static giants are equivalent . \n a large grid of static giant spectra was used to determine the effective temperatures of the spectra of our sample . feast ( 1996 ) has derived an alternative temperature scale for lpvs using a data set grouping m mira and non - mira stars . \n the colour - t@xmath14 relation derived is steeper than the one derived using the static giants models : cool mira spectra are assigned lower t@xmath14 values . \n this relation could be biased since the t@xmath14 used in feast s fit are derived from angular diameter measurements , who are interpreted using uncertain models both to correct for limb - darkening and to convert a monochromatic radius to the effective radius ( rosseland optical depth 2/3 or 1.0 ) . \n the situation is complicated by the uncertainties about the pulsation mode of some lpvs . \n in addition , the t@xmath14 derived can be biased if there is some scattering source ( dust ? ) in the upper atmospheres of lpvs that makes them appear bigger than they are ( wood , private communication ) . \n + to be conservative we have constructed two different librairies considering the two different t@xmath14-(j - k ) relations . \n schematically , the thermal pulses move stars up and down in luminosity along the evolutionary tracks , while the lpv pulsations ( periods of @xmath15 days ) occur perpendicular to the tracks ( large t@xmath14 shifts ) , deeply modifying the spectral type , the shape of the global energy distribution and the spectral signatures of the stars . \n the evolutionary tracks represent the evolution of static parent stars of the pulsating long period variables . how do we deal with this problem ? how to determine the stellar spectrum to associate with each point of the evolutionary tracks \n ? there are two approaches to adopt . \n one is to obtain properly weighted averages of the phase dependent spectra of individual stars , for various masses and evolutionary stages . \n this approach is , in principle , correct , but needs a huge amount of data or large pulsating model grids , which makes this approach very hard practically . \n the second approach , which was adopted , is to average the instantaneous spectra by temperature bin , disregarding phase and the pulsation properties . \n this approach is supported by the fact that , in our sample , no systematic correlation between the molecular indices and the luminosity or amplitude was found . \n in addition , this approach needs much less data . \n + our library also contains carbon stars . using interferometric angular diameters , in combinaison with bolometric flux , dyck et al . \n ( 1997 ) have found that there is small range of effective temperatures for c - stars over a large range in spectral type , and derived that t@xmath16 k. finally , the library includes 5 oh / ir and several observations of 1 c / ir star . \n this library of averaged spectra is constructed for population synthesis modelling . \n it should become public before the end of the year . \n we acknowledge the fruitful collaboration with r. alvarez , b. plez , m. scholz , p. wood , for different aspects of this work . \n alvarez , r , lanon , a , plez , b , in preparation bessell , m. , schloz , m. , wood , p. , 1996 , a&a , 307 , 481 bressan , a , granato , g. , silva , l. , 1998 , a&a , 332 , 135 dyck , h. m. , van belle , g. t. , benson , j. a. , 1996 , aj , 112 , 294 feast , m. w. , 1996 , mnras , 278 , 11 fluks , m. a. , plez , b. , the , p. s. , et al , 1994 , a&as , 105 , 311 groenewegen , m. a. t. , 1998 , eds . \n le bertre et al , 191 iau sympo . in press habing , h. j. , 1996 , a&ar , 7 , 97 haniff , c. a. , scholz , m. , tuthill , p. g. , 1995 , mnras , 276 , 640 kanbur , s. m. , hendry , m. a. , clarke , d. , 1998 , mnras , 289 , 428 lanon , a. , mouhcine , m. , fioc , m. , silva , d. , 1999 , a&a , 344 , l21 lanon , a. , rocca -

{"ContextTokens": 2284, "GeneratedTokens": 104, "SynthesizedBody": "laser - compton scattering is an attractive method to generate photons in an energy range from x to @xmath0 rays . \n the advantages of of this scheme are ; the required electron energy is lower than those of synchrotron radiation , polarized photons can be produced and easily controlled by the incident laser beam polarization . \n thanks to these advantages , this scheme can be applied to a wide area of scientific and industrial fields such as material science , medical science , particle - nuclear physics , and therefore , its characteristics and possible applications have been discussed by many authors @xcite . \n one of the issues of the laser - compton scheme is to obtain sufficient photon intensity for various applications . \n an optical resonant cavity is an idea to provide high power and high repetition laser pulses by coherently accumulating them in the cavity , which allows us to construct a laser - compton facility without a large scale laser system . for the coherent superposition of laser pulses , \n however , the length of the optical path in the cavity should be multiples of the wavelength with high precision , that reaches o ( 10 ) pm for the finesse of @xmath1 . \n therefore , controlling the optical path length is a key issue to realize the laser system with the high finesse optical cavity . \n we have developed optical cavities and performed a series of experiment to generate photon beams by laser - compton scattering at the accelerator test facility ( atf ) in kek , japan , by the collaboration of kek , waseda university and hiroshima university with a close information exchange with a group of lal orsay , france . \n the initial results were published in @xcite . at the latest experiment \n , we successfully kept the optical path length of the cavity with the order of 10 pm and enhanced the laser pulse intensity to 1230 times in the cavity @xcite .    for more power enhancement in the cavity , \n one order higher for example , the required precision will reach o(1 ) pm . \n it could be achieved with a sophisticated optical and feedback system , however , is technically challenging to develop such system . as an alternative of precise control of the optical path length by active feedback system , we proposed an idea of self - resonating cavity , in which the optical system composed of a laser amplifier and an optical cavity keeps resonance condition by itself @xcite \n .    in this article , we report a status and prospect of our effort to develop optical cavities for laser - compton scattering , including a self - resonating cavity . \n a schematic of an optical cavity installed in the atf is shown in figure [ 4mcavity ] . \n the cavity is a 4 mirror ring cavity with the optical path length of about 1.68 m. a discussion about various configurations of the 4 mirrors cavities is find in @xcite . \n comparing with a simple two mirror cavity , the 4 mirror cavity has advantages of stability against miss - alignment of the mirrors . particularly for an operation with a tight laser beam focusing @xcite . \n the main parameters of the atf and laser pulses used in the experiments are summarized in table [ parameters ] . \n energy & 1.28 gev + energy spread @xmath2 & @xmath3 + beam intensity & @xmath4/bunch + bunch spacing & 5.6 ns + circumference & 138.6 m + emittance ( @xmath5 ) & @xmath6 + revolution & 2.16 mhz +   + wavelength & 1064 nm + repetition frequency & 357 mhz + pulse width & 11 ps ( fwhm ) + power & 10 w ( 28nj / pulse ) +    [ parameters ]        a unique feature of the cavity is that the 4 mirrors of the cavity are arranged in a way to make a twisted optical path for the circulating laser pulses . \n it causes a geometric phase for a laser wave state in the cavity , and as a result , the cavity only resonates with left- or right- circularly polarized state separately at different optical path length . \n this feature is useful for generating circularly polarized photon via laser - compton scattering and also applicable to a feedback control scheme with a simple setup @xcite . \n we conducted the laser - compton experiments at the kek atf , an electron storage ring which was constructed to develop technique for an ultra - low emittance electron beam required for future linear colliders @xcite . \n figure [ storage ] shows the stored power in the cavity during the operation in the atf ring . \n the average power was observed to be 2.6 kw . \n since the input power to the cavity was 2.1 w , the stored power was enhanced by a factor of 1230 . from the fluctuation of the stored power , 38 w , \n the precision of the optical path control was calculated to be @xmath7 pm . \n we also succeeded to generate @xmath0 rays at the rate of @xmath8 with their average energy of 24 mev    it must be mentioned , while not discussed in this article , another 4 mirror optical cavity was installed by the french group in the atf and successfully demonstrated photon generation of @xmath9 photons per second with an average power in the cavity of 35 kw @xcite . \n the cavity equipped an automated mirror alignment system with pound - drever - hall stabilizing technique , while the cavity described in this article adopted relatively simple mechanical configuration and the polarization based feedback system . \n the average photon yield depended on the electron beam conditions during the experiments , which eventually gave us a similar number of photons per second . \n the photon yields normalized by the electron intensity for both experiments were consistent with the laser power and the french cavity showed approximately 400 photons per laser - election pulse interaction , which is the world record at the time of the publication @xcite . \n the obtained photon yields of @xmath10 , described in the previous section , are still not sufficient for realistic applications , thus we need to increase intensity of both electron and laser beams . in terms of the laser power in the optical cavities , \n the required precision of the optical path control will reach order of picometers or less . to avoid \n the technical difficulty , an idea of the self - resonating cavity was proposed @xcite . \n a configuration of the self - resonating cavity is illustrated in figure [ self - setup ] , which forms an optical loop with a laser amplifier and an optical cavity . at the beginning , a laser wave which satisfies \n the resonance condition , @xmath11 , circulates in the optical loop and acts as a seed of the laser oscillation . \n when the gain of the amplifier becomes sufficient to compensate over all power loss in the loop , the laser oscillation starts spontaneously with a wavelength which satisfies the resonance condition . \n the length of the cavity , @xmath12 , and therefore the resonance wavelength , fluctuates due to environmental disturbances , however , the system , in principle , keeps the laser oscillation with a new wavelength chosen by the cavity . \n we demonstrated the idea with a two mirror fabry perrot cavity@xcite . \n the reflectivity of the mirrors are 99.999% and the intrinsic finesse of the cavity was independently measured to be @xmath13 .        as the first trial , we operated the system with continuous wave laser with the wavelength around 1047 nm . \n we observed a highly stable operation with the power fluctuation of @xmath14% for more than two hours . \n figure [ drop ] shows a demonstration of the stability of the self - resonating cavity . during a stable operation of the cavity \n , we hit the body of the cavity with a hammer . \n a sharp drop of the stored power was observed , but was automatically restored in about 40 ms , which was consistent with a damping time of the mechanical vibration of the body of the cavity .    . \n what shown in b ) is a magnification of the behavior at the power recovery . \n see text for the description of a sharp drop the power and its recovery . ]    the effective finesse , which is a measure of the performance of the cavity including the stability of self - resonating mechanism , was measured to be @xmath15 . the stored power in the cavity , which was calculated from the transmitted power with the transmittance of the mirror , was @xmath16 kw , showing a power enhancement factor of approximately 187,000 . \n toward application of this idea to the laser - compton scattering , the mode locked pulsed oscillation is necessary . \n it requires a mechanism to make pulses in the system such as a nonlinear polarization rotation optics . \n in addition , mode locked oscillation requires a relation between the entire optical path and the cavity length as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath12 are the optical path length of the entire loop and the length of the cavity embedded in the optical loop . \n we succeeded a proof of the principle experiment of a mode locked oscillation with low finesse ( about 220 ) cavity as shown in figure [ self - modelock ] . \n the details of the mode locked operation can be found in @xcite and the r&d toward a stable and high power storage is now in progress . \n a series of experiments has been performed at the atf electron ring in kek and demonstrated photon generation by laser - compton scattering .    a new cavity based on the self - resonating mechanism has been developed and we successfully demonstrated a stable operation with continuous wave . \n an effort is in progress toward realization of stable mode lock operation for the laser - compton experiment . \n the authors would like to thank the members of the atf group and collaborators of lal orsay , france . this research has been supported by quantum beam technology program of japanese mext and also supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 23226020 , 24654076 and 25246039", "StartTimeOffset": 4186936738694, "RequestID": "264278fb003a4b81b3da215bd066f212", "TotalTokens": 2388}
