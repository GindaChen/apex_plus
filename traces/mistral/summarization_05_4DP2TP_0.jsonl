therefore , neutrino dis serves , for now , as an important benchmark process to perform rigorous and refined comparisons between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations . in the long run , a high luminosity neutrino factory could , of course , considerably raise the accuracy of present day information from @xmath8-dis . \n the theoretical calculations of inclusive charged current charm production have been carefully studied in the literature . \n additionally , the charm fragmentation spectrum has also been calculated in detail . while inclusive calculations are sufficient for many tasks , a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data at nlo requires additional information from the theoretical side . in \n charged current @xmath8-fe charm production , the detector acceptance depends on the full range of kinematic variables : @xmath9 . \n here , @xmath10 is the bjorken-@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the virtuality of the @xmath12-boson , @xmath13 is the scaled energy of the charm after fragmentation , and @xmath14 is the charm rapidity . \n the theoretical task is , _ mutatis mutandis _ \n , not too different from the extraction of the neutral current charm structure function @xmath15 as performed by the hera experiments ; the hera analysis uses the theoretical calculation of the differential cross section to extrapolate into regions of poor acceptance .    in this short report,@xcite \n we briefly discuss the key factors that influence the acceptance of the experimental detector , review the theoretical calculation of the fully differential cross section at nlo in qcd , and present numerical results for typical fixed target kinematics . \n dimuon events from neutrino charged current charm production can provide a clear set of events from which to study the strange sea . their signiture in a detector is a pair of oppositely charged muons and hadronic shower originating from the same vertex . the second muon is produced in the semileptonic decay of the charmed particle . in order to properly reconstruct these events from data , \n a minimum energy requirement must be applied to this muon . to be visible at all \n , it must first be energetic enough that it travels further in the detector than the particles which make up the hadronic shower . \n the background from muons from nonprompt decays of pions and kaons within the shower is large at low energy , and must also be reduced . \n typically a cut on the charm decay muon s energy of a few gev is applied to guarantee it is reconstructable , and reduce the nonprompt backgrounds . \n this energy requirement leads to a dependence on variables in addition to the typical @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 or @xmath18 dependence of the charged current cross section . \n the energy of the decay muon depends on the energy of the charmed meson from which it decays , and therefore depends on the fragmentation parameter @xmath13 . in nlo \n , it also depends on the transverse momentum of the charmed quark . \n an event with a low @xmath13 , and/or high transverse momentum will be less likely to pass a cut on the decay muon s energy than one with a high @xmath13 and no transverse momentum . \n it is therefore important that the charm production cross section s dependence on these variables be understood for a monte carlo to be able to model dimuon event acceptance properly . \n recorded charged - current charm production rates must be corrected for the detector acceptance which , as discussed above , depends on the full range of kinematic variables @xmath19 . \n therefore , we must obtain the nlo theoretical cross section which is completely differential in all these variables . as the nlo theoretical cross section contains @xmath20-function distributions and `` plus''-distributions , \n there are many inherent difficulties combining this program with a complex detector simulation mc program . \n the singular distributions are nothing but an unphysical artifact of regularized perturbation theory ; for any physically observable quantity , these singularities will be smeared by soft gluon emission to yield physical c - number distributions . \n as the theoretical machinery of soft gluon resummation is not fully developed for semi - inclusive dis ( massive ) heavy quark production , we will use a two step phenomenological approach : 1 )  we regularize the nlo calculation to provide numerical distributions free of @xmath20-function and `` plus''-distributions by integrating over bins which reflect the finite resolution of the experimental detector . \n 2 )  this result is input to a monte carlo ( mc ) where additional effects , including iterated soft gluon emissions are added to the @xmath21 smearing from nlo kinematics to match a gaussian distribution that has been fit to data . \n in addition to the above complications , we also encounter large and negative sudakov logarithms close to the phase space boundary where , at fixed - order , soft single - gluon emission is enhanced . \n these sudakov logarithms diverge in the limit of zero bin - width ; as we increase our resolution via narrow binning , we begin to resolve the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions . '' \n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . \n having addressed the complication of mapping mathematical distributions onto c - number functions by the introduction of bins , we now present some preliminary results of step  1 ) of this calculation . \n we compute the normalized differential charm production cross section for the differential structure function with the binning procedure defined above .    for our variables , \n we choose the set @xmath22 where @xmath14 is the charm rapidity evaluated in the collinear ( @xmath23 ) target rest frame . in we present results for kinematics typical of a wide - band neutrino beam on a fixed target : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . \n we plot @xmath27 in 2-dimensions _ vs. _ \n @xmath13 and @xmath14 in -a . -b and -c show @xmath28 for the case where either @xmath14 or @xmath13 is integrated out . in both cases \n , we display this for fine - binnings of 1@xmath29100 or 100@xmath291 , and broad - binnings of 1@xmath295 or 10@xmath291 . as an important cross - check on these results \n , we verify that the binning @xmath30 ( rapidity integrated out ) reproduces the integrated results in the literature . \n we observe negative sudakov logarithms which occur at large @xmath13 where we have @xmath31 in the integrand . \n this effect is an artifact of our fixed - order result , and is clearly evident in -b where we see that in the case of fine binning and large @xmath13 , the distribution turns negative . \n the fine binning effectively resolves the unphysical @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions , '' and results in an unphysical negative distribution . \n conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results . in an actual experimental analysis , \n this requirement of broad bins arises naturally given the finite detector resolution . \n hence , we observe that negative weights can be easily avoided by using sufficiently broad bins in a reasonable broadening of the binning    our use of bins to regularize the differential distributions will have negligible impact on the experimental analysis because our bin size is small compared to the experimental detector resolution , and also because the detector acceptance is a smooth function in terms of the set of kinematic variables . in particular , given the geometry of typical neutrino detectors , the effective experimental bin size in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is _ comfortably _ large enough for the purpose of regularizing the differential distributions with the binning technique . \n in conclusion , we have presented a fully differential nlo calculation of the neutrino - induced dis charm production process . \n this calculation is an essential ingredient for a complete analysis of the dimuon data , and will allow a precise determination of the strange quark pdf . \n we have demonstrated that by binning the data appropriately , we can interface the theoretical calculation ( containing @xmath20-functions and `` plus - distributions '' ) directly to the experimental monte carlo analysis program . \n we observe the enhancement of the sudakov logarithms at the phase - space boundaries , and verify that these can be controlled with this binning method . \n the fully differential distributions obtained here allow charged current neutrino dis experiments to use the complete nlo qcd result in the monte carlo data analysis . \n this analysis using the nutev data is in progress . \n these tools will allow us to extract the strange quark pdf from the dimuon data at nlo with unprecedented accuracy ; this information should prove crucial to understanding the behavior of the strange quark in the proton . \n the authors would like to thank t.  adams , t.  bolton , r.  frey , m.  goncharov , j.  morfin , r.  scalise , p.  spentzouris , and w .- k . \n tung , for helpful discussions . \n this research was supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-0070443 , by the u.s . \n department of energy , and by the lightner - sams foundation .      as space in this short report is limited , we refer the reader to our long paper for a complete set of references : s.  kretzer , d.  mason , f.  olness , _ differential distributions for nlo analyses of charged current neutrino - production of charm _ \n , e - print archive : hep - ph/0112191 .", "StartTimeOffset": 293506806, "RequestID": "96207305ac1e497fb5205d64705e30f2", "TotalTokens": 2756}

ordered onto a set of eigenvectors and eigenimages ( heyer & schloerb 1997 ; brunt & heyer 2002 ) . \n the eigenvectors describe the velocity differences in line profiles and the eigenimages convey where those differences occur on the sky . \n the structure function is constructed from the velocity and angular scales determined from the set of respective eigenvectors and eigenimages that are significant with respect to the noise of the data . to date , the results from pca have been empirically linked to the velocity structure function parameters based on models under a broad range of physical and observational conditions ( brunt & heyer 2002 ; brunt etal 2003 ) . \n the three methods described in the previous section provide valuable tools to determine the velocity structure function for a singular interstellar cloud from a set of spectroscopic imaging data \n . however , for most observations , the statistical and systematic errors for the derived power law index for a given cloud is large ( @xmath16 10 - 20% ) and preclude a designation of a turbulent flow type . \n moreover , given the broad diversity of environments and physical conditions within the molecular ism , any single measurement of a cloud is unlikely to characterize the complete population . \n therefore , it is imperative to analyze a large sample of molecular clouds to assess the impact of local effects and to identify trends and differences .    for velocity \n centroid analysis , miesch & bally ( 1994 ) analyzed a set of 12 clouds or sub - regions within giant molecular clouds . \n they determine a mean value of @xmath17 to be 0.43@xmath180.15 . using pca , \n heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) studied 28 clouds in the perseus and local spiral arms and found @xmath17=0.49@xmath180.15 . \n this mean value for @xmath17 is consistent with highly supersonic turbulence in which the velocity field is characterized by ubiquitous shocks from converging gas streams . \n the observed distribution of @xmath17 would exclude a kolmogorov description of incompressible turbulence unless the velocity fields are characterized by strong intermittency . \n moreover , they identified the surprising result that the scaling coefficient , @xmath13 , exhibits little variation from cloud to cloud , despite the large range in cloud sizes and star formation activity . \n effectively , when the individual structure functions are overlayed onto a single plot , they form a nearly co - linear set of points ( see figure  [ uniplot ] ) . \n co j=1 - 0 data cubes ( heyer & brunt 2004 ) . \n the nearly co - linear set of points attest to the near - invariant functional form of structure functions despite the large range in size and star formation activity . \n the filled circles are the upper endpoints for each structure function and are equivalent to the size and global line - width for each cloud . ] \n a necessary consequence of this universality is the larson ( 1981 ) cloud - to - cloud size - linewidth relationship . \n basically , the upper endpoint of each individual structure function corresponds to the global size and line width of a cloud ( filled points in figure  [ uniplot ] ) . \n this set of endpoints are correlated only by the fact that the individual velocity structure functions are described by similar values for @xmath17 and @xmath13 . \n if there were significant variations of these parameters , then the scatter of points on the cloud - to - cloud relationship would be much larger than is observed . \n using monte carlo simulations to model the scatter of line - width and size for gmcs in the inner galaxy , heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) constrain the variation of @xmath17 and @xmath13 to be less than 10 - 15% . \n the measurements of velocity structure functions in the molecular ism point to supersonic turbulent flows in which energy is dissipated in shocks . unless this energy is replenished within a crossing time , the velocity field would evolve into a kolmogorov flow comprised exclusively of solenoidal or eddy - like motions . \n the fact that we observe supersonic turbulence demonstrates that such driving sources must be present in the molecular ism . \n miesch & bally ( 1994 ) summarize candidate sources of energy that could sustain the observed turbulent motions . \n these include sources that may be resident within the molecular cloud such as protostellar outflows and intermediate and external sources such as hii regions , supernova remnants , and galactic shear . while all such sources make some contribution , it is important to assess whether any one process is the dominant source .    as first noted by larson ( 1981 ) , \n the universality of velocity structure functions imply a common , _ external _ source of energy . otherwise , those regions with significant localized sources would exhibit significant departures from the observed universal relationship . \n however , gmcs with rich young clusters , and ob stars show the same amplitude of velocity fluctuations as low mass star forming clouds or even those few clouds with negligible star formation activity ( heyer , williams , & brunt 2006 ) . \n either there are self - regulating processes independent of energy input scales that maintain this amplitude for most interstellar clouds or such internal energy sources contribute only a small fraction of the energy budget of a molecular cloud . \n large scale driving is also implied by the observation that most of the kinetic energy of a cloud is distributed over the largest scales ( brunt 2003 ) . \n this is illustrated in figure  [ drive ] , which displays the first and second pca eigenimages derived from @xmath19co j=1 - 0 emission from the ngc  7538 molecular cloud . \n the first eigenimage is similar to an integrated intensity image over the full velocity range of the cloud . \n the second eigenimage exhibits a dipole - like distribution that identifies the large scale shear across the cloud . \n all clouds studied by heyer & brunt ( 2004 ) exhibit this dipole distribution in the second eigenimage . for comparison , we show the first two eigenimages calculated from simulated observations of velocity and density fields produced by computational models that are driven at small , intermediate , and large scales . using the ratio of characteristic scales determined from each eigenimage \n , one can quantitatively show that the observations are best described by a large scale driving force ( brunt 2003 ) . \n protostellar outflows can have a significant but localized impact on a sub - volume of a cloud and can redistributed energy and momentum to large scales ( see bally in these proceedings ) . \n however , it seems quite unlikely that an ensemble of widely distributed outflows within the cloud s volume , can generate the large scale shear that is observed within all molecular clouds analyzed to date . \n co j=1 - 0 emission from the ngc  7538 molecular cloud and model spectra from computation simulations driven at small , intermediate , and large scales ( mac low 1999 ) . \n most observations of molecular clouds exhibit a dipole distribution in the second eigenimage that places most of the kinetic energy within the largest scales of a cloud . \n the observations are more congruent with computational simulations driven at scales larger than or equal to the size of the cloud . ] \n our understanding of turbulence in the molecular interstellar medium has greatly advanced over the last 10 years owing to more sophisticated computational simulations and ever improving observations . however , there are more critical questions to address to improve these descriptions of turbulence and the role it plays in the star formation process . \n * does the shape of the velocity structure function for a given region change at spatial scales smaller than current resolution limits ? \n * does the universality of velocity structure functions extend to the extreme environment of the galactic center ? * \n are velocity fields of interstellar clouds anisotropic as predicted by the theory of strong , mhd turbulence ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ) ? \n new telescopes , instrumentation , and analysis methods will be required to address these questions . \n alma will provide both sensitivity and angular resolution to investigate velocity structure functions at the smallest scales and for distant gmcs . \n the large millimeter telescope will offer the capability to study the low surface brightness component of the molecular ism to trace the transition from turbulent diffuse material to the dense proto - stellar and proto - cluster cores . \n these instruments , and others , offer exciting , scientific opportunities to advance our knowledge of interstellar turbulence . \n this work was supported by nsf grant ast 05 -

{"ContextTokens": 3684, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "after decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , it is generally taken for granted that neutrinos are massive particles that can vary among all the three flavors through the oscillation process described by neutrino mixing . \n one of the most important issues concerning neutrino mixing is the determination of the neutrino mixing matrix , i.e. , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata  ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite , which is the lepton sector counterpart of the quark sector mixing matrix , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . \n the pmns matrix is defined as the correlation matrix linking neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath0 and mass eigenstates @xmath1 , @xmath2 this mixing matrix is conventionally represented in the standard chau - keung ( ck ) scheme  @xcite as    @xmath3    where three mixing angles are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , with their trigonometric functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . represented by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . respectively . \n the _ cp_-violating phase is denoted by @xmath11 , meanwhile @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the other two phases in the case of majorana neutrinos . in the case of dirac neutrinos , \n the latter two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be removed by redefinition , thus there remain only four independent parameters , i.e. , three mixing angles together with one _ cp_-violating phase . \n if the neutrinos are of majorana type , the two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 are needed for a full determination of the mixing matrix . \n as the majorana phases do not manifest themselves in the oscillation , we ignore these two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 and take only the first term on the right - hand side of eq . \n ( [ cke ] ) in this article . by now , the quark - sector mixing matrix has been measured with good precision . in the lepton sector , the values of the three mixing angles have been measured after years of neutrino oscillation experiments , though with relatively lower precision compared to the quark case . \n the explicit form of the fermion mixing matrix is not unique and an alternative scheme is the kobayashi - maskawa  ( km ) scheme  @xcite @xmath14 in the km scheme , as will be mentioned later , the _ cp_-violating phase of the quark sector is quite near @xmath15 , leading to the hypothesis of `` maximal _ cp _ violation ''  @xcite . \n besides the ck and km schemes , in ref . \n @xcite all the other possible schemes of the mixing matrix are considered and presented . \n there are actually 12 schemes of mixing matrix . among them \n , 3 schemes can be transformed into others through straightforward redefinition of mixing angles , thus leaving 9 different schemes  @xcite , whose forms are provided in sec . \n [ sec2 ] . \n quark - lepton complementarity  ( qlc )  @xcite and self - complementarity  ( sc )  @xcite are phenomenological relations of quark and lepton mixing angles . \n they provide a novel connection to link quarks and leptons . \n they can be expressed in a more clear way as ( [ qlcsc1])-([qlcsc4 ] ) : @xmath16 ( from now on we use @xmath17 to represent lepton sector mixing angles to distinguish them from quark sector mixing angles @xmath18 . )    here we have marked the two qlc relations by qlc1 and qlc2 , and the two slightly different sc relations by sc1 and sc2 respectively . \n originally these phenomenological relations are observed only in the ck scheme and fit the experimental results within small errors . \n however , a question naturally arises , i.e. , whether these relations still hold in schemes other than the ck scheme since we can not find any justification for the priority of the ck scheme . \n there are already some researches on qlc and sc in the nine schemes  @xcite . \n however , all of these examinations of qlc and sc are carried out under some fixed phase choices . since the _ cp_-violating phase of the lepton sector \n is not determined from current experiment , in this article we examine qlc and sc with the whole range variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase . \n these will be treated in sec . \n [ sec3 ] and sec . \n [ sec4 ] . \n we purpose to make a detailed re - analysis of qlc and sc in all the nine schemes , emphasizing on the influences due to the variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase . in sec . \n [ sec2 ] we use the latest experiment results to do calculations on mixing angles and _ cp_-violating phases in all the nine schemes . in sec . \n [ sec3 ] we focus on qlc , examine these complementarity relations and make some analyses . in sec . \n [ sec4 ] we similarly examine and analyze sc . in sec . \n [ sec5 ] we discuss some properties of _ \n cp_-violating phases among different schemes with a suggestion of convention redefinition , and suggest some empirical relations among quark _ cp_-violating phases in different schemes . \n first we list all the nine schemes mentioned in sec . \n [ sec1 ] in table  [ tabscheme ] .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n some empirical relations we can easily read out are listed here : @xmath19 in fact , ( [ 1 ] ) are satisfied by the similarities between their mixing angles . from table \n [ tab1 ] , we have these relations approximately  ( here @xmath20 represents @xmath21 in p@xmath22 scheme ) : @xmath23 then using the scheme - independent jarlskog invariant , we get @xmath24 justifying the relation ( [ 1 ] ) . by the same way , ( [ 3 ] ) \n is justified through the similarities among mixing angles in p6 , p8 , and p9 . \n relation ( [ 2 ] ) states possible maximal _ cp _ violation as we discussed before , and relation ( [ 4 ] ) merely reflects the relative largeness of the three mixing angles in p7 . with the existence of _ cp _ \n violation confirmed , @xmath25 can not be exactly @xmath26 though close to it  @xcite . \n we are willing to find out some similar empirical relations on lepton _ cp_-violating phases . \n unfortunately , similar relations can not be easily found , because the lepton mixing angles are quite different from each other in different schemes , thus invalidating our method used for the quark sector . \n from the results of sec .  [ sec3 ] and sec . \n [ sec4 ] , the validation of qlc and sc depends on the choices of schemes and lepton _ cp_-violating phases , and careful inspections should be carried out when we consider the generalization of qlc and sc from the standard ck scheme to the other eight schemes . on the issues of _ cp_-violating phases , restrictions on lepton _ cp_-violating phases in p6@xmath27p9 are recognized . \n simultaneous maximal _ \n violation in both the quark and the lepton sector is possible in the p2 and p3 scheme . \n a redefinition of _ cp_-violating phases for unification is suggested and some empirical relations on the quark _ cp_-violating phases are explored . \n all of these results may enrich our knowledge of qlc , sc relations , and _ cp_-violating phases , helping us understand the mystery of lepton mixing . \n this work is supported by the principal fund for undergraduate research at peking university . \n it is also partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( grants no .  11021092 , no . \n 10975003 , no . \n 11035003 , and no . \n 11120101004 ) , by the national fund for fostering talents of basic science ( grants no . \n j1030310 ) , and by the research fund for the doctoral program of higher education ( china ) . \n 50 b.  pontecorvo , sov . \n jetp * 26 * , 984 ( 1968 ) ; + z.  maki , m.  nakagawa and s.  sakata , prog . \n * 28 * , 870 ( 1962 ) . \n n.  cabibbo , phys . \n * 10 * , 531 ( 1963 ) ; + m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa , prog . \n theor . phys . \n * 49 * , 652 ( 1973 ) . \n chau and w.y . \n keung , phys . \n * 53 * , 1802 ( 1984 ) . \n m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa , prog . \n . phys . * 49 * 652 ( 1973 ) . \n y. koide , phys . \n b * 607 * , 123 ( 2005 ) . \n y.  koide and h.  nishiura , phys . \n d * 79 * , 093005 ( 2009 ) . \n frampton and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n b * 688 * , 67 ( 2010 ) ; p.h . \n frampton and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n d * 82 * , 017301 ( 2010 ) . \n li and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 691 * , 37 ( 2010 ) . \n n.  qin and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b 695 , 194 ( 2011 ) ; n.  qin and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n d 83 , 033006 ( 2011 ) . \n ahn , h.y . \n cheng and s.  oh , phys . lett . \n b * 701 * , 614 ( 2011 ) . \n h. fritzsch and z .- z . \n xing , phys . \n d * 57 * 594 ( 1998 ) . \n zheng , phys . \n d * 81 * , 073009 ( 2010 ) . \n x.  zhang and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 710 * , 630 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  zhang , y .- j . \n zheng and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n d * 85 * 097301 ( 2012 ) . \n a.  y.  smirnov , arxiv : hep - ph/0402264 . \n h.  minakata and a.y . \n smirnov , phys . \n * 70 * , 073009 ( 2004 ) . \n m.  raidal , phys . rev \n * 93 * , 161801 ( 2004 ) . \n see , e.g. , p.  h.  frampton and r.  n.  mohapatra , j. high energy phys . * \n 0501 * , 025 ( 2005 ) ; n.  li and b .- q .  ma , phys . \n d * 71 * , 097301 ( 2005 ) ; s.  antusch , s.  f.  king and r.  n.  mohapatra , phys . \n b * 618 * , 150 ( 2005 ) ; h.  minakata , ; j.  ferrandis and s.  pakvasa , phys . \n d * 71 * , 033004 ( 2005 ) ; s.k . \n kang , c.s . \n kim and j.  lee , phys . \n b * 619 * , 129 ( 2005 ) ; m.a . \n schmidt and a.y . \n smirnov , phys . \n d * 74 * , 113003 ( 2006 ) ; k.  a.  hochmuth and w.  rodejohann , phys . \n d * 75 * , 073001 ( 2007 ) ; f.  plentinger , g.  seidl and w.  winter , phys . rev . \n d * 76 * , 113003 ( 2007 ) ; g.  altarelli , f.  feruglio and l.  merlo , j. high energy phys . * 0905 * , 020 ( 2009 ) . \n y .- j .  zheng and b .- q . \n j. plus * 127 * , 7 ( 2012 ) . \n l.  wolfenstein , phys . \n lett . * 51 * , 1945 ( 1983 ) . \n j.  beringer _ \n ( particle data group ) , phys . \n d * 86 * , 010001 ( 2012 ) . c.  jarlskog , phys . \n * 55 * 1039 ( 1985 ) ; + d .- d . \n wu , phys . \n d * 33 * 860 ( 1986 ) ; + o.w . \n greenberg , phys . \n d * 32 * 1841 ( 1985 ) . \n g.  l.  fogli , e.  lisi , a.  marrone , d.  montanino , a.  palazzo , and a.  rotunno , phys . \n d * 86 * , 013012 ( 2012 ) . \n x.  zhang and b .- q . \n ma , phys . \n b * 713 * , 202 ( 2012 ) ; arxiv:1204.6604 [ hep - ph ] . \n k.  abe _ et al . \n * 107 * 041801 ( 2011 ) , . \n . lett . * 107 * , 181802 ( 2011 ) . c.  jarlskog phys . \n b * 625 * , 63 ( 2005 ) . \n li , h .- h . \n lin and x .- g . \n he , phys . \n b * 711 * , 57 ( 2012 ) . \n see , also , jean - marc gerard , arxiv:0811.0540 .", "StartTimeOffset": 40648375072, "RequestID": "43b4ece3b11b4c8bb1ad59b622691feb", "TotalTokens": 3872}

@xmath31 eliminating @xmath32 we have @xmath33 defining @xmath34 then , @xmath35 when the driving amplitude is small,(@xmath36 ) @xmath37 using the transformation @xmath38 , we arrive at @xmath39 correct to @xmath40(@xmath41 ) . \n we recognize eq([eq38 ] ) as a mathieu equation and note that there will be a periodic response at a frequency of @xmath42 provided we fulfill the condition @xmath43 this is in effect a construct on the initial conditions . \n the result found in eq([eq39 ] ) implies that for every modulating frequency @xmath44 , there will be some initial conditions for which a periodic response will be possible . \n for initial conditions in the range @xmath45 , the response will be unbounded while for initial conditions outside this range the response will be bounded and in general quasi - periodic - the periodic motion resulting when eq([eq39 ] ) is satisfied . \n + in fig[[fig2 ] ] , the unboundedness of the solution is shown for @xmath46 . \n the width of the unbounded region is exactly @xmath47 . \n the original set of equation have nonlinear terms that prevents the dynamics becoming unbounded . \n nevertheless we get the signature of unboundedness through the steep increase of the width ( @xmath48 ) fig[[fig3 ] ] of the phase space trajectory in the same frequency range .    ) \n shows the signature of unboundedness of the linearized solution.fig([fig3 ] ) change of width ( @xmath48 ) ( a , b ) reflects the resonance in linearized rezime . as we move from linearized unbounded solutions @xmath48 decreases ( c , d ) . \n solid lines ( a , c ) represent the unperturbed trajctories . ]    [ fig2 ]    ) ] campares well with the signature of resonance in original dynamics ( b ) . in ( b ) @xmath48 is plotted with initial conditions of population density ( @xmath49 ) . ] \n @xmath48 is potentially very different from the width @xmath50 we discussed later . \n @xmath48 is a effect of the dynamics of two competing frequencies having resonating effect at comparable values , whereas @xmath50 shows the presence of two different order of timescale . \n in this section , we consider the variation in the parameter of the lotka volterra model to be very rapid , i.e. the period @xmath44 of the forcing in eq([eq41 ] ) , is much greater than the frequency of the unforced system . \n the system fluctuates rapidly from the unperturbed trajectory and the phase space trajectory is broadened fig[[fig4 ] ] . \n this broadening ( @xmath50 ) depends mainly on the frequency of forcing and feebly on forcing amplitude . as @xmath44 increases this broadening decreases very rapidly .    ) of high frequency perturbation changes as we vary frequency of perturbation ( @xmath44 ) from 10 ( a ) to 30 ( b ) . \n phase space plots ( b , d ) also show these through its change of width . \n the solid lines represent the unperturbed trajectory . ] \n the analysis of the system follows a procedure explained by landau and lifshitz . \n we split the variables @xmath51 and @xmath32 into two parts , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 carry the rapid variations ( scale of @xmath44 ) and the averaged quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 carry the slow variation ( order unity ) of the original model . substituting in eq([eq41 ] ) ; @xmath57 in this section , we do not restrict @xmath41 to be small . instead , we note that since @xmath58 , typically @xmath59 . \n we choose the dynamics of @xmath60 to be @xmath61 in the above @xmath55 and @xmath56 may be treated as constants on the scale of variation over a period @xmath62 . \n in that situation , eqs([eq44 ] ) and ( [ eq45 ] ) reduce to @xmath63 since @xmath64 , we write the approximate solution of eq([eq46 ] ) as @xmath65 we now average eqs([eq42 ] ) and ( [ eq43 ] ) over the fast variations , drop terms that are @xmath66 and obtain @xmath67 which is the unforced system in the coarse - grained variables . \n the picture , which emerges is as follows : under a high frequency modulation , the motion can be explained as a rapidly oscillatory motion which is virtually identical to the trajectory of the unforced system . \n the amplitude of the fast variations decays according to @xmath68 as shown in eq([eq47 ] ) . \n numerical simulation of the system bears out these expectations.fig[[fig5 ] ]     is plotted against the frequency of modulation ( @xmath44 ) . \n the fitting function ( f(x ) ) supports the form of analytical result . ] \n in this paper we have shown that under lotka - volterra dynamics populations of predator and prey depend on their initial population densities . \n this dependence of initial population brings forth changes in dynamics but helps us formulate an effective mathew - hill type equation for this 2-species system under periodic seasonal changes . \n this also indicates slow seasonal changes have more effects in the variation of population than its faster counterpart . \n 99 a.j lotka , j. am . \n chem soc . * 42 * , 1595 ( 1920 ) . \n v. volterra , atti r. accad , naz . \n lincei , mem . \n fis , . mat . \n * 2 * , 31 ( 1926 ) . \n h. haken , _ synergetics _ , 3rd ed . \n ( springer - verlag , new york , 1983 ) . \n d. neal , _ introduction to population biology _ \n ( cambridge university press , cambridge , u.k . \n r. m. may , _ stability and complexity in model ecosystems _ \n ( princeton university press , princeton , 1973 ) . j. maynard smith , _ models in ecology _ ( cambridge university press , cambridge , u.k . 1974 ) . \n j. d. murray , _ mathematical biology _ , 3rd ed . \n ( springer - verlag , new york , 2002 ) , vols . \n t. fukai and s. tanaka , neural comput . \n * 9 * , 77 ( 1997 ) . \n zhang yi , k . k. tan , phys . \n e , * 66 * , 011910 ( 2002 ) . \n luca bianco , federico fontana , vincenzo manca j.j . \n hopeld , proc . \n usa * 81 * , 3088 ( 1984 ) . \n k. gopalsamy and x.z . \n he , physica d * 76 * , 344 ( 1994 ) . \n m. mobilia , t. goeorgiev , u. c. tuber , phys . \n e , * 73 * , 040903(r ) ( 2006 ) a. r. balsara , k. lindenberg and k. e. shuler , j. stat . phys,*27 * 787 ( 1982 ) a. b. budgor , b. j. west phys . \n a , * 17 * 370 ( 1978 ) mikhail f. dimentberg , phys . rev . \n e , * 65 * 036204 ( 2001 ) sabin g.c.w , summer d , math biosci . \n * 113 * 91 ( 1993 )", "StartTimeOffset": 46056283747, "RequestID": "941310f4d3be4e80954f3712f853c899", "TotalTokens": 3546}
{"ContextTokens": 3383, "GeneratedTokens": 163, "SynthesizedBody": "cosmological models predict that halos of luminous galaxies are assembled through merging of smaller structures . \n remnants of past mergers will survive for a long time in the halo as debris streams because of the very long dynamical time scale . \n the gaia mission offers a unique opportunity to search for and study these remnants with full phase space information in our galaxy s halo . \n however disentangling the possibly many remnants from each other and from the background of galactic stars will be very challenging . \n the gaia catalogue will contain about one billion objects of which the stars in the individual debris streams may form only a very small fraction . \n in addition the streams are spread out all over the sky . \n identifying them will require a combination of search methods that make use both of conserved dynamical quantities of the debris stream ( such as energy and angular momentum , see e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and astrophysical properties of the constituent stars ( from photometric data ) . \n the goals of this work are : * 1 . * study the retrieval from gaia data of remnants of satellite galaxies that have been disrupted in the potential of our galaxy ; * 2 . * \n include a realistic model of the galactic background population against which the remnants have to be detected ; * 3 . \n * gain practical experience with analysing and visualising the enormous volume of information that will be present in the gaia data - base .    to achieve \n this we built a monte carlo model of the smooth components of the galaxy containing a realistic number of stars and performed tree - code @xmath2-body simulations of satellites that are disrupted while orbiting the galaxy . \n the galaxy and satellite models were subsequently combined and gaia observations were simulated . in the following \n we summarise how the simulated gaia survey was generated , with emphasis on the proper combination of the satellite and milky way models , and we present some examples of the simulated gaia data . for details \n we refer to @xcite . \n the milky way model consists of three spatial components : a bulge with a plummer density law , a double exponential disk , and a flattened halo ( @xmath3 ) for which the density drops as @xmath4 . \n the kinematics are modelled in a very simple manner : each component rotates with constant velocity dispersion , for the bulge an isotropic dispersion is assumed , for the disk a different velocity ellipsoid is used for each spectral type ( obafgkm ) , while for the halo the dispersions are the same for each spectral type . \n the individual stars are assigned an absolute magnitude @xmath5 and a colour @xmath6 from a hess - diagram which is considered fixed for all galactic components and all positions throughout the galaxy . \n the hess - diagram is taken from table 47 of @xcite and provides the relative numbers of stars in bins of absolute magnitude ( @xmath5 ) and spectral type . \n these numbers integrated over spectral type provide the luminosity function . \n although this is a highly simplified and certainly not self - consistent model of the galaxy it is good enough for providing the ` background ' distribution in phase space against which the debris streams have to be found .    for a magnitude \n limited survey , as is the case for gaia , a straightforward monte carlo realisation of the galactic model is potentially a very wasteful procedure . \n most simulated stars will be too faint to be included in the survey . \n hence we used a strategy that minimizes wasted effort by generating stars only within the magnitude limited sphere centred on the observer . \n this results in a galaxy model with a luminosity function that is weighted by the space density integrated over the volume limited sphere for each spectral type . \n this luminosity function is shown in fig . \n [ fig : lumfunc ] . \n nevertheless the generation of the monte carlo model is still a large computational task and in order to save time we decided not to simulate the part of the sky within galactic coordinates : @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n tracing the debris streams in this part of the sky will be difficult in practice due to the large extinction in those directions . in our galactic model @xmath9% of the stars \n lie in this region of the sky as seen from the sun for a survey limited at @xmath10 . \n the resulting simulated survey of the galaxy is fully sampled and contains @xmath11 stars . for each of these we generated \n the 6 phase space coordinates ( positions and velocities ) , an absolute magnitude , a population type ( bulge , disk or halo ) and a spectral type . \n the models of the debris streams were generated by simulating the disruption of dwarf galaxies orbiting our galaxy . the milky way is represented by a rigid potential which is derived from a mass - model consisting of : a double exponential disc , a spherical bulge with hernquist profile , and a logarithmic halo potential with flattening @xmath3 . \n the dwarf galaxies are represented by king models @xcite with a mass of @xmath13  m@xmath14 or @xmath15  m@xmath14 and @xmath16 particles . \n the tidal radius and concentration parameter @xmath17 are 3150  pc and @xmath18 , respectively . \n the satellites are placed on five different orbits which vary in apocentre , pericentre and the initial inclination with respect to the milky way s disc . \n the simulations were evolved with a tree - code for @xmath19  gyr . \n multiple debris streams can be simulated by combining different @xmath2-body snapshots ( different orbits and/or ages ) , and each snapshot can be rotated around the @xmath20-axis or flipped with respect to the disc plane . \n two of the orbits for the @xmath2-body satellites are shown in fig .  [ \n fig : satorbits ] . \n all stars of a given dwarf galaxy are assumed to be of the same age . \n masses are drawn from a mass - function and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are derived from a low - metallicity isochrone ( from * ? ? ? \n * ) of the appropriate age . \n the 6 phase space coordinates @xmath21 for each star in the galaxy and satellite model are referred to the solar position and velocity and converted to the 5 astrometric parameters ; position @xmath22 , parallax @xmath23 , proper motions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the radial velocity @xmath26 . \n the conversion is done using the standard prescriptions for transforming cartesian position and velocity coordinates into astrometric parameters and radial velocities , such as described in in volume  1 , section  1.5.6 , of the hipparcos catalogue @xcite . \n the astrometric errors are added as a function of @xmath27 ( gaia broad band magnitude ) and @xmath6 : @xmath28 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 the parallax errors for the simulated gaia data of the milky way model are shown in fig . \n [ fig : parerr ] . the mean position and proper motion errors are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and the variation of the astrometric errors with ecliptic latitude @xmath33 is included . \n the radial velocity errors for oba - type stars are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37  km  s@xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , respectively . for fgkm - type stars the errors are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 km  s@xmath38 at @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath47 . for stars fainter than @xmath48 ( oba ) or @xmath49 ( fgkm ) radial velocities \n are not available . \n these error prescriptions are according to the gaia concept and technology study report @xcite . \n having made a considerable effort to realistically simulate the number of galaxy stars that is expected to be seen by gaia , we want to ensure that the satellite simulations are properly added to the galaxy data . \n this means that the number of satellite particles in our simulated gaia catalogue should be a realistic fraction of the number of galactic particles . getting this right \n is not trivial and we explain our solution to this problem here .    given a certain distribution of stars along the orbit of a particular dwarf galaxy ( corresponding to an @xmath2-body ` snap - shot ' ) , the number of stars from this satellite that will end up in the gaia catalogue depends on three factors : * 1 . \n * the overall number stars ( i.e. , luminous particles ) in the dwarf galaxy . \n this number is determined by its overall luminosity and the stellar mass function . \n the gaia survey limit leads to an upper limit @xmath50 on the absolute magnitude of visible satellite stars . * \n the variation of @xmath50 along the satellite orbit , caused by a variation in distance from the sun .    at each distance @xmath51 where an @xmath2-body particle is located the fraction of visible satellite stars @xmath52 can be calculated : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , while @xmath55 is the mass function and @xmath56 its upper limit . \n the overall fraction @xmath57 of visible @xmath2-body stars is @xmath58 . as fig . \n [ fig : visfrac ] illustrates the overall fraction of visible stars for a fully populated mass function can be very small depending on the distribution of satellite stars along the orbit . \n in addition we are faced with the problem that real dwarf galaxies contain up to @xmath1 stars but our @xmath2-body models contain 1 million particles only . of these ` expensive ' @xmath2-body particles \n we want to waste as little as possible . \n an obvious step is to assume that all n - body particles represent stars that are brighter than the faintest star that can enter the gaia survey given the distance distribution of the @xmath2-body particles . \n this will raise the overall visible fraction @xmath2-body particles as illustrated by the dashed line in fig . \n [ fig : visfrac ] . \n this hints at the following solution : assume that all @xmath2-body particles represent a bright tracer population , such as agb stars . \n that is , @xmath59 for all particles \n . this will further raise the overall visible fraction @xmath57 . \n the details of this procedure are discussed in @xcite where it is shown that depending on the total luminosity ( mass ) of the simulated satellite one can then easily retain the majority of the @xmath2-body particles while still preserving the variation of the visible fraction of tracer stars along the debris stream . \n various methods have been proposed and used to recover satellite remnants from surveys of galactic phase space . \n figure  [ fig : elz ] shows an example of energy vs angular momentum ( @xmath60-@xmath61 ) diagrams . for this figure we combined 18 million stars from the monte carlo model of the galaxy with the satellite models 1 ( at 10  gyr ) and 4 ( at 5  gyr ) . \n the value of @xmath62 is @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . \n keep in mind that the figures under - represent the real contrast between galaxy and satellite . \n we intend to use this work to study in detail the retrieval of debris streams from the gaia catalogue by making use of the accurate phase space data that gaia will provide throughout the galaxy . \n however , as can be appreciated from the @xmath60-@xmath61 diagrams shown in fig . \n [ fig : elz ] it will not be possible to trace complete debris streams based on phase space data alone . fortunately , using the photometric information from gaia will provide astrophysical parameters for the different stellar populations . \n this will enable a drastic narrowing down of the parts of the gaia catalogue that need to be searched . investigating this will require improvements to the simulations . \n the simulation of actual gaia photometry from the broad and medium band photometers is possible using the tools developed at the university of barcelona ( see the contributions by jordi et  al .  and carrasco et  al .  in this volume ) . \n an extinction model can be included in an approximate way using currently available 3d extinction models such as the one presented by drimmel et  al . \n ( this volume ) . \n finally , if in reality the galactic halo has not had time to relax and wipe out the clumpy remnants of past merger events , it will be necessary to replace the smooth halo component in our milky way model with a clumpy one . \n a.b .  thanks everyone at ia -

[ [ priority - vas . ] ] priority vas . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equipping two counters ( in petri - speak , places ) with zero tests , of course , makes vas as powerful as minsky machines and the reachability problem undecidable . \n it has turned out , though , that the mayr - kosaraju - lambert proof can be extended when only one counter may be tested for zero . \n in fact , reinhardt has obtained a highly non - trivial proof of an even more general result : that reachability is decidable for _ pvas _ , where one may test whether all counters from any one of a series of sets @xmath0 are zero @xcite . so far with one zero - testable counter \n , bonnet has succeeded in greatly simplifying reinhardt s proof along the lines of leroux @xcite . \n let us say that pvas whose series of zero - testable sets of counters have length @xmath1 are of _ index _ \n @xmath1 . \n [ [ stack -

return procedures , one may consider intersections of vas languages and context - free languages . for an svas in that alternative presentation , \n let us say that it is of _ index _ \n @xmath1 if and only if the context - free language is of index @xmath1 , i.e.  there is a context - free grammar such that every word in the language has a derivation whose every step contains at most @xmath1 non - terminal symbols . \n atig and ganty have recently shown that finite - index svas are essentially equivalent to pvas : every index-@xmath1 svas can be simulated by an index-@xmath1 pvas , and every index-@xmath1 pvas can be simulated by an index-@xmath2 svas @xcite . \n incidentally , that seems to be the only interesting known relationship among bvas , pvas and svas . \n the reachability problem for finite - index svas is consequently decidable since it is decidable for pvas . \n although decidability for unrestricted svas remains an open question , we make some progress here in the opposite direction , obtaining that the problem is not elementary . \n that puts svas in contrast to bvas , for which decidability is also unknown but so far there is only an elementary lower bound @xcite . \n [ [ coverability . ] ] coverability . \n + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the well - known coverability problem for vas and their extensions corresponds to `` control - state reachability '' : it asks whether a given system can reach a configuration that is pointwise ( i.e. , for each counter ) greater than or equal to a given configuration . \n lipton s and rackoff s classical results show that coverability for vas is expspace - complete @xcite , and by building on those works , demri et al . \n have shown 2exptime - completeness of the problem for bvas @xcite . \n unfortunately , for pvas and svas , there is no hope for such results , since for both classes of systems , there are straightforward reductions of reachability to coverability . \n [ [ variable -

variable first - order logics on data words and data trees . for positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of a data word , \n the logics have navigational predicates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as equality of data labels @xmath7 . on data trees , where variables range over nodes , navigational predicates are either vertical ( `` child '' and `` descendant '' ) , or horizontal ( `` next sibling '' and `` following sibling '' ) , or compare nodes for positions in the pre - traversal ( `` document order '' ) .    on data words , \n bojaczyk et al . \n @xcite showed that the satisfiability problem for such a logic reduces in doubly - exponential time to the reachability problem for vas , and is therefore decidable . \n moreover , they exhibited a polynomial - time converse reduction , and so lipton s lower bound carries over to the logic . \n on data trees , the picture is more complicated . \n already without document order , bojaczyk et al . \n @xcite observed that the satisfiability problem is at least as hard as the reachability problem for bvas ( whose decidability is open ) , but obtained decidability by disallowing also the transitive navigational predicates ( `` descendant '' and `` following sibling '' ) . \n another way of getting decidability was found by bjrklund and bojaczyk : no restrictions on the navigational predicates are required provided the depth of data trees is bounded . with that assumption , they showed how to reduce satisfiability to the reachability problem for pvas . \n an alternative restriction on data trees suggests itself : that data labels be allowed only on leaf nodes . \n although decidability of the full 2-variable fo on such structures remains open , we show that even without the `` descendant '' and `` following sibling '' predicates , satisfiability is at least as hard as the reachability problem for svas , and so is not elementary . \n ( 60,27)(0,-1 ) ( vas)(30,2.5 )    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( vas , bvas ) ( vas , pvas ) ( pvas , svas ) ( vas , vas2 ) ( vas2,vas ) ( bvas , bvas2 ) ( pvas2,pvas ) ( svas , svas2 ) \n it is convenient for our purposes to formalise svas as programs which operate on non - negative counters and a finite - alphabet stack . \n more precisely , we define them as finite sequences of commands which may be labelled , where a command is one of : an increment of a counter ( @xmath8 ) , a decrement of a counter ( @xmath9 ) , a push ( @xmath10 ) , a pop ( @xmath11 ) , a non - deterministic jump to one of two labelled commands ( @xmath12 ) , or termination ( @xmath13 ) . initially , all counters have value @xmath14 and the stack is empty . whenever a decrement of a counter with value @xmath14 or an erroneous pop is attempted , the program aborts . in every program , \n @xmath13 occurs only as the last command . \n the reachability problem can now be stated as follows : given an svas , does it have a computation which reaches the @xmath13 command with all counters being @xmath14 and the stack being empty ? \n the reachability problem for svas is not elementary . \n the proof is by reducing from the @xmath15-bounded halting problem for _ counter programs _ with @xmath16 commands , where :    * for @xmath17 , the _ tetration _ operation @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; * the counter programs are defined like svas , except that they have no stack , have only deterministic jumps ( @xmath21 ) , but can test counters for zero ( @xmath22 ) ; * the @xmath15-bounded halting problem asks whether @xmath13 is reachable by a computation during which all counter values are at most @xmath23 \n .    given such a counter program @xmath24 , we construct in time polynomial in @xmath16 an svas @xmath25 which simulates @xmath24 as long as its counters do not exceed @xmath23 . as in stockmeyer s yardstick construction @xcite , \n the idea is to bootstrap the ability to simulate zero tests of counters that are bounded by @xmath26 , @xmath27 ,  , @xmath23 . \n more precisely , for each counter @xmath3 of @xmath24 , @xmath25 has a pair of counters @xmath3 and @xmath28 , on which it maintains the invariant @xmath29 . \n thus , every increment of @xmath3 in @xmath24 is translated to @xmath30 in @xmath25 , and similarly for decrements . \n for every zero test of @xmath3 in @xmath24 , @xmath25 uses auxiliary counters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for which it also maintains @xmath33 . \n moreover , we assume that @xmath34 at the start of each zero - test simulation . \n the simulation begins by @xmath25 transferring some part of @xmath28 to @xmath31 ( while preserving the invariants ) . \n it then calls a procedure @xmath35 which decrements @xmath31 exactly @xmath23 times . for the latter to be possible , \n @xmath3 must have been @xmath14 . \n otherwise , or in case not all of @xmath28 was transferred to @xmath31 , the procedure can only abort . \n when @xmath35 succeeds , the initial values of @xmath3 and @xmath28 are reversed , so to finish the simulation , everything is repeated with @xmath3 and @xmath28 swapped . \n the main part of the construction is implementing @xmath36 for @xmath37 . assuming that @xmath36 which decrements @xmath38 exactly @xmath39 times and maintains @xmath40 has been implemented for some @xmath41 , @xmath42 consists of performing the following by means of @xmath38 , @xmath43 and @xmath36 :    * push exactly @xmath39 zeros onto the stack ; \n * keep incrementing the @xmath44-digit binary number that is on top of the stack until no longer possible , and decrement @xmath45 for each such increment ; * pop @xmath39 ones that are on top of the stack , and decrement @xmath45 once more .    by a similar pattern , starting with all counters having value @xmath14 \n , @xmath25 can initialise each auxiliary counter @xmath43 to @xmath39 , and each @xmath28 to @xmath23 , as required . \n let _ leaf - data forests _ be data forests in which data labels are present only at leaf nodes . \n more precisely , they are finite forests such that :    * the root nodes are linearly ordered ; * each node is either a leaf , or its children and their descendants form a leaf - data forest ; * each node has a label from a finite alphabet @xmath46 ; * each leaf node also has a label from an infinite domain ( say , @xmath47 ) \n .    now , let fo@xmath48 denote the two - variable first - order logic on leaf - data forests that has the following predicates :    * a unary predicate for each letter from @xmath46 ; * @xmath49 ( @xmath4 is a child of @xmath3 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath4 is the next sibling of @xmath3 ) ; * @xmath51 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are leaves , and @xmath3 precedes @xmath4 in the document order ) ; * @xmath7 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are leaves with the same data label ) . \n the reachability problem for svas is reducible in logarithmic space to the satisfiability problem for fo@xmath48 on leaf - data forests . \n the proof is based on encoding svas computations as leaf - data forests . in the latter , their tree structure is used to represent the evolution of the stack , and data labels are employed for keeping track of counter values .    more concretely , \n suppose @xmath52 is an svas . \n we show how to compute in logarithmic space a sentence @xmath53 of fo@xmath48 whose models are exactly leaf - data forests that encode in the following manner computations of @xmath52 that halt with all counters @xmath14 and the stack empty :    * the computation that such a leaf - data forest encodes can be obtained by traversing the forest so that each internal node is visited once before its children ( generating a push ) and for a second time after its children ( generating the corresponding pop ) ; * each leaf node is labelled either by a jump command , or by an increment or a decrement , and in the latter cases , mutually distinct data labels are used to distinguish among increments of the same counter and to match them to its decrements ; * each internal node is labelled by a pair consisting of a push command and the pop command that corresponds to it in the computation . \n i am grateful to mikoaj bojaczyk and anca muscholl for outlining to me the reduction from svas reachability to fo@xmath48 satisfiability on leaf - data trees .", "StartTimeOffset": 67800432637, "RequestID": "41ce5d23508a40ddbd3ac6ad19b573b6", "TotalTokens": 3800}
{"ContextTokens": 3663, "GeneratedTokens": 113, "SynthesizedBody": "classical and recurrent novae  distinguished by the observation of one or more eruptive events , \n respectively  are thermonuclear runaways ( tnr ) on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) star which ensues following extensive accretion of hydrogen rich material from a less evolved secondary star . \n the ejected material is rich in heavy elements which enrich the interstellar medium ( @xcite , see also gehrz et al . , these proceedings ) . \n the nova eruptions are the most common thermonuclear runaways in the galaxy ( 34@xmath0 novae per year ; @xcite ) and scale with galaxy size ( @xcite ) . \n the infrared temporal evolution of the nova is nicely described in gehrz et al . \n ( these proceedings ) and for detailed reviews on interefometric observations of novae , see chesneau & banerjee ( 2012 ) and chesneau ( 2014 ) . of particular interest , to this work , is that during the initial phases of the eruption the ejected material can be modelled as an optically thick fireball that radiates like a blackbody and as the expansion continues and reduces in density , the infrared continuum becomes dominated by optically thin free - free emission with strong hydrogen re - combination lines on top . \n observations of novae are going through a renaissance over the last decade or so driven by the upgrade of telescopes , instruments , and new discoveries ( see the various contributions in @xcite ) . \n of particular note , the discovery of high energy @xmath1-ray emission ( @xcite ) and pinpointing the location of @xmath1-ray production , from internal shocks due to different velocity components at the equatorial and polar regions ( @xcite ) .    a number of factors are required to be systematically studied across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to understand the evolution of the nova eruption . of paramount importance , in any field of astrophysics , is the distance to an object . in the milky way , \n the distance to novae allow us to derive their spatial distribution in order to understand from which population / s novae arise from \n disc / bulge  and also the occurrence of novae in our galaxy . \n the first observations with an infrared interferometer occurred with nova v1974  cygni ( 1992 ) on the mk iii interferometer ( @xcite ) . the nova was resolved aroudn 10 days after maximum light . fitting a uniform disk model to the data the distance was estimated to be 2.5 kpc , in line with other studies ( @xcite ) . \n there was one more nova - like eruptive event , in v838 mon ( @xcite ) , that was followed with palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) . \n however , this event is largely accepted to have been the merger of two stars . \n it was not until the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi erupted in 2006 that infrared interferometric observations truly come to play . \n rs oph was observed first with the infrared optical telescope array , keck and pti ( @xcite ) , suggesting that the near - infrared emission arose due to a non - expanding , dense , and ionised circumbinary gaseous disk or reservoir . however , lane et al . ( 2007 ) resolve the emission in rs oph using pti providing clear evidence for a near - infrared source that initially expanded and then began shrieking . \n the amber instrument on the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) was also used , on day 5.5 after eruption , to measure the @xmath2-band continuum and the br@xmath1 and hei 2.06 @xmath3 m lines ( @xcite ) . \n the @xmath2-band emission is dominated by free - free emission and had a smaller size than the br@xmath1 and hei lines ( 3x2 mas , 5x3 mas , and 6x4 mas , respectively ) . \n these results were also contrary to monnier et al . \n furthermore , chesneau et al . ( 2007 ) found two velocity fields in the br@xmath1 line ; a slowly expanding ring - like structure ( @xmath4  1800  km  s@xmath5 ) , and a fast structure extended in the e - w direction ( @xmath6  25003000  km  s@xmath5 ) . \n a two velocity component was also required to replicate the hubble space telescope narrow band imaging observations of the resolved remnant , at day 155 after eruption , and the ground - based optical spectroscopy ( @xcite ) . \n lastly , rs oph observations with the keck interferometer nuller , around day 3.8 after eruption , showed evidence for dust that is present in - between eruptions , rather than created during the eruption ( @xcite ) in line with findings from the spitzer space telescope of silicate dust that survives the hard radiation impulse and shock blast wave from the eruption ( @xcite ) . \n other novae have been observed since rs oph with infrared interferometric instruments ; the recurrent nova t  pyxidis ( @xcite ) , the dust forming nova v1280 sco ( @xcite ) , and the @xmath1-ray detected classical nova v339 delphini ( 2013 ; @xcite ) . \n what is clear from the various bodies of work is that the nova eruption is far from spherical , or uniform disks . \n efforts are now under way to understand the progress of the nova eruption from optical to radio observations applying one single model . for example , optical emission line profile fitting of the classical nova v959  mon proved useful in determining , the ejection morphology , inclination angle and the expansion velocity of the ejecta ( @xcite ) . these results are also corroborated with the observations of eclipses at x - ray and optical wavelengths ( @xcite ) and observations of a bipolar ejection morphology at radio frequencies ( @xcite ) . \n lastly , applying the free - free thermal process to the models derived at optical wavelengths above we were able to derive the distance to v959  mon ( @xcite ) .    up to now the observations \n have provided important information on the distances to these objects assuming uniform / gaussian fitting to the visibilities / images when available as well as departure from these morphologies for the ejecta . \n in fact , the distance may also be constrained assuming the blackbody angular radius and doppler expansion velocity which give day of the eruption , the distance and the outburst luminosity ( @xcite and gerzh et al . \n these proceedings ) \n . however , we can extract further information if we assume a thermal free - free emission . \n here we will , also , be able to extract ejected masses , temperature of the ejecta , and density profiles of the ejecta . \n ideally , we would want to combine all this information with other wavelengths , such as optical for the doppler expansion velocity , in order to reduce the amount of free parameters and computational time . \n although the distance is a very important issue , the gaia satellite will largely solve this in the coming years . \n furthermore , a suit of new instruments are to be installed in the vlti which will provide marked improvement , both in resolution and sensitivity ( matisse and gravity ) , over current capabilities . \n the author would like to thank bob gehrz for reading and commenting on the manuscript and christiaan brinkerink for useful discussion on interferometric observations . \n the author also acknowledges financial support from the radboud excellence initiative . \n 99 abdo , a.  a. , ackermann , m. , ajello , m. , et al . \n 2010 , science , 329 , 817 ackermann , m. , ajello , m. , albert , a. , et al . \n 2014 , science , 345 , 554 barry , r.  k. , danchi , w.  c. , traub , w.  a. , et al . \n 2008 , apj , 677 , 1253 bode , m. f. & evans , a.  2008 , editors _ classical novae _ , 2nd edition ( cambridge university press ) chesneau , o.  2014 , in _ stella novae : past and future decades _ , eds . \n p. a. woudt & v. a. r. m. ribeiro , aspcs , vol . \n 490 , 243 chesneau , o. & banerjee , d.  p.  k.  2012 , basi , 40 , 267 chesneau o. , banerjee d. p. k. , millour f. , et al . \n 2008 , a&a , 487 , 223 chesneau o. , clayton g. c. , lykou f. , et al . \n 2009 , a&a , 493 , l17 chesneau , o. , lagadec , e. , otulakowska -

pixel amplification and particle detection by embedding a fet in high - ohmic silicon material . \n the sensor is fully depleted due to sidewards depletion from the backside contact and from the transistor channel jointly . the sidewards depletion and additional implantations close to the detector front side form a laterally confined potential valley underneath the transistor channel . \n this potential valley is called internal gate , derived from the external gate of the transistor . \n electrons generated by impinging radiation drift to the internal gate where they are collected . \n the potential of the internal gate changes due to the collected charge @xmath6 and the transistor current is modulated according to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is called the internal gain of the depfet transistor , equivalent to the transconductance of the external gate @xmath9 . \n finally , the signal charge collected in the internal gate can be determined by measuring the device current . since the readout of the device current does not affect the charge in the internal gate \n , it has to be removed from time to time . \n this is know as the clear of the device and is realized by an additional contact at the pixel fringe ( not shown in figure  [ depfet_principle ] ) . \n the main advantages of the depfet technology are the fully depleted bulk that is used for signal generation and the fact that charge collection is induced by an electric field . \n since the depfet concept relies on a backside contact to provide the fully depletion , new thinning concepts apart from the standard ones used in microchip industry need to be explored to fabricate thin depfets . \n the present approach for thinning depfet modules is based on wafer bonding technology and anisotropic etching . \n the principle has been demonstrated by producing thin diode structures @xcite and will be combined with a large scale depfet pixel production in future . \n the radiation tolerance of the sensor against ionizing radiation has been shown up to a dose of 1mrad using x - rays from a @xmath10 source @xcite . \n a principle sketch of one ladder end proposed for a depfet ilc vertex detector is shown in figure  [ ilc_ladder ] . \n the sensitive area is thinned to @xmath11 m keeping a thicker frame ( @xmath12 m ) for mechanical stability and stiffening of the 100 mm long and 13 mm wide ladder . \n the steering chips for row selection and clearing strobes are situated at the longer side so that the detector is read out row wise to the ladder ends . there \n , readout chips are placed that process all matrix columns in parallel .    concerning the readout of such a depfet ladder , \n new concepts have been explored as well @xcite . \n since the device signal of the depfet is a current , the most natural way is to adapt the signal processing queue to the current operation of the device . \n therefore , current memory cells are used in the readout chip for temporal storage and processing of the signal current . \n the basic principle of operation of such a memory cell @xcite is shown in figure  [ si_cell ] . \n the cell operates as a dynamic current mirror , where transistor m1 works as the input and output stage depending on the setting of the different switches s1-s3 . \n apart from the fact that a direct signal processing without any current to voltage conversion is smart , additional advantages of operating in the current domain exist , upon the most important ones are :    * the voltage sampled at the gate of the transistor m1 in figure  [ si_cell ] is not directly proportional to the signal current . hence , a higher dynamic range compared to a voltage sample and hold can be achieved . \n this is particularly important for emerging process technologies with reduced supply voltage . * the subtraction of two values , as needed for pedestal subtraction , \n can be done very accurate and easily with currents . \n as an intermediate step towards a full scale ilc detector ladder , a prototype system using a depfet pixel matrix has been developed . a schematic overview of the system is given in figure  [ system_overview ] . \n it consists of three major parts : a usb - board , a daq - board and a hybrid - board . \n the usb - board is based on usb2.0 standard and provides the communication between the system and a pc . the hybrid - board hosts the depfet pixel matrix , the steering chips switcher  ii , the readout chip curo  ii and a pair of transimpedance amplifiers ( i2u ) that convert the current outputs of the curo chip to voltage signals . \n the daq - board carries two 14bit adcs for digitization and a sram for data storage . \n integral part of the daq - board is a spartan 3 fpga which provides the configuration of all chips in the system and manages the synchronization between the components during data acquisition . \n an external protection - board can be inserted to safeguard the power supply voltages . \n a photograph of the depfet system is shown in figure  [ system_photo ] . \n figure  [ chip_assembly ] shows a close - up view of the chip assembly on the hybrid - board .    ) \n .,width=302 ]    the @xmath0 pixel depfet matrix is situated in the center . \n the steering strobes for the matrix are provided by two switcher  ii chips @xcite located at both matrix sides . \n the switcher  ii has been fabricated in an ams high voltage process to provide a voltage range of up to 25v , needed to operate some matrix designs . \n the present hybrid uses two steering chips to be very versatile in operating different matrix types . \n recent measurements @xcite show that for some matrix designs only one steering chip is sufficient to take care of matrix steering and clearing .    at the bottom of the matrix \n the 128 channel readout chip curo  ii @xcite is placed . \n this chip is fabricated in a @xmath13 m tsmc process . \n in addition , most of the design already uses radiation tolerant layout rules @xcite . \n it is therefore very likely that the readout chip sustains the radiation dose of 200krad expected after 5 years operation of the ilc . \n whether the present chip already shows a suitable radiation tolerance or if the layout has to be improved further on will be studied in irradiation test . \n one of the main features of the readout chip are on - chip pedestal subtraction and zero suppression . \n the zero suppression is performed by a scanner which scans the binary hit pattern in parallel . \n standalone tests with the present curo  ii chip show that the scanner finds up to two hits in a 128 channel hit pattern with rates of more than 100mhz . \n this is much faster than needed to cope with the expected rates at the ilc . \n the system has been used in the lab for x - ray detection in an energy range from 5.9 up to 44.23kev . \n the capability of spatial detection of x - rays has been demonstrated using a 75@xmath2 m thick tungsten test chart with an engraved logo and several line structures having a pitch of 100 , 75 , 50 and 25@xmath2 m ( from left to right , respectively ) . \n the radiogram of the @xmath142x3@xmath15 large test chart is shown in figure  [ lab_faustlogo ] . \n tungsten test chart taken with @xmath16.,width=302 ]    the test chart has been placed on the backside of the detector and the system has been irradiated with a @xmath17 source . \n the radiogram has been obtained by summing the pulse heights for pixels that contain a signal higher than five times their noise . \n although no spatial reconstruction techniques have been applied to improve the spatial resolution , the 50@xmath2 m lines in the radiogram are clearly visible . to determine the internal gain of the depfet device and to measure the linearity of the system , \n energy spectra have been taken for rubidium ( rb ) , molybdenum ( mo ) , silver ( ag ) , cadmium ( cd ) , barium ( ba ) and terbium ( tb ) , provided by a variable x - ray source @xcite . \n after performing a row - wise common mode correction , clusters are reconstructed by identifying neighboring pixels , where every pixel contains a signal higher than five times its noise . in figure  [ lab_matrixgain ] \n the mean cluster signal as a function of the characteristic x - ray energy is shown . \n -5 mm     from the slope of the system response an internal gain of the depfet sensor of @xmath18 is extracted . the integral - non - linearity ( inl ) of the system is better than 0.8@xmath19 for a dynamic range of 8500@xmath20 . \n this range is large enough for the detection of about 2 mips in a 50@xmath2 m thin sensor device . \n the best noise performance achieved in the lab is around enc=220e@xmath3 at room temperature . \n this number is quite comparable with the calculated noise performance of @xmath21 , where thermal noise is identified as the dominant contribution @xcite . \n however , the total noise needs to be improved by a factor of two to achieve the final aim of around 100e@xmath3 . \n this is within a realistic scope since the bandwidth of the present readout and steering chips have already been designed to cope with the final line rate of 20mhz . \n it is therefore very likely that a future generation of the system with an optimized readout chip and sensors with higher @xmath8 can achieve a noise of 100e@xmath3 . \n the system has been tested for mip detection in the 6gev electron test beam at the desy synchrotron . \n the analysis of the data is done in the following way : after pedestal and common mode corrections , clusters are searched for . \n seeds are identified with a threshold cut of 5@xmath22 . \n the seeds are combined with neighboring pixels if their signal is two times higher than the noise . \n the signal distribution for clusters containing a maximum of @xmath23 pixels is shown in figure  [ tb_signals ] . \n pixels.,width=283 ]    the observed most probable value of about 36000e@xmath3 ( @xmath24adu ) obtained by a landau fit complies with the expected mip signal in a @xmath25 m silicon sensor material . the system noise extracted from the noise peak of the raw data spectrum \n is found to be @xmath26adu . \n this combines to a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath27 . \n the observed noise figure in the test beam ( @xmath28 ) is higher than the one achieved in the lab . \n it turned out that the connection node between readout chip and transimpedance amplifier is very sensitive for pick - up . \n hence , the system noise depends on different operating parameters . a future version of the readout chip implementing either a transimpedance amplifier or a current mode adc is expected to overcome this . \n figure  [ tb_clustersize ] shows the cluster size distribution . \n -5 mm   pixels.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    the most probable cluster contains about 5 pixels only . \n the relatively small clusters are due to the fact that charge collection in the depfet is done by an electric field and not by thermal diffusion . also shown in figure  [ tb_clustersize ] is the cluster size distribution for inverse signals . \n this event distribution is obtained by inverting the signals and repeating the analysis . \n it is very likely that the inverted signals are due to out - of - time events . \n furthermore , efficiency and purity for track reconstruction have been studied . \n a four plane telescope system is used to determine the particle tracks . \n clusters are searched in the depfet matrix within an area of @xmath29pixels around the predicted track position . \n the efficiency is defined as the ratio of clusters found in the fiducial depfet area and the corresponding tracks identified by the telescope system . \n figure  [ tb_efficiency ] shows the efficiency as a function of the seed cut threshold . \n -5 mm     the observed inefficiency in the order of 0.3% is mostly due to multiple scattering effects in the low energy electron beam . \n ( note , that clusters are detected in a relatively small area of @xmath302 pixels . ) to reduce multiple scattering effects , only very stiff tracks are selected for the analysis by applying a high @xmath31 probability cut of 0.9995 . \n this enhances the efficiency to almost .    the purity defined as the ratio of found good clusters and all clusters is shown in figure  [ tb_purity ] as a function of the seed cut . \n -5 mm     the main result of the efficiency and purity study is that an operation at almost 100% purity and efficiency is achieved by choosing a seed cut of @xmath32 . \n note , that this threshold corresponds to only @xmath33 of a mip signal . \n a prototype system for the ilc vertex detector based on depfet pixels has been developed . \n the system has been successfully used for x - ray and mip detection . \n the current benchmarks of the system are :      concerning position resolution , the present test beam data yields an upper limit of @xmath34 m dominated by multiple scattering effects . \n a more precise measurement will be performed in the high energy test beam at cern in summer 2006 .    to achieve the final ilc specifications the system still needs improvements . \n most importantly , the line rate needs to be increased by a factor of 10 . \n the single components of the systems have already been tested up to a line rate of more than 20mhz , whereas their synchronization in the system needs further optimization . moreover \n , the noise performance has to be improved by a factor of two . based on calculations and the experience with the present system , we are very confident that this will be achieved with the next version of depfet sensors and readout chip .    as a next step , \n new generations of all system components are designed and fabricated . \n large depfet matrices with up to @xmath35 pixels are in production . \n the pixel size is reduced to @xmath36 and the internal gain of the sensor is optimized .    a new steering chip using a standard , low voltage process is designed . \n some depfet designs having a so called _ cleargate structure _ can be cleared at much lower voltages than offered by the present steering chip . \n hence , the use of a submicron process is possible here as well . \n this promises a much better radiation tolerance compared to the present chip using a high voltage technology . \n a new generation of the readout chip is designed as well . \n operating the system with a duty cycle as close as possible to the bunch timing of the accelerator ( 1:199 ) will reduce the total power consumption significantly . \n hence , one of the most important conceptual extension of the readout chip will be a power down feature . \n on a longer time scale , a major step is to combine the thinning technology with a depfet production in order to fabricate thin depfet sensors . \n together with the aimed noise figure of enc=100e@xmath3 , a signal - to - noise ratio of 40 is expected for these thin devices . \n the authors would like to thank the technology crew of pnsensor gmbh and the semiconductor laboratory at the mpi munich supporting the depfet fabrication , and uli ktz and norbert meyners for the invaluable support at desy . \n m. trimpl ( 2005 ) : `` design of a current based readout chip and development of a depfet pixel prototype system for the ilc vertex detector '' , phd thesis bonn -

board the 1 . 0 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio , chile ) , in the nights of december 15 to 16 , 2004 . with a pixel size of @xmath12 , and a ccd size of 512 @xmath13 512 pixels , \n this samples a @xmath14 field in the sky . \n + the details of the observations are listed in table  1 where the observed fields are reported together with the exposure times , the average seeing values and the range of air -

41 , pg  0231 + 051 , rubin  149 , rubin  152 , t  phe and sa  98 - 670 ( see table  1 for details ) . \n the calibration equations turned out of be of the form : + @xmath15 + @xmath16 + @xmath17 , + where @xmath0 are standard magnitudes , @xmath18 are the instrumental ones and @xmath19 is the airmass ; all the coefficient values are reported in table  2 . \n the standard stars in these fields provide a very good color coverage . \n the final _ r.m.s . \n _ of the calibration are 0.049 , 0.034 and 0.033 for the b , v and i filter , respectively . \n photometric errors have been estimated following @xcite . \n it turns out that stars brighter than @xmath20 mag have internal ( allstar output ) photometric errors lower than 0.10  mag in magnitude and lower than 0.18  mag in color . \n the final photometric catalog for whiting  1 ( coordinates , b , v and i magnitudes and errors ) consists of 1757 stars and are made available in electronic form at the webda site maintained by j .- \n c . mermilliod . \n @xcite report a preliminary estimate of whiting  1 diameter amounting to 1.2 arcmin . by inspecting fig \n 1 we can recognize that dias et al . estimate is surely a reasonable one . + since our photometry covers entirely the clusters area and part of the surroundings , we performed star counts to obtain an improved estimate of the clusters size . \n + we derived the surface stellar density by performing star counts in concentric rings around the clusters nominal center and then dividing by their respective surfaces . \n poisson errors have also been derived and normalized to the corresponding surface . \n poisson errors in the field star counts turned out to be very small , and therefore we are not going to show them . the final radial density profile for whiting  1 is shown in fig .  2 as a function of v magnitude . \n the contribution of galactic disk field has been estimated by considering all the stars in the corresponding magnitude bin , located outside 1.6 arcmin from the cluster center , and by normalizing counts over the adopted area . \n + the cluster seems to be populated by stars of magnitude in the range @xmath21 , where it clearly emerges from the background . in this magnitude \n range the radius is not larger than 0.5 arcmin . in conclusion \n , we are going to adopt the value of 0.5 arcmin as whiting  1 radius throughout this paper . \n this estimate is in good agreement with the value of 1.2 arcmin reported by @xcite for the cluster diameter . \n in fig . 3 we present the cmds of whiting  1 for all the detected stars . in the left panel of the same figure \n we show the cmd in the @xmath22 vs @xmath23 plane , whereas in the right panel we show the cmd in the @xmath22 vs @xmath24 plane . \n these cmds are not very easy to be interpreted , due to the faintness of the stars . \n however we can recognize a wide main sequence ( ms ) in both the cmds , extending from @xmath25 , where the turn off point ( to ) is located down to @xmath26 . \n the upper part of the cmd is more confused . \n it seems that a sub - giant branch ( sgb ) is actually present , and that the red giant branch ( rgb ) starts rising at @xmath27 , @xmath28 . \n the rgb however is poorly populated . \n a group of stars at @xmath29 , @xmath30 may indicate the presence of a clump . \n + better information can be derived from fig .  4 , where we show the cmds of whiting  1 as a function of the distance from the cluster nominal center . \n here we consider only stars having errors in v - band lower than 0.15 mag ( see sect .  2 ) . \n in the left panel all the stars are plotted , whereas in the middle panel we only plot the stars which lie within the cluster radius ( see sect  3 ) . \n finally , in the right panel we plot the stars outside the cluster region , to show how the galactic field toward the cluster looks like . \n + interestingly , the ms in the middle panel gets much thinner , and we can locate the to at @xmath31 , @xmath32 . the rgb is scarcely populated and the presumed clump disappears . \n most of the stars in the left panel located in the rgb region and in the red edge of the ms come from the field shown in the right panel . in conclusion , \n the overall shape of the cmd in the middle panel is reminiscent of an old cluster . \n in this section we provide estimates of whiting  1 basic parameters . + we start deriving a first guess of the cluster reddening by using firb maps by @xcite . \n we obtain e(b - v ) = 0.026 , a very low value as expected for a cluster located at high galactic latitude . \n + at this point , since we do not have any other information , we have to rely on a detailed comparison between the cmd morphology and theoretical isochrones . in the following analysis we are going to adopt the padova isochrones ( @xcite ) . \n + in fig .  5 and 6 we play with age and metallicity , trying to encounter the best overall fit of the cmd . + in details , in fig .  5 we keep the metallicity fixed to z=0.001 and change the age from 3.8 to 5.6 gyrs \n . in both the cmd the best fit \n is provided by the age of 4.8 gyrs ( dashed - dotted line ) which implies a reddening e(b - v)= 0.04 and e(v - i)=0.05 . \n the older isochrone ( 5.6 gyr ) implies an untenable e(b - v ) = 0.00 , or slightly negative , while the youngest one ( 3.8 gyr ) implies a reddening e(b - v ) = 0.12 , which is still acceptable , but the overall fit of the red part of the cmd looks very poor . + on the other hand , in fig . \n 6 we keep the age of 4.8 gyr fixed and play with metallicity . in this case \n the best fit is provided by z=0.001 . \n the fit with a lower metal abundance is not so bad as well , while the larger metallicity isochrone poorly fits the cmd and implies a negative reddening . \n + from this exercise we infer that the cluster metal abundance is around z=0.001 and the age around 5 gyrs . \n the best fit is therefore outlined in fig .  7 , and from this we derive a distance modulus @xmath33=18.4 and a reddening e(b - v)=0.04 . \n as a consequence , we obtain a heliocentric distance of about 45 kpc . \n the results we achieved are listed in detail in table  3 . \n we have presented the first ccd @xmath0 photometric study of the star cluster whiting  1 . \n the cmds we derive allow us to infer estimates of the cluster basic parameters , which are summarized in table  3 . \n + in detail , we find that :          the combination of age , position and metallicity makes whiting  1 a very puzzling object . \n + we can rule put the hypothesis of an old open cluster , because of the low metal content , and mostly beacuse of its positions . \n + the cluster bears some similarities with palomar  1 ( @xcite ) , an 8 gyr old globular cluster , and other transitional clusters like terzan  7 , ruprech  106 and others mentioned in @xcite . + following the kind of discussion by @xcite \n , we here tentatively propose that whiting  1 is the milky way youngest globular cluster insofar known , although a clear explanation for its formation and evolution remains very challenging . \n dias w.s . , \n alessi b.s . \n , moitinho a. , lepine j.r.d . , 2002 ,   389 , 871 girardi l. , bressan a. , bertelli g. , chiosi c. , 2000 ,   141 , 371 landolt a.u . , 1992 ,   104 \n , 340 patat f. , carraro g. , 2001 ,   325 , 1591 rosenberg a. , saviane i. , piotto g. , aparicio a. , zaggia s. , 1998 ,   115 , 648 schlegel , d. , finkbeiner , d. , & davis , m. ,  , 1998 , 500 , 525 . \n stetson p.b . \n 1987 ,   99 , 191 whiting a.b . , hau g.k.t . \n , irwin m. , 2002 ,   141 , 123", "StartTimeOffset": 80058258008, "RequestID": "56d51c60aa0541778a18a96f02fe2939", "TotalTokens": 3030}
{"ContextTokens": 2052, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "one hundred years after their discovery the properties of uhecr , the most energetic particles in the universe , remain still uncertain . \n their sources , nature and acceleration and propagation mechanisms are nowadays some of the major open questions in astrophysics . \n a great effort has being carried out with experiments such as hires  @xcite and agasa  @xcite and at present the pierre auger observatory  @xcite to acumulate statistics in a energy region ( well above 1 eev ) where the rate of events is extremely low due to the suppression of the flux , recently observed and confirmed  @xcite , when uhecr interact with the cosmic microwave radiation .    when an uhecr interacts with an atmospheric molecule it developes an extensive air shower ( eas ) . \n the particles in the shower deposit part of the energy carried by the primary in the atmosphere through ionization , resulting in a free electron plasma . \n microwave emission due to the molecular bremsstrahlung of free - electron collisions with the neutral molecules of the atmosphere has been measured in a particle accelerator and could be used to detect air showers @xcite . \n a cosmic ray detector based on this technique would provide calorimetric measurement of the primary energy and a direct measurement of the maximum development   @xmath0 , main advantages of the fluorescence detectors used at present in cosmic ray experiments . \n this technique has also a nearly 100% duty cycle , as surface detectors sampling the shower at ground level , and very little atmospheric attenuation . \n the midas experiment , a prototype detector to characterize this microwave emission , has been recently commissioned at the university of chicago . \n design , specifications of the electronic components , a description of the implemented trigger logic , and preliminary test results are discussed below . \n the main goal of the midas experiment is to detect and characterize the microwave emission from eas . for this purpose , \n we have built a wide field of view telescope with a camera of 53 channels of 0.8 ghz bandwidth in the 4 ghz microwave band . \n the center of the camera is located at the focus of a 4.5 m diameter parabolic antenna . \n each channel is equipped with a c - band commercial satellite television receiver , i.e. a combination of feed horn , low noise amplifier , and frequency down converter . \n the signal from each of these receivers is then transformed to a voltage level using a fast power detector with logarithmic response to the input rf power . the dc output signal ( ranging from 0.5 - 2.1 v ) is continuously digitized in custom 14-bit 20 mhz analog - to - digital converters ( adc ) modules . \n digital samples are processed locally with on - board field programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) , where a trigger logic allows discrimination of events . \n a trigger master board is used to synchronize all adc boards , and to generate a global trigger . \n it provides a system clock for simultaneous sampling and receives the local trigger from each adc board via front lvds - panel connections . after a trigger , \n a 100 microsecond time stream of data ( 25 @xmath1s corresponding to data before the trigger ) is packed and buffered for readout via a vme back panel and stored for later analysis . a vme gps module ( hytec 2092 ) \n is also used for precise timing information . \n the 53 receiver channels are serviced by 4 identical adc boards . on - board fpgas \n allow local data analysis , based on a trigger level system developed to select candidate events . \n the trigger system is based on the same principles as the one used for the fluorescence detector of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite . \n a first level trigger ( flt ) at the channel level , has been designed to identify peaks in the fadc trace . \n the flt information of all channels is then sent to the trigger master board to perform a second level trigger ( slt ) at the level of the whole camera . \n if the slt condition is satisfied , the system trigger pulse is send to the 4 adc boards for the readout . \n these first and second level trigger conditions are implemented as follows :    flt : a channel is marked as triggered if the running sum of 20 consecutive bins exceeds an adjustable threshold . \n this status is extended for 10 @xmath1s to allow coincidences between channels in subsequent trigger requirements . \n the threshold is continuously regulated to compensate the changing background conditions and to ensure a constant trigger rate per channel of 100 hz . \n the procedure is illustrated in figure [ fig : flt ] . \n slt : the flt information is sent to the master trigger board where another on - board fpga is used to evaluate trigger conditions at the level of the whole camera . the slt block is designed to search for 4-fold patterns of flt channels compatible with an uhecr shower track . \n a slt rate of much less than 1 hz is expected from random coincidences . \n high level trigger conditions have been also developed to deal with the different background conditions . \n for example , the threshold regulation and data acquisition are inhibited when slt rate is higher than a certain limit . \n the daq system is continuosly monitoring the data conditions by recording each second an average baseline ( over 10 ms ) for each channel , the instantaneous threshold and flt rate . figure [ fig : sun ] shows the temporal evolution of the baseline for the central channel of the camera with the adjustable threshold for the same period . \n as it can be observed , the threshold reproduces accurately the baseline profile . \n the large peak shown in the plot is originated by the sun passing through the field of view of the feed . \n the fast peaks in the figure are noise bursts , possible induced by aircrafts , which reduce significantly the duty cycle of the experiment . \n an absolute calibration of the antenna is provided by the sun , whose emission in the frequency of interest is measured every day by several radiotelescopes around the world . \n figure [ fig : sun ] shows the signal in adc counts generated by the sun crossing the field of view of the central channel of the camera . \n the system temperature can then be derived from the difference in adc counts between the peak induced by the sun and the baseline . a patch antenna located at the center of the 4.5 m dish \n is used to generate rf signals of known intensity , thus performing a relative calibration of the individual feed channels . \n also , it allows the study of the relative timing , which was found to be well below the 50 ns sampling .      up to now \n , the telescope has been taking data in stable conditions during 40 days with an average event rate of 0.5 hz . \n a prelimary analysis suggests that data are dominated by noise , both the expected uncorrelated random noise and correlated noise due to fast transient events of unknown origin . \n all channels present a good long term stability with baseline fluctuations smaller than 1 db . physics event search is still in progress . \n events simulations have been also carried out including the measured values of the detector calibration , the noise level and the microwave emission scaled from the laboratory measurements . \n the midas experiment has been assembled and commissioned between october 2009 and february 2010 at the university of chicago . \n the first period of data taking has been focused on the understanding of the detector and of the noise conditions . \n the sensitivity of the prototype was found to be adequate for detection of uhecr . \n some improvements are being implemented to increase the duty cycle to close to 100% . in order to crosscheck candidate events with already established detection techniques , \n we foresee the operation of midas at the southern auger observatory . \n r.  u.  abbasi _ et al . _ [ hires collaboration ] , astrophys . \n j.  * 622 * ( 2005 ) 910 . n.  chiba _ et al . \n meth . a*311 * ( 1992 ) 338 . \n j.  abraham _ et al . _ \n [ pierre auger collaboration ] , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 523 * ( 2004 ) 50 . \n r.  abbasi _ et al . _ \n [ hires collaboration ] , phys . \n * 100 * ( 2008 ) 101101 . \n j.  abraham _ et al . _ \n [ pierre auger collaboration ] , phys . \n * 101 * ( 2008 ) 061101 . \n p.  w.  gorham _ et al . \n rev . d*78 * ( 2008 ) 032007 . \n pierre auger collaboration , `` pierre auger project technical design report '' .", "StartTimeOffset": 84645353102, "RequestID": "eef9c8052f9448fb841fae19f9202e0c", "TotalTokens": 2237}

( 2007 ) ) observed with the 8 micron irac camera on the spitzer space telescope yielded the most precise times of transit and secondary eclipse for any extrasolar planet , 6 and 24 seconds , respectively . \n this led us to propose to observe an additional six transits and eclipses of this system over time with the goal of measuring :    * precise transit - timing ( ( * ? ? ? * agol et al . \n 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * holman & murray 2005 ) ) to search for the presence of resonant ( or near - resonant ) terrestrial - mass planets captured by migration ( ( * ? ? ? \n * e.g.  mandell , raymond & sigurdsson 2007 ) ) or on longer timescales precession of an eccentric orbit ( ( * ? ? ? \n * miralda - escud 2002 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * heyl & gladman 2007 ) ; also fabrycky and wolfe , these proceedings ) ; * variations in the depth of the secondary eclipses with time which might be caused by large - scale variable atmospheric features ( ( * ? ? ? \n * rauscher et al . 2007 ) ; also showmand and dobbs - dixon , these proceedings ) ; * precise transit depth for comparison with atmospheric - absorption models to contrain the molecular composition ( ( * ? ? ? \n * e.g. tinetti et al . \n 2007 ) ; also tinetti et al . \n , fortney et al . , and hubeny et al . , these proceedings \n ) ; * improved system parameters for better characterization of the planet , host - star , and orbit properties ( ( * ? ? ? \n * winn et al .  ( 2007 ) ) ; also winn , these proceedings ) \n .    for librating planets in a low - order mean motion resonance , the times of transit vary with an amplitude : @xmath0 and libration period of @xmath1 where @xmath2 are masses of the earth , jupiter , and host star , @xmath3 is the period of the transiting planet , and the numbers have been estimated for the libration amplitude for planets starting on circular orbits with exact commensurability ( * ? ? ? \n * ( agol et al .  2005 ) ) ; the actual value depends on the libration amplitude . \n this timescale requires observations separated by months with @xmath4 seconds precision in timing , and in principle could be sensitive to sensitive to mars mass planets . \n so far spitzer has observed four transits and four secondary eclipses of hd  189733 for this program with 44,000 exposures of 0.4 second each over 5 hours each . \n additionally we re - analyzed the data from ( * ? ? ? \n * knutson et al .  ( 2007 ) ) . \n we utilized the irac 8 microns as it has been demonstrated to be the most stable irac band . due to the brightness of the host star we made the observations in sub - array mode . \n we carried out aperture photometry with a 3.5 pixel radius . due to the small limb - darkening , stable instrument ( thanks to the earth - trailing orbit of spitzer which leads to stable thermal properties and no occultation of targets by the earth , as occurs with hst ) we obtained 0.5% precision per 0.4 second exposure . in the shot - noise limit \n we expect a 3-second precision for transit times . \n figure [ fig01 ] shows a gallery of the transits and secondary eclipses obtained . the strong  ramp \" which causes the flux to change by about 1% is a well known feature of the irac camera when observing bright sources . \n we fit the ramp with the function @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the start of the observation and @xmath7 are constants . \n this appears to remove any trace of the ramp in the corrected data . \n we assign each data point an error bar which equals the scatter in residuals of the data outside of transit / eclipse . \n in two initial fits we include one ephemeris for the transits , one ephemeris for the secondary eclipses , and required all other parameters describing the transits and eclipses to be the same for all 10 transits / eclipses to determine their mean values . \n we performed one of these fits with stellar limb - darkening set to zero , while for a second fit we allowed the linear coefficient of the stellar limb - darkening to freely vary ( in all cases we assume the planet to be uniform in surface brightness ) . \n we allowed the ramp parameters to vary independently for each transit / eclipse . \n a sum of the five transits corrected for the ramp is shown in figure [ fig02a](a ) without limb darkening , and figure [ fig02b](b ) with limb darkening . \n the five secondary eclipses are shown in figure [ fig02c ] .    without limb darkening we find a best - fit @xmath8 for 231508 degrees of freedom ( 231516 data points with 8 model parameters ) . with linear limb darkening the @xmath9 \n improves by @xmath10 for 231507 degrees of freedom , with a best - fit limb darkening parameter of @xmath11 ; thus limb - darkening is detected at 12@xmath12 - this can be seen by eye by comparing figures [ fig02a](a ) and [ fig02b](b ) . \n this best - fit value for limb - darkening gives a limb - darkening profile which is very close to that predicted by a kurucz model with parameters appropriate for hd  189733a ( effective temperature @xmath13 k and surface gravity @xmath14 = 4.5 $ ] ) . \n we find a best - fit planet - star radius ratio of @xmath15 , which translates into a best - fit area ratio of @xmath16% , while the best - fit eclipse depth is @xmath17% - note that this is a 72@xmath12 detection of a secondary eclipse ! the errors on these parameters ( and throughout the rest of the paper ) are computed by generating one hundred synthetic data sets from the best fit light curve ( for each model ) added to the residuals shifted by a random number of data points , re - fitting the model to each synthetic data set , and then taking the standard deviation of the 100 synthetic parameter sets to determine each parameter s error . \n we have measured the best - fit ephemeris to our data , separately for the transits and eclipses . \n we find a transit ephemeris of @xmath18 hjd and @xmath19 days , while for the eclipses we find @xmath20 hjd and @xmath21 days , assuming that they occur exactly one half period after primary transit . \n the periods are consistent within @xmath22 , while the central eclipse times differ by @xmath23 seconds , indicating that the secondary eclipses occur later . \n about 31 seconds of this difference can be accounted for by the light travel time across the system , while the other 26 seconds is likely due to a slight orbital eccentricity . \n we have performed a second set of fits allowing the central times of transit / secondary eclipse to vary . \n the transit timing variations are plotted in figure [ fig03 ] for the transits and secondary eclipses , compared to the best - fit transit ephemeris ( and assuming the secondary eclipse is offset by 1/2 an orbit ) . \n we find no significant deviations from a uniform period by more than 5 seconds for either the transits or secondary eclipses ; once the final four data sets are obtained we will carry out a more detailed analysis . \n poster 79 by miller - ricci and poster 87 by neale gibson at this iau symposium also present new transit - timing data for this system . \n in a third set of fits we held the ephemerides fixed , but allowed the depths of secondary eclipse to vary . \n figure [ fig04 ] shows the variations in the five observed eclipse depths in units of the flux of the star . \n we find that the fractional variations in the eclipse depth are smaller than about 10% ; this is about the level of variation predicted by ( * ? ? ? \n * rauscher et al .  ( 2007 ) ) . \n a fit to the eclipse depths assuming a constant depth gives a @xmath24 for 4 degrees of freedom ( 5 eclipses minus one free - parameter , the mean eclipse depth ) . \n once the final two secondary eclipse observations are obtained ( in june and july 2008 ) , a more comprehensive analysis will be carried out of the limits on secondary eclipse depth variation . \n the depth of primary transit we have obtained contains five times as much data as that in ( * ? ? ? \n * knutson et al .  ( 2007 ) ) , providing more precise constraints on the spectral energy distribution in the mid - infrared . \n we have combined this data point with transit depths measured by ( * ? ? ? \n * pont et al .  ( 2008 ) ) in the optical with hst , ( * ? ? ? \n * swain et al .  ( 2008 ) ) in the near - infrared with hst , ( * ? ? ? \n * beaulieu et al .  ( 2008 ) ) at 3.6 and 5.8 microns with irac , and ( * ? ? ? \n * knutson et al .  ( 2008 ) ) at 24 microns with mips ( also knutson et al . , these proceedings ) . \n the data are plotted in figure [ fig05 ] along with the best - fitting model of ( * ? ? ? \n * tinetti et al .  ( 2007 ) ) which does not have enough methane to fit the near - infrared data . \n we find that our 8 micron data point lies above the tinetti model ; as the 8 micron band covers a region in which methane absorption is quite strong ( @xmath25 @xmath26 per molecule ) , the model may be brought back into agreement with the data with a higher abundance of methane , as is already required by the near - infrared data ( ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * swain et al .  2008 ) ) . \n it also clear that the model is a poor fit to the optical data ; the fit may be improved by including rayleigh scattering ( lecavelier des etanges et al . \n 2008 , and these proceedings ) . \n error bars.,width=491 ] \n the five transits we have observed are consistent with no transit timing variations greater than 5 seconds . \n the five secondary eclipses are consistent with no eclipse depth variations at greater than the 10% level . from just an analysis of the lightcurves \n we can place constraints on the eccentricity and longitude of periastron : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; similar to the results of ( * ? ? ? \n * winn et al .

{"ContextTokens": 3201, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "with ever increasing global population and even faster densification of various large metropolitan areas of the world , mass transit systems are becoming more important . \n improved transit systems are also important for keeping personal cars off of congested road networks , thus addressing climate change concerns and making future switch to cleaner energy source easier . \n urban planners are hard at work designing faster , cheaper , safer and more comfortable transit systems . \n most often local and federal governments are in charge of building transit systems . \n if we view transit systems as a public utility then this government control is reasonable . \n but it also means that there is almost no competition in most cities . \n it is widely believed that for most businesses competition may improve efficiency and quality of service . \n one area where fierce competition has helped reduce inefficiencies is electronic capital markets . global stock exchanges and market places \n are more at sync and bid - ask spreads are low . \n one core principle that guides such optimization is the elimination of arbitrage or riskless profit making \n .    the goal of this paper is to investigate whether there are pricing inefficiencies in mass transit systems that can lead to arbitrage and ask how we can improve transit fares for commuters . as a case study we looked at san francisco bay area rapid transit ( bart ) system , which is the fifth largest transit system by ridership in the us . \n we also took a cursory look at washington dc metrorail , which is the second largest system in the us . \n a motivating example is the case when one individual is traveling from millbrae station , a suburb south of san francisco , to embarcadero station which is downtown san francisco , and at the same time a second individual is traveling from glen park station , a residential area in san francisco , to berkeley station where university of california berkeley is located . \n the two tickets cost ( according to http://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/bart%202014%20fare%20chart_tab.pdf[2014 fare chart ] ) $ 4.50 and $ 4.20 respectively . \n but if during the segment between glen park station and embarcadero station the two travelers agree to exchange their tickets the cost becomes $ 5.10 and $ 1.85 . \n so from a total cost of $ 8.70 a simple ticket swap saves $ 1.75 or 20% . \n another similar example comes from washington dc metrorail . \n if one individual is traveling from vienna / fairfax station to metro center station on the orange line and another individual is traveling from rosslyn station to new carrollton station on the same train then during peak hours they pay $ 5.3 and $ 4.9 . \n but if the travelers decide to swap tickets they pay $ 5.75 and $ 2.1 instead \n . so the saving is $ 2.35 or 23% of total trip cost .    in the following sections we discuss general conditions for arbitrage and how those are reflected in real systems like bart \n in this paper we use the phrase _ fare arbitrage _ as the scenario where two individuals traveling separately have overlapping routes and may agree to exchange tickets to decrease the total price of their trips . higher order arbitrage where more than two travelers decide to exchange tickets \n is not considered here . \n fig  [ fig : transit - diagram ] shows a transit route from station a to d via stations b and c. suppose one traveler is going from station a to c while another traveler is going from station b to d. between stations b and c both travelers are on the same train . \n if they choose to swap tickets the transit system will see one traveler going from station a to d while another from b to c. if the total price of latter two tickets is less than the actual trips then there is fare arbitrage . \n the reverse case could also be true  if two travelers going from a to d and b to c respectively have to pay higher price than a to c and b to d then arbitrage becomes possible . \n one simple pricing method that is quite common is to have a fixed fare for all trips . \n large transit systems such as new york city and chicago have such flat rates . \n although this method eliminates fare arbitrage , it may only be feasible for a city with a large population , high density and high fraction of citizens using the service for daily commute . \n another common strategy is to use a price proportional to distance traveled . \n this fair pricing model is showed as the grey line in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] . \n san francisco bay area caltrain system breaks up the route into zones and uses prices that are proportional to the number of zones traveled . like the flat rate method \n , this pricing strategy also eliminates fare arbitrage . \n but it may not be optimal for revenue maximization if the transit system is complex and population density is non - uniform . \n it may also not be ideal if policy makers wish to change population density by encouraging people to move closer to city center or farther out . \n attempts to explain these curves using population density . ]    going back to the example in fig  [ fig : transit - diagram ] let us assume that the individual going from station a to c is traveling distance @xmath0 while the individual going from station b to d is traveling distance @xmath1 . \n suppose @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n let us assume @xmath4 is the fare as a function of distance . \n we can express the arbitrage condition as follows . \n @xmath5    if @xmath6 and our two travelers swap their tickets during their trip , they get a discount worth @xmath7 . \n this scenario is possible if the fare function has a concave shape , as shown by the blue curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] .    in fig \n [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] the blue curve is above the fair grey line . \n this implies short distances are penalized to maxmize transit revenue . if the blue line had the same concave shape but were below the grey line then short distances are fair but long distances are subsidized .    if @xmath8 then a pair of travelers where one is traveling from a to d and the other from b to c can get a discount of @xmath9 if they choose to swap tickets mid trip . \n convex price functions such as the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] give rise to such arbitrage . \n since the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] is below the grey line , short distances are subsidized but long distances are fair . \n a similar convex curve above the grey line would mean short distances are fair but long distances are penalized . \n hypothetical population density scenarios related to price functions in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] are shown in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] . in the top diagram \n a ( blue ) transit line starts and ends in sparse suburbs and passes through a dense region . in this case revenue can be increased by following the blue concave curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] where there is an extra charge to enter the dense region .    in the bottom diagram of fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] the ( red ) transit line connects two dense regions , with sparse area in between . in this case revenue \n is maximized if fares follow a convex curve similar to the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] but above the grey fair price line . \n both these scenarios are likely in real world and both give rise to fare arbitrage . \n intuitively , the top diagram in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] should match global structure of most metropolitan areas . \n san francisco bart and washington dc metrorail does indeed resemble this . \n but we also see evidence of smaller instances of the bottom diagram of fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] in some part of the transit system . \n san francisco bay area rapid transit ( bart ) is the fifth largest transit system in the us with almost half a million riders on average on a weekday . \n fig  [ fig : bart - map ] shows a simplified diagram of bart with denser areas in ovals . \n five routes of bart according to fig  [ fig : bart - map ] are shown in table  [ tab : bart - routes ] . \n four out of the five routes pass through dense san francisco city , cross the bay tunnel ( thick line in fig  [ fig : bart - map ] ) , then through dense oakland and end in suburban areas . \n the other route is the richmond - fremont line which passes through oakland . \n all five routes resemble the top diagram of population scenario in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] .    . \n the thick line between san francisco city and oakland represents the bay tunnel . ] \n fig  [ fig : millbrae - richmond ] shows fares from millbrae towards richmond at various stations as a function of number of stops . \n we notice that the region between station 3 and station 7 corresponds to the steep price of entering san francisco city . once inside downtown san francisco fares from millbrae \n are flat until the bay tunnel is crossed . \n there is a small bump between station 12 and station 14 to enter oakland . beyond oakland fare increases roughly linearly . \n .bart routes in fig  [ fig : bart - map ] . \n [ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : bart - arbitrage ]    the first two rows in table  [ tab : bart - arbitrage ] are due to the higher price commuters have to pay when they travel from san francisco to oakland compared to commuters who have started outside san francisco and already paid a high price to enter the city . \n someone going from san francisco airport to embarcadero can swap tickets with someone from balboa park and leverage the lower price to cross into oakland . \n the last two rows in table  [ tab : bart - arbitrage ] are due to increased fares near the end of the routes shown in fig  [ fig : millbrae - richmond ] and fig  [ fig : richmond - fremont ] . \n this is similar to the red convex curve in fig  [ fig : dist -

crystal structures @xcite . \n these structures emerge in various _ processes of self - assembly _ , most of which utilize liquid degrees of freedom and nonequilibrium methods @xcite . \n the gold nanoparticles are often used due to the property that their surfaces can be _ \n functionalized _ in an appropriate manner . \n the functionalization of the nanoparticle surfaces has effects on their interactions @xcite . in the case of nanoaprticle films on substrate assembled by the liquid evaporation @xcite the thiol - passivated nanoparticles where used , where the attached chains determine the minimum distance between two neighbouring nanoparticles . \n another way to induce desired interaction between two nanoparticles was designed recently with attaching the pieces of biologically compatible strands of dna molecules to different nanoparticles @xcite . \n the dna - mediated interaction then utilizes the _ biological recognition _ and binding energy of the compatible dna base pairs . depending on the number of other factors , which we will also discuss later \n , this programmable self - assembly may lead to random as well as regular super - crystal structures , as shown in recent experiments in refs . \n @xcite . somewhat similar ( but in a different potential range ) , is the bio - recognition assembly which utilizes biologically compatible protein molecules , for instance the antigen \n antibody recognition @xcite , which can be used in biosensors . \n the nanoparticle assemblies exhibit a wide range of physical properties which are not found in the bulk materials and at the level of a single nanoparticle @xcite . \n moreover , the emergent physical properties of the nanoparticle assemblies can often be related to their spatial structure @xcite . \n for instance , new optical and magnetic properties have been found in super - lattices made of nanocrystal @xcite . by speciffic functionalization of their surfaces \n gold nanoparticles develop directionally dependent exchange interaction @xcite . assuming that such nanoparticles can be arranged on nodes of a sparse scale - free graph \n , numerical simulations predict new features of the magnetic response of such a structure @xcite , compared to the classical memory materials @xcite . similarly , the films of gold nanoparticles under voltage bias conduct current via _ single - electron tunneling \n _ processes @xcite due to their small capacitances and the coulomb blocade effects @xcite . \n in contrast to classical conduction , the single - electron conduction processes have numerous advantages , e.g. , the absense of dissipation due to heathing , and the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics , which are important in the nanoelectronics . experimentally a large nonlinearity of the current  voltage curve has been found in self - assembled nanoparticle films on substrates , which appears to be fairly correlated with the film structure @xcite . \n the random structure of nanoparticle films on substrates can be adequately modelled by planar graphs ( _ nano - networks _ ) @xcite . for the charge transport via single - electron processes , which we study here , the topological elements of these nano - networks are suitably selected as follows : the _ nodes _ represent nanoparticles , whereas _ edges _ ( links ) are the tunneling junctions between two nanoparticles . \n for the junction ( link ) to occur between two nanoparticles , the distance between them must be smaller than the _ tunneling radius _ of the electrons for that kind of nanoparticles @xcite . \n the charge transport through the film under applied voltage can be described within the model of the capacitively - coupled nanoparticles on substrate @xcite . in our previous work @xcite we generalized the model of capacitively - coupled nanoparticle assemblies for an arbitrary topology of the nano - networks @xcite and implemented a numerical model of single - electron tunnelings driven by the external voltage through such networks . \n theoretical background and the details of the numerical implementation is reviewed in ref . \n the simulation results revealed the topology - induced nonlinearity in the @xmath0 curve , in a good agreement with the experiments @xcite .    in the present work we study the collective dynamic behavior which makes the physical basis for the observed @xmath0 nonlinearity , in particular , the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations monitored at each nanoparticle and inhomogeneous charge flow along the conducting paths through the sample and at the electrode . \n we determine the probability distributions of various quantities related to the conduction process and demonstrate how the topological and charge disorder affect the quantitative statistical properties and the @xmath0 dependences . \n the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  2 we present the model of the particle self - assembly with bio - recognition bonding and show some of the typical emergent structures . in section  3 \n we summarize the theoretical background of the conduction with single - electron processes and its numerical implementation for an arbitrary network topology . \n the visualization of the conduction paths through two network types , the regular and inhomogeneous nanoparticle aggregates , as well as the statistical properties of the topological and charge flow are shown in section  4 . in section  5 \n we analyse the simulated time series of charge and current fluctuations and the related @xmath0 curves . \n section  6 gives a short summary of the results . \n different assembly processes make use of the liquid phase , that provides the nanoparticle diffusion and affects the interaction . \n the assembly with fast evaporation of the liquid @xcite induces additional constraints to the particle motion and interaction . \n the interaction itself between pairs of the nanoparticles moving in a liquid is taking part at short distances and depends on the type of functionalization of their surfaces , as mentioned above . in the case of bio - recognition binding , which we will discuss shortly here , \n the attached dna induce the differences between two types of nanoparticles , i.e. , type a and type b nanoparticles , each of which carry the biologically compatible strand of the same dna molecule . \n thus , the interaction between a  b type is attractive within some bonding distance @xmath1 . \n the bonding distance depends on the lengths of the attached molecules and on the number of the compatible base - pairs on them @xcite . \n therefore , it exceeds the sum of the particle radii @xmath2 . the effective interaction between a \n b particles can be then modeled by the lennard - jones potential @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the actual distance between particles and the potential minimum corresponds to the optimal bonding distance . in the present case , \n the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend , roughly speaking , on the lengths of the attached dna chains and the strength of binding ( number of the compatible base pairs)@xcite . on the contrary , the particles which carry biologically incompatible dna strands have no attractive interaction of this type . the repulsive part alone of the potential in eq . \n ( [ eq - ljpotential ] ) can describe the interaction of the equal - type particles a  a and b  b , occurring at short distances .    [ \n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the correlations in the current fluctuations at the electrode , i.e. , at the last layer of the nanoparticles connected to the electrode , are caused by the tunneling processes deeper in the sample . \n the time - series of the number of tunnelings \\{@xmath7 } at all nanoparticles in in the whole network and their power spectra are shown in fig . \n [ fig - nt ] . \n the power spectrum of the number of tunnelings exhibits long - range correlations for high frequencies , according to @xmath8 the exponent @xmath9 ( within numerical error bars ) for the topologically disordered nano - network nnet1 , suggesting strong cooperation between the conducting paths . \n whereas , the correlations are much weaker in the triangular array , leading to @xmath10 for high frequencies , and the absence of correlations at low frequencies . \n in our numerical study of the conducting nanoparticle films on substrates , we pointed out several steps that play an important role in designing the conduction properties of the films . specifically , we study in quantitative details the emergent properties of such nanoparticle assemblies along the line from the self - assembly processes , the topology of structures , and conduction through such structures .    *   _ self - assembly _ processes are leading to different types of structures of the film . \n we have shown that both regular and highly inhomogeneous nanoparticle films , which are typically fabricated in entirely different techniques@xcite , can be assembled within the same process with the bio - recognition binding and varying a single control parameter . \n *   _ conducting paths _ through the film have been identified and their topological centrality and the dynamical flow computed for for @xmath11 . \n coalescence of flow along different paths contributes to the nonlinear @xmath0 dependences in a range of voltages above the transition @xmath12 . in our simulations , \n the nonlinearity exponent @xmath13 depends strongly on the structure , in agreement with measured @xmath14 curves in different nanoparticle films @xcite . *   _ collective dynamical effects _ in the tunneling processes deep inside the sample lead to the non - gaussian current fluctuations at the electrode . \n we have determined various statistical measures of these collective effects . \n in particular , we find the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations at all nanoparticles , broad distribution of flow on junctions through the nano - network , and non - gaussian distribution of the current increments on the electrode . a non - gaussian distribution have been found in the experiments with nanowires @xcite . \n our numerical results suggest that @xmath15-gaussian distribution with different parameters could be measured in the nanoparticle films . \n the occurrence of the @xmath15gaussian in a larger class of complex dynamical systems with long - range interactions has been discussed recently @xcite . \n furthermore , we demonstrate how different types of disorder affect the conduction in our comparative study of the regular nanoparticle array in the presence of local charge disorder , on one side , and the topologically inhomogeneous nano - network without charge disorder , on the other . \n we hope that our detailed numerical study of the processes leading to different structures and the structure - dependent function of the nanoparticle assemblies sheds a new light on the problem of engineering of the functional materials with desired characteristics . \n we thank the project mrtn -

positron pairs , which deposit  2 mips of energy in the first few centimeters of their tracks ( fig [ fig : egamma ] ) . \n candidate data as a function of energy . \n an excess of events above background is visible at low energies.,width=377 ]    ) , width=302 ]      microboone is also an important stage in the development of lar technology in the community . \n microboone will be the largest lartpc to be built in the u.s . \n it will also be the first lartpc to attempt to drift ionization electrons 2.5 m . demonstrating this 2.5 m drift is an important milestone which must be achieved in order to be able to build larger lartpcs . \n the goal of our lartpc r&d is to make this technology a viable option for next generation kiloton scale detectors . \n lartpc technology has many features that can benefit neutrino physics , but we first must demonstrate the scalability of the technology . some of the challenges that microboone will be addressing are noise - reducing cold electronics , lar purity in larger detectors , analysis tools , and understanding cross sections in lar . \n argoneut @xcite has already made important measurements of cross sections in lar , but microboone will build on this with its larger fiducial volume and higher statistics . \n microboone has a variety of other physics goals as well . \n firstly , the low energy neutrino cross section measurements are an important physics goal . \n it is important to understand how to model neutrino interactions on different nuclei . \n microboone is also sensitive to a burst supernova . \n it is sensitive to all neutrino species for elastic scattering , charged current , and neutral current events . \n this is not unique to lar , but we can learn a lot from detecting these neutrinos in lar , particularly in future larger detectors . \n we are also able to prepare for future proton decay searches ( @xmath8 ) . \n microboone is not large enough to see proton decay , but we can develop particle i d , triggers , and understand background . \n the ability to see proton decay is a very attractive feature of lar detectors as the outgoing k is below cherenkov threshold and therefore invisible to cherenkov detectors , which are currently the leading detector type for kiloton scale detectors . \n microboone is also sensitive to @xmath9 , the fraction of proton spin carried by the strange quark , through neutral current elastic scattering . \n this is impossible for most detectors because it is difficult to tell protons from neutrons , but liquid argon detectors can measure the energy of the outgoing proton and may be able to see the disconnected neutron - proton vertex . measuring @xmath9 in lar will help us to better understand proton spin . \n lastly , microboone will be able to search for exotic physics such as decays of exotic heavy particles . \n while the information provided by the argon scintillation light is not directly used in the determination of the energy of the incident neutrinos , the @xmath10 it provides is required . without it , there is some uncertainty between where the event occurred in the detector and when the event took place , since we only know when the event reached the wire planes . \n a light collection system allows us to reject background by comparing interaction time with the beam time structure , which is crucial for a surface detector like microboone . \n it also allows us to trigger on interesting non - beam events , which is necessary in order to study events like from supernovae or proton decay in liquid argon . knowing the exact location of an event can also allow corrections for charge losses and diffusions as a function of drift distance which allows for a more accurate measurement of energy deposits . \n the light that we are interested in measuring is the scintillation light of the argon . \n there are two paths for scintillation light to be produced @xcite @xcite :    the fast scintillation path : :    makes up about 25% of the scintillation light . \n as a charged particle    travels through the lar , it may excite the argon atoms . \n when this    occurs , the excited argon atom may combine with another argon atom to    form a singlet state excimer which will then decay to form two argon    atoms and a 128 nm photon . \n this process takes   6ns . \n the slow scintillation path : :    makes up the other 75% of the scintillation light and begins with the    charged particle traveling through the lar ionizing the argon atom    ( the same process by which the ionization electrons are produced ) . the    resulting argon ion can recombine with another argon atom and another    electron in order to produce a triplet state excimer . \n this excimer    then decays into a singlet state excimer , which as before , decays into    two argon atoms and a 128 nm photon . \n this process takes 1.6    @xmath11    this 128 nm scintillation light is in the vacuum uv , a range of wavelengths which is unable to pass through most substances , including air . \n this 128 nm light is also unable to pass through the glass of a photomultiplier tube , so we must first shift the light to wavelengths in the visible range in order to detect it .      in order to detect the argon scintillation light with photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) \n , we use a wavelength shifting material called tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) to coat acrylic plates positioned in front of the pmts . \n tpb absorbs light in the uv and re - emits in the visible ( fig [ fig : tpbspectrum ] ) . the efficiency for re - emission of light absorbed at 128 nm has been determined by ref @xcite to be 120% for a film of pure tpb made through vacuum evaporation . \n we plan to use a coating of 50% tpb and 50 % polystyrene ( ps ) for our plate coating , which we have measured to have about 50% of the efficiency of the evaporative coating . \n we find that this mixture makes the plates more durable and also more cost effective . \n the tpb coated plates have a diameter of 12 \" and will be placed on top of posts so that they are suspended directly above the pmts ( fig [ fig : pmtmount ] ) . \n the posts , which are made of the thermally resistant material polyether ether ketone ( peek ) , also serve to hold the pmt in place . there will be 30 pmts in microboone arranged behind the wire planes along the side of the detector outside of the electric field region ( fig [ fig : pmtmount ] ) . \n while the microboone light collection system is a good fit for a  100 ton lar detector , there are many challenges this system would face when scaling up to a larger multi - kiloton detector . \n the proposed multi - kiloton detectors use modules which each have their own electric fields and wire planes , so that the electric field does not have to be applied across too large of a distance , as the necessary field strength would be difficult to work with . having a light collection system only on the edges of such \n a detector is unlikely to be successful , as the light has a large probability of being absorbed during multiple rayleigh scatters . \n having a system that could slide in between wireplanes would be a solution to this problem . \n our solution is a lightguide detection system @xcite where lightguides are bent to guide light adiabatically into pmts which are placed out of the electric field region . \n ( see fig [ fig : tesspaddle ] ) . \n these lightguides would take up far less of the fiducial volume of the detector than a system of pmts , as well as being able to go places that pmts can not such as in electric fields and tighter spaces . \n a much larger area of coverage is also possible .          in order for lightguiding to occur without the light having originally entered at the end of the guide \n , the light must be produced inside the guide . \n this is accomplished by embedding the tpb in a thin film of polystyrene ( ps ) , a good index of refraction match to acrylic , and applying this coating to the surface of the acrylic . \n the coating is a mixture of 25% tpb to 75% ps . \n when the uv light hits a tpb molecule , the outgoing visible light is emitted isotropically inside the film and may be totally internally reflected if the light is emitted above the critical angle of the guide . \n this coating must be optically smooth for better lightguiding properties . \n the lightguides are tested using a small @xmath12 disk source placed @xmath13 5 mm from the lightguide which produces @xmath14 mev @xmath15 particles . \n these @xmath16 travel @xmath17 in argon , producing photons along its path through the mechanism described in section [ sec : light_in_lar ] which may hit the lightguide and be transmitted to a r7725-mod pmt . \n our setup is shown in fig [ fig : lightguide_setup ] . \n the pmt observes a multi - photoelectron prompt pulse from the fast scintillation light , which arrives all at once , as well as single photoelectron ( p.e . ) \n late pulses ( fig [ fig : pulse ] ) . \n disk source placed @xmath185 mm from the lightguide emits photons through argon scintillation which hit the lightguide , are shifted , and reemitted down the lightguide and into the pmt , width=188 ]        these pulses are calibrated in two ways in ref @xcite . \n we must define one p.e . in terms of adc counts . \n the first method is to define one p.e . by the late light , as most of the late light pulses only contain one p.e . , and take the mean of the gaussian that results by fitting the pulse heights of these late light charges . \n the second method is to fit the early pulse with equally spaced gaussians ( with the spacing allowed to float ) . \n there are natural peaks in the data , representative of a poisson distribution around each number of p.e . that a pulse can have . \n both of these methods yield the same answer . for our new studies \n , we are using the integrated pulse charge and calibrate using the late light only for simplicity . \n the resulting fits @xcite yield an average of  8 p.e . and \n an attenuation of  75 cm . using 1 m paddles ( 8 lightguides curving into a 2 in pmt ) , we would need 27 paddles to detect a 40 mev proton ( defined as observing 5 p.e . ) in microboone . \n this is practical , though not nearly as good as the current microboone system . \n since this paper , we have switched to using uv transmitting acrylic for our coating in which to embed the tpb , and switched to using cast acrylic instead of extruded acrylic for our lightguides , as the cast acrylic should have a higher attenuation length . with these new lightguides \n , we are seeing an average of 35 p.e . \n per @xmath15 , which is a factor of 4 more light . \n this makes this r&d even more promising . \n we plan to set up a demonstration detector ( fig [ fig : demodetector ] . with six 20 cm wide by 40 cm long paddles of eight lightguides each in order to demonstrate this technology as well as measure the muon lifetime in argon . \n microboone is an important state in the development of future lar tpcs . \n it will also help our understanding of the miniboone experiment as well as making other important physics contributions . \n the new developments in lightguide r&d for general purpose light collection in lar look promising , and may be a solution to the problems that will be faced when scaling up systems which are currently in use to the kiloton scale .", "StartTimeOffset": 107556197965, "RequestID": "2a5b3479511c4535be85cc2738f4e3c8", "TotalTokens": 3621}

{"ContextTokens": 3861, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "ue to their remarkable agility and robustness , quadcopters have become an exciting area of research and a common sight among aircraft hobbyists , academic researchers and industries . in general \n , they have high thrust to weight ratio which allows them to carry significant payloads or have high lateral accelerations when not carrying a load . \n quadcopters are nowadays being used to study a plethora of concepts ranging from non - linear control[1 ] and learning[2 ] to vision - based pose estimation[3].when quadcopters are used for tasks like mapping , search and rescue , patrol , surveillance and product delivery , they re required to follow a predefined path at a particular height . in general , circular and straight line paths are used . \n path - following algorithms are used to ensure that the quadcopter will follow a predefined path in two or three dimensions at constant height . \n another important consideration is that the path - following algorithms are robust and accurate with regard to turbulences . \n a wide range of path - following algorithms have been proposed [ 4 ] . \n in this paper we use the non - linear guidance logic ( nlgl ) [ 4 ] coupled with model - predictive control [ 5 ] for trajectory tracking for the quadcopter . \n the main objective of this approach includes :    * the trajectories must be feasible under the dynamic and input constraints of the quadrotor * the generated trajectories should bring the vehicle to the target position on the path as quickly as possible , * the trajectory calculation must be fast enough to be used online , and * it must be possible to generate an implicit feedback control law by re - planning the trajectory intercept at each controller update , and applying the control inputs of the first section of it . \n a scheme is presented in [ 6 ] for generating state interception trajectories for quadcopters ; that is , trajectories starting from an arbitrary state and achieving a ( reduced ) end state in a specified amount of time , whilst satisfying input constraints . \n this approach builds on the previous work presented above in that we seek to develop that satisfies various constraints and is also fast enough to allow real - time planning . \n trajectory tracking is done by formulating the trajectory of the quadrocopter in its jerk , in discrete time , and then solving a convex optimization problem on each decoupled axis . \n the nlgl algorithm is now used to track the path effectively . \n the quadrocopter model is presented in section ii , with the trajectory tracking scheme given in section iii . \n section iv discusses simulation results , and an outlook is given in section v. \n the quadcopter is modeled as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom : linear translation along the inertial x1 , x2 and x3 axes , and three degrees of freedom describing the rotation of the frame attached to the body with respect to the inertial frame , which is taken here to be the proper orthogonal matrix r. the control inputs to the system are taken as the total thrust produced f , for simplicity normalized by the vehicle mass and thus having units of acceleration ; and the body rates expressed in the body - fixed frame as  = ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . \n these are illustrated in fig \n . 1 . \n figure  [ fig:3d ]    the mixing of these inputs to individual motor thrust commands is done on board the vehicle , using feedback from gyroscopes . \n it is assumed that the time constant of the onboard controllers is low enough to have negligible influence on the algorithm presented here . \n because of their low rotational inertia , quadcopters can achieve extremely high rotational accelerations ( on the order of 200 rads2 [ 7 ] ) about the 1 and 2 axes , while it will be shown that the rotation about 3 is not needed for the trajectories considered here . \n the differential equations governing the flight of the quadcopter are now taken as those of a rigid body [ 8 ]    @xmath0    @xmath1\\ ] ]    with e3 = ( 0,0,1 ) and [ [ wx ] ] the skew symmetric matrix form of the vector cross product such that :    @xmath2 = \\left| \\begin{array}{ccc } -

pitch propellers with a fixed direction of rotation , and , specifically , that the requirement on the thrust input is non - convex . \n @xmath7    the following conservative box constraints are applied to yield convex constraints :    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    the resulting trajectories are guaranteed to be feasible with respect to the thrust limit if    @xmath11 \n the three axes are decoupled and hence the optimization problem is solved separately for each axis . \n the trajectory tracking is rewritten as an optimal control problem , with boundary conditions defined by the quadrocopter s initial and ( desired ) final states . the cost function to minimize \n is chosen as    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    a nonlinear guidance law based method described in [ 4 ] is used to determine the destination intercept along the given path . for simplicity , \n assume the uav is following a path , as shown in figure 4 . \n at the current uav position p , draw a circle of radius l. the circle will intercept the path at two points q and ql . depending on the direction in which the uav has to move , either q or @xmath15 . will be selected . \n the advantage of this algorithm is that the same algorithm can be applied to any type of trajectory . \n the stability of the guidance law is shown using lyapunov stability arguments [ ] . \n once the target intercepts are calculated , future position , velocity and acceleration of the quadcopter are predicted using convex optimization and having constraints based on the quadcopter model . the discrete time formulation ( described in the next sub - section ) is used to predict up to 5 values if position , velocity and acceleration . \n the first value of the jerk calculated from the constraints is given as input . \n figure  [ fig : vtp ]      the trajectory generation problem for each decoupled axis is rendered finite dimensional by discretizing the time with uniform steps of size t . \n each axis is then a discrete time linear , time invariant system in the state z , consisting of position , velocity and acceleration , with scalar jerk input @xmath16 , where the axis subscripts have been neglected for convenience . \n @xmath17 = \\dddot x(k\\delta t)\\ ] ]    @xmath18 = [ x(t_1 ) x(t_2 ) . . \n x(t_n ) ] ^t\\ ] ]    @xmath19 = \\begin{bmatrix } \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & 0 \\\\   \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } & \\delta \\frac{t^3}{6 } \\end{bmatrix } \\times \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\\\ u_4 \\\\ u_5 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    @xmath20 \\times \\ddot x(t_1 ) + \\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\delta t\\\\ 2\\delta t\\\\ 3\\delta t\\\\ \n 4\\delta t\\\\ 5\\delta t\\end{array } \\right ] \\times \\dot x(t_1 ) + \\left[\\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\times x(t_1)\\ ] ]    the optimal control problem is to solve for u[k ] matrix in equation ( 17 ) subject to the above dynamics , satisfying the boundary conditions defined by the initial and final positions @xmath21 , respectively , velocities @xmath22 and accelerations @xmath23 . \n @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    the quadratic cost function ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) with the linear equality constraints ( 17 ) to ( 20 ) define a convex optimization problem.there exist efficient methods for solving problems of this sort , with cvxopt [ 11 ] , forces [ 12 ] and cvxgen [ 13 ] presenting techniques for creating c - code based solvers for specific instances of convex optimization problems . here , solvers are generated using the cvxopt software of [ 11 ] , which was able to generate solvers for large problems . \n cvxopt uses efficient interior point methods tailored to convex optimization problems , as are typical in model predictive control applications , and allows for high - speed implementation with good numerical stability properties .    the generated solvers either return a solution that solves the problem to within some acceptable residuals , or returns that no solution is found . in reality , \n failure to find a solution can mean that :    * a solution exists , but the solver failed to find it due to reaching an internal limit ; * no solution exists to the conservatively constrained decoupled problem ; * no solution exists to the fully coupled nonlinearly constrained problem . \n the proposed algorithm was used to follow particular straight line paths , circles and sinusoidal curves defined by their respective mathematical equations . \n the results of the above have been shown in fig ( 3 ) ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . \n the starting points were taken to be outside the path to follow , but close enough for the circle to find the vtp and start tracking the trajectory . in the plots shown in the figures , the time intervals between every measurement of velocity , \n acceleration and position was taken to be 0.08s . \n the radius of the circle used in these plots is 50 units . \n the output of the proposed algorithm was also compared with the trajectory generation model proposed in [ 7 ] , where the cost function to be minimized calculates the sum of squares of the input jerk . in comparison \n , the proposed algorithm performs as well as the trajectory generation method proposed in [ 6 ] . \n the performance of the trajectory tracking is found by solving trajectories from rest , for step times varying from 0.08s to 2s . \n for each trajectory length , 1000 iterations were executed using python idle which took a mean time of 60ms per iteration . \n these were calculated on a pc running ubuntu 12.04 , with an intel core i3 - 330 m dual core processor ( 2.13 ghz ) with 4 gb ram . \n the solver was linked to an executable using python idle . in each case \n the optimizations were set to maximize speed . \n this paper presents a method for trajectory tracking for quadcopters , from arbitrary initial conditions to a desired end state characterized by a position . the nlgl based destination \n intercept works satisfactorily in tracking subsequent intercepts in the predefined path . \n the constrained trajectory tracking problem is posed as a convex optimization problem for each decoupled axis , which can be solved in real time . \n therefore this technique is suitable for use in feedback as a model predictive controller ; it also naturally handles cases where the desired end state evolves over time , such as when trying to hit an uncertain target or when it has to overcome an obstacle , where the target prediction evolves in real time . \n the convex optimization problem could be easily modified to achieve different goals , e.g. by removing the equality constraint on end velocity and acceleration , and adding the magnitude of the end velocity to the cost function , one solves a problem somewhat similar to that of [ 14 ] . \n this project work was supported by the robotics research centre at international institute of information technology , hyderabad ( iiit -

consistent system of spinor , scalar and gravitational fields in presence of a perfect fluid and cosmological term @xmath1 @xcite . \n various observations @xcite suggest that our universe is accelerating . and \n the reason behind it is believed to be a mysterious _ dark energy _ , a term coined recently in 1999 but its history traces back as late as newton s time @xcite . \n the cosmological constant @xmath1 , first adopted and then abandoned by einstein for his static model of the universe @xcite , is considered as one of the candidates for the dark energy . \n the other candidate is a scalar field often referred to as quintessence @xcite . \n it is , however , speculated that @xmath1 is a dynamical term rather than a constant . \n the dark energy may be described as a perfect fluid through the equation of state @xmath2 relating the fluid pressure and matter density of the physical system through the relation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the barotropic dark energy equation of state parameter . \n it plays a significant role in the cosmological evolution . \n this is in general a function of time and may be a function of scale factor or redshift @xcite . \n recently , @xcite have proposed a time dependent @xmath5 for the study of cosmic evolution with the equation of state parameter @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the time varying hubble parameter . \n the dynamics of both expanding and contracting epoch of the universe is buried in the sign of @xmath8 in this simple expression . \n the @xmath8=0 represents a linearly expanding universe with @xmath9 . \n a close system like an oscillatory universe may be created without violating any known conservation law of physics as its total mass ( energy ) is zero , which is indeed possible @xcite . \n a universe may enter into an epoch of expansion followed by an epoch of contraction after every bounce . for an expanding universe that was created at @xmath10 with @xmath11 \n , we may arrive at two situations ( i ) linearly expanding universe represented by @xmath12 ( ii ) and universe that has undergone an adiabatic expansion to a finite @xmath13 followed by a linear expansion ( for example , our universe ) that may be represented by another condition @xmath14 provided @xmath15 . \n having the same theoretical framework these two cases may be represented by a single set of equations @xcite with a difference that inflation leads to a scaling in @xmath16 . \n thus , it is the equation of state that distinguishes between the two . after achieving its maximum radius at time @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , \n the universe starts collapsing due to its own mass and enters into an epoch of contraction with a negative sign of @xmath8 . \n thus at a later time @xmath21 , @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 , which would continue to decrease till universe achieves its minimum radius . at preceding times closer to it , a ` condition of oscillation ' , @xmath24 , would hold . \n this condition would still at a time when universe sets to expand again . \n the above equation of state enables us to handle this third possibility at least qualitatively when employed in the framework of general relativity . \n the history of oscillations does not go unnoticed by the classical thermodynamics since cosmological entropy ( unidirectional thermodynamical scale of time ) keeps on growing after every cycle @xcite . \n the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics relates the dark energy equation of state with cosmological entropy @xcite . \n thus the equation of state , which translates itself into entropy , would manifest similar properties despite the fact that relativity breaks down at singularities , whose details are not required in the framework . \n an observer outside the universe , who measures a growing time ( or growing entropy ) from point of creation , would distinguish a state in an oscillation with an identical state in the next oscillation with a decrease in @xmath8 . \n this would result in different solutions of field equations for identical states in two different oscillations . \n the state of expansion , contraction and oscillation of the universe is buried in @xmath8 . \n we find no reason to believe , why field equations of general relativity would not yield a valid solution for any value of @xmath8 no matter how many times the universe has hit the singularity in the middle and has come up to a finite size again and again for ` unknown ' reasons . \n the einstein field equations of general relativity are @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is time - dependent cosmological term with vacuum velocity of light being unity in relativistic units . for the spherically symmetric friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric , einstein field equations ( [ eq3 ] ) yield friedmann and raychaudhuri equations , respectively ,    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath28 is the curvature constant , @xmath29 is the hubble parameter and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the gravitational constant , matter - energy density and fluid pressure , respectively . \n the @xmath30 is taken to be a constant quantity along with a variable @xmath1 in which case the generalized energy conservation law may be derived @xcite . using equation of state ( @xmath33 ) in eq . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) and differentiating eq . \n ( [ eq5 ] ) with time @xmath34 for flat universe ( @xmath35 , we arrive at    @xmath36    in the light of the studies by @xcite , we use the _ ansatz _ , @xmath37 . \n as argued by @xcite this _ ansatz _ may find realization in the framework of self consistent inflation model @xcite in which time - dependent @xmath1 is determined by the rate of bose condensate evaporation with @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the mass of bosons and @xmath40 is the planck mass ) . \n the equation of state along with eqs . \n ( [ eq6 ] ) ,  ( [ eq10 ] ) and above _ ansatz _ leads to    @xmath41    the condition @xmath24 with @xmath42 simplifies it further    @xmath43    a change of sign for @xmath8 would amount to the change of sign for @xmath44 . \n thus , we have same solution set for @xmath42 with @xmath45 as    @xmath46),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath50    @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are integration constants . \n the logarithm @xmath56 demands a positive definite value for @xmath57 . \n thus @xmath58 , @xmath55 and @xmath44 must have identical sign . \n therefore , second term of eq . \n ( [ eq17 ] ) i.e. @xmath59 is positive for @xmath60 and negative in the range @xmath61 . \n we find @xmath62 for a linearly expanding universe and a range @xmath63 for an inflationary universe @xcite . \n thus , it is always negative . for a contracting universe @xmath8 is negative , which makes the second term of eq . \n ( [ eq2 ] ) positive . \n this , when compared with eq . \n ( [ eq17 ] ) , suggests that @xmath44 is positive for @xmath64 and negative for @xmath65 . \n thus , for @xmath66 , we obtain a condition , @xmath67 . here \n @xmath68 means @xmath69 , which represents a linearly expanding universe with @xmath70 . for an observer sitting outside the universe , the rate @xmath8 would appear to be smaller and smaller for the increasing number of oscillations as @xmath34 would appear to be larger and larger . \n it is obvious from eq . \n ( [ eq16 ] ) that @xmath22 is positive definite that means it grows from zero to a maximum value during the epoch of expansion and and then approaches to zero during the epoch of contraction . \n we also observe that eq . \n ( [ eq18 ] ) for the density is singular at @xmath71 , so is the pressure ( @xmath72 ) , which turns out to be positive for @xmath73 . \n the same restriction is found for the expanding universe using same equation of state @xcite , which is in agreement with the results of gsl of thermodynamics that too restricts the equation of state , @xmath74 , in an expanding universe . beyond this limit , for example @xmath75 , pressure is negative . \n let us now try to extract the two phases of expanding and contracting universe . \n as mentioned earlier , we had the condition @xmath76 @xcite which we must satisfy here also and thereby take @xmath77 and @xmath78 \n . with this our @xmath31 will always be positive either universe is expanding or contracting . in our solution \n @xmath57 depends upon the constants @xmath55 , @xmath58 , @xmath79 and also @xmath34 . \n @xmath58 , via the relation @xmath80 , is a negative quantity \n . thus @xmath55 must be negative to make @xmath57 positive and between @xmath81 and @xmath82 . \n hence pressure will be positive and universe will contract . \n it also depends upon constant @xmath55 , so if @xmath83 multiplied by @xmath79 is less than @xmath82 pressure would be positive . in other words \n if @xmath58 is very very small , even for a large @xmath79 , pressure will be positive and universe will contract . but with increasing @xmath79 , @xmath84 will eventually be greater than equal to one and pressure will again be negative and the universe will start expanding . \n we , therefore , construct the story for a universe like ours , which had started with an adiabatic expansion with @xmath85 , then it had been slowed down to a linearly expanding universe with @xmath86 , which was then followed by an epoch of contraction with a positive value of @xmath59 . for smaller values of @xmath57 or @xmath34 , \n @xmath59 may reach the condition @xmath75 , which will make the pressure positive and thus would receive a bounce . \n this process would continue repeating without violating any known conservation law . \n however , @xmath87 for @xmath88 . \n thus , the universe would appear to be a linearly expanding universe with @xmath70 and would never reach the condition for contraction or bounce i.e. @xmath75 . \n thus , it recommends for initial oscillations only . \n one may suggest improvements in the equation of state , however we have shown a way to incorporate oscillatory universe in general relativity through it . \n for the successive oscillations having equal epoch of expansion and contraction . \n the solid , dotted , dashed , long -

{"ContextTokens": 2241, "GeneratedTokens": 343, "SynthesizedBody": "the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) is a large ( diameter @xmath0 degrees ) , nearby supernova remnant associated with the vela pulsar and is one of the brightest objects in the x - ray sky . \n recent work indicates the distance to vela is only @xmath1  pc ( cha   1999 and jenkins & wallerstein 1995 ) , making it an ideal candidate for resolving fine structure in x - rays with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. _ rosat _ all - sky survey observations showed a complicated morphology and revealed the outer extent of the remnant for the first time . \n aschenbach  ( 1995 ) identified several features protruding beyond what is believed to be the primary blastwave as `` explosion fragments '' . \n the brightest of these features is the so - called `` bullet d '' . \n tsunemi  1999 and miyata  2001 observed `` bullet a '' with _ \n asca _ and _ chandra _ respectively and detected strong si emission lines which they concluded was evidence that bullet  a was indeed composed of ejecta from the original explosion . \n moriguchi  ( 2001 ) suggested that the bullet features were more likely the result of the interaction of the snr shock with an inhomogeneous medium as indicated by the numerous molecular clouds identified by a co survey of the region . \n redman   ( 2000 ) noted the coincidence of the bright optical filamentary nebula rcw  37 and bullet  d. we proposed two _ \n observations , one at the head of the bullet and the other in the `` wake '' in order to examine the proposed explanations for bullet  d. \n _ chandra _ observed the eastern limb of vela in september 2000 with the acis - i detector . \n the exposure at the head of the bullet d was 31  ks and the exposure in the wake region was 52 ks . \n figure  1 displays the image from the head of bullet d after selecting events in the 0.4 to 2.5  kev range , binning the data in @xmath2 pixels , and smoothing the data with a gaussian filter with a fwhm of 3 . \n the data show a fragmented , filamentary structure consistent with a shock interacting with an inhomogeneous medium . \n if this feature were a fragment of ejecta from the explosion , one would expect a larger contrast in intensity of the x - ray emission from the head of the feature to the trailing edges as seen in bullet  a. \n the frontside - illuminated ( fi ) ccds on acis suffered radiation damage early in the mission which resulted in a large increase in the charge transfer - inefficiency ( cti ) and a significant reduction in the spectral resolution . \n the observations of the bullet d are seriously impaired by this damage since the object covers all four ccds on the acis - i array . \n we have used the cti - correction software and appropriate response matrices developed at penn state ( see townsley   2000 , townsley   2000a , and townsley   2000b ) . \n the cti correction dramatically improves the quality of the data as demonstrated in our analysis of the spectra of the smc snr 1e0102.2 - 7219 ( see plucinsky   2001 ) . \n fortunately , the spectrum of the bullet d is quite similar to that of 1e0102.2 - 7219 in that both have strong lines of o , ne , and mg with little or no fe . \n we focus on the spectrum of the brightest part of the bullet d feature described by the ellipse in figure  1 . \n the acis spectrum of this feature is shown in figure  2 . \n the dominant features are the oviii  @xmath3 line at 654  ev , the neix triplet at @xmath4  ev , and the mgxi triplet at @xmath5  kev . \n we fit these data with a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) model and derived a best - fit temperature of @xmath6  kev after fixing the to be @xmath7 ( see dubner   1998 ) . at this temperature \n , the cie model indicates that the o and ne abundances must be enhanced by several times over solar values . \n next we fit the data with a model of a simple continuum plus gaussians to represent the line emission . \n we used the ratios of ovii  triplet / oviii  @xmath3 and neix  triplet / nex  @xmath8 as non - equilibrium diagnostics . \n both diagnostics indicated that temperatures below log(t)=6.4 are not consistent with the data . \n both the o and ne line ratios are consistent with ionization timescales in the range @xmath9 . \n we can impose an upper limit on the ionization timescale of @xmath10 by assuming an age of 12,000  yr and a maximum ambient density of @xmath11 . \n we can then compare the emissivities of the oviii  @xmath3 , oviii  @xmath12 , neix  triplet , and nex  @xmath3 lines to the expected values . \n the measured emissivities are plotted against the expected emissivities as a function of temperature and ionization timescale in figures  3 and  4 . \n the measured ne emissivity is higher than the predicted emissivity for all values of the ionization timescale regardless of temperature , indicating that the abundance of ne must be higher than solar . in the preferred range of ionization timescales from @xmath13 , \n the ne abundance required to be consistent with the model predictions varies from 1.6 to @xmath14 solar . \n the situation with o is significantly different . in the range of preferred ionization timescales from @xmath15 , \n the measured emissivity is lower than the expected emissivity for a large range of ionization timescales . over this range , \n the o abundance required to be consistent with the model predictions varies from 0.5 to @xmath16 solar . \n the o and ne data are most consistent with each other for a temperature of log(t ) = 6.6 and an ionization timescale of @xmath17 . at these values \n the ne abundance is @xmath18 twice solar and the o abundance is @xmath18 solar . \n the morphology of the x - ray emission revealed by _ chandra _ is more consistent with a snr shock interacting with an inhomogeneous medium than with a discrete fragment of ejecta . \n spectra indicate that ne is enhanced above solar values , but at a rather modest level , and o is consistent with the solar value . \n we therefore conclude the _ chandra _ observations of the vela bullet d region are more consistent with a shock breakout hypothesis than with a bullet of ejecta hypothesis , although the _ chandra _ data can not rule out the bullet idea . \n we thank all of the engineers , technicians , and scientists who have made the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ such a success . \n ppp , rks , rje , tjg , and pos acknowledge support for this work from nasa contracts nas8 - 39703 and go0 - 1127 . \n lkt and psb acknowledge support for this work from nasa contract nas8 -

filter mode in the quiescence show flickering variability on timescales of minutes and amplitudes of 0.05 - 0.1 mag in u gem ( figure 2a ) and even 0.7 mag in su uma ( figure 1a ) . \n the flickering amplitude in both stars increases toward the shorter wavelenghts during the quiescence and almost disappear during the outburst and the superoutburst phases in su uma . \n the maximum amplitude corresponds to the best visibility of the hot spot ( face - on ) near phase 0.6 . on the other hand , in the case of u gem flickering \n is well visible not only when the hot spot is well seen ( figure  2a ) . \n the flickering is most pronounced near phase 0.4 when the hot spot does not face the observer . \n thus , the influence of intrinsic accretion disk instabilities seem to be a very important source of flickering in u gem \n . +   * acknowledgements : * this work was supported by the polish mnisw grant n203 018 32/2338 . \n krzemiski w. , 1965 , _ apj _ , * 142 * , 1051 -

{"ContextTokens": 1604, "GeneratedTokens": 219, "SynthesizedBody": "inner rings and pseudo - rings are evident in 50% of all spiral galaxies and in more than 75% of early - type barred spirals ( kormendy 1979 ;

see also http://trifle.gsfc.nasa.gov/uit/astro2/ngc4736_pr.gif ) . \n exterior to the ring are two 500-pc size _ bi - symmetric knots _ on diametrically opposite sides of the nucleus . \n the hst s nuv image of the central 20 arcsecs shows a 500-pc long _ mini - bar _ that had been previously inferred from photometric analyses of optical - band images . by comparison , \n a groundbased r - band image shows the underlying bulge and _ oval disk _ made up of cooler and typically older stars . \n taken together , the nuclear minibar , starburst ring , bi - symmetric knots , oval disk , and outer pseudo - ring provide compelling evidence for resonant dynamics operating in the disk of m94 . \n more specifically , the radii of these various features match those of important orbital resonances , given a pattern speed of 35 km s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 and our adopted distance and inclination ( see figure  [ fig-1 ] ) . \n this pattern of orbital resonances is most likely driven by some combination of the nuclear mini - bar and oval distortion in the disk . \n note in figure 1 that our fit places the starburst ring between the two inner lindblad resonances rather than aligned with the outer ilr as modeled by gerin et al . \n ( 1991 ) and mulder & combes ( 1996 ) . \n it is worth noting that at redshifts of 15 , the 2-kpc diameter starburst ring in m94 would subtend angles of only ( 0.7@xmath3  1.0@xmath3)h@xmath4/75 in an einstein - de sitter universe ( q@xmath4 = 1/2 ) and ( 0.3@xmath3  0.2@xmath3)h@xmath4/75 in an open ( milne ) universe ( q@xmath4 = 0 ) . \n therefore , many of the `` core - halo '' morphologies that are evident at high - redshift in the restframe fuv ( cf . \n giavalisco 1997 ) may , in fact be marginally - resolved representations of galaxies with starburst rings in their centers . \n gravitationally - lensed galaxies are fortuitously magnified , enabling resolution of their structure at high s / n . \n an important precedent in this regard is the gravitationally - lensed `` pretzel galaxy '' which lies behind the galaxy cluster 0024 + 1654 at an estimated redshift of 1.2  1.8 ( colley et al . \n 1996 ; tyson et al . \n detailed reconstructions of the multiply - lensed galaxy show a clear annular morphology on a scale of several kpc . if m94 and other nearby ringed galaxies can be used as current - epoch analogues , the `` pretzel galaxy '' and perhaps other marginally - resolved `` core - halo '' galaxies at high redshift may represent youthful inner disks evolving under the influence of oval or bar asymmetries . \n conversely , if evidence for starburst rings at high redshift proves to be sparse , then massive inner disks featuring ring - bar dynamics have yet to form in most systems , or starbursting bulges are masking their presence . \n buta , r. , & combes , f. 1996 , fund . \n cosmic phys . , 17 , 95 colley , w. , tyson , j. a. , & turner , e. l. 1996 , , 461 , l83 de vaucouleurs , g. , & buta , r. 1980 , , 44 , 451 giavalisco , m. , et al . \n 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : probing the progress of galaxy evolution , eds . \n w. h. waller , m. n. fanelli , j. e. hollis , & a. c. danks ( new york : aip press ) , p. 221 gerin , m. , casoli , f. , & combes , f. 1991 , a&a , 251 , 32 kormendy , j. 1979 , , 227 , 714 mulder , p. s. & van driel , w. 1993 , a&a , 272 , 63 mulder , p. s. & combes , f. 1996 , a&a , 313 , 723 tyson , j. a. , kochanski , g. , & dellantonio , i. 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : ... , p. 204 \n waller , w. h. , et al . \n 1997 , in the ultraviolet universe at low and high redshift : ... , p. 39", "StartTimeOffset": 151624403084, "RequestID": "11e5a9af35e9413ca3b5f8b30af2a35c", "TotalTokens": 1823}
{"ContextTokens": 2819, "GeneratedTokens": 124, "SynthesizedBody": "the harp experiment@xcite was designed to perform a systematic and precise study of hadron production for beam momenta between 1.5 and @xmath3 and target nuclei ranging from hydrogen to lead . \n the detector was located at cern , in the ps beam.the daq recorded 420 million events during the years 2001 and 2002 . \n the physics program of harp includes : a ) the measurement of pion yields for a variety of energies and targets relevant for he design of the proton driver of a future neutrino factory@xcite ; b ) the measurement of pion yields on low @xmath4 targets as well as on cryogenic oxygen and helium targets , useful to improve the precision of atmospheric neutrino flux calculations@xcite ; and c ) the measurement of pion and kaon yields , relevant for the calculation of the neutrino fluxes of experiments such as miniboone@xcite and k2k@xcite . \n harp ( fig . \n [ fig : harp ] ) is a large acceptance spectrometer , with two distinct regions . in the forward part of the apparatus ( up to polar angles of about 250 @xmath2 ) , \n the main tracking devices are a set of large drift chambers . \n magnetic analysis is provided by a 0.4 @xmath5 dipole magnet and particle identification relies in the combination of a threshold cherenkov detector , a time - of - flight wall and an electromagnetic calorimeter . in the rest of the solid angle \n the main tracking device is a tpc , which is complemented by a set of rpc detectors for time - of - flight measurements . \n the target is located inside the tpc . \n in addition , sophisticated beam instrumentation ( including three timing detectors and threshold cherenkov detectors ) provides identification of the incoming particle and allows the interaction time at the target to be measured . \n given the immediate interest of the miniboone and k2k experiments in a measurement of the production cross sections for pions and kaons at the energies and targets relevant for their beam setups , the harp collaboration has given priority to the analysis of those particular data sets . \n in particular , we present in this article an initial result relevant for the k2k experiment . \n specifically , we measure pion yields from proton - nucleus collisions , for a thin al target ( @xmath6 ) and a beam energy of 12.9 @xmath7 . \n the k2k neutrino beam is produced from the decay of hadrons ( primarily pions ) emanating from a @xmath8 al target , at the kek ps proton driver energies of 12.9 gev . \n further details about the motivation of this analysis can be found in ref . \n tracking of forward - going particles is done by a set of large drift chambers(ndc ) placed upstream and downstream of the dipole magnet . \n the chambers were recuperated from the nomad experiment and their properties have been described elsewhere@xcite . \n each ndc module is made of four chambers , and each chamber of three planes of wires with tilted angles @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n the single - wire efficiency is of the order of @xmath12 , and the spatial resolution approximately @xmath13 . \n the performance of the ndc is inferior to the one measured in nomad , where the hit efficiency was close to @xmath14 and the resolution approached @xmath15 . \n this is mainly due to the fact that , for harp , the ndc used a gas mixture and voltage settings different from the ones in nomad , a non - flamable gas mixture . ] .    due to the low hit efficiency , \n the algorithm used in nomad , based in building up space points ( with an efficiency of about @xmath16 ) is not viable ( for harp we would obtain @xmath17 ) . instead , the reconstruction builds @xmath18 and @xmath19 track segments in each ndc module ( 12 hits maximum ) , which are fitted to a straight line model via a kalman filter fit@xcite . \n next , the algorithm attempts all possible combinations ( which include at least a @xmath19 segment ) to connect tracking objects in the modules downstream of the dipole magnet . \n combinations such as @xmath19 + @xmath18 or even @xmath19 + hits  not  associated are valid ways to build longer , @xmath19 segments .    to measure the momentum it is necessary to connect a ( @xmath19 ) segment downstream of the dipole with at least one space point upstream of the dipole . since one can impose the constraint that all tracks emanate from the event vertex in the case of thick target \n , a vertex algorithm will provide the event vertex to a comparable precision.]this point is always known and therefore the necessary and sufficient condition for a particle emanating from the target to have its momentum measured is that a @xmath19 segment can be measured by the combination of downstream ndc chambers . \n a measurement in the first ndc module is not strictly necessary to analyse the track momentum . ideally , one would like , of course , to connect a @xmath19 segment downstream with a @xmath19 segment in the ndc1 _ and _ the vertex point . however , the tracking efficiency of the upstream module is sizeable lower than the efficiency of the downstream modules . \n this is due to , a ) a higher hit density in ndc1 and b ) the lack of redundance due to the fact that there is only a single module upstream of the dipole . \n a too restrictive condition to accept a track such as matching a @xmath19 segment upstream of the dipole with a @xmath19 segment downstream results not only in lower efficiency , but also in a systematic error , arising from the uncertainties in the hit density expected in ndc1 which would be hard to estimate ( hit density depends on factors such as track multiplicity and opening angle , which are model - dependent ) . instead , by building a track _ \n always _ when a @xmath19 segment is present downstream of the dipole , one is practically independent of the tracking efficiency in ndc1 .    in order to quantify these considerations , \n we have considered three different types of tracks , depending on the matching between the downstream and upstream modules . \n type i is a @xmath19-@xmath19 matching . \n type ii matches a @xmath19 ( downstream ) with a @xmath18 ( upstream ) . \n type iii are those where one has been unable to find either a @xmath19 or a @xmath18 segment in ndc1 and thus the track is built using the downstream modules and the vertex constraint . \n particle identification ( pid ) in the forward region of the spectrometer combines the information provided by beam detectors and three systems located downstream the dipole magnet . \n namely , a threshold cherenkov detector ( ckov ) , a time  of  flight wall ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( electron identifier , eid ) . \n these subsystems have been described in ref . \n its combined information results in good pid over the whole range of relevant momenta , as well as redundancy due to overlaps . \n pion / proton separation is provided by tof up to @xmath20 , and by the ckov above @xmath21 . \n electron / pion separation is covered by the ckov below @xmath21 and by the eid above @xmath22 . \n finally the kaon contamination can be estimated with the ckov above @xmath21 and with the ( tof ) below this energy . \n about one sixth ( 1 million events ) of the `` k2k thin target '' data has been analysed . \n the unnormalised pion production differential cross section can be computed as follows :    @xmath23 \\label{eq : cross}\\ ] ]    where the sum runs over track types ( i = @xmath19-@xmath19 , ii= @xmath19-@xmath18 , iii=@xmath19-vertex ) and the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to true and reconstructed @xmath26 bins respectively . \n @xmath27 is the geometrical acceptance , @xmath28 is the tracking efficiency , @xmath29 is the migration matrix from reconstructed bin @xmath25 to true bin @xmath24 , @xmath30 is the pion identification efficiency , @xmath31 is the pion purity and @xmath32 is the observed pion yield . \n the pion purity is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of true observed pions in the bin @xmath25 , and @xmath35 is the number of particles misidentified as pions in the same bin @xmath25 . \n that means that @xmath31 is just the probability of correct identification of a pion . the pion identification efficiency , @xmath30 is the fraction of times that a tracked pion is identified as such . \n [ fig : down_eff_p_th ] shows the spectrometer acceptance . for clarity of ilustration , \n the momentum acceptance has been computed in the region of good angular acceptance , ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and conversely , the geometrical acceptance has been computed in the region of good momentum acceptance ( @xmath38 ) . as it can be seen \n the acceptance is good for pion momenta above 1 @xmath0 , and still acceptable above @xmath39 . as illustrated in ref . \n @xcite this permits the measurement of k2k neutrino fluxes up to @xmath40 , which amply covers the energy region where the atmospheric oscillation affects the neutrino spectrum maximally . \n the angular acceptance is also very well matched to k2k physics requirement .    the tracking efficiency is shown in fig . \n [ fig : track_eff_mc1_normalized_p_th ] as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . \n the contributions of track types i , ii and iii are normalized individually , so that the total efficiency is the sum of the three . notice that the loss in efficiency at low polar angles for tracks of type i ( due to saturation effects in ndc1 ) is largely compensated by tracks of type ii and iii , so that the total tracking efficiency is rather flat . \n finally , the yield must be corrected by the pion efficiency and purity , which is computed from the data themselves , using samples of pions , protons electrons and kaons of various energies tagged with the help of the beam detectors . the pion correction factor defined as the ratio of purity over efficiency \n is shown in fig . \n [ fig : pion_corr_factor ] , for the three track types and for 1.5 , 3 and 5 gev beam particles . \n preliminary studies show an almost diagonal migration matrix , where migration is mainly due to finite momentum and angular resolutions , but not to systematic effects ( momentum and angular biases , etc ) . \n figure  [ fig : cross ] shows the pion yields as a function of momentum after succesive corrections ( e.g. , acceptance , tracking efficiency and pion correction factor ) . \n no attempt to deconvolute the data ( e.g , correct for migrations ) have been done yet , and no absolute normalization is computed . \n we have presented a preliminary analysis of one of harp data samples , corresponding to a thin al target , at beam energies of @xmath43 . \n this analysis is relevant for the k2k experiment and a first step towards an upcoming measurement of the fully corrected production cross section . \n 99 the harp collaboration , cern - spsc/2003 - 027 , spsc - p-325 for a

{"ContextTokens": 3827, "GeneratedTokens": 220, "SynthesizedBody": "remarkable detection capabilities appearing in animal hearing are essentially governed by both a passive mechanical and an active biophysical procedures in the cochlea  @xcite . \n the active amplification of the living cochlea was conjectured by gold in 1948  @xcite and is now qualitatively studied widely through the hopf equation in mathematical models  @xcite . in order to give a better understanding to the experimental observations , \n a more accurate model is required . \n furthermore the physical origin of the active oscillation remains still unclear . in mammals , the outer hair cells ( ohcs ) \n are known to be force generators for auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity . proposed mechanisms of the force generation \n are contraction of the ohc itself  @xcite and an active motion of the hair bundle  @xcite . \n energy depot model can describe the active phenomena  @xcite , because the energy supplied by the depot can induce a negative dissipation . a similar mechanism for a negative stiffness in the bullfrog s hair bundle \n has been reported  @xcite . \n it is reasonable to consider the ohc as an energy depot since the ohcs play an important role in the active amplification of the cochlea even though we do not know the exact mechanism of the energy supply . in nature \n all living things have some mechanisms of protection for survival . \n we expect that there might be a similar mechanism to protect cochlea from damage by any external factors such as loud stimulation . \n hence , we propose a braking mechanism in the cochlea to prevent the basilar membrane ( bm ) from an excessive oscillation which could damage the cochlea . \n for this purpose , a critical velocity of the ohc oscillation will be introduced in our model .    in the following sections , we describe our model and reproduce the essential phenomena of the active cochlea observed in recent experiments such as the compressive nonlinearity , the dynamics of the bm response , nonlinear distortion and the spontaneous bm oscillation ( sbmo ) . \n it will also be pointed ut that our model naturally includes the hopf bifurcation model  @xcite in the case of weak stimulation . however , in the regime of strong stimulation , the present model is essentially different from the hopf bifurcation model . \n it shows that the response of the bm is non - linear and compressive at the cf . \n ( note that the slope of the solid line is less than one . ) otherwise , the response of the bm is a linear function of the stimulation yielding that the slopes are @xmath0 . \n these results agree with the experimental observations  @xcite . ] \n it is well known that a change of transmembrane potential in the ohc induces a somatic vibration . \n this implies that a part of the electric energy is converted into the mechanical energy . in this sense , we believe that the ohc functions as an energy depot for the bm . \n the ohc as the energy depot stores energy supplied and converts it into kinetic energy overcoming dissipation . \n this energetics can be described by the following energy balance equation  @xcite . \n @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy density of the energy depot , @xmath3 the rate of the energy pumping into the energy depot per unit area , @xmath4 the rate of the internal energy dissipation , @xmath5 the rate of the energy converting into the kinetic energy of the bm , and @xmath6 the velocity of the bm . considering that constant contribution of @xmath5 can be incooperated into @xmath4 and that conversion rate of the energy into the kinetic energy of the bm will not be sensitive to the sign of @xmath6 , we assume that @xmath5 is an even function of @xmath6 without a constant term . the energy depot model in which @xmath7 has been extensively discussed  @xcite . in this paper , we include the next higher contribution to @xmath5 and introduce a critical velocity of the bm to describe a braking mechanism  @xcite . \n hence the conversion rate @xmath5 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical velocity . \n for a finite @xmath9 the oscillation of the bm can be braked by the negative conversion rate into the kinetic motion of the bm . \n note that @xmath10 corresponds to a system without the braking mechanism . \n the critical velocity will be roughly estimated from the contraction of the ohc later for our numerical calculation . \n khz and the stimulation is @xmath11db . \n the onset time is much shorter than the offset time which is not shown in full scale . \n this result is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations  @xcite . \n @xmath12kgm@xmath13s@xmath14 , @xmath15m@xmath13s@xmath16 , and @xmath17 . \n the

velocity of the bm is ( not ) saturated when the stimulation is sufficiently large with ( without ) the braking mechanism . ] \n now it is worthwhile to compare our newly proposed model with the one previously introduced in ref .  @xcite . whereas we treat the energy density ( @xmath2 ) of the energy depot(ohc ) , in ref . \n @xcite the energy density ( @xmath28 ) of the propagating hydrodynamic wave is considered . \n the model in ref . \n @xcite describes the coupling of the active elements to the propagating wave , while the present model describes the coupling between the energy depot(ohc ) and the bm oscillation . \n the emphasis in this paper is on showing that the active and compressive response arises naturally from the generalized energy depot concept . \n an adiabatic approximation in which the adaptation of the energy depot is very fast  @xcite yields that @xmath29 it should bear in mind that @xmath2 is not constant . \n the oscillation of the bm is then governed by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density , @xmath32 the physical damping coefficient , @xmath33 the stiffness , and @xmath34 the displacement of the bm . \n @xmath35 includes the contributions of a sound wave ( external stimulation ) and a noise . \n the noise is assumed to be a gaussian white noise . \n @xmath36 is the active force density acting on the bm by the ohc , @xmath37 note that the langevin equation , eq . \n ( [ full ] ) , describes the passive and the active response in a unified and natural way . \n it should be noted that the active force , eq . \n ( [ active ] ) , can be either positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath6 . when @xmath38 is smaller than @xmath39 ( weak stimulation ) , a positive active force \n is provided on the bm ( active mechanism ) . on the other hand , when @xmath38 is larger than @xmath39 ( strong stimulation ) , a negative active force , hence an extra drag force , is exerted on the bm ( braking mechanism ) . \n the mass density of the bm is known to be about @xmath40kg / m@xmath16  @xcite and the reported damping coefficient , @xmath32 , of the bm has a large variation from @xmath41 to @xmath42 kg m@xmath13s@xmath14  @xcite depending on the models . for a numerical calculation \n , we set the damping in the range of @xmath43 kg m@xmath13s@xmath14 . \n it has been reported that the guinea pig ohcs are able to change its length up to @xmath44 when the transmembrane potential is varied . \n this corresponds to a displacement of @xmath45 m for the ohcs of @xmath46 m at the high - frequency end  @xcite . \n hence , in the regime of high frequency of @xmath47khz , the adjustable parameter @xmath9 is roughly estimated about @xmath48 m/s . by considering the ohc as a capacitor and using the observed membrane potential , membrane capacitance  @xcite , and the scale of the ohc  @xcite , we estimate the value of @xmath3 to be about @xmath48 kg s@xmath49 . \n the response of the bm to the sound wave can be then obtained straightforwardly using eqs . \n ( [ full ] ) and  ( [ active ] ) . in the following calculations , we set @xmath50 and the characteristic frequency ( cf ) , @xmath51 . it will be shown later that these relations arise from the conditions of the hopf bifurcation . in the present calculations , \n the noise width of the distribution is chosen to be zero db . \n the compressive and dynamical responses of the bm are obtained as shown in fig . \n [ compressive ] and fig . \n [ dyn ] , respectively . \n [ compressive ] demonstrates that the response of the bm is non - linear and compressive at the cf , while the response is linear at other frequencies . \n this compressive response of the bm agrees well with the observations  @xcite as expected . \n [ dyn ] shows the time course of the bm response , reproducing the experimental observation that the onset time of the response is shorter than the offset time , although the onset time is somewhat larger than the experimental values  @xcite . \n it is important to notice that the velocity of the bm increases continuously as long as the stimulation is being turned on if the braking mechanism is not included @xmath52 . \n hence , the braking mechanism introduced in our model is essential to explain the experimental observation at a sufficiently strong stimulation . \n a dependence of the bm velocity on @xmath9 is plotted in fig . \n the results clearly show that lower critical velocity produces smaller response at the same stimulation , thus producing a supercompressive behavior as observed in experiment  @xcite . \n this is the effect of the braking mechanism , which is significantly different from the hopf bifurcation model . \n note that the saturation of the bm response disappears if the braking mechanism is not considered . \n , the brownian fluctuation is suppressed , while in the region of @xmath53 , the brownian fluctuation is amplified . for the plots , \n the intensity of the thermal noise is @xmath54pa , and the strength of the fluctuation is @xmath54db . \n ( a ) @xmath55kgm@xmath13s@xmath14 , @xmath56 m/s . \n ( b ) @xmath57kgm@xmath13s@xmath14 , @xmath22 m/s . ]    khz , @xmath58khz , both strengths of the stimulation are @xmath11db , the response is measured at the place where the @xmath59khz , @xmath60m@xmath16/s@xmath16 and @xmath23kgm@xmath13s@xmath14 . ] \n the gain of the oscillator is defined as the ratio of the displacement of the bm to the stimulation , @xmath61 using eq . \n ( [ full ] ) , we obtain the gain , which is a scaling function of the stimulation when the stimulation is not too large , @xmath62 . \n this result agrees well with the experiment  @xcite and the result of the hopf bifurcation model  @xcite , @xmath63 . \n indeed our model includes the hopf model naturally . to show this , we expand the active force , eq . \n ( [ active ] ) , up to the lowest nonlinear term when @xmath64 is small . \n ( [ full ] ) is then approximately written as @xmath65 in the fourier spectra space , this directly corresponds to the hopf equation  @xcite with the following bifurcation conditions , @xmath66 hence our energy depot model with a braking mechanism reduces to the hopf bifurcation model in the limit of weak stimulation . \n one of the most important results of our model is an amplification of the thermal noise itself in the absence of an external stimulation . at the bifurcation point or when @xmath67 , the thermal noise is well suppressed . \n however , when @xmath68 , so that too much of the internal energy is converted into the

and hydra a , mcnamara et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the reason we wanted to use pressure balance between thermal and non - thermal plasmas is that this procedure provides an estimate of the non - thermal pressure which can be compared to that obtained from the usual synchrotron formulae assuming equipartition between the energies in relativistic particles and the magnetic field . \n it is then possible to evaluate the likelihood for various values of the critical synchrotron parameters . to do this confidently \n , we require that unmeasurable ram pressures be negligible and that by defining various areas of the radio source , we can infer the emitting volumes . \n we use the redshift of 3c129.1 ( z=0.0208 , spinrad , 1975 ) as the distance indicator of the cluster , and with h@xmath1=65  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , one arcsec corresponds to 450  pc . \n the x - ray emission from the cluster gas is shown in fig . \n it is relatively smooth unlike the clumpy distribution seen for the gas around the radio galaxies hydra a ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) and m84 ( finoguenov & jones , 2001 ) . \n we performed a spectral deprojection analysis ( krawczynski 2002 ) and @xmath3 model fits to the radial distributions in two pie sections are shown in fig .  2 . \n from these data we can obtain the thermal pressure as a function of distance from the cluster center which was judged to lie @xmath4 sw of 3c129.1 . \n it seems likely that the cluster has suffered a recent merger because the gas distribution is significantly elliptical ( figs .  1 and 2 ) ; the cluster contains a radio galaxy with a long tail ; and we find no evidence for a cooling flow ( krawczynski , 2002 ) ; \n the calculation of minimum non - thermal pressure involves 4 components : the assumption of equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field ; the assumption that the filling factor is 1 ; the assumption that protons do not contribute significantly to the particle energy ; and the assumption that most of the relativistic electrons have been counted when the synchrotron luminosity is integrated over some frequency range . \n if any of these assumptions are violated , the total non - thermal pressure will be greater than the minimum value .    while the usual invocation of equipartition leads to the classical @xmath5 power for the pressure s dependence on the filling factor and the proton energy density \n , we should not forget that if we were to abandon equipartition and argue that we knew the average magnetic field strength from some other method ( e.g. detection of inverse compton emission from a known photon distribution ) , then the dependence is linear . \n compare the basic equation for the total pressure with the expression for the minimum non - thermal pressure . \n @xmath6    for the field which minimizes the total pressure , b@xmath7    @xmath8^{\\frac{4}{7}}\\ ] ]    where + @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11 is the filling factor for the emitting volume , v ; k is the ratio of particle energy densities ( protons to electrons ) , and @xmath12 is the amplitude of the radiation power law : @xmath13 . \n it is also the case that various conditions can be chosen instead of the classical equipartition ( particle energy density equals magnetic field energy density ) . \n we have chosen to use the magnetic field strength which minimizes the total pressure , b@xmath7 \n . other choices which can change the value of the field by factors of up to 1.48 include assuming the field is smooth or tangled and equalizing pressures instead of minimizing the total pressure , or equalizing the energy densities instead of minimizing the total energy ( see the appendix of harris et al . \n 1995 , for further details ) . \n we have chosen regions in 3c129.1 and 3c129 on the basis of minimizing uncertainties in converting rectangular areas to cylindrical volumes and circular areas to spherical volumes ( i.e. we chose regions for which the assumption that the depth dimension can be found from transverse dimensions is most likely valid ) . these regions are shown in fig .  3 . \n flux densities for these regions were measured at 0.33 , 1.4 , 5 , and 8 ghz . \n spectral indices were determined for single or broken power laws from these flux densities as well as from spectral index maps produced by scaled arrays ( 5 and 8 ghz , taylor et al . \n 2001 ) and from the similar uv coverage of our 0.33 and 1.4 ghz data .. details of this analysis can be found in krawczynski et al . \n ( 2003 ) . \n the results are shown in fig .  4 and given in table  1 and it is immediately clear that the minimum non - thermal pressures are almost always less than the thermal pressures , and that the difference for most regions is a factor of order 0.5 .    llcll number & region & p@xmath14 & p@xmath15 & p@xmath15 + & & 10@xmath16cgs & @xmath17  hz & @xmath18  hz + 1 & 129.1 : n rectangle & 6.0 & 5.37 & 2.15 + 2 & 129.1 : n inner & 21.2 & 1.60 & 1.20 + 3 & 129.1 : s inner & 24.3 & 1.46 & 0.80 + 4 & 129 : inner arm & 3.70 & 2.08 & 1.66 + 5 & 129 : w eye & 2.26 & 3.31 & 2.36 + 6 & 129 : e eye & 2.30 & 3.45 & 2.79 + 7 & 129 : 4 am & 0.48 & 18.0 & 13.5 + 8 & 129 : 8.9am & 0.74 & 4.45 & 2.16 + 9 & 129 : 10.5am & 0.59 & 5.25 & 2.08 + 10 & 129 : 12.7am & 0.92 & 3.27 & 0.76 +    notes to table    the thermal pressures at each location use the temperature from the spectral deprojection and the density from the deprojection ( weight 2 ) and @xmath3 model fit ( weight 1 ) . \n the non - thermal pressures were calculated by selecting the magnetic field strength which minimizes the total pressure , taking the filling factor , @xmath11=1 , negligible energy density from protons ( k=0 ) ; and integrating the synchrotron luminosity down to @xmath17 ( columns 3 & 4 ) or 10@xmath19  hz ( column 5 ) . \n given the uncertainties in calculating various pressures , we find it remarkable that the thermal and non - thermal pressures are so close to each other for most of the regions selected . extending the integration of the synchrotron spectrum down to 1 mhz ( and thereby including electrons with lorentz factors in the range @xmath20  =  100 to 500 ) increases the minimum non - thermal pressures to values only a factor of two less than the thermal estimates for most regions . \n this factor of two is easy to obtain for example by invoking a value of the filling factor , @xmath21 . \n taken at face value , the small factors between the thermal and non - thermal pressures indicate that we can not accommodate large values of k ( expected if relativistic protons are present ) ; significant departures from equipartition ( as hypothesized in a different context to facilitate explanations of excess euv emission as ic emission , bowyer , this volume ) ; anomalous numbers of low energy electrons ( i.e. an excess over the extrapolation to low energies from the electron spectra inferred from the radio data ) ;

\n a definitive answer to this question is still missing . \n there are , however , a few clues . \n if a cs potential has discontinuous forces it presents two liquid phases but no density anomaly  @xcite is observed . \n however , once the cs potential is modified to have continuous forces , the anomalies appear  @xcite .    recently it has been proposed that a cs potential exhibits density anomaly if the two length scales identified with the softened region would be accessible  @xcite what can be understood as follows . the radial distribution , @xmath11 of a cs potential has peaks at @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two length scales of the cs potential  @xcite . if @xmath16 the model is introduced and the simulation details are presented . in sec . \n [ sec : results ] the pressure - temperature phase diagram is presented together with the behavior of the radial distribution function with density and temperature . \n conclusions are presented in sec . \n [ sec : conclusions ] . \n our system consists of @xmath17 identical particles interacting through a continuous pair potential obtained by the addition of @xmath18 different fermi - dirac distributions  @xcite , @xmath19 the resulting expression describes a family of pair interaction potentials discriminated by different choices of the parameters @xmath20 . \n appropriated choices of the parameters allow us to obtain potentials that go from a smooth two length scales potential to a sharp , almost discontinuous , square potential  @xcite .    in the table  [ table : ref ] \n nine different sets of parameters are shown , organized in three families named , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . \n as shown in figure  [ fig : potential ] , for each family a specific characteristic of pair interaction potential is tuned . \n then it is possible to test the effect of changing the two length scales in the pressure temperature phase diagram .    in the potentials \n @xmath21 the slope between the two length scales is varied . \n then it is possible to check if the slope between the two length scales controls the location in the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the density anomalous region as suggested by yan et al . \n @xcite .    in the case of the potentials \n @xmath22 , the attractive length becomes broader . consequently using this potential we test if increasing the range of the attraction leads to a decrease in the critical pressure as proposed by skibinsky et al . \n @xcite .    in the case of the potentials \n @xmath23 , the repulsive length scale becomes broader . \n therefore this family of potentials is appropriated to observe if the enlargement of the repulsive length scale leads to a decrease in the liquid - liquid critical pressure and to an increase in the liquid - liquid critical temperature as suggested by skibinsky et al . \n in addition to verify the assumptions of yan et al . \n @xcite and of skibinsky et al . \n @xcite related to criticality , these three families of potentials are the perfect scenario to check our hypothesis that the density anomaly region in the pressure - temperature phase diagram is delimited by properties of the radial distribution function at the two length scales .            .parameters for potentials @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in reduced units of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .

called `` pattern flooding '' problem @xcite . \n a way of dealing with pattern flooding is to search for equivalence classes of itemsets , i.e. itemsets shared by the same set of objects ( or having the same image ) . for an equivalence class , there is one maximal itemset , which corresponds to a `` closed set '' , and possibly several minimal elements corresponding to `` generators '' ( or `` key itemsets '' ) . from these elements , families of association rules \n can be extracted . \n these itemsets are also related to fca , where a concept lattice is built from a binary context and where formal concepts are closed sets of objects and attributes . \n the present work is rooted both in fca and pattern mining with the objective of extracting interval patterns from numerical data . \n our approach is based on `` pattern structures '' where complex descriptions can be associated with objects . in  @xcite \n we introduced closed interval patterns in the context of gene expression data mining . \n intuitively , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , each dimension corresponding to a range of values of a given attribute ; it is closed when composed of the smallest intervals characterizing a same set of objects .    in the present paper , we complete and extend this first attempt . considering numerical data , some general characteristics of equivalence classes remain , e.g. one maximal element which is a closed pattern and possibly several generators which are minimal patterns w.r.t . a subsumption relation defined on patterns . \n we show that directly extracting patterns data from numerical is more efficient using pattern structures than working on binary data with associated scaling procedures . \n we also provide a semantics to interval patterns in the euclidean space , design and experiment algorithms to extract frequent closed interval patterns and their generators . \n the problem of mining patterns in numerical data is usually referred as quantitative itemset / association rule mining  @xcite . \n generally , an appropriate discretization splits attribute ranges into intervals maximizing some interest functions , e.g. support , confidence . however \n , none of these works covers the notion of equivalence classes , closed patterns , and generators , and this is one of the originality of the present paper . \n the plan of the paper is as follows . \n firstly , we introduce the problem of mining numerical data and interval patterns . \n then , we recall the basics of fca and interordinal scaling . \n we pose a number of questions that we propose to answer using our framework of interval pattern structures dealing with numerical data . \n we then detail two original algorithms for extracting closed interval patterns and their generators . \n these algorithms are evaluated in the last section on real - world data . \n finally , we end the paper in discussing related work and giving perspectives to the present research work . as a complement , an extended version of this paper \n is given in  @xcite , providing algorithms pseudo - code and a longer discussion on the usefulness of interval patterns in classification problems and privacy preserving data - mining . \n we propose a definition of interval patterns for numerical data . \n intuitively , each object of a numerical dataset corresponds to a vector of numbers , where each dimension stands for an attribute . \n accordingly , an interval pattern is a vector of intervals , and each dimension describes the range of a numerical attribute . \n we only consider finite intervals and that the set of attributes / dimensions is assumed to bed ( canonically ) ordered . \n a numerical dataset is given by a set of objects @xmath0 , a set of numerical attributes @xmath1 , where the range of @xmath2 is a finite set noted @xmath3 . \n @xmath4 means that @xmath5 is the value of attribute @xmath6 for object @xmath7 .    .a \n numerical dataset . \n [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in both cases , using binary data is better when the minimal support is high ( e.g. 90% ) . for low supports , a critical issue , our algorithms deliver better execution times . \n most importantly , the global redundancy effect discards the use of binary data , e.g. only @xmath8 of all fisg are actually fipg in dataset bl . \n finally , the algorithm _ minintchangeg - t _ outperforms _ minintchangeg - h_. _ minintchangeg - t _ however needs more memory since it stores each closed set of objects as a word in the trie , and to each word the list of associated fipg . \n it is very interesting to analyse the compression ability of closed interval patterns and generators . \n for that , we compare in each dataset the number of those patterns w.r.t . to all possible interval patterns . \n it gives the ratio of closed ( generators ) in the whole search space . in both cases , \n ratio varies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n this means that the volume of useful interval patterns , either closed or generators , is very low w.r.t . \n the set of all possible interval patterns , justifying our interest in equivalence classes for interval patterns . \n we discussed the important problem of pattern discovery in numerical data with a new and original formalization of interval patterns . \n the classical fca / itemset - mining settings are adapted accordingly : from a closure operator naturally rise the notions of equivalence classes , closed and generator patterns , and we designed corresponding algorithms . \n an appropriate semantics of interval patterns shows from a theoretical ( redundancy ) and practical ( computation times ) points of view that mining equivalent binary data ( encoding all possible intervals ) is not acceptable . \n this is due to the fact that interval patterns are provided with a stronger partial ordering than is - itemsets ( classical set inclusion ) , hence pattern structures yield significantly less generators w.r.t . \n their semantics .    dealing with interval patterns has applications in computational geometry , machine learning and data - mining , e.g.  @xcite and references therein . \n it is indeed highly related to the actual problem of ( maximal ) @xmath11-boxes which corresponds to interval patterns ( generators ) with support @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , it corresponds to largest empty subspaces of the data . \n our contribution to this field is the characterization of smaller subsets ( closed and generators ) .    in data - mining , \n closed patterns and their generators are crucial for extracting valid and informative association rules  @xcite , while generators can be preferable to closed patterns following the minimum descriptions length principle for so - called itemset - based classifiers  @xcite . \n how these notions can be shifted to interval patterns is an original perspective of research rising questions concerning missing values , fault - tolerant patterns , and interestingness measures that are critical issues even in classical itemset mining : although the compression ability of closed interval patterns and generators is spectacular , the number of patterns remains too high for large datasets . \n however , bringing the problem of numerical pattern mining into well known settings in favor of these perspectives of research . \n e.  boros , k.  elbassioni , v.  gurvich , l.  khachiyan , and k.  makino . \n an intersection inequality for discrete distributions and related generation problems . in _ international colloquium on automata , languages and programming ( icalp ) _ , lncs ( 2749 ) , pages 543555 . \n springer , 2003 . \n j.  li , h.  li , l.  wong , j.  pei , and g.  dong . \n minimum description length principle : generators are preferable to closed patterns . in _ innovative applications of artificial intelligence conference_. \n aaai press , 2006 .", "StartTimeOffset": 205018941431, "RequestID": "b173cfc77e2b43b2a5eba86672386689", "TotalTokens": 2006}

robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime with non - relativistic matter ( dust ) on the inside . \n the schwarzschild and frw spacetimes have two different coordinate systems which must be matched along the boundary . \n this difficulty can be overcome @xcite through a coordinate transformation which allows the full spacetime to be covered by a single coordinate system . \n however a more serious difficulty is that pressureless dust is not a good model of how matter behaves in the extreme conditions of singularity formation . \n so the properties of dust singularities tell us very little about the properties of generic singularities . \n ideally , one would like to check the bkl conjecture by treating the gravitational collapse of a more realistic matter model , like a scalar field , using a single coordinate system that follows the formation of the black hole and the singularity . \n as a preliminary step in that direction , we perform numerical simulations of the behavior of a test massive scalar field on the spacetime of @xcite using the coordinates of @xcite . \n the relevant equations and numerical methods are described in section 2 , while results are presented and discussed in section 3 . \n a spherically symmetric spacetime can be put in the form @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the usual area coordinate , while @xmath2 is a time coordinate chosen so that @xmath3 . \n we now show how to put the schwarzschild and frw metrics in this form . \n the schwarzschild metric in the usual coordinates is @xmath4 we wish to express @xmath5 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 so that the metric takes the form of eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) . \n some straightforward but tedious algebra shows that the expression @xmath6\\ ] ] yields a metric of the form of eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) with @xmath7 the spatially flat dust frw spacetime has the metric @xmath8 ) \\label{frw}\\ ] ] with the scale factor @xmath9 given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant . \n we wish to perform a coordinate transformation that gives this metric the form of eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) . comparing the angular parts of the metric \n , it is clear that we must have @xmath12 . \n it is then straightforward to show that with @xmath13 the metric of eqn . \n ( [ frw ] ) takes the form of eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) with @xmath14    the collapse takes place at negative times and is complete at @xmath15 . \n the boundary between the interior frw part of the spacetime and the exterior schwarzschild part is given by @xmath16 . \n for some function @xmath17 . since the metric , and \n therefore @xmath18 must be continuous across the boundary , we have @xmath19 thus the spacetime metric is given by eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) with @xmath20 given by eqn ( [ schpsi ] ) for @xmath21 and @xmath20 given by eqn . \n ( [ frwpsi ] ) for @xmath22 . \n we wish to simulate the klein - gordon equation on this spacetime assuming spherical symmetry for the scalar field . \n that is , we want a scalar field @xmath23 that satisfies @xmath24 for a metric of the form of eqn . \n ( [ pgmetric ] ) the klein - gordon equation for a spherically symmetric scalar field becomes @xmath25 for the numerical method used , we put this equation in first order form : we introduce the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 given by @xmath28 from the definitions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 it immediately follows that @xmath29 while eqn . \n ( [ kg ] ) becomes @xmath30    the equations to be evolved are eqns . \n ( [ dtphi]-[kg1 ] ) . \n we evolve using finite differences , where each scalar @xmath31 is represented by the quantities @xmath32 . \n spatial derivatives are evaluated using standard centered differences , that is @xmath33 however , to maintain accuracy near the origin , the quantity @xmath34 requires special treatment . \n we define @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath37 and @xmath38 . \n correspondingly we define @xmath39 and @xmath40 . \n then we use the finite difference @xmath41 the quantity @xmath18 and its derivatives are evaluated analytically using the formulas in eqns . \n ( [ schpsi ] ) and ( [ frwpsi ] ) . \n ( [ dtphi]-[kg1 ] ) are evolved using a three step iterated crank -

gordon equation ( [ kleingordon ] ) in the untransformed frw metric and coordinates given by eqns . \n ( [ frw ] ) and ( [ adust ] ) . keeping only terms containing time derivatives , we find @xmath67 the general solution of this equation is @xmath68    @xmath43 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for @xmath47 at @xmath69 ( solid)@xmath70 ( dashed ) and @xmath66 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath43 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for @xmath49 at @xmath69 ( solid)@xmath70 ( dashed ) and @xmath66 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath71 _ vs _ \n @xmath72 for @xmath47 at @xmath69 ( solid)@xmath70 ( dashed ) and @xmath66 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath71 _ vs _ \n @xmath72 for @xmath49 at @xmath69 ( solid)@xmath70 ( dashed ) and @xmath66 ( dotted ) ]    for some functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 . \n in particular , the bkl conjecture leads us to expect that as the singularity is approached , @xmath75 should approach a function of @xmath76 . \n note , that expressed in terms of the @xmath77 coordinates of our simulation , we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 . \n thus , we are led to expect that as the singularity is approached , if we plot @xmath71 _ vs _ @xmath72 the plots should approach some limiting profile as @xmath80 . to see whether that expectation is realized , \n such plots are given in figure [ fig6 ] for @xmath47 and [ fig7 ] for @xmath49 . \n these figures are consistent with @xmath71 approaching a limit as the singularity is approached . however , in order to be more definite , we need to approach the singularity more closely . \n the results of simulations which show the scalar field at times closer to the singularity are shown in figures [ fig8]-[fig11 ] . here \n figure [ fig8 ] shows @xmath43 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for @xmath47 and the times @xmath81 and @xmath82 . \n figure [ fig9 ] shows @xmath43 _ vs _ @xmath1 at the same times for the @xmath49 case . \n the corresponding rescaled quantities , that is @xmath71 _ vs _ @xmath72 are shown in figure [ fig10 ] for @xmath47 and in figure [ fig11 ] for @xmath49 . \n @xmath43 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for @xmath47 at @xmath83 ( solid)@xmath84 ( dashed ) and @xmath82 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath43 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for @xmath49 at @xmath83 ( solid)@xmath84 ( dashed ) and @xmath82 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath71 _ vs _ \n @xmath72 for @xmath47 at @xmath83 ( solid)@xmath84 ( dashed ) and @xmath82 ( dotted ) ]    @xmath71 _ vs _ \n @xmath72 for @xmath49 at @xmath83 ( solid)@xmath84 ( dashed ) and @xmath82 ( dotted ) ]    it is clear from figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] that @xmath71 approaches a limit as the singularity is approached . since this is just what one would expect from the bkl conjecture , our simulations lend support to the notion that the bkl conjecture holds , not only in the extensively studied case of closed cosmologies , but also in the more physically interesting case of asymptotically flat spacetimes . to explore this issue \n further , it would be helpful to go beyond the case of a test scalar field on a background spacetime . \n in particular , one could treat the collapse of a self - gravitating scalar field using the method of@xcite and see whether the singularity produced in the collapse satisfies the bkl conjecture . \n the work of dg was supported by nsf grant phy-0855532 to oakland university . \n rs and ra are supported by a grant from the us department of energy .", "StartTimeOffset": 220914416365, "RequestID": "60d99ca78609449c94dca3b23b776fc5", "TotalTokens": 3576}
{"ContextTokens": 4093, "GeneratedTokens": 139, "SynthesizedBody": "galaxy interactions have been known for a long time to trigger star formation , although both observations and numerical simulations have shown that the enhancement of star formation depends , among other factors , on the orbital geometry of the encounter . in some situations interactions \n might even suppress star formation . \n hence , the star formation properties of interacting systems may serve as a clue to their interaction history .    here \n we analyse the star formation properties of three nearby galaxy systems in differing evolutionary phases : the weakly interacting triplet am 1238 - 362 @xcite , the strongly interacting compact galaxy group scg 0018 - 4854 @xcite , and the merging compact group cg j1720 - 67.8 @xcite . \n the first two systems are at comparable distances ( 48 and 45.5 mpc , respectively , assuming h@xmath1 = 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , close enough to allow us to study the luminosity and size distribution of the hii regions in the individual galaxies . \n the third system , at a distance of 180 mpc , does not offer us the possibility to study the properties of individual hii regions . \n however , the general distribution of the ionized gas across the whole group and its velocity field can be used to guess the evolutionary status of the group . \n we interpret our ( in some cases still preliminary ) results taking into account star formation properties of other nearby galaxies @xcite and numerical simulations from the literature ( e.g. mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 ) . \n am 1238 - 362 is a fairly tight triple system composed by two nearly face - on ( eso 381-g009 and tol 1238 - 36.4 ) and an edge - on ( eso 381-g006 ) spiral galaxies ( fig . \n [ am_a ] ) . a detailed study of the morphological and spectrophotometric properties of the two face - on galaxies has been presented in temporin et al . \n ( 2003a ) , where the interaction signatures and star formation properties have been discussed in the framework of the evolutionary history of the system . \n the two galaxies exhibit enhanced star formation activity , and the radial and azimuthal distribution of their h@xmath0 emission show a tendency for both disks to concentrate the star formation activity on the side facing the companion ( see temporin et al . \n 2003a , fig . \n 20 ) . here \n we make use of h@xmath0 narrow - band imaging obtained at the eso - mpia 2.2 m telescope ( see the above cited work for details on observations and data reduction ) to further investigate the star formation properties of these mildly interacting galaxies . in particular we measured the h@xmath0 luminosities and the sizes of the individual hii regions in order to analyse their luminosity functions ( lfs ) and size distributions . \n the regions were identified and measured in automated way with the hiiphot algorithm @xcite , choosing as a detection threshold a signal - to - noise ratio s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . the lfs are shown in fig . \n weighted least square fits to the regions in the luminosity range where lfs were believed to be complete were obtained assuming a standard power - law distribution with index @xmath0 . \n similarly we obtained power - law fits to the size distributions of the hii regions . \n the slope @xmath5 of the size distribution is expected to be related to that of the lf by the relation @xmath6 @xcite . for tol 1238 - 36.4 , a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) classified as an sb(rs)bc \n , we obtained @xmath0 = @xmath7 2.36@xmath80.16 , in good agreement with expectations for its morphological type @xcite , and @xmath5 = @xmath7 4.61@xmath80.62 , in agreement ( within errors ) with the above relation . \n however , we observe a uniform shift of the lf towards higher luminosities by about one order of magnitude with respect to other nearby star - forming spiral galaxies ( e.g. thilker et al . 2002 ) . \n this feature of the lf is typical of lirgs ( see also alonso - herrero , these proceedings ) . in this particular case \n , the high luminosity of the hii regions could be a consequence of the increased star formation activity triggered by the interaction . \n since the influence of the agn is mostly confined within the central kpc @xcite , we rule out the possibility of a significant cotribution to the ionization by the central agn . for eso 381-g009 \n , the slope of the lf strongly depends on the choice of the fitted luminosity range . \n the steeper slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath72.17@xmath80.34 ) shown in fig . \n [ am_b ] , obtained for regions with @xmath9(l@xmath10 ) @xmath3 39.5 , is in good agreement with the slope of the size distribution . \n the h@xmath0 image revealed also the presence of 12 emission - line point - like sources in the intergalactic space . \n their projected distances to the nearest galaxy range between 12 and 68 kpc and their h@xmath0 luminosities are in the range 0.6 - 7.4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath2 . \n these could be intergalactic hii regions similar to those recently found in other interacting systems or around cluster galaxies @xcite . \n this strongly interacting galaxy group is composed by a tight quartet @xcite and a concordant redshift spiral galaxy ( eso 194-g13 ) @xmath13 12 arcmin apart . all members exhibit strong signs of disturbances , the most outstanding being the @xmath13 30 kpc - long tidal tail of ngc 92 . here \n we present a preliminary analysis of the h@xmath0 images of the 5 galaxies . \n the observations were carried out in 2002 september and 2003 january at the eso - vlt - ut4 telescope equipped with fors2 . \n the h@xmath0 images were reduced in a standard way and flux - calibrated by means of a standard star observed during the same nights , taking into account the filter transmission curve and the contribution from the [ nii ] @xmath14 6548 , 6583 emission lines . \n appropriately scaled r - band images were used for the continuum subtraction .    in three of the galaxies , \n individual hii regions were detected in sufficient number to allow us the construction of lfs and size distributions ( fig . \n [ lf_scg0018 ] ) . the same method described in section  2 was adopted . \n a more detailed analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper . \n the lf of ngc 92 exhibit a considerable flattening at the high luminosity end . \n this effect is not shared by the companion galaxies , so it might be a real feature , rather than an artificial effect due to source blending . \n when the highest luminosity hii regions are excluded from the fit of the lf , we obtain a slope @xmath0 = @xmath71.73@xmath80.11 consistent with the morphological type and in agreement , within errors , with the observed size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.71@xmath80.54 ) . \n some excess of relatively high luminosity hii regions is observed also in eso 194-g13 , but we can not exclude that this smaller effect is due to source blending , especially in the central part of the galaxy , where the spatial density of hii regions appears higher . the observed size distribution is steeper than expected ( @xmath5 = @xmath75.46@xmath80.40 ) , if the slope of the lf , @xmath0 = @xmath71.90@xmath80.37 , is considered . \n the lf of ngc 87 is based on the only 56 hii regions detected with s / n @xmath3 5@xmath4 . also in this case the lf slope ( @xmath0 = @xmath71.55@xmath80.11 ) , \n although consistent with the late morphological type of the galaxy ( ibm pec ) , does not agree with the slope of the size distribution ( @xmath5 = @xmath73.57@xmath80.73 ) . \n for the two remaining galaxies no hii region lf could be built . \n none the less , the h@xmath0 images show interesting features . \n ngc 88 , apart from the bulk of emission stemming from its central part , shows h@xmath0 emission in two plume - like features . \n ngc 89 , besides hosting a seyfert 2 nucleus , shows a ring of circumnuclear hii regions and two - sided extraplanar h@xmath0 emitting features , including a jet - like structure with a projected length of @xmath13 4 kpc whose nature is yet to be established ( fig . \n [ lf_scg0018 ] ) . \n this extremely dense , low velocity dispersion compact group is composed by two actively star - forming spirals and one lenticular galaxy with a small amount of central star formation @xcite . \n a @xmath13 29 kpc - long tidal tail hosts a number of candidate proto - tidal dwarf galaxies @xcite . as shown in the h@xmath0 map ( fig . \n [ hamap ] ) reconstructed from integral field spectra obtained at the aat 3.9 m telescope ( see temporin , staveley - smith , &  kerber 2004 for a detailed description and analysis of the data set ) , the star formation activity is spread all across the group , with as much as 31 per cent of the entire h@xmath0 emission stemming from the long tidal tail . \n such an activity is clearly related to the undergoing merging process . \n the velocity field of the ionized gas ( fig . \n [ vfield ] ) helps constraining the group dynamics and favours the idea of a prograde - retrograde @xmath15 200 myr - old encounter between the two spiral galaxies . while the estimated age of the tidal tail well agrees with the burst age of the two spiral galaxies , the knots in the tidal tail show evidence of more recent star formation events ( < 10 myr ) , supporting the idea that the condensations of gas and stars have formed under the action of self - gravity within the tail \n all three systems , although in different phases of interaction , present a clear enhancement of star formation , which appears related to the interaction process . \n this suggests encounter geometries favouring the onset of bursts of star formation @xcite . \n the slopes of the hii region lfs mostly agree with the expectations for the relevant morphological types ( kennicutt et al . \n 1989 ) , although some peculiarities are present . \n our main results on the individual systems are listed below .    _ \n am 1238 - 362 . \n _ the distribution of hii regions across the disks of the two face - on members seems related to the interaction . \n their hii region lfs , presented here for the first time , considerably differ from one another , although the size distributions do not . \n the shift of the lf of tol 1238 - 36.4 towards high luminosities is possibly a consequence of the interaction process . in this system \n we do not observe the tendency suggested by frattare , keel , &  laurikainen ( 1993 ) for interacting galaxies to have flatter hii region lfs than normal galaxies . \n candidate intergalactic hii regions have been identified in the space between the galaxies , however , spectroscopic confirmation is needed . \n no obvious correlation is found between the position of these sources and the distribution of hi @xcite . \n _ scg 0018 - 4854 . _ \n all five galaxies show active star formation . a preliminary analysis of the hii region lfs of three members of this compact group \n do show some peculiarities , especially a considerable flattening of the lf of ngc 92 at the high luminosity end . \n a certain amount of flattening could be caused by blending of hii regions , an effect that might become important at a distance of 45 mpc . \n however , since such an effect was not observed in the other galaxies of the group , nor in am 1238 - 362 ( located at similar distance ) , we exclude this as the only reason for the observed flattening . \n we plan to investigate separately the lfs of the regions located in the tidal tail and in the galaxy body , where they are organized in circumnuclear rings . \n two of the galaxies appear to have hii region size distributions steeper than expected , given the observed lfs . \n possible reasons for this effect are yet to be investigated . \n _ cg j1720 - 67.8 . \n _ in this dense system , the merging process is undoubtedly responsible for the ubiquitous star formation and the formation of ( candidate ) proto - tidal dwarf galaxies . \n the velocity field of the ionized gas , besides helping to constrain the interaction history of the group , shows an interesting feature , i.e. a @xmath13 5 kpc offset of kinematic center with respect to the photometric center of the central spiral galaxy , in north - west direction along its kinematic minor axis ( temporin et al . 2004 ) . \n we speculate that this might hint at the presence of a common dark matter halo in the system .    in this work we made use of the hiiphot algorithm available at the ftp site : ftp://ftp.aoc.nrao.edu / staff / dthilker / hiiphot_code/. st acknowledges financial support by the european southern observatory and is grateful for hospitality at the eso -

handed quark doublets @xmath60 , the charge - conjugated right - handed up - type quarks @xmath61 and the charge - conjugated right - handed down - type quarks @xmath62 exist . \n the up - type yukawa coupling matrix and the down - type one are diagonalized as @xmath63 respectively . \n the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 one finds that the small @xmath0 breaking parameters induce small mixing angles . notice that our model naturally includes the model discussed in ref . \n @xcite , where non - universal kinetic terms are absent . \n we can express the ckm matrix elements in terms of the mass eigenvalues . \n the cabibbo angle is determined solely by the observed values as @xmath66 this fritzsch relation have been known to be successful @xcite . \n @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 notice that in eq . \n ( [ eq : ckm ] ) values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are almost fixed by the empirical masses as @xmath73 ( see eqs . \n ( [ eq : masses ] ) and ( [ eq : ulr ] ) ) . \n thus , parameters determined from @xmath67 and @xmath74 are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . \n @xmath77 does not play an essential role . \n let us perform crude estimation before making numerical analysis , elucidating the importance of unusual structure of kinetic terms . for the present , we adopt the following representative values : @xmath78 taking into account that @xmath79 the area where @xmath80 itself is close to @xmath81 is preferable . from the constraint @xmath82 \n one finds that the most favorable range is @xmath83 and @xmath84 we discard the case where @xmath85 since rather large @xmath80 is demanded . combining this inequality ( eq . \n ( [ eq : x ] ) ) with the constraint @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n thus , we conclude that considerably suppressed @xmath76 is necessary in order that our @xmath0 model with the diagonal breaking matrices explains the empirical masses and mixings . recalling that @xmath90 this conclusion highlights a possibility that extremely large top mass is attributed to singular structure of normalization of the fields in the case of small @xmath91 . \n put another way , we draw a plot of the allowed value of the top quark mass @xmath92 as a function of @xmath76 when the other quantities are fit with their experimental values as above . \n the allowed region is depicted in fig . [ \n fig : mt ] . \n one finds that the allowed top mass is rather sensitive to the choice of @xmath76 . \n it is interesting to observe that the case of universal kinetic terms examined in ref . \n @xcite is completely ruled out and thus the inclusion of the singular normalization with extremely small @xmath76 is essential to make the model realistic . \n we now exhibit numerical analysis based on the diagonal breaking matrices . for simplicity we set @xmath93 , which does not alter our conclusion . \n the following parameter set , @xmath94 reproduces mass eigenvalues @xmath95 and magnitudes of the ckm matrix elements @xmath96 which should be compared with the experimental data evaluated at the @xmath97-boson mass scale @xcite . \n we have made the comparison at the @xmath97-boson mass scale . \n the same conclusion that extremely small @xmath76 is required holds even if we made this comparison at the gut scale in the mssm , though the value @xmath76 itself is different . \n this is because the effect of running comes from the top yukawa coupling , which appears in the wave - function renormalization of the top quark in supersymmetry . \n although we have so far supposed that the parameters which are responsible for quark masses and mixing angles are real , the observed @xmath98 asymmetry can be also explained in this framework by taking complex @xmath53 and @xmath52 . \n in this paper , we have pointed out the possibility that the wave function normalization of the top quark can be singular , which makes it very heavy . \n we have illustrated this in the framework of the democratic fermion ansatz . there \n the fermion mass structure is controlled by the @xmath0 permutation symmetries , with diagonal breaking introduced . in this case \n , we can make even a stronger statement : the singular normalization is essential to reproduce the top quark mass and the other quark masses as well as their mixing . \n this investigation presented here is indeed based on a particular form of the @xmath0 breaking . however , we emphasize that the large top quark mass can be realized by invoking singular structure of the corresponding kinetic terms . \n this argument is irrespective of the form of the @xmath0 breaking matrices . \n this new idea of highly different normalization of fields can save theories in which yukawa couplings would otherwise be suppressed and thus would fail to reproduce the large top mass . \n examples include    * brane - world scenarios in which quark and/or higgs fields propagate in the bulk . in this case \n yukawa coupling constants in four dimensions are volume - suppressed by some powers of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the compactification scale and @xmath101 the fundamental one ; * @xmath102 guts . \n an attractive feature of the @xmath102 guts is that the mssm higgs doublets can arise as pseudo - goldstone multiplets @xcite . \n a natural extension to @xmath102 from @xmath103 suggests to introduce @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 as quarks and leptons , and @xmath107 and @xmath105 as higgs multiplets . \n however with these matter contents one can not write down @xmath102 invariant yukawa couplings for up - quark masses at the renormalizable level . \n up - type yukawa couplings arise from non - renormalizable operators and are suppressed by powers of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 represents the gut scale . \n thus one conventionally introduce * 20 * to obtain the large top yukawa coupling . \n our mechanism of the yukawa enhancement due to the singular wave - function normalization , however , may allow us to construct a simpler model without introducing the * 20 * multiplet .    throughout this paper \n , we have assumed that the singular normalization for the top quark is realized by some means , but we have not specified a possible mechanism . \n a particularly interesting possibility is that the singular normalization is realized dynamically associated with , for example , the electroweak symmetry breaking . \n although a naive inspection suggests that one needs a very flat potential for a field responsible for the wave - function normalization , which is thus unlikely , further study along this line is interesting and should be encouraged . \n this work was supported in part by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan , no.12047201 . \n mk thanks the japan society for the promotion of science for financial support .", "StartTimeOffset": 238702533196, "RequestID": "b904ffc62cb541389273eae6861820fb", "TotalTokens": 3488}

{"ContextTokens": 3989, "GeneratedTokens": 253, "SynthesizedBody": "the prisoner s dilemma game , consisting of cooperation and defection as the two competing strategies , is considered a paradigm for studying the emergence of cooperation between selfish individuals @xcite . since the game promises a defecting individual the highest income if facing a cooperator the prevalence of cooperation within this theoretical framework presents a formidable challenge . \n indeed , the classical well - mixed prisoner s dilemma game completely fails to sustain cooperation @xcite , which is often at odds with reality where mutual cooperation may also be the final outcome of the game @xcite . \n a seminal theoretical mechanism for cooperation within the prisoner s dilemma game was introduced by nowak and may @xcite , who showed that the spatial structure and nearest neighbor interactions enable cooperators to form clusters on the spatial grid and so protect themselves against exploitation by defectors . a decade later , this theoretical prediction has been confirmed by biological experiments @xcite . \n nonetheless , the somewhat fragile ability of the spatial structure to support cooperation @xcite , along with the difficulties associated with payoff rankings in experimental and field work @xcite , has made it a common starting point for further refinements of cooperation facilitating mechanisms . \n in particular , the specific topology of networks defining the interactions among players has recently received substantial attention @xcite , and specifically scale - free graphs @xcite have been recognized as extremely potent promoters of cooperative behavior in the prisoner s dilemma as well as the snowdrift game @xcite . \n although the promotion of cooperation by the scale - free topology has been found robust on several factors @xcite , the mechanism has recently been contested via the introduction of normalized payoffs or so - called participation costs @xcite . moreover , \n the interplay between the evolution of cooperation as well as that of the interaction network has also been studied @xcite , and it has been discovered that intentional rewiring in accordance with the preference and fitness of each individual as well as simple random rewiring of the interaction network might both have a beneficial effect on the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma and the snowdrift game . for a comprehensive review of this field of research see @xcite .    besides studies addressing network complexity as a somewhat direct extension of @xcite , \n several approaches have also been proposed that warrant the promotion of cooperation within nearest neighbor interactions . \n examples include strategic complexity @xcite , direct and indirect reciprocity @xcite , asymmetry of learning and teaching activities @xcite , random diffusion of agents on the grid @xcite , as well as fine - tuning of noise and uncertainties by strategy adoption @xcite . \n the impact of asymmetric influence , introduced via a special player with a finite density of directed random links to others , on the dynamics of the prisoner s dilemma game on small - world networks has also been studied @xcite . \n it is worth noting that stochasticity in general , either being introduced directly or emerging spontaneously due to finite population sizes @xcite , has been found crucial by several aspects of various evolutionary processes .    in this paper , we wish to extend the scope of stochastic effects on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game by introducing the social diversity of players as their extrinsically determined property . \n this is realized by introducing scaling factors that determine the mapping from game payoffs to the fitness of each individual . \n the scaling factors represent extrinsic differences amongst players , and as such determine their social status and the overall social diversity on the spatial grid . \n importantly , the scaling factors are drawn randomly from different distributions and are determined only once at the beginning of the game . \n positive scaling factors increase the magnitude of payoffs a particular player is able to exchange , while negative factors have the opposite effect . \n it is important to note that the average of all scaling factors is exactly zero , so that there is no net contribution of social diversity to the total payoff of the population . \n presently , we consider scaling factors drawn from the uniform , exponential , and scale - free distribution , and thus distinguish three different cases of social diversity . \n we investigate how the introduction of social diversity , and in particular its distribution and amplitude , affect the evolution of cooperation amongst players on the spatial grid . \n we report below that the cooperation is enhanced markedly as the amplitude of social diversity increases , and moreover , that the biggest enhancement is obtained if the social diversity follows a power - law distribution . \n we attribute the enhancement of cooperation to the emergence of cooperative clusters , which are controlled by high - ranking players that are able to prevail against the defectors even if the temptation to defect is large . indeed , the role of these clusters is similar to the role of pure cooperator neighborhoods around hubs on scale - free networks @xcite , or to the part of imitating followers surrounding master players in the enhanced teaching activity model @xcite , as will be clarified later . to highlight the importance of the strongly diverse social rank , we also study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity , and find that the facilitation of the cooperative strategy deteriorates as the correlation length increases . \n thus , a finite spatial correlation of social diversity hinders the formation of strong cooperative clusters , in turn lending support to the validity of the reported cooperation - facilitating mechanism in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . \n section ii is devoted to the description of the spatial prisoner s dilemma game and the properties of scaling factors determining social diversity of players on the spatial grid . in section \n iii we present the results of numerical simulations , and in section iv we summarize the results and outline some biological implications of our findings . \n we consider an evolutionary two - strategy prisoner s dilemma game with players located on vertices of a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions . \n each individual is allowed to interact only with its four nearest neighbors , and self - interactions are excluded . a player located on the lattice site @xmath1 can change its strategy @xmath2 after each full iteration cycle of the game . \n the performance of player @xmath1 is compared with that of a randomly chosen neighbor @xmath3 and the probability that its strategy changes to @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 } \\,\\ \n , , \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 characterizes the uncertainty related to the strategy adoption process , serving to avoid trapped conditions and enabling smooth transitions towards stationary states . \n the payoffs @xmath7 and @xmath8 of both players acquired during each iteration cycle are calculated in accordance with the standard prisoner s dilemma scheme @xcite , according to which the temptation to defect @xmath9 , reward for mutual cooperation @xmath10 , punishment for mutual defection @xmath11 , and the sucker s \n payoff @xmath12 . \n importantly , throughout this work the original prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking ( @xmath13 ) is applicable since the introduction of social diversity via scaling factors only acts as a mapping of the original payoffs to individual fitness , as will be described next .    ) \n originating from the uniformly distributed random variable ( @xmath14 ) . \n the three functions correspond to uniform ( u ) , exponential ( e ) , and power - law ( p ) distribution when @xmath15 . for easier comparison only the @xmath16 $ ] interval of @xmath17 is plotted.,width=321 ] \n to introduce social diversity we use rescaled payoffs of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is either @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a scaling factor drawn randomly from a given distribution for each participating player @xmath1 only once before the start of the simulation . \n note that the minimum of the two random scaling factors involved at every instance of the game is used for payoffs of both involved players @xmath1 and @xmath3 to ensure that the prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking is preserved . \n it is worth mentioning that the maximum of both values would have had the same effect , but below presented results are virtually independent of this technicality , and moreover , it seems reasonable to assume that the higher - ranking player ( the one with the larger value of @xmath17 ) will adjust to the weaker one since the latter simply can not match the stakes of the game otherwise . within this study \n we consider the uniform ( also known as rectangular ) , exponential , and power - law distributed social diversity defined by the following functions : @xmath26 here @xmath14 are uniformly distributed random numbers from the unit interval , and @xmath27 in all cases , so that the average of @xmath17 over all the players is zero . \n it is easy to see that the largest difference between the exponential and power - law function can be obtained if @xmath28 in the latter , as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . \n henceforth we use @xmath29 when the power - law distribution is applied . \n the parameter @xmath30 determines the amplitude of undulation of the scaling factors , and hence the dispersion of social diversity , and can occupy any value from the unit interval . \n in particular , @xmath31 returns the original payoffs , whereas @xmath15 is the maximally allowed value that still preserves @xmath32 for all @xmath1 , thus preventing possible violations of the prisoner s dilemma payoff ranking . \n note that @xmath33 could induce @xmath34 , which would directly violate the rules of the prisoner s dilemma game . \n the spatial distributions of the three considered cases obtained by @xmath15 are demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] where cross - sections with linear system size @xmath35 are plotted . \n clearly , the uniform distribution provides the gentlest dispersion of social diversity , whereas the largest segregation of players is warranted by the power - law distributed scaling factors where some values are very high at the expense of extended regions of very small @xmath17 resulting in these players having much smaller payoffs as compared to the non - scaled case . \n the exponential distribution of scaling factors yields a dispersion of social diversity that is between the uniform and the power - law case , as can be inferred from fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , as well as indirectly also from fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] .     when uniform ( u ) , exponential ( e ) , and power - law ( p ) distributed values of scaling factors were used . \n lines show an exemplary cross - section of the two - dimensional grid.,width=321 ]    in order to explain the main features of the reported results , we also use spatially correlated social diversity so that the scaling factors @xmath25 satisfy the correlation function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the spatial correlation length . in this case \n we constrain our study to the case where @xmath25 are drawn from a uniform distribution within the interval @xmath16 $ ] . \n an efficient algorithm for the generation of spatially correlated random numbers with a prescribed correlation length is given in @xcite . \n the effect of different values of @xmath37 on the scaling factors determining social diversity is demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . clearly , the random undulations become more and more correlated across neighbors on the spatial grid as @xmath37 increases .    before the start of each game simulation , both strategies populate the spatial grid uniformly and the scaling factors are drawn randomly from a given distribution to determine the social diversity of participating players . \n after these initial conditions are set , the spatial prisoner s dilemma game is iterated forward in time using a synchronous update scheme , thus letting all individuals interact pairwise with their four nearest neighbors . after every iteration cycle of the game , all players simultaneously update their strategy according to eq . \n [ eq : prob ] . to avoid finite -

section of the two - dimensional grid.,width=321 ] \n next , we study how different distributions of social diversity affect the evolution of cooperation via numerical simulations of the above - described spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n figure  [ fig : fig4 ] features color - coded @xmath41 for all three types of social diversity in the relevant @xmath47 parameter space . \n evidently , regardless of the distribution , increasing values of @xmath30 clearly promote cooperation as the threshold of cooperation extinction increases from @xmath48 in the absence of social diversity to @xmath49 ( uniformly distributed social diversity ) , @xmath50 ( exponentially distributed social diversity ) , and @xmath51 ( power - law distributed social diversity ) . \n moreover , there always exists a broad range in the parameter space within which cooperators rule completely ; a non - existent feature if @xmath31 . \n we argue that the above - reported facilitation of cooperation is due to the induced inhomogeneous social state of players that fosters cooperative clusters around players with the largest values of @xmath25 . indeed \n , as soon as cooperators overtake these prime spots of the grid they start to spread due to their cluster - forming nature . \n note that the latter feature is not associated with defectors who therefore fail to take the same advantage out of social diversity , and are thus defeated . \n a similar behavior underlies also the cooperation - facilitating mechanism reported for the scale - free networks , where the players with the largest connectivity dominate the game . \n since cooperators are much better equipped for permanently sustaining the occupation of hubs , the scale - free networks provide a unifying framework for the evolution of cooperation @xcite . \n an even better similarity can be established with the model incorporating the inhomogeneous teaching activity @xcite . in the latter , \n some players are blocked and therefore unable to donate their strategies , which results in homogeneous cooperative domains around players with full teaching capabilities . \n in the presently studied model , the introduction of social diversity partly results in a similar suppression of selected players , especially so for the power - law distributed case where the majority of players are low - ranking , as demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] . \n these players can form an obedient domain around a high - ranking player and so prevail against defectors . on the other hand , \n a high - ranking defector will be weakened by the low - ranking players who follow its destructive strategy . \n the above - described feedback works only if the high - ranking defectors can be linked solely by their follower neighborhoods ; namely there must not be a strong connection with other high - ranking players . in the opposite case \n , the heterogeneous strategy distribution supports the survival of defectors . to support our explanation \n , we study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity on the evolution of cooperation . according to our argument \n , the transition from uncorrelated to spatially correlated diversity should be marked with the deterioration of cooperation . \n we thus introduce spatially correlated social diversity as described in section ii , and study the effect of different @xmath37 on the evolution of cooperation . \n figure  [ fig : fig5 ] features the results . in agreement with our conjecture , \n the facilitation of cooperation deteriorates fast as @xmath37 increases . \n indeed , a near linear decrease of the critical @xmath52 marking the extinction of cooperators can be established , and moreover , by large @xmath37 the cooperators can outperform defectors only for slightly higher values of @xmath52 than in the absence of social diversity ( @xmath31 ) . \n this result supports the validity of the reported cooperation - facilitating mechanism , and hopefully paves the way for additional studies incorporating social diversity into the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory . \n in this paper , we show that social diversity is an efficient promoter of cooperation in the spatial prisoner s dilemma game . \n the facilitative effect increases with the dispersion of social diversity and deteriorates with the increase of its spatial correlation . \n accordingly , spatially uncorrelated power - law distributed social diversity provides the biggest boost to the cooperative strategy . \n we argue that the facilitative effect is conceptually similar to the one reported previously for inhomogeneous teaching activities , and also has the same root as the mechanism applicable by scale - free networks , namely : akin to hubs or players with enhanced teaching activity , in this model , high - ranking players can form robust cooperative clusters with low - ranking obedient neighbors . \n the presented results suggest that the distribution of wealth plays a crucial role by the evolution of cooperation amongst egoistic individuals , and it seems reasonable to investigate further whether a co - evolution of both might yield new insights and foster the understanding of the formation of complex societies . \n this work was supported by the slovenian research agency ( z1 - 9629 ) ( m. p. ) and the hungarian national research fund ( t-47003 ) ( a. s. ) . \n discussions with gyrgy szab are gratefully acknowledged . \n we also thank girish nathan for useful comments .", "StartTimeOffset": 257038919893, "RequestID": "dfa44c33dc95470dbdebce2a8a76edfc", "TotalTokens": 4242}

high granularity tracking system of 5 stations each with two detection planes ; a large warm dipole magnet ; a passive muon filter wall , followed by four planes of trigger chambers and a inner beam shield surrounding the beam pipe to protect the chambers from high particle flux at large rapidities . \n each tracking chamber provides two dimensional hit information by measuring the charge distributions on two segmented cathode planes . \n the cathode which has higher resolution in the direction ( y - direction ) perpendicular to the plane containing the magnetic field ( x - direction ) and beam axis ( z - direction ) is referred to as the bending cathode , while the other along the magnetic field is referred to as non - bending cathode . \n two tracking stations are placed before , one inside and two after the dipole magnet . \n the total number of readout pads is about 1.1 million and covers an area of about 100 m@xmath12 . \n the trigger system consists of four resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) planes arranged in two stations which are placed behind the muon filter . \n the trigger system has to select events containing a muon pair coming from the decay of j/@xmath3 or @xmath5 resonances from all possible background contaminations . \n the main background comes from low-@xmath13   muons of pion and kaon decays . \n thus , the l0 trigger is generated if at least two tracks with opposite charge ( or the same charge used in this case for background subtraction ) , both above a predefined @xmath13   cut are detected in an event . \n two different @xmath13   thresholds of 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c have been chosen for j/@xmath3 and @xmath5 measurement , respectively , according to simulation studies . \n however , the coarse grained segmentation of the rpcs and the presence of the iron wall before the trigger stations , do not allow a sharp @xmath13   cut . \n this is demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , through a simulation study carried out using the aliroot framework  @xcite . \n it is evident that the l0 trigger passes a substantial number of events which are below the @xmath13-threshold . \n in addition , the trigger efficiency is around 60% near the threshold value of 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c . \n thus , the primary task of the dimuon high level trigger ( dhlt ) is to refine the @xmath13   cut in order to increase its selectivity . for this purpose , in the addition to the trigger chambers , the slower but more accurate tracking chambers have been used and a real - time event reconstruction scheme for the entire muon spectrometer has been developed . \n this scheme should satisfy the following criteria :    \\(a ) the event processing should be done at a rate of 1 khz for pb - pb collisions ; ( b ) the real - time reconstruction should produce results of appreciable quality without losing any signal event ; ( c ) it should be robust and should not stop processing due to any data corruption in the input buffer . \n the event reconstruction in tracking chambers is a two step process , which involves the reconstruction of charge clusters and the track formation using the reconstructed hit points . in offline reconstruction , \n these two steps are implemented by mathieson fitting of the charge clusters which are defined by the nearest neighbour algorithm and kalman filtering , respectively . however \n , none of them can be applied for real - time reconstruction due to the time constrain set by the expected event rate of 1 khz . \n thus , new algorithms for fast reconstruction have been developed for dhlt  @xcite . \n these are described below . \n * hit - reconstruction : * : :    this new algorithm does not identify the charge clusters by nearest    neighbour search . instead , \n it searches for pads with maximum charge    whose immediate neighbours have nonzero charge . \n the two schemes are    equivalent since every cluster has an unique central pad whose charge    is greater than other members . once the central pads are identified ,    the hit positions along the bending and non - bending directions are    given by the centre of gravity of the charges measured on the central    pad and the two pads around it in y and x directions , respectively .    finally the information on bending ( y - direction ) and non - bending    ( x - direction ) cathodes are merged to generate hit position . \n * partial tracking : * : :    in the first attempt to improve the accuracy of the l0 trigger , the    trigger track segments are extended upto the fourth tracking    station  @xcite . \n the straight line tracks in the two tracking    stations after the magnetic field give a better    @xmath13   estimation than the value obtained from    the trigger tracks . \n the result of this improvement is shown in    fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , by the solid lines which are    marked by ` hlt partial tracker ' . \n it is evident that there is a marked    improvement in accuracy over the l0 trigger , but the trigger    efficiencies at @xmath13   = 1 gev / c and 2 gev / c    are about 20% and the desired efficiency ( @xmath1490% ) is    achieved only around 1.5 gev and 2.5 gev , respectively . \n thus , this    method is not suitable for dhlt and the full tracking through the    magnetic field is essential . \n * full tracking : * : :    the full tracking formalism creates tracks from the last trigger    station to the first tracking station . \n various tracking stages has    been shown in fig . \n [ fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency](top ) . \n these are    described below . \n +    _ tracking in station 4,5 : _ ;

[ \n fig : ms_pt_cut_efficiency ] ( bottom ) , by the solid line marked as ` hlt full tracker ' and have been compared with the offline reconstruction . \n it can be observed from this simulation study that the estimated @xmath13 s of the muon tracks match closely with the offline analysis and the desired improvement of the l0 can be achieved . \n the framework of the full tracker was successfully implemented on the hlt computing farm and all the validation tests were completed before the pp collisions at @xmath0  tev data taking in march , 2010 .    in fig . \n [ fig : offline_hlt_trigger_cut ] , the effect of the @xmath13-cut from the offline analysis and from the real - time full tracker has been compared for pp ( `` real data '' ) collisions . \n the top and bottom panels of the figure show the invariant mass plot around the j/@xmath3 peak when the @xmath13   of one muon was found to be greater than 1 gev / c by the offline and online reconstruction , respectively . \n the invariant spectra are fitted with a gaussian signal and a double exponential functions . \n the width of the j/@xmath3 peak was found to be 93.8 and 95.5 mev / c@xmath12 for offline and hlt triggers , respectively . \n this shows that a sufficient accuracy of the @xmath16-cut for the full tracker is achieved . \n however , the counts in the j/@xmath3 peak for the offline reconstruction is higher by 7% with respect to the online reconstruction . \n this indicate a small inefficiency of the online trigger . \n studies are ongoing to correct this effect . \n it has been demonstrated both from simulation and data , that the hlt for the muon spectrometer is capable to improve the trigger momentum resolution of the tracks and validate the l0 muon candidates by a sharp @xmath13   cut . in the coming years of lhc operation , \n when the luminosity of the beams will reach its nominal values , the dhlt will play a crucial role in background rejection and allow the muon spectrometer to run at higher l0 trigger rates . \n in addition , it is estimated that the use of dhlt , with a loosening of the l0 @xmath13   cut , will allow recovering about 20% of the low-@xmath13   muon events .", "StartTimeOffset": 267354442897, "RequestID": "ea561715472448018afa271f1616fbc8", "TotalTokens": 2838}
{"ContextTokens": 2639, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding stellar convection and accurately representing it in stellar models remains a formidable challenge . \n one of the commonly used treatments for convection is the mixing length theory ( mlt ; * ? ? ? \n * ) ,  which represents convection with a characteristic length scale . \n the mixing length parameter ( which is the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height , @xmath3 ) sets the specific entropy of the convection zone , which in turn adjusts the stellar radius . \n this provides a means of determining the mixing length parameter for the sun , since we have precise constraints on the solar radius . \n this solar - calibrated value for the mixing length parameter is usually used to model all other stars , but there is evidence suggesting that this is not the case in reality .    even when properly calibrated to the stellar radius , mlt - like treatments of stellar convection fail to accurately represent inefficient convection . \n this failure severely limits the accuracy of the convective envelope boundaries within stellar models . \n one such boundary is the superadiabatic layer ( sal ) , which is a region near the surface of stars with convective envelopes . \n this layer spans several scale heights and encompasses the transition from efficient convective energy transport to radiative . \n radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations of the sal have proven to be a useful tool for studying realistic stellar convection . \n simulations self - consistently couple the convective envelope to the radiative atmosphere , while including important physical processes such as turbulent pressure . \n established by as a feasible technique for studying realistic stellar convection in the sal , rhd simulations have been carried by a number of groups . \n ( e.g. * ?

? ? \n * etc ) .    in sections [ sec : code ] and [ sec : grid ] \n describe the 3d rhd code and the grid of simulations used in this work . \n section [ sec : microphysics ] outlines the changes to the microphysics induced by altering the hydrogen mass fraction , and the expected effect that these changes will have on convective dynamics . \n we then examine in detail the consequences of hydrogen abundance on various properties extracted from the simulations in sections [ sec : salstructure ] through [ sec : spectral ] . \n our code simulates convection by solving the compressible navier - stokes equations with radiative transfer , and has been described in detail in @xcite . \n the code is originally based on that of @xcite and @xcite but has updated physics and numerical schemes . \n the simulation code uses microphysics that are fully consistent with that of the stellar evolution code yrec . \n the equation of state and opacity are taken from the opal tables @xcite and the @xcite opacity tables at low temperatures using the heavy element mixture of @xcite . \n for the simulations in this work , radiative transfer was computed using the 3d eddington approximation @xcite in the optically thin layers , and the diffusion approximation in the deeper optically thick layers , however , as @xcite showed , using a different radiative transfer scheme ( rays with long - characteristics ) does not make a substantial difference in the sal below the photosphere . \n the computational domain is a cartesian box with periodic boundary conditions on the vertical walls , and the top and bottom surfaces are closed . \n spatial curvature and the radial variation of gravity are both negligible . \n the domain spans the sal so the bottom surface is well below the superadiabatic peak , and the top surface is in the optically thin radiative layers of the atmosphere . \n thus , the space between the two surfaces encompasses the transition from fully convective to fully radiative energy transport . \n the strategy for exploring the effect of helium on convection closely mirrors the approach described in @xcite , which dealt only with changes to the mass fraction of metal elements . in this study \n , we construct a grid of simulations that covers a range in helium mass fractions . \n because the effect of helium may differ between metal - rich and metal - poor stars , we compute our simulations with different hydrogen mass fractions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for two different metallicities ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . \n the grid of simulations comprises six sets , each with a different chemical composition . \n the grid is divided into two groups ( each with three sets ) , corresponding to low and high metallicity . \n the sets within a group have fixed metallicity , but different helium abundances . \n the range in helium and metallicity is quite large , covering a factor of three in @xmath13 and a factor of @xmath14 in @xmath15 . while large , the range in helium mass fraction is less extreme than what has been used to model some stellar populations , including that of @xmath6 centauri , which @xcite recently modeled with helium enrichments of up to @xmath7 . \n the grid of 24 simulations is summarized in table [ tab : grid ] . \n the two metallicity groups are denoted with ` a ' and ` b ' for the low- and high - metallicity , respectively . \n surface gravity is held fixed at @xmath16 for the entire grid . \n the effective temperature for each simulation is an output property , and can not be precisely controlled . as such \n , simulations typically can not be directly compared , but each set overlaps in the effective temperature range , allowing for comparisons as a function of radiative flux .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the signature of helium abundance on stellar convection is smaller than that of metallicity , but is nonetheless significant . \n changes to convective properties are primarily caused by opacity . \n the sensitivity of convective properties to helium abundance is because of similar reasons as metallicity described in @xcite , namely , for a given , an increase in opacity in the sal is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in density so that the constant radiative energy flux is maintained . \n our simulations show systematically larger convective velocities and overshoot with hotter , larger @xmath15 and smaller @xmath13 .    while similar , the effect of helium is distinct from that of metallicity because of the way in which it changes the equation of state . \n the mean molecular weight is more sensitive to helium abundance , particularly in the optically thin layers above the maximum superadiabaticity . \n the signature of helium might manifest itself separately from that of metallicity in the details of the velocity field , such as the velocity distribution presented in fig . \n [ fig : velocity ] . \n the key to isolating the effect of helium may be in comparing the hot upflows and cool downdrafts . \n [ fig : velocity ] shows variation in the ` upflow ' peak with @xmath15 , and variation in the extreme edge of the ` downflow ' peak with @xmath13 . \n radiation accounts for most of the energy flux from the hot upflowing granules \n . consequently , the structure and dynamics of the granules are more sensitive to radiative cooling rates , which vary more strongly with metallicity than helium . \n conversely , the downflows are less sensitive to radiative cooling rates , but will be affected by the mean molecular weight . \n it is possible that the signature of helium abundance is observable through its effect on the convective overshoot in the atmosphere . \n in particular , the curvature of spectral line shapes and the absolute shift of the line cores are sensitive to helium abundance . \n provided that the metallicity are well constrained , it might be possible to isolate the effect of helium on the velocity field . \n old metal - poor stellar populations often exhibit signs of @xmath0-element enrichment . using a set of simulations \n separate from our grid , we have carried out tests to measure the magnitude of the effect of changing the heavy element mixture . \n details of the heavy element mixture alter the opacity because of changes in the number of ionized electrons , which affects h@xmath17 opacity . \n our simulations show that the effect is quite small ; considerably smaller than the effect of changing @xmath15 or @xmath13 . while @xmath0-element enrichment may have a more substantial effect in the deep interior of the star \n , we do not measure a significant dependence on the structure of the sal . \n our @xmath0-enhancement tests also verify that the effect of helium could not be accounted for by adjusting the heavy element mixture . \n jt is supported by nasa atfp grant # \n nnx09aj53 g to sb , and acknowledges a pgs - d scholarship from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada . \n this work was supported in part by the facilities and staff of the yale university faculty of arts and sciences high performance computing center .                                                  , \n b. , ludwig , h .- g . \n , & steffen , m. 1999 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 173 , stellar structure : theory and test of connective energy transport , ed . \n a.  gimenez , e.  f. guinan , & b.  montesinos , 225", "StartTimeOffset": 275247464935, "RequestID": "0ce9a78a7b854229b9513b030ac580a0", "TotalTokens": 2913}

cone gauge , which we call the hybrid gauge , \n we get the following effective lagrangian of @xmath0@xcite : @xmath6 the first term in the second line describes elastic scattering of a collinear quark field off of the scattering center and the second term describes elastic scattering of a collinear gluon field off of the scattering center in the medium . \n note that different collinear sectors with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 separated in the transverse direction are coupled through this term . \n with the effective lagrangian of @xmath0 at hand , it is a straightforward task to calculate the medium - induced splitting kernels . \n we consider an initial quark or gluon with momentum @xmath9 splitting into two partons with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath10 , where the splitting energy fraction is defined as @xmath11 . \n we use the following momentum assignment to partons in the splitting : @xmath12 , i.e. for example when we refer to @xmath13 splitting we have in mind that a quark with momentum @xmath9 splits into a quark with momentum @xmath7 and a gluon with momentum @xmath10 . \n we thus have four possible splittings : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n the final partons are taken to be on - shell : @xmath17 . \n the light - cone vector @xmath18 is aligned with the initial parton , so that by definition @xmath19 and thus @xmath20 . \n the diagrams in the medium that need to be evaluated are presented in figure [ fig1 ] . \n the result of applying the feynman rules of @xmath0 and evaluating single and double born diagrams along with longitudinal integrals can be expressed through four transverse momenta which we define as : @xmath21 after a straightforward though lengthy calculation we obtain the following result for arbitrary medium - induced splitting@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the elastic scattering cross section of the parton in the medium and as suggested by notation the phases @xmath24 are independent of the splittings . \n they are equal to :    [ fig2 ]    @xmath25    the coefficients @xmath26 and the scattering lengths @xmath27 in fact depend on the splitting . \n the scattering lengths are equal to the gluon scattering length @xmath28 for splittings @xmath13 and @xmath29 and the quark scattering length @xmath30 for the splittings @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n the coefficients @xmath31 for the @xmath13 splitting are equal to : @xmath32 and for three remaining splittings they all have been calculated and can easily be extracted from ref . \n the vacuum splitting functions @xmath33 are well known @xcite and we do not present them here for brevity . \n the numerical evaluation of splitting intensity @xmath34 for the splitting @xmath13 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . for details on implementation of nuclear recoil and phase space cuts \n @xcite .    in the process of deriving the medium - induced splitting kernels in ref . \n @xcite we have shown explicitly that they are gauge invariant and that they factorize from the hard scattering process that creates the jet . \n this is described in detail in ref . \n @xcite for @xmath13 splitting and works similarly for the remaining splittings . \n using @xmath0 , several theoretical advances were achieved , relevant for jet quenching phenomenology . \n we proved the gauge invariance and factorization of the medium - induced splitting kernels . on the quantitative level we calculated the medium - splitting kernels beyond the small@xmath35 approximation which is inherent to energy loss calculations . with these improved results for @xmath13 and @xmath14 splittings , as well as \n two additional splittings @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which only appear at finite @xmath1 order , we have all ingredients to present improved theoretical predictions for jet production at rhic and lhc @xcite . \n these results will be presented elsewhere . \n 00    m.  gyulassy , i.  vitev , x.  -n . \n wang and b.  -w . \n zhang , in * hwa , r.c . \n et al . : quark gluon plasma * 123 -

{"ContextTokens": 3667, "GeneratedTokens": 195, "SynthesizedBody": "none of the previous analysis of the x - ray data of rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( henceforward rxj1856 ) revealed any significant periodicity @xcite . on the contrary a recent xmm - newton observation of rxj1856 has discovered that this isolated neutron star pulsates with a period of @xmath3 s @xcite . \n this object has a completely featureless x - ray and optical spectra . \n the lack of any significant spectral features in the x - ray spectrum argues against a heavy element atmosphere @xcite , whereas single temperature hydrogen atmosphere fits over - predict the optical flux by a large factor @xcite . as the soft x - ray spectrum \n is well fitted by the planckian spectrum with a temperature @xmath4ev @xcite . \n it has been proposed that the star has no atmosphere , but a condensed matter surface @xcite . \n such a surface might emit a featureless , likely a blackbody spectrum , at a temperature close to that of the surface , as suggested by @xcite . \n the overall spectra of this source has often been described by a two - temperature blackbody models @xcite , because the parameters derived from x - rays do not fit the optical data , which shows the rayleigh - jeans slope with an intensity a factor of 6 larger than that of a x - ray emission . \n alternatively a recent paper by @xcite explains the observed featureless spectra of this object assuming that the star has a thin magnetic , partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere on top of a condensed surface . \n though , one of important uncertainties for this model appears to be a creation of thin hydrogen atmospheres . \n however , to make these models work , the ns has to have a condensed matter surface , which requires the specific conditions @xcite . \n also , it remains to be seen weather a detailed analysis of magnetically condensed matter confirms the required non - uniform distribution of the surface temperature ( two - component blackbody model ) . \n so we must conclude that existing models , based on an assumption that the emission of rxj1856 has a thermal nature face numerous problems .    in the present paper \n we propose our explanation of the detected pulsations in the x - ray emission of rxj1856 , which is naturally possible based on emission model developed by @xcite . in this paper \n it is assumed that the emission of this object is generated by the synchrotron radiation , which is created as the result of appearance of pitch angles during the quasi - linear stage of the cyclotron instability . \n we suppose that the model proposed by @xcite works , which assumes the case of a nearly aligned rotator , whereas the periodic variations of the observed emission may be caused by the presence of a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves in the pulsar magnetosphere . \n these waves propagate across the magnetic field and encircle the open field line region of the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . \n they are not directly observable but only cause the periodic change of the direction of the pulsar emission @xcite .    in this paper , we give a description of the emission mechanism in section 2 . \n the mechanism of change of the pulsar radiation direction is described in section 3 , our model is presented in section 4 and conclusions are done in section 5 . \n as it is known the pulsar magnetosphere is filled by a dense relativistic electron - positron plasma . \n the ( e@xmath5e@xmath6 ) pairs are generated as a consequence of the avalanche process ( first described by @xcite ) and flow along the open magnetic field lines . \n the plasma is multi - component , with a one - dimensional distribution function ( see fig.1 from @xcite ) and consists of the following components : the bulk of plasma with an average lorentz - factor @xmath7 ; a tail on the distribution function with @xmath8 and the primary beam with @xmath9 . \n the main mechanism of wave generation in plasmas of the pulsar magnetosphere is the cyclotron instability . \n generation of waves is possible if the condition of the cyclotron resonance if fulfilled @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle velocity along the magnetic field , @xmath12 is the lorentz - factor for the resonant particles and @xmath13 is the drift velocity of the particles due to curvature of the field lines ( @xmath14 is the radius of curvature of the field lines and @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency ) . here \n cylindrical coordinate system is chosen , with the @xmath16-axis directed transversely to the plane of field line , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial and azimuthal coordinates . during the quasi - linear stage of the instability \n a diffusion of particles arises as along , also across the magnetic field lines . \n therefore , plasma particles acquire transverse momenta and begin to rotate along the larmor orbits . \n the synchrotron emission is generated as a result of the appearance of pitch angles . \n in @xcite it has been assumed that the emission of rxj1856 is generated by the synchrotron mechanism , which is created as the result of the cyclotron instability . \n though , the original waves excited during the cyclotron resonance come in the radio domain , the radio emission is not observed from rxj1856 . \n this waves as well as the x - ray and optical emission propagate along the local magnetic field lines . \n one of the possible explanations why the radio emission is not detected from this object is that it is generated at lower altitudes in contrast to the x - ray and optical emission and might miss our line of sight . \n another explanation is that the radio emission covers a large distance in the pulsar magnetosphere ( since the model of the aligned rotator is used ) . \n so there is a high probability for it , to come in the cyclotron damping range @xmath19 @xcite . in this case \n the radio emission will not reach an observer . \n * - rotation , * k * - emission and * a * - observers axes . angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are oscillating with time.,width=5 ] \n considered distribution function should generate various wave - modes in certain conditions . \n particularly it has been shown @xcite that a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves can be excited . \n they propagate across the magnetic field , so that the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 . in other words , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 . \n the period of the drift waves @xmath29 can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pulsar spin period , @xmath32 is the lorentz - factor of the relativistic particles and @xmath33 is the magnetic field in the wave excitement region ( @xmath34 is the magnetic field at the pulsar surface and @xmath35 is the radius of the neutron star ) . \n it appears that the period of the drift waves can vary in a broad range . \n the magnetic field of drift wave adds with the pulsar magnetic field as @xmath17 component and causes changing of the curvature of field line . \n even a small change of @xmath36 causes significant change of @xmath37 . \n variation of the field line curvature can be estimated as : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a longitudinal component of wave vector and @xmath17 is distance to the center of the pulsar . \n it follows that even the drift wave with a modest amplitude @xmath40 alters the field line curvature substantially @xmath41 .    since the pulsar emission propagates along the local magnetic field lines \n , curvature variation causes change of the emission direction , with the period of the drift waves . \n there is unequivocal correspondence between the observable intensity and @xmath42 ( the angle between the line of sight of an observer and the emission direction , see fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . \n maximum of intensity corresponds to the minimum of @xmath43 . \n the period of pulsar is the time interval between neighboring maxima of observable intensity i.e. minima of @xmath43 . according to this fact \n , we can say that the observable period depends on time behavior of @xmath43 and as it appears below it might differ from the real spin period of the pulsar .    from pulsar geometry \n it follows that @xmath23 can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the pulsar , @xmath46 is the angle between the rotation and the observer s axes , @xmath47 is the angle between the rotation and emission axes ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and @xmath48 is the amplitude of changing of @xmath22 .    in the absence of the drift wave @xmath49 and consequently the period of @xmath43 \n equals to @xmath50 . on the other hand , if the angle between the rotation and emission axes is too small i.e. @xmath51 , then the period of @xmath23 equals to @xmath52 . in this case \n the observable period @xmath53 does not represent the real spin period of the pulsar , but equals to the period of the drift wave , which we suppose to be 7.055 s. when the real spin period of this object has been estimated by @xcite to be @xmath54 . \n hence , for some values of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath21 it is possible to explain the 7 s pulsations of rxj1856 . \n if we consider this object in the framework of our model its angular parameters will get the values shown in table 1 . \n simulated lightcurve for rxj1856 is presented on fig . \n [ fig2 ] , which well expresses the value of the pulsed fraction of only @xmath2 ( the smallest ever seen in the isolated x - ray pulsars ) , obtained from observations @xcite . \n in the present paper we propose our explanation of recently discovered 7 s pulsations in the isolated neutron star rxj1856 , based on model drawn by @xcite . \n the main feature of this work is that the spin period of pulsar might differ from the observable one , which is the consequence of existence of very low frequency drift waves in the region of excitement of the pulsar emission . \n these particular waves are not detected but only result in a periodical change of curvature of the magnetic field lines , which in turn cause the change of observed radiation with a period of the drift wave . \n drift wave driven model is very convenient , since it makes able to explain almost every feature of known extraordinary pulsars such as : extremely long period radio pulsars @xcite , rotation radio transients @xcite , anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite . \n we suppose that treatment of the real period of rxj1856 can be achieved by more detailed observations . in the case of nonzero @xmath20 , which is most likely , \n variations with different time - scale should be appeared with value of the pulsar spin period , see fig . \n if this is confirmed , it will benefit to our model . \n we are grateful to george machabeli for valuable discussions . \n this work was partially supported by georgian nsf grant st06/4 - 096 . \n arons , j. 1981 , in : proc . \n varenna summer school and workshop on plasma astrophysics , esa , p.273 burwitz , v. , zavlin , v. e. , neuhuser , r. , predehl , p. , trmper , j. brinkman , a. c. , 2001 , a&a , 379 , l35 burwitz , v. , haberl , f. neuhuser , r. , predehl , p. , trmper , j. zavlin , v. e. , 2003 , a&a , 399 , 1109 chkheidze , n. , machabeli , g. , 2007 , a&a , submitted ( arxiv:0705.1628v1 [ astro - ph ] ) drake , j. j. , marshall , h. l. , dreizler , s. , freeman , p. e. , fruscione , a. , et al . \n 2002 , apj , 572 , 996 ho , w. c. g. , kaplan , d. l. , chang , p. , adelsberg , m. , potekhin , a. y. , 2007 , mnras 375 , 281h kazbegi a. z. , machabeli g. z. , melikidze g. i. , 1991 , mnras , 253 , 377 kazbegi a. z. , machabeli g. z. , melikidze g. i. , shukre c. , 1996 , a&a , 309 , 515 khechinashvili , d. g. , melikidze , g. i. , 1997 , a&a , 320 , l45 lai , d. , salpeter , e. e. , 1997 , apj , 491 , 270 lai , d. , 2001 , rev . of mod . \n 73 , 629 lomiashvili d. , machabeli g. , & malov i. , 2006 , apj , 637 , 1010 lomiashvili d. , machabeli g. , & malov i. , 2007 , mnras , submitted malov , i. f. , machabeli , g. z. , 2007 , ap&ss , 29 m pavlov , g. g. , zavlin , v. e. , trmper , j. , neuhuser , r. , 1996 , apj , 472 , l33 pavlov , g. g. , 2000 , talk at the itp / ucsb workshop `` spin and magnetism of young neutron stars '' pavlov , g , g. , zavlin , v. e. , sanwal , d. , in neutron stars and supernova remnants . \n w. becher , h. lesch , & j. trmper , 2002 , mpe report 278 , 273 pons , j. a. , walter , f. m. , lattimer , j. m. , prakash , m. , neuhauser , r. , an , p. , 2002 , \n apj , 564 , 981 ransom , s. m. , gaensler , b. m. , slane , p.o . \n 2002 , apj , 570 , l75 sturrock p. a. , 1971 , apj , 164 , 529 tiengo , a. , mereghetti , s. , 2007 , apj , 657 , l101 turolla , r. , zane , s. drake , j. j. , 2004 , apj , 603 , 265", "StartTimeOffset": 306333362264, "RequestID": "12addac3f2294c75b5cb8b67670936b8", "TotalTokens": 3862}

stellar companion to kic7917485 ( 11.8m@xmath0 ) is close to the planet  brown - dwarf mass boundary . \n although such a body would not be expected to have a solid surface , it could presumably host smaller exomoons . \n it is therefore interesting to determine whether the planet lies within the habitable zone . \n the habitable zone is broader for a stars than for cooler stars because the inner edge extends to higher incident surface fluxes for hotter stars @xcite . \n their calculations indicate that , at the temperature of kic7917485 , the inner edge lies between @xmath461.2 and 1.4 times the surface flux at earth , depending on the mass of the potentially habitable body . \n the mean projected separation between the components , @xmath47 , is 2.05au . at this separation , \n the luminous a star irradiates the companion to a surface flux ratio , @xmath48 , of 2.36 times the flux at earth . statistical correction for random inclination gives @xmath49 as the most probable value . \n the luminosity of the a star is not well constrained , and is a strong function of main - sequence age . at the @xmath50 lower luminosity limit ( see table[tab : atmos ] ) , those values of @xmath48 reduce to 1.72 and 1.27 , respectively . \n thus the position of kic7917485b is consistent with the habitable zone at the @xmath50 level . \n the companion would have been closer to the center of the habitable zone earlier in the star s lifetime . \n the luminosity will be refined substantially when the _ gaia _ mission provides a distance measurement , and the question of habitability can be reassessed . \n kic7917485b is the least massive companion that we have found in _ \n data with the pm method ( et al . \n 2016 , in preparation ) . \n we have also found two other stars with time delay variations consistent with planetary companions having periods longer than the 4-yr data set ( kic9700322 , kic8453431 ) , but the finite duration of _ kepler _ time - series does not allow the orbits to be fully parametrized . \n these detections allow us to comment on the planet occurrence around a stars . \n the detectability of low - mass companions is very sensitive to the noise in the fourier transform of the time delays , which is determined by the pulsation properties @xcite . \n we quantified this noise level for 2040 pulsating single a stars and found that only five of them had lower noise levels than kic7917485 . against the same sample , kic9700322 and kic8453431 ranked as the 9@xmath51 lowest and 2@xmath52 lowest , respectively . \n in other words , we have been able to detect a planetary - mass companion in one of the nine stars with the lowest noise levels , and two others show variations that are consistent with planetary - mass companions . \n this fact is in strong support of existing observations that intermediate - mass stars ( ` retired a stars ' ) tend to host high - mass planets in wide orbits @xcite . \n we have found a planetary companion of near the inner edge of the habitable zone of kic7917485 . \n this is the first planet orbiting a main - sequence a star to be discovered via the motion of its host star . \n other planets orbiting a stars have been discovered via the transit method and have short periods , or been discovered by direct imaging and have very long periods . \n our finding is particularly significant because no other method is presently capable of detecting non - transiting planets around these stars with periods of a few years , i.e. , near their habitable zones . \n kic7917485 has particularly low noise levels in its light arrival time delays . \n we analyzed other stars with similarly low noise and for two of them we also found evidence for planetary - mass companions with periods similar to the 4-yr time span of _ kepler _ data . \n this fact strongly supports the idea that intermediate - mass stars tend to host high - mass planets in wide orbits .", "StartTimeOffset": 313435749581, "RequestID": "d40a95500f36474fbb68f3f62b73c325", "TotalTokens": 3815}
{"ContextTokens": 3637, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "two - dimensional crystals have been given a large amount of attention since the isolation of one - atom - thick materials by novosolov _ \n et al_.  in 2004.@xcite graphene , a single layer of graphite , has attracted by far the most attention because of the high crystal quality of the graphene samples and its fascinating electronic properties.@xcite these properties make it a promising candidate to use as a basic material for future electronics applications.@xcite however , the use of graphene for applications in electronics suffers from a major drawback : graphene is , in its pristine state , a zero - bandgap semiconductor and this gapless state appears to be rather robust . \n several ways have been explored to induce a finite band gap in graphene . \n it was found experimentally that a band gap can be opened by confining the electrons in nanoribbons @xcite or by applying a potential difference over a graphene bilayer.@xcite    the chemical modification of graphene is another promising way to create a band gap . \n @xcite when radicals such as oxygen , hydrogen , or fluorine atoms are adsorbed on the graphene surface they form covalent bonds with the carbon atoms . \n these carbon atoms change their hybridization from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , which leads to the opening of a band gap ( similar as in diamond ) . \n the adsorbed radicals can attach to the graphene layer in a random way , as is the case in graphene oxide ( go),@xcite or they can form ordered patterns . in the last case , new graphene - based 2d crystals are formed with properties that can vary greatly from their parent material . \n this has been found to be the case for hydrogen and fluorine adsorbates . \n the new 2d crystals that are expected to form in those cases@xcite have been named graphane @xcite and graphene fluoride ( or fluorographene)@xcite , respectively .    following this route , \n multi - layer graphene fluoride was recently synthesized , @xcite and its structural and electronic properties were studied . \n a strongly insulating behavior was found with a room temperature resistance larger than 10g@xmath2 , which is consistent with the existence of a large band gap in this new material.@xcite only a partial fluorine coverage of the graphene multi - layer samples was achieved in these experiments . \n the f / c ratio was estimated to be 0.7 in ref . and 0.24 in ref . , according to weight gain measurements . \n an important step forward in creating fully covered two - dimensional graphene fluoride samples was recently achieved in ref . . \n the obtained single - layer graphene fluoride exhibits a strong insulating behavior with a room temperature resistance larger than 1t@xmath2 , a strong temperature stability up to 400 @xmath3 , and almost a complete disappearance of the graphene raman peaks associated with regions that are not fully fluorinated.@xcite the graphene raman peaks do not disappear completely , however , which could be an indication of the presence of defects in the sample , such as a small portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms . \n it was also found experimentally that fluorographene has a young s modulus of @xmath4 100 n / m , and the optical measurements suggest a band gap of @xmath4 3ev .    in ref . \n it was demonstrated that single - side adsorption is also possible and that it probably results in a crystalline c@xmath5f structure with a large band gap .    on the theoretical side , \n first - principles studies on graphene monofluoride started in 1993 , motivated by available experiments on graphite monofluoride . using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , \n it was shown in ref . that the chair configuration of graphene fluoride is energetically more favorable than the boat configuration by 0.145 ev per cf unit ( 0.073 ev / atom ) , while a transition barrier of the order of 2.72 ev was found between both structures . due to the small difference in formation energy and the large energy barrier between both configurations \n , it was argued that the kinematics of the intercalation could selectively determine the configuration , or that there could also be a mixing of both configurations in the available experiments . by using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional a direct band gap of 3.5 ev \n was calculated for the chair configuration in ref . . \n however , it is well known that dft generally underestimates the band gap . \n recent calculations used the more accurate gw approximation and found a much larger band gap of 7.4 ev for the chair configuration of graphene monofluoride ( ref . ) . \n this theoretical value is twice as large as the one obtained experimentally for graphene fluoride in ref . \n , which is @xmath4 3ev . \n the experimental value for the young s modulus as found in ref . \n ( @xmath4 100 n / m ) is also half the value obtained recently from first - principles calculations in ref . \n ( @xmath4 228 n / m ) for the chair configuration of graphene fluoride . \n it is worth noting that the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite values of the young s modulus of graphene only differ in a small percentage . \n possible reasons for the disagreement between the experimental values and the ab initio results for the young s modulus and the band gap of graphene fluorine could be : i ) the presence of a different configuration or a mixture of them in the experimental samples , or ii ) the presence of defects , which could decrease the size of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values .    in this paper , we investigate various possible crystal configurations for both graphene - based two - dimensional crystals , graphene fluoride and graphane , and we examine their structural , electronic , and mechanical properties . in the case of graphene fluorine , we found a new configuration not considered before that has a lower energy than the boat configuration . \n this new configuration , which we call the zigzag configuration , is energetically less favorable than the chair configuration by only 0.073 ev per cf unit ( 0.036 ev / atom ) . \n we calculated the young s modulus and the band gap ( both with gga and in the gw approximation ) for the different configurations . \n the disagreements between experimental and ab initio calculations for graphene fluoride persist independently of the considered configuration . \n these results imply that the available experimental samples probably contain a large number of defects , such as a portion of carbon atoms not bonded to fluorine atoms , that decrease the value of both the young s modulus and the band gap from the expected theoretical values . \n the paper is organized as follows : first we describe the computational details of our first - principles calculations \n . then we investigate the stability and structural properties of the different configurations of both graphene derivatives . to conclude , \n the elastic and electronic properties of the different structures are discussed . \n we examine different graphane and graphene fluoride configurations with the use of _ ab initio _ calculations performed within the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism . \n the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite is used for the exchange - correlation functional and a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 40 hartree is applied . \n the sampling of the brillouin zone is done with the equivalent of a @xmath6 monkhorst - pack k - point grid@xcite for a graphene unit cell and we use pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type.@xcite since periodic boundary conditions are applied in all 3 dimensions a vacuum layer of 20 bohr is included to minimize the ( artificial ) interaction between adjacent layers . \n all the calculations were performed with the abinit code.@xcite    the reported quasiparticle corrections for the band gap are obtained using the yambo code.@xcite here the first - order quasiparticle corrections are obtained using hedin s gw approximation  @xcite for the electron self - energy . because we are treating two - dimensional systems , \n the spurious coulomb interaction between a layer and its images should be avoided , as this causes serious convergence problems . \n therefore we use a truncation of this interaction in a box layout , following the method of rozzi _ \n et al._.@xcite the remaining singularity is treated using a random integration method in the region near the gamma point.@xcite nevertheless , a larger separation between the layers is necessary , so a value of @xmath7 bohr is used for these calculations . \n we studied four different stoichiometric configurations for both graphane and graphene fluoride in which every carbon atom is covalently bonded to an adsorbate in an equivalent way , i.e.  every carbon / adsorbate pair has the same environment . \n these configurations are schematically depicted in fig . \n [ fig_conform ] and we will refer to them as the ` chair ' , ` boat ' , ` zigzag ' , and ` armchair ' configuration . the chair and boat configurations have been well investigated before , but the zigzag and armchair configurations are rarely examined for graphane@xcite and we are not aware of any studies for fluorographene . \n the names of these last two configurations have been chosen for obvious reasons ( see fig . [ \n fig_conform](c ) and [ fig_conform](d ) ) . \n after relaxation , the different configurations appear greatly distorted when compared with the schematic pictures of fig . \n [ fig_conform ] , so these figures should only be regarded as topologically correct ( see fig . \n [ fig_superlatt ] ) .      to examine the stability of the different configurations , we make use of the formation energy of the structures and the binding energy between the graphene layer and the adsorbates . \n we define the formation energy , e@xmath8 , as the energy per atom of the hydrogenated or fluorinated graphene with respect to intrinsic graphene and the corresponding diatomic molecules h@xmath9 and f@xmath9 . \n the binding energy , e@xmath10 , is defined with respect to graphene and the atomic energies of the adsorbates and is calculated per ch or cf pair . \n the results are summarized in table [ tab_energies ] . \n .the formation energy e@xmath11 , the binding energy e@xmath12 , and the relative binding energy @xmath13e@xmath11 ( with respect to the most stable configuration ) for different hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene configurations . the energies are given in ev.[tab_energies ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the electronic band structure and the corresponding density of states of graphane and fluorographene in the chair configuration are shown in fig . \n [ fig_bs ] . \n both band structures look similar but there are also some clear differences . in the case of fluorographene the parabolic band at the @xmath14-point , corresponding to quasi - free electron states , is at much higher energies which indicates a larger ionization energy for fluorinated graphene . \n this ionization energy ( ie ) is defined as the difference between the vacuum level and the valence band maximum and an explicit calculation of this energy indicates a difference of about 3 ev between graphane and fluorographene ( see table [ tab_bg ] ) . \n this is a consequence of the negative charges on the fluorine atoms in fluorographene . \n we can also compare the ie values with the work function of graphene which is the same as its ionization potential ( because graphene has no band gap ) and has a value of 4.22 ev from gga ( this is somewhat smaller that the experimental value@xcite of 4.57@xmath150.05 ev ) . \n it can be seen from table [ tab_bg ] that the ionization energies of both graphene derivatives are higher than that of graphene ( @xmath4 0.5 ev and 3.5 ev , respectively ) , although the ionization energy of graphane is rather similar to graphene . \n we investigated different configurations of the graphene derivatives fluorographene and graphane . \n the chair configuration is the most stable one in both cases , but the zigzag configuration has only a slightly higher formation energy and is more stable than the much more studied boat configuration . \n fluorographene is found to be much more stable than graphane which is mainly due to a much higher desorption energy for f@xmath9 as compared to h@xmath9 . \n we also demonstrated that there are structural and electronic differences that are caused by the charged state of the f atoms in fluorographene . \n when our results are compared to available experimental data for fluorographene some discrepancies can be noticed : for all the configurations studied we find much larger band gaps in the electronic band structure and the calculated young s modules is much larger . \n this might indicate that the experimental samples still contain appreciable amounts of defects . \n the nature of these defects requires further investigation , but one can speculate that these defects consist of missing adsorbates , partial h / f coverage , or mixed configurations . \n this work was supported by the flemish science foundation ( fwo -

{"ContextTokens": 3098, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "the brazilian government classifies the goods it buys according to a particular taxonomy : the catmat ( catalog of materials ) . \n when the government purchases a new good , the person in charge of classifying it must choose one of the 560 catmat classes . \n the cognitive load is heavy , especially if the person is new to catmat . \n the result is misclassification . \n for instance , of the 30,774 goods classified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 , 17,469 cost less than r$ 1,000 ( us$ 250 as of 2015 - 12 - 01 ) . \n that price seems too low for a wheeled vehicle . \n when we inspect the product descriptions we see that the problem is misclassification : spare parts ( catmat classes # 2510 , # 2520 , # 2530 , and # 2590 ) are often misclassified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) .    when the misclassification rate is so high it is hard to audit government expenditures . \n in particular , it is hard to know whether the price paid for a given item was reasonable ( i.e. , similar to the prices paid for the same item before ) or not . auditing authorities waste resources investigating legitimate purchases , on the one hand , and fail to investigate fraudulent purchases , on the other hand . \n to reduce misclassification i trained a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier that takes a product description as input and returns the three most likely catmat classes as output . \n the idea is to semi - automate the process : we want to suggest likely classes to the person classifying the good ( the user of our app ) . \n he or she may choose among the suggested classes or ignore them and choose a different class . \n for instance , say some public hospital is buying insulin syringes . \n the hospital will describe the product in detail on the invitation to bid - say , as  disposable insulin syringes with 0.5ml and ultra - thin ( 6 mm ) needle , 50 units \" . \n the user feeds that description to the svm classifier , which then suggests three catmat classes : # 6515 ( medical and surgical equipment and supplies ) , # 6550 ( supplies for medical diagnostic and testing ) , and # 6640 ( laboratory equipment and supplies ) . \n the user chooses one of these three classes or , alternatively , discards them and chooses a different class \n .    we can not fully automate the process ( i.e. , substitute the svm classifier for the human classifier ) , for two reasons . first , in about 16.7% of the cases none of the svm - suggested classes is the correct one ( more on this later ) . hence a human must remain in charge of the final decision . \n but in the remaining 83.3% of the cases the svm classifier will be correct , which should reduce classification error . and perhaps this is a foundation upon which a fully automated classifier can be created in the future . \n second , after the user has chosen a catmat class he or she must also choose a subclass and an item . \n the catmat is a hierarchical taxonomy : it comprises 79 groups , 560 classes , 18,380 subclasses , and 217,907 items ( as of 2015 - 04 - 02 ) . \n but the svm classifier can not offer any suggestions when it comes to subclasses or items : with 18,380 or 217,907 categories there is just not enough data to train the classifier ; its accuracy would be too low . but \n reducing misclassification at the catmat level already improves the quality of the data , even if the user chooses the wrong subclass or item - research and auditing done at the class level will be more reliable . and perhaps the user is more likely to choose the correct subclass and item when the catmat class is correct . \n svm is a well - known classification algorithm first introduced by vapnik and lerner ( 1963 ) and later popularized by boser , guyon and vapnik ( 1992 ) and by cortes and vapnik ( 1995 ) . \n it learns from manually classified samples ( the training samples ) and then uses that knowledge to classify new samples . \n here we have a total of 28,420,761 samples , which are all the goods the brazilian government purchased between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 . \n i split the samples into 70% training , 15% validation , and 15% testing . \n the classifier  sees \" the description _ and _ the catmat class of each of the training samples and thus learns how to map descriptions onto catmat classes . \n for instance , the classifier learns that when  stapler \" appears in the description the good is usually classified under catmat class # 7520 . \n it learns that when  tea \" appears in the description the good is usually classified under catmat class # 8955 . \n and so on . \n once the classifier is trained we use the validation samples to assess its performance . for each validation sample and each catmat class \n the classifier estimates the probability that the sample belongs to that class . \n hence for each validation sample the classifier estimates 560 probabilities . \n the estimation is word - based . \n for instance , having the word  stapler \" in the description increases the probability that the sample belongs to catmat class # 7520 and decreases the probability that it belongs to catmat class # 8955 . \n when all estimations are done we check how often the catmat class of highest probability is the correct one . \n we then go back to the training phase , changing one or more model parameters ( like the learning rate or the regularization term ) . \n we assess the classifier s performance once more . \n we train the model again , with new changes in the parameters . \n and so on and so forth until we are satisfied with the results . \n when the classifier performs well enough with the validation samples we check how well it performs with the testing samples . \n that is the final result - once the testing samples are used we can not go back and adjust the parameters again , lest we overfit the classifier ( i.e. , lest we make the classifier too responsive to the idiosyncrasies of our data and thus non - generalizable ) . \n before we can train the svm classifier we need to collect , clean , and process the data . \n all the data are in the comprasnet database . \n the descriptions are in the d_itcp_item_compra table . \n the catmat classes are in the f_item_compra table . \n a common key allows joins between these two tables . \n i discarded the cases whose description and/or class was empty or null we are left . \n i also discarded the cases that corresponded to services ( about 10% of the total ) , as services are too unique and idiosyncratic for algorithmic classification . \n the result was a total of 28,420,761 samples ; as mentioned above , they correspond to all the goods the brazilian government purchased between 1999 - 04 - 01 and 2015 - 04 - 02 . \n i lower - cased all the descriptions and removed all special characters , numbers , and one - character words . \n i also converted plural words to singular words , using the first step of a portuguese stemmer algorithm ( the rslp algorithm , created by orengo and huyck [ 2001 ] ) . \n finally , i removed all words that only appeared once in the entire dataset . \n i transformed each document ( description ) into a vector of word counts and merged all vectors . \n this resulted in a term - frequency matrix - a matrix whose rows represent words , columns represent documents , and each entry is the frequency of word _ \n i _ on document _ j _ ( i.e. , the term - frequency , @xmath0 ) . \n next i apply the @xmath1 transformation . \n the @xmath1 of each entry is given by its term - frequency ( @xmath0 ) multiplied by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number of documents and @xmath4 is the number of documents in which word @xmath5 appears ( i.e. , the word s document frequency  @xmath6 ; the @xmath2 ratio thus gives us the inverse document frequency \n @xmath7 ) . \n what the @xmath1 transformation does is increase the importance of the word the more it appears in the document but the less it appears in the whole corpus . \n hence it helps us reduce the weights of inane words like ` the ' ( ` o ' , in portuguese ) , ` of ' ( ` de ' ) , etc and increase the weights of discriminant words ( i.e. , words that appear a lot but only in a few documents ) . for more details on @xmath1 \n see manning , raghavan , and schtze ( 2008 ) . \n the next step is normalization . \n here we have documents of widely different sizes , ranging from two or three words to dozens of words . \n longer documents contain more unique words and have larger @xmath8 values , which may skew the results ( manning , raghavan , and schtze 2008 ) . to avoid that we normalize the columns of the @xmath1 matrix , transforming them into unit vectors . \n the resulting @xmath1 matrix has dimensions 28,420,761 ( descriptions ) by 505,938 ( unique words ) . \n it is this matrix that we use to train , validate , and test the svm classifier . \n our svm classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.3% . \n the errors seem to have two main causes . first , misclassification in the training data \n . the svm classifier is learning from imperfect examples . \n as we discussed before , half the goods currently classified as wheeled vehicles ( catmat class # 2320 ) are actually spare parts ( catmat classes # 2510 , # 2520 , # 2530 , and # 2590 ) . \n second , class frequency . \n catmat classes that are bought more often tend to be more accurately classified by the svm classifier . \n this is expected : for these classes there are more training samples , so the classifier has a larger set of descriptions from which to learn . \n in fact , there is a negative linear correlation between class frequency and misclassification rate ( -0.36 , with p @xmath9 0.0001 ) . \n i used the trained classifier to build an open source web app . \n its interface is very simple : there is a single input form , wherein the user writes or pastes the description of the good being purchased ( as it appears on the invitation to bid , for example ) . \n the user then clicks submit and is shown the three most likely catmat classes .    in the example below we inputed the description of an air conditioning unit and \n got back three catmat classes : # 4120 ( air conditioning equipment ) , with probability 58% ;

{"ContextTokens": 2715, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "a matter - antimatter mix is generally expected to annihilate . however , under certain conditions a trend might appear , which leads to a matter - antimatter space separation . \n the problem was discussed elsewhere ( see , for example @xcite ) . in the present work \n an original approach is discussed . \n our formulation of the problem is as follows . \n * an _ open system _ of material objects and radiation is considered in a flat space - time . \n there is no phisical cause for preference in choosing inertial reference frames . \n thus , the system is assumed to be baryon symmetric , uniform and isotropic on average _ in any reference frame_. it leads to specific requirement for a matter coordinate - momentum distribution , as shown further . \n * material objects are characterized by a mass distribution ( in a unit volume ) @xmath0 , which is the same for matter and antimatter . \n baryon charge is conserved . \n in addition , the system is characterized by a uniform coordinate - momentum distribution ( in a unit volume ) . \n @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3.1 in  space and momentum 3-vectors . * \n all known physical interactions are allowed between system constituents \n .    the above formulation of the problem reflects the idea of a generalized matter transport equation . in the present work a treatment of the problem will be as much simplified as possible to concentrate our attention on the question of matter - antimatter separation . \n we do not specify the physical nature of material objects . \n any concrete astrophysical picture of a matter structure might be embedded , if needed , into the frame under consideration . in general , an object is meant to be a free microscopic or macroscopic particle , free solid body or a gravitationally linked system ( particle cloud , multi - body association , galaxy etc ) . \n we assume that a free object is made of either matter or antimatter . \n hence , an object is characterized by its mass at rest and baryonic type , its internal evolution being ignored . for the purpose of this work it seems sufficient to consider object - object interaction in general terms of a random collision followed by a formation of a compound system , which may disintegrate into new objects with channel probabilities of fragmentation , annihilation , and merge processes . \n we assume that matter - antimatter annihilation results in gamma radiation being a source of a following pair production . \n it means that annihilated matter is regenerated in the `` first group '' of a mass distribution . \n the `` first group '' may be referred , in principle , to elementary particles as a `` seed matter '' and plays a role of a source term in a kinetic equation . \n next comments concern relativistic properties of an open system . \n first of all , we need to explain the term `` relativistic material system '' . \n a uniform isotropic matter distribution in a flat space is characterized by a uniform coordinate - momentum distribution function ( 1 ) . \n it is lorentz - invariant , that is unchanged if measured in any inertial reference frame . \n such a state of matter can be treated as a `` maximal chaos '' in terms of bayesian approach for description of relativistic gas @xcite . \n actually , this is an approximation of non - interacting particles . \n it is worth noting that the relativistic gas model has nothing in common with friedmann - lemaitre expanding universe model @xcite , which treats matter like dust - like matter - made particles with small relative velocities in an observer s vicinity . \n the expanding universe itself plays a role of the absolute reference frame . in our approach \n an opportunity of introducing the absolute reference frame is denied . \n however , the above approximation of non - interacting particles leads to an infinite energy density . in a more rigorous relativistic gas model one has to take into account that physical processes locally observed under conditions of an open system should be characterized by retarded casual connections with the rest of the space , and inertial systems must be referred to a limited space - time volume depending on how precise they are needed to be defined . \n hence , a `` realistic '' coordinate - momentum distribution must be characterized by some space - energy correlation and must have a smooth cut - off at however high energy range , or an effective temperature parameter . now any local energy density will be found limited and invariant in a broad set of inertial systems ( the higher temperature , the broader set ) . \n we assume that the temperature is well above the threshold needed for pair production process being effective . \n under above conditions annihilation and pair production processes have to be balanced , for there is no energy dissipation in the open system . in other words , \n the system is expected to be in a self - sustained baryon symmetric state . \n if a mass distribution function is not degenerated into the `` first source group '' one can state that a matter - antimatter space separation takes place . \n the mass distribution function should be found from a material balance ( kinetic ) equation . \n let a mass distribution function for like matter objects ( in a unit volume ) be given in a mass group form for matter @xmath4 or antimatter @xmath5 : @xmath6 with a total mass conserved : @xmath7    next we use so called _ one velocity approximation _ , that is an equation being averaged over momentum distribution . \n let us introduce a generation rate @xmath8 of matter -

function is normalized to ensure a correct mass balance , annihilated mass in a form of gamma - radiation being taken into account .    choosing a proper summation rule we come to expressions for a removal rate @xmath20 and @xmath21 in matter - matter and matter - antimatter types of collision , correspondingly . \n @xmath22\\rightarrow m_k)>\\ ] ] @xmath23\\rightarrow m_k)>\\ ] ]    as is said above , an annihilation rate @xmath24 is followed by a matter recreation in the first group , @xmath25 , masses of radiation @xmath26 and recreated matter @xmath27 being in balance : @xmath28\\rightarrow m_\\gamma ) > ~.\\ ] ]    finally , we have a stationary kinetic equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    due to a symmetry of physical properties of matter and antimatter \n one can get the same equation starting considering generation / removal rates for antimatter - made objects . \n the equation ( 9 ) may be written in an integral form . \n it is easy to see that the equation has a non - trivial solution if a merge channel providing a transfer from a mass group @xmath9 to a mass group @xmath34 is open . \n since microscopic and macroscopic merging processes are known from conventional physics we may conclude that the above equation has a physical meaning . \n to demonstrate a solution we realized the monte carlo method for k - functions reduced to delta - functions . \n in other words , the fragmentation process has been ignored . \n we checked that it does not appreciably influence the form of solution though a computing time significantly increases . \n obviously , a solution depends on a collision cross - section as a function of an object mass . \n four variants were studied : constant cross - section , cross - section , proportional to the mass of a target object , cross - section proportional to both the mass of target and the mass of incident object , finally cross - section proportional to the squared mass of the target object . \n the last two variants were expected to have only slightly different solutions . \n the variants seem to include typical types of mass - dependent cross - sections of body - body physical interactions . however , concrete energy - dependent cross - sections for specific interactions may differ significantly in magnitude in different mass intervals . \n we do not know to what extent the solutions are influenced by `` one velocity approximation '' . \n this important question needs a special study on open relativistic matter system properties , their dependence on energy density , in particular . besides \n , taking into account an object internal evolution might be important also if the results were used for their speculative applications concerning astrophysical problems @xcite . \n all these questions are out of the scope of the present work . \n the main conclusion we would like to emphasize is that an open steady - state isotropic system consisted of baryon symmetric uniformly distributed matter should be characterized by a relativistic momentum distribution with an effective high temperature parameter . \n subsequently , a space matter - antimatter separation takes place resulted from random interactions within the system . \n the possible scale of separation may be seen from the statistical assessments of stationary mass distribution functions in fig .  1 . \n the picture gives us the idea of a solution of a simple model kinetic equation describing the above system : the solution may be approximated by a function @xmath35 with @xmath36 ranging between 2 and 3.5 , depending on model parameters . \n apparently , there might be a trend of decreasing @xmath36 for asymptotic solution . \n the latter should be found by analytical method . \n the result shows that an open baryon symmetric matter system reveals a structure containing matter or antimatter - made objects of any size . \n there is no material limit for their construction because of the system being unlimited in space . \n the bigger size ( age ) objects have , the less their population is . \n further computer simulations with more sophisticated models might show more physically meaningful features of the baryon symmetric open system . \n 99 r.omnes . \n * 23 * , 38 ( 1969 ) . \n science , * 171 * , 339 ( 1971 ) . \n f.m.stecker ,  d.l.morgan ,  j.bredekamp . phys.rev.lett . \n * 27 * , 1469 ( 1971 ) . \n c.e.fichtel  and  p.sreekumar . \n proc . of the fourth compton conf . \n , 436 , aip ( 1997 ) . \n j.l.synge . the relativistic gas . north -

functional - based calculations since the original approximations to density - functional theory  @xcite were based upon analytical expressions derived from exchange - only treatments of the the free - electron gas . \n for example slater derived an expression for a local potential which reproduced the hartree - fock trace of the free electron gas  @xcite . \n later , kohn and sham derived an expression that reproduced the fermi energy of the free electron gas  @xcite . \n the latter expression also reproduces the total exchange - energy of a free - electron gas ( see for example ref . \n the factor of @xmath1 difference in the kohn - sham and slater approximations also lead to the use of the x@xmath2 approximations  @xcite and approximations along the lines of this method continue to be investigated as an attractive means for developing approximate element dependent functionals that permit fully analytic implementation of density functional theory  @xcite . \n such analytic implementation is computationally very efficient and has been used for structure optimization of icosahedral fullerenes containing more than two thousand atoms using triple - zeta quality basis set  @xcite . \n the ability to accurately reproduce polarizabilities of large systems is of significant importance to many forefront research areas in computational chemistry , materials science and quantum physics . \n the ability to accurately determine polarizabilities is required to account for hydrogen bonding , van der waal s interactions ,  @xcite solvation effects ,  @xcite and a materials dielectric response . as discussed in ref . \n @xcite , the same interactions or matrix elements required for an accurate determination of phenomena that are directly mediated by polarizabilities also determine a variety of transition rates which include spontaneous emission , stimulated absorption and emission , and foerster - energy transfer rates . \n such rates are of direct importance to the problem of many photovoltaic applications . \n the radiative transition rates must also be quantified for applications to quantum - control of matter or any type of light - mediated manipulation of molecular- and cluster- materials . \n derivatives of the polarizability tensor with respect to normal - mode displacement also determine the intensity of the raman shifts of a given molecule or cluster  @xcite .    because of the central role that polarizabilities play in materials science and chemistry \n there have been significant efforts aimed at experimentally validating theoretically predicted polarizabilities . \n however , such experiments are themselves very difficult to interpret for a variety of reasons . from the standpoint of comparison to experiments on bulk systems \n , the polarizability of an array of nonoverlapping polarizable molecules may be approximated from the clausius - mossotti relation . \n such comparisons have been performed with some success on very idealized systems such as fullerene molecules  @xcite . \n however , for pure - metal clusters the polarizability may not be determined from such a means because the individual clusters would coalesce into the the bulk material if placed upon a lattice . \n as such the preferred experimental approach for measurement of metal - cluster polarizabilities rely upon the electrostatic equivalent of a stern - gerlach experiment in which a beam of metal clusters traverse a nonuniform electric field and are deflected due to the the induced polarization of the cluster  @xcite . \n again , for simple systems such a fullerene molecules quantitative agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved . however , for metallic clusters deviations exist between different experiments and also between experiment and theory . \n generally , it appears that the theoretically predicted polarizabilties display a more monotonic and smooth behavior than the experimental measurements . \n moreover , earlier comparisons suggested that the experimental polarizabilities tended to be larger than theory . \n such discrepancies are now largely understood to be due to temperature dependent corrections that depend upon the permanent dipole of the clusters . \n however , some discrepancies still exist and it is not understood why . \n one possibility that we attempt to investigate here is that different low - lying geometries of a cluster may have significantly different polarizabilites or anisotropies in their polarizabilities \n .    experimental measurements of polarizability of li clusters containing up to 22 atoms have been reported  @xcite . here , we present and compare our density functional predictions of polarizabilities of li clusters with the avialable experimental data . \n the calculations are performed for clusters in the size range 8 - 22 as number of studies have already addressed polarizabilities up to size 8  @xcite . rather than concentrate on the _ ground state _ for each size regime we have adopted a different approach that relies on the generation of several low - energy structures . \n the polarizability of each structure is subsequently calculated to determine whether conformer - induced changes in polarization are expected to be observable . \n the determination of lowest energy structure of clusters is a nontrivial task . to obtain the candidate structures for the ground state of li clusters , \n we make use of a recently determined database of sodium clusters  @xcite . \n this database is generated using a global optimization technique such as the basin hopping algorithm using the interatomic potential determined within the kohn - sham dft framework . \n this numerical ks dft provides very good description of sodium clusters  @xcite . using starting geometries from this database and bachelet - hamman - schluter pseudo potential method  @xcite \n we quickly generate low - energy structures for li clusters using conjugate - gradient technique . \n a set of few lowest - energy geometries are then selected for further optimization at the all - electron level until forces on all atoms are below the 0.001 hartree / bohr . \n for each of these equilibrium geometries we have then performed six additional calculations with electric fields turned on . \n the included fields are ( e,0,0 ) , ( -e,0,0 ) , ( 0,e,0 ) , ( 0,-e,0 ) , ( 0,0,e ) and ( 0,0,-e ) with e=0.001 atomic units . from the standard relation between the dipole \n moment , polarizability , and applied electric field : @xmath3 we determine the polarizability tensor using a central differencing method . \n additional discussion of this procedure may be found in ref . \n @xcite . from the above expression it is possible to determine the central - difference off - diagonal elements ( @xmath4 ) from either @xmath5 and @xmath6 or @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the limit of a vanishingly small - field or an exactly harmonic polarizability tensor \n , the values obtained in the two different ways would agree perfectly ( regardless of issues related to basis sets ) . \n this exact relation provides one way of estimating whether the applied electric field is small enough to accurately determine the polarizability tensor . \n we find that the off - diagonal elements are small but agree to approximately 1 - 5% . \n of course , the size of the off - diagonal element depends on the original choice of coordinate system . \n our original coordinate system uses the principal axes of inertia . to determine the principal polarizability axes we then diagonalize the polarizability tensor and rotate the molecule so that the molecular x , y and z axes coincide with the predicted principle polarizability axes . as a final check we have ascertained for several cases that the predicted polarizabilities are accurate and uncontaminated by higher - order polarizabilities . for these tests , we perform an analysis similar to that of quong and pederson for the c@xmath9 and benzene polarizabilites  @xcite . that is , we have determined that the polarizabilities obtained from either energies or dipole moments agree .    to perform the electronic - structure calculations we have used the nrlmol suite of codes due to pederson _ \n et al . _ \n this all - electron method uses gaussian - type orbitals to represent both the core , valence and unoccupied electrons . \n a highly accurate variational integration mesh  @xcite is used to calculate matrix elements required for the secular equation . \n the coulomb potential is calculated analytically ( in terms of incomplete gamma functions )  @xcite on this mesh . \n the exchange - correlation potential and energy kernel is also calculated analytically on this mesh . for the work discussed here we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite generalized gradient approximation . \n the basis sets here have been specifically optimized for this functional . for li \n , we use a total of ten single - gaussians to construct 5 contracted s - type orbitals , 3 contracted p - type orbitals and 1-contracted d - type orbital . \n each d - type orbital used also contributes a spherical s - type orbital with an @xmath10 prefactor . \n this basis set is used for optimizing the geometry . \n .gaussian decay parameter , @xmath11 in bohr@xmath12 , and contraction coefficients , c(1s ) and c(2s ) , used in this work . as discussed in the text \n , the default basis set also contains single gaussians . for the s functions we use @xmath13-@xmath14 . \n the p functions use @xmath15-@xmath16 . \n the d functions use @xmath15 . for the polarizability calculations , we also include @xmath14 and @xmath17 for the p- and d- functions respectively . [ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ] \n in this paper we have discussed a relatively automated procedure for investigating polarizabilities of clusters as a function of size and conformation . \n this procedure has been tested on lithium clusters in the n=8 - 22 range due to availability of experimental data . \n while the binding energy per atom and average polarizability show very little nonmonotonic behavior in this range , there are significant departures from isotropic polarizabilities in these clusters . as expected from jellium models it is only for n=20 , the polarizability tensor is found to be significantly isotropic . \n the calculated polarizabilities show smoother decrease with increase in cluster size than the experimental values . \n the spin polarized calculations indicate that all even size clusters as expected have zero moments ( no unpaired electron ) . \n however , a few odd size clusters are found to show higher ( 3 @xmath18 ) spin states . \n we thank dr . \n p. calaminici and dr . \n g. maroulis for encouraging us to complete the present work for this issue . \n this work is supported in part by the national science foundation through crest grant , by the university of texas at el paso ( utep startup funds ) and in part by the office of naval research , directly ( onr 05pr07548 - 00 ) and through the naval research laboratory . \n computational support was provided by the dod high performance computing modernization office . \n m. r. pederson , r. a. heaton , j. g. harrison and c. c. lin , metallic state of the free - electron gas within the self - interaction - corrected local - spin - density approximation , phys . \n b * 39 * , 1581 ( 1989 ) .              m.r . \n pederson and t. baruah , molecular polarizabilities from density - functional theory : from small molecules to light - harvesting complexes , in _ lecture series on computer and computational sciences _ , vol 3 pp 156 - 167 ( 2005 ) . \n pederson , t. baruah , p. b. allen and c. schmidt , density - functional - based determination of vibrational polarizabilities in molecules within the double - harmonic approximation : derivation and application , \n _ j. chem . theory and comp . _ * 4 * , 590 ( 2005 ) . \n e. benichou , r. antoine , d. rayane , b. vezin , f. w. dalby , ph . \n dugourd , m. broyer c. ristori , f. chandezon , b. a. huber , j. c. rocco , s. a. blundell , and c. guet , measurement of static electric dipole polarizabilities of lithium clusters : consistency with measured dynamic polarizabilities , _ phys . \n rev . a _ * 59 * , r1 ( 1999 ) . \n g. maroulis and d. xenides , enhanced linear and nonlinear polarizabilities for the li4 cluster . \n how satisfactory is the agreement between theory and experiment for the static dipole polarizability ? \n _ j. phys . \n a _ * 103 * , 4590 ( 1999 ) .              a. vichare , d. g. kanehre , and s. a. blundell , model dependence of the thermodynamic properties of na8 and na20 clusters studied with ab initio electronic structure methods , _ phys . \n b _ * 64 * , 045408 ( 2001 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 353284245801, "RequestID": "7ac66fbe575a4c41b4129582d3de6aef", "TotalTokens": 3417}

korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ) . \n models using these response functions are those of tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998 ) , trager _ \n ( 2000a ) , and thomas , maraston & bender ( 2003 ) . \n however , the accuracy of these theoretical predictions have not been tested empirically yet . \n it is the main objective of this work to provide [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios for one of the most complete empirical stellar libraries currently available ( miles ) ( * m*id - resolution * i*saac newton telescope * l*ibrary of * e*mpirical * s*pectra , snchez - blzquez _ et al . \n the miles database , which was especially designed for stellar population modelling , contains flux calibrated optical spectra of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for 985 stars covering @xmath33525 - 7500  with a homogeneous resolution @xmath4 = fwhm = 2.3  . the parametric coverage of sample stars in the three - dimensional h - r diagram is quite wide : 2800 @xmath5 t@xmath1 @xmath5 50400 k , 0.0 @xmath5 @xmath6 g @xmath5 @xmath75.0 , and @xmath82.7 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath71.0 dex , where [ fe / h ] = log(fe / h)@xmath9 @xmath8 log(fe / h)@xmath10 such that formally log(fe ) = log(@xmath11(fe)/@xmath11(h ) ) + 12 , log(h ) = 12 and @xmath11(fe ) and @xmath11(h ) are the numerical densities ( @xmath12 ) of iron and hydrogen atoms respectively . \n the scales for these photospheric parameters were carefully defined by cenarro _ \n their precisions , respectively @xmath13100 k , @xmath130.2 and @xmath130.1 dex , makes miles good for ssp modelling . for the present work , we excluded those stars with uncertain or wrong atmospheric parameters ( see vazdekis _ \n _ 2010 for details about how these stars were identified ) . \n the miles [ mg / fe ] catalogue presented here consists of two measurement sets . the first one is composed of measurements obtained from the literature from high spectral resolution analyses properly calibrated to a common system . \n the second set assembles abundances measured by us directly from the miles mid - resolution ( hereafter mr ) spectra and calibrated using the high - resolution ( hereafter hr ) sample . \n the catalogue is represented in two separate tables for field and cluster stars . \n both tables are only available in electronic form . \n the paper layout is as follows : section 2 describes the compilation of hr abundance measurements from the literature and their calibration ; section 3 shows the mg abundance measurements from the miles spectra ; section 4 compiles the miles [ mg / fe ] catalogue and analyses its coverage over the library parameter space ; section 5 compares our stellar data with predictions of theoretical models focusing on the behaviour of some lick indices with [ mg / fe ] ; and , finally , section 6 plans for applications to building new simple stellar population models with variable @xmath0-enhancement . \n section 7 summarizes the whole paper and final conclusions . \n there are also three appendices : appendix a confronts the compiled hr data with a well - known stellar spectrum library , appendix b presents comparisons of the miles photospheric parameter scales with those from the compiled hr studies , and appendix c compares the results for cluster stars with hr studies . \n the first step of this work consisted of performing a bibliographic compilation of magnesium abundances from high - resolution spectroscopic analyses for the miles library stars . to guarantee homogeneity between the measurements provided by several studies we performed a calibration and correction of systematic differences among sources and a chosen standard reference system , following a similar procedure as in cenarro _ \n et al . _ ( 2001 , 2007 ) \n for instance , feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) give a detailed error analysis of elemental abundances for g and k metal - rich dwarfs also including comparisons with other studies . in this section , we describe the chosen reference sample and the procedures we followed to homogenize the measurements to a single uniform scale of [ mg / fe ] .      our reference sample to define a scale for the mg / fe abundance ratio is from borkova & marsakov ( 2005 , hereafter bm05 ) . \n the catalogue of borkova & marsakov is a robust compilation of the atmospheric parameters t@xmath1 , log @xmath14 and [ fe / h ] plus [ mg / fe ] from high - s / n high - resolution analyses of field stars published between 1989 and 2003 ( covering 36 studies with mg abundance determinations for around 900 stars ) . \n bm05 computed weighted average values and their errors through an iterative procedure in order to correct for the systematic deviations of each data set relative to reduced mean homogeneous scales . \n the uncertainty of [ mg / fe ] in bm05 is 0.05 and 0.07 dex , respectively , for metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath81.0 dex ) and metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath81.0 dex ) . \n the bm05 catalogue contains 218 stars in common with the miles library ( all with log @xmath14 @xmath16 3.0 ) . \n bm05 was also the reference work adopted in cenarro _ \n ( 2009 ) , where mg and ca abundances were compiled for 192 stars of their calcium triplet stellar library ( hereafter cat ) of 706 objects . \n as there are many miles stars in common with the cat sample ( 132 stars ) , this work provides values that we can compare with ( see appendix a ) . \n we first checked the possible presence of systematic differences in the scales of miles and bm05 atmospheric parameters ( [ fe / h ] , log @xmath14 and t@xmath1 ) , however we did not find any ( see appendix b for details ) . \n apart from the bm05 compilation , we obtained [ mg / fe ] for 97 more stars from 15 other hr studies , as listed in table 1 . \n their abundance ratios were then carefully transformed onto the adopted scale as described next .", "StartTimeOffset": 364574176686, "RequestID": "ac3ad6634d704bc3a7fa508a5d9d69ba", "TotalTokens": 2491}
{"ContextTokens": 3706, "GeneratedTokens": 183, "SynthesizedBody": "atomic resonance/ fluorescence lines may be linearly polarized when anisotropic optical pumping produces an anisotropic angular momentum distribution ( `` alignment '' ) within the ground state @xcite ( hereafter yl06,yl07,yl08 ) . \n this occurs if the pumping photon rate is greater than the collision rate , for instance within 1 - 10 pc of an ob star . in the presence of a magnetic field , `` magnetic realignment '' then occurs when the larmor frequency is greater than the photon rate . for the `` saturated '' case ( valid in the diffuse ism , where any field @xmath0 @xmath1gauss causes realignment ) , the polarization depends on the 3d geometry of the magnetic field , the ion ground state configuration and sometimes on the pumping spectrum . in circumstellar matter , @xmath2 @xmath1gauss \n is required for realignment , and the polarization can depend also on the field strength . \n related effects have been seen in the sun @xcite , but have not yet been demonstrated elsewhere . as a diagnostic of the magnetic field , \n magnetic realignment is potentially more powerful than the 21 cm zeeman effect , since it is sensitive to weaker fields and works in hot gas , and more powerful than dust alignment , since it is sensitive to 3d geometry , gas properties and velocity . \n this paper explores observational aspects of this effect . \n figure 1 shows the observational geometry . \n a gas cloud with a magnetic field at an angle @xmath3 from the line of sight is illuminated by a nearby star ( the `` pumping star '' ) at an angle @xmath4 from the field ( @xmath5 from the line of sight ) . in the absorption case , \n flux from a star behind the cloud ( the `` target star '' , which may be the same as the pumping star ) is absorbed by ions in the cloud . \n if the ions are aligned , the resultant absorption line is linearly polarized , with a position angle either parallel or perpendicular to the projected magnetic field , and a degree that depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for absorption , yl06 \n show that a non - zero polarization requires ions with at least three fine states in the ground level @xmath6 . in neutral gas , the most common ions are ni , oi , sii , and feii . the spectral resolution required is @xmath7 , to resolve the interstellar lines . \n since the absorption lines are almost entirely in the fuv , this requires a high resolution fuv spectropolarimeter @xcite .    in the emission case , \n the observed light is light from the pumping star which is scattered into the line of sight . \n the unique polarization signature of magnetic realignment is a distortion of position angles of the scattered emission lines from the centrosymmetric pattern expected for pure reflection polarization . yl07 and \n yl08 show that ions need at least three fine _ or hyperfine _ states in the ground level ( @xmath8 ) for a nonzero magnetic field effect . \n this adds the resonance lines of nai , ki , and alii to the roster . \n also , transitions that do not return to the ground state ( fluorescence ) exhibit the effect , thus opening up numerous targets in the visible and nir . \n the spectral resolution required is more modest : for sensitivity against scattered dust continuum @xmath9 is adequate . \n thus in principle , this effect can be observed with a ground - based moderate - resolution spectropolarimeter . \n this paper describes the beginnings of such an investigation , targeted at fluorescence lines in the visible . \n visible - wavelength fluorescence of oi , ni , and siii has been observed in hii regions and planetary nebulae @xcite . however , these lines are faint compared to the recombination and collision - excited lines in these regions , and the existence of alternate excitation mechanisms confuses their use . \n a better environment for the exploration of these lines is the neutral medium , for instance the gas within reflection nebulae , where photoexcitation is the sole excitation mechanism . \n a rough calculation suggests that the lines should be visible above the dust - scattered continuum with an equivalent width of @xmath10 , so should be visible with moderate resolution . \n no such observations have been published : we here report a pilot spectroscopic investigation of the bright rn ngc2023 . \n observations were obtained on 25 - 27 oct , 2006 as a part of `` performance verification '' on the new robert stobie spectrograph @xcite on the southern african large telescope , a new 10m - class telescope ( buckley , swart , & meiring 2006 ) . a north -

wavelength emission : ni , oi , mgii , alii , siii , ari , tiii , crii , mnii , feii , and niii . \n we observe ni , oi , siii , feii , and possibly tiii and crii . \n the observed equivalent widths are adequately predicted by a simple shell illuminated by a b1.5v star , @xmath37 mag , @xmath38 km / s , and no h@xmath39 absorption : the ratio of the predicted to observed equivalent widths are given in table 1 and shown in figure 2b . \n all the predicted lines for our wavelength coverage are seen to within a factor of two of prediction , except for oi @xmath186048 , which may in fact be feii , and for the mgii lines @xmath408115/8120 , which are not seen , perhaps due to additional depletion . outside of our wavelength coverage , we predict a detectable line of alii at 8641   and two very strong lines of mgii at 9221 and 9244 @xmath21 ( table 1 ) . \n we have not yet made predictions for tiii , crii , and feii , because their non - ls coupling results in far more complex pumping . \n we can now predict polarization signals from the lines seen and predicted for ngc2023 . \n the polarization is the sum of the reflection polarization - the polarization expected from an unaligned ( `` thermalized '' ) ground state - plus that due to ground state alignment . \n @xcite gives the reflection polarization , @xmath41 where @xmath5 is the scattering angle and @xmath19 is the `` polarizability '' , which depends only on the angular momentum @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) of the ground , upper and final levels ( table 1 ) . \n the polarization position angle is centrosymmetric : either perpendicular or parallel to the scattering plane . \n the maximum polarization is @xmath44@xmath19 at @xmath45 ; @xmath46 corresponds to thompson scattering . \n the alignment polarization will be nonzero only for alignable ions , where the ground state is aligned by pumping via all the possible uv resonance transitions . \n addition of the alignment to the reflection polarization changes both the degree of polarization _ and the position angle _ , depending on the scattering angle and the 3d magnetic field orientation . \n this results in a position angle that is no longer centrosymmetric , a feature unique to this process ( see figure 3a ) . \n a useful measure of this signal is the deviation @xmath47 from centrosymmetric , expressed as a polarization , @xmath48 .    a plot of  @xmath49(max ) _ vs _ @xmath19 ( table 1 ; figure 3b ) for each line is useful to plan the analysis . of the ions we see or predict , two are not alignable ( mgii and siii ) , and 5 are ( oi , alii , tiii , crii , and feii ) . to deduce the magnetic field geometry at any position in a nebula , we need first to estimate the scattering angle @xmath5 . for this \n we use lines of nonalignable ions with large @xmath19 , like mg ii @xmath189218 ( @xmath50 ) with equation ( 1 ) to derive @xmath5 . \n lines with zero polarizability ( mgii @xmath189244 , si ii @xmath185979 ) are used to measure and subtract foreground interstellar polarization . \n finally , to derive the magnetic field map , we use the map of @xmath51 for lines of alignable ions like oi @xmath187995 and alii @xmath188641 . \n ( if there is significant variation in @xmath5 along the line of sight , a more complex model will be required ) . \n a important consideration is the role of optical depth of the uv pumping lines . \n if the pumping line is `` trapped '' ( return is much more probable to the ground state than to an excited state ) , then when @xmath52 the excitation will be dominated by diffuse trapped light , which is no longer anisotropic ; any fluorescence from this level will be unpolarized , and the ground state can not become aligned . \n on one hand , most fluorescent exciters are never trapped , because the fluorescent transition itself has sufficiently high probability that the exciting radiation is rapidly destroyed : the maximum number of scatterings @xmath53(escape prob ) @xcite . \n ( in the simple model for ngc2023 above , the fluorescence intensity is modeled as being proportional to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , whichever is smaller ) . \n thus the reflection polarization of fluorescent lines should not usually be depolarized by a large factor . on the other hand , many alignable ions have lower lying trapped resonance lines that dominate the pumping of the ground state , whose effect is then to depolarize the _ alignment _ polarization . \n remedies for this situation are to look at thinner nebulae , and to look at ions which do not have trapped resonance lines , such as feii . \n we plan spectroscopy of ngc2023 and other nebulae to look for the predicted mgii and alii lines , followed by slit spectropolarimetry to find the best lines . \n the new fabry - perot polarimetry mode of the salt rss spectropolarimeter will then be used for construction of a magnetic field map . \n modeling improvements will include an feii realignment calculation and fluorescence model . \n buckley d.a.h . , \n swart g.p . , meiring j.g . , 2006 , proc spie , 6267 gatley , i. , hasegawa , t. , suzuki , h. , garden , r. , brand , p. , lightfoot , j. , glencross , w. , okuda , h. , & nagata , t. 1987 , 318 , 73 grandi , s.a . 1976 , 206 , 658 hummer , d.g . \n 1964 , 140 , 276 kobulnicky , h.a . , \n nordsieck , k.h . , \n burgh , e.b . , \n smith , m.p . , \n percival , j.w . , \n williams , t.b.and odonoghue , d. 2003 , proc spie , 4841 , 1634 nordsieck , k.h . , jaehnig , k.p . , \n burgh , e.b . , \n kobulnicky , h.a . , \n percival , j.w . , & smith , m.p . \n 2003 , proc spie , 4843 , 170 stenflo , j. o. 1994 , solar magnetic fields ( dordrecht : kluwer ) yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2006 , , 653 , 1292 yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2007 , , 657 , 618 yan , h. , & lazarian , a. 2008 , , 677 , 1401", "StartTimeOffset": 370234367813, "RequestID": "77c347eddb494713958ad2ce8c1d8986", "TotalTokens": 3889}
{"ContextTokens": 2013, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "most black hole x - ray binaries are transients . they spend years to decades in a very low state , and then increase in luminosity over a few days by as much as eight orders of magnitude . the outbursts \n last for weeks to months before the source returns to quiescence . \n quiescent black hole binaries ( hereafter qbhbs ) , have optical / ir emission dominated by the companion star , which can be used to precisely determine the orbital parameters , including the mass of the black hole ( see @xcite for details and a discussion of potential errors ) . \n but there is also emission from the residual accretion flow and from jets , which plays an important role in understanding the changes in accretion state during the outburst . finally , the inferred demographics of x - ray binaries , which have assumed a heightened importance in the dawning era of gravitational wave astronomy ( @xcite ) , depend critically on the duration of quiescence . \n observational astrophysicists commonly employ a variety of metaphors in explaining the importance of their work . \n accordingly i will organize the rest of this paper by means of three of the more common metaphors , whose literal manifestations are shown in figure 1 . \n i will take as an example the prototypical black hole x - ray transient a0620 - 00 ( hereafter a0620 ) , which underwent a huge outburst in 1975 ( @xcite ) reaching a peak flux of over 50 crabs . and \n has been in quiescence ever since . \n a `` smoking gun '' is an observation that confirms something that was already suspected to be true . in the case of qbhbs \n , the confirmed truth is that the accreting object in many x - ray binaries is a black hole . \n the companion stars which dominate the optical / ir light in qbhbs have optical absorption spectra similar to those of ordinary main sequence or giant stars . by applying traditional binary star techniques to these stars , the orbital parameters of the system can be robustly obtained . in many cases , \n the mass of the compact accreting star can be shown to be greater than @xmath0 , the upper limit on the mass of a neutron star . \n such objects are sometimes referred to as `` dynamically confirmed black hole candidates '' . \n the radial velocity curve of the companion can be used to determine the mass function @xmath1 , which is a strict lower limit on the mass of the compact object . \n the first mass function greater than @xmath0 was obtained by @xcite for a0620 ; since then better data have been obtained for a0620 ( @xcite ) and over a dozen other systems have been observed ( @xcite ) . \n the radial velocity curves are beautifully sinusoidal , as expected from tidally circularized systems , and there is little doubt that they represent the true motion of the companion star .    to obtain a mass , rather than a mass function , for the compact object \n , information about the orbital inclination @xmath2 must be obtained . \n this is generally done by studying the ellipsoidal variations of the companion star , caused by the tidally distorted shape of the companion , which results in changes in the cross - sectional area of the star as a function of orbital phase . \n the interpretation of such observations requires accounting for the contribution of the accretion flow to the observed flux ( e.g @xcite for a0620 ) . \n when this is done , the derived binary parameters fix the geometric size of the companion quite precisely , and the observed colors and absorption spectrum fix the temperature \n . therefore the intrinsic luminosity of the companion is well - determined , leading to robust determinations of the distance . \n one relevant case is that of gro j1655 - 40 , which shows very clearly defined ellipsoidal variations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n the well - determined physical size and temperature of the companion require a distance of @xmath3 kpc . \n an alternative distance of @xmath4 kpc ( @xcite ) would require the companion star to underfill its roche lobe by a factor of 2 , which would result in a nearly spherical star that can not produce the observed ellipsoidal variations . \n the lower distance estimate is based on the assumption that the observed spectral type implies a star with mass and radius similar to those of isolated field stars . \n but the evolution and surface gravity of a star losing mass through roche lobe overflow differ dramatically from those of isolated stars , and the observed masses and radii of qbhb companions differ from field stars of similar spectral type in many well - studied systems , including a0620 ( @xcite ) and v4641 sgr ( @xcite ) , as well as gro j1655 - 40 . \n a  rosetta stone \" is an observation that connects two hitherto disparate phenomena . \n qbhbs may provide such a connection between accretion physics and jet outflows .        during the transition from quiescence to outburst and back , \n x - ray binaries change not only the amount of accretion , but the nature and state of the accretion flow . \n these so - called `` state changes '' have been the subject of considerable recent work . the general consensus ( see @xcite for a review ) is that there is a low - hard state , with a power - law x - ray spectrum and radio emission from a jet , and a high - soft state , in which the x - ray luminosity is dominated by a thermal accretion disk , which quenches the jet . \n there are also a variety of intermediate states . \n the presence of a jet in the low - hard state has led to a scenario in which the accretion in that state is in the form of a radiatively inefficient radial flow , which allows the formation of of a jet ( @xcite ) . \n but it should be noted that the empirical support for such accretion - jet scenarios rests on the radio / x - ray correlation . \n the possibility that there might be a `` universal '' correlation in which @xmath5 , and , with suitable correction for the mass of the accretor , extends to the agn , generated considerable excitement ( @xcite ) . \n observations of a0620 ( @xcite ) held down the low luminosity end of this correlation nicely . however , further investigation revealed multiple correlations and branches , and a recent reobservation of a0620 has shown that the source has moved in the @xmath6 plane in a direction perpendicular to the general correlation ( see figure 2 ) . \n so the connection between accretion and jet physics is not yet as empirically well - founded as one might have hoped . \n the `` tip of the iceberg '' is an object or observation which implies the existence of a large unseen population . \n the current set of observed x - ray transients is certainly the tip of the iceberg of many currently unobserved galactic black hole binaries . \n x - ray transients are generally discovered during their brief outbursts , which requires that the outburst occur at a time when it can be observed . \n since x - ray astronomy is only @xmath7 years old , objects that have not gone into outburst during that time can not have been identified . \n many objects have been observed in outburst only once , which implies the existence of objects that havent gone into outburst at all . \n if such objects are common , the number of qbhbs in the galaxy will scale with the typical outburst recurrence time , a quantity for which there is currently no empirical constraint . \n theoretical arguments can be made regarding the outburst recurrence time based on assumptions associated with the disk instabilities responsible for the outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n however the variable recurrence timescales displayed by objects that have multiple outbursts demonstrate that we still have much to learn about these instabilities . \n but we now have decades of monitoring of qbhbs , and we can begin to see how they evolve as the disk builds up toward its next outburst . \n recently , a decade - long brightening trend has been found in nova muscae 1991 ( @xcite ) . \n it is also notable that the passive quiescent state in a0620 ( @xcite ) has disappeared over the past ten years in favor of the brighter active quiescent state . \n we therefore examined all of the quiescent data from a0620 accumulated since 2003 . \n as can be seen in figure 3 , the initial finding was very encouraging  however when data from 2015 -

{"ContextTokens": 3694, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "the advances in the comprehension of the physical properties of manganese perovskites have been given in two main boosts . \n the first one started in 1950 , when these materials were first considered by jonker and van santen . \n @xcite in that period , that spanned over more than a decade , the basic mechanisms governing their magnetic and transport properties were defined , giving rise to the description of the double exchange interaction.@xcite the second one took place last decade , after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite ( although a high mr had already been observed experimentally before , first by searle and wang@xcite and later by kusters _ \n et al._@xcite ) . during this period , in which we are still immersed \n , the research activity reached a magnitude that made the topic a starring one in the community of condensed matter physics , and the current opinion about the state - of - the - art underwent several changes . in the first few years after the description of cmr \n , explanations were tried on the basis of double exchange,@xcite but it was demostrated soon that such effect alone could not explain the magnitude of cmr.@xcite later , certain evidences in favor of the existence of an inhomogeneous electronic state in these materials started to appear.@xcite this tendence continues nowadays after the conclusions of many groups that found -and are still finding- that the homogeneous description of the magnetic and electronic state of manganites is almost ruled out .    in order to establish the basis for such behavior the idea of phase separation , i.e. \n , the coexistence of regions of localized and itinerant carriers within the same crystallographic structure , has been proposed.@xcite in this framework , dagotto , hotta and moreo@xcite proposed in a recent review the existence of a temperature window where coexisting metallic and insulating clusters appear above the curie temperature , @xmath3 , when this transition is first - order and there is a source of disorder . \n this temperature window would extend up to @xmath4 , where these clusters dissociate to form two - mn zener polarons ( or small polarons ) . \n the aim of the present work is to find experimental evidence of such temperature @xmath6 . for this purpose , ultrasonic attenuation and phase velocity measurements \n were carried out in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . \n this technique is proved to be a very sensitive tool not only for studying defects and microscopic processes in solids , but also for probing systems undergoing magnetic and structural phase transitions.@xcite \n samples were prepared by solid state reaction of la@xmath7o@xmath2 , cao or srco@xmath2 , mno@xmath7 and mno ( at least 99.995 @xmath8 in purity ) , which were heated in air in two steps ( 1100@xmath9c 70 hours , 1200@xmath9c 27 hours ) and pressed into disks . \n the temperature was slowly ramped at 5@xmath9c / min , and cooled down to room temperature at 2@xmath9c / min . \n intermediate grindings were made . \n pellets were finally pressed at 7 ton/@xmath10 and annealed at 1300@xmath9c for 100 hours , with an intermediate grinding at 30 hours . \n the nominal oxygen content was almost stoichiometric as determined by iodometric analysis . \n x - ray powder patterns were collected at room temperature using a philips pw1710 diffractometer , working with @xmath11 radiation . \n the lattice parameters , derived by rietveld analysis , are in agreement with those reported in the literature . \n cylindrical pellets , with a diameter of 10.0 mm and heights 2.4 mm ( lacamno ) , and 3.1 mm ( lasrmno ) were used to perform ultrasonic measurements . \n the two opposite faces of each sample were polished so that the difference between two points in each surface was not more than 1 @xmath12 m . \n the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements were performed on a matec-6600 series by means of the conventional pulse - echo technique . \n y - cut quartz transducers of 5 mhz fundamental frequency were used for transverse ultrasonic excitation . \n they were coupled to the sample surface with a grease for high temperature uses ( leak point 550 k ) . \n the sample was coupled at high temperature , and then cooled until 200 k and maintained at this temperature for 15 minutes before measurementes were carried out . \n the ultrasonic elapsed time for a pulse round trip ( transit time ) was obtained with the pulse - echo - overlap technique at the initial temperature . \n then , time variation with temperature was automatically monitored with a sensitivity of 0.05 ns at 5 mhz . \n the experiment was taken in a closed - cycle refrigerator ( janis ) and the temperature of the sample was varied at a rate of about 0.5 k / min . \n in fig . [ un](a ) we show ultrasonic velocity vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and attenuation vs. temperature data for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , obtained with 5 mhz transversal waves between 220 and 400 k. for lasrmno it was impossible to measure the attenuation because its high value allowed to obtain only two echoes at room temperature ( at higher temperatures the second echo became negligible ) . \n the transit time was measurable at room temperature , and then time variations were measured with our automated improved matec system . \n the influence of thermal expansion has not been taken into account , because it is negligible : if ( @xmath13@xmath14)/l=@xmath15 we have that for our sample , with @xmath14= 2.4 mm thick ( 4.8 mm microwave path ) and a velocity of about 2500 m / s , @xmath16 ( @xmath17=time ) is @xmath18 s and therefore , at t@xmath19 , the associated variation of velocity is far smaller than the one we measured .    in our original ultrasonic velocity data , an approximately linear increment with temperature \n was observed at temperatures above 350 k for both samples . at this temperature range \n no mechanism related with magnetic phase transitions is expected , and this variation should be attributed to another mechanism , as the produced by crystalline defects present in the material.@xcite the resonant mechanism associated to dislocation lines is well known from crystalline metals . as moreno - gobbi and eiras@xcite , working on crystalline copper , have shown , it gives a term proportional to t for velocity and proportional to t@xmath20 for attenuation . \n the coefficient of proportionality depends on @xmath21 for velocity and @xmath22 for attenuation , where @xmath23 is the average free length of the segment of dislocation lines . in the present paper \n we assume a background of this kind in order to take into account the variation of velocity at high temperatures . \n the velocity background was fitted to the high temperature region of velocity vs. temperature curves , and then substracted from original data . \n these fits gave a term @xmath24 t for lacamno and @xmath25 t for lasrmno . \n the so - corrected velocity data are presented in fig . \n [ un](b ) . \n the differences between the numerical values of the coefficients of proportionality have their origins in the different values of @xmath23 expected for different materials.@xcite    the ultrasonic velocity for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 presents two clear anomalies : an abrupt hardening at about 250 - 260 k , and another lesser at about 350 - 360 k. the first one marks the t@xmath19 of this system@xcite ( t@xmath19= 260 k ) . \n the behavior is similar to that found at mhz frequencies by other authors,@xcite and at khz frequencies by cordero _ \n al_.@xcite the abrupt decay of the curve at t@xmath19 signals the first - order character of this transition,@xcite an interpretation that is in agreement with results obtained from other techniques.@xcite the decay in velocity is accompanied by a peak in the attenuation curve at t@xmath19 . \n this peak is asymmetric , in agreement with the results of cordero _ \n et al._,@xcite who explain it invoking the presence of inhomogeneous phases below t@xmath19 in a similar way to relaxor ferroelectrics.@xcite    the second anomaly takes place above t@xmath19 , showing a hardening process at @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k ( fig . [ dous ] ) . in fig . \n [ un ] it is also observed a very large attenuation peak at 320 k accompanying this velocity anomaly . \n this was not observed by cordero _ \n et al . _ at khz frequencies , but is clearly observed in our mhz measurements . \n the reason lies on the higher sensitivity of mhz techniques to small inhomogeneities , as magnetic clusters , due to the shortest wavelength ( approximately 0.5 mm at 5 mhz for transversal waves ) .    in figs . \n [ un ] and [ dous ] it is also observed that the only noticeable anomaly in the utrasonic velocity curve of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 is a hardening process beginning at about 370 k ( in the order of that of lacamno in the same temperature region ) , that is coincident with the second - order phase transition point of this compound , clearly observed by magnetization measurements ( t@xmath27 370 k).@xcite in the explored temperatures , no more transitions were detected . \n based on this behavior we can perfectly associate the process of hardening observed at 370 k to this second - order phase transition . \n one of the open issues in the comprehension of the physics of ferromagnetic manganese perovskites at present is to determine the nature of the magnetic phase above @xmath3 . from our ultrasonic velocity data \n it seems that this phase is different in the two systems considered . \n first of all , whereas lacamno displays a first - order transition at @xmath3 , lasrmno presents a second - order one . \n this difference , that has already been highlighted by magnetic measurements,@xcite and attributed by mira _ \n et al._@xcite to a change in the crystal symmetry , from orthorhombic to rhombohedral , seems to have further implications . \n magnetoresistance , thermal expansion , magnetovolume and magnetocaloric effects experience a considerable change when moving from one compound to the other.@xcite also , calorimetric data showed evidence for an anomaly at a similar @xmath6 in those manganites la@xmath28(ca , sr)@xmath29mno@xmath2 with a first - order transformation at @xmath3,@xcite in agreement with the ultrasonic data presented here that show the existence of a transition point at @xmath30 in lacamno . \n it is worth mentioning that our @xmath6 is similar to the point at which both the volume thermal expansion deviates from a gruneisen fit and the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates from a curie - weiss fit , after results of de teresa _ \n _ in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( ref . \n @xcite ) . supporting our results , we have to mention that neutron diffraction studies@xcite in the paramagnetic region of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 show differences with respect to la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 . \n we want also to call the attention on the similar values of the temperatures of the second - order transitions , @xmath6 @xmath26 350 - 360 k for la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , and @xmath3 @xmath26 370 k for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . in some sense \n , it leads to think that the magnetic interaction between the mn atoms is of the same strength in both compounds and only the occurrence of the first - order change in lacamno is breaking the long - range order at a temperature below @xmath6 . \n after rder , zhang and bishop,@xcite this might be due to lattice effects , that would decrease the t@xmath19 associated to the de coupling . \n the anomaly at @xmath6 shows that the magnetic phase transition is not from ferromagnetism to a purely paramagnetic state , but some sort of magnetic structure is present . \n such idea is in accordance with the theoretical results of moreo _ \n et al._,@xcite who have proposed , after computer simulations , that large coexisting metallic and insulating clusters of equal electronic density are generated in manganese oxides with first - order magnetic transitions . \n et al._@xcite have qualified these compounds as relaxor ferromagnets , with a relaxation from one phase to the other . \n the fluctuations between both phases have been seen by transmission electron microscopy by podzorov _ \n et al._.@xcite in such a case , after kimura _ \n et al._@xcite the transition would be diffuse , like the one observed by us at @xmath6 . \n nowadays there is being growing experimental work that leads to assume the electronic phase - separated nature of such materials , and now it is well established that this phase separation is not due to chemical inhomogeneities or to the existence of phases with a different chemical composition.@xcite although this approach is quite recent in manganese perovskites , it had already been proposed by sears rodrguez and goodenough@xcite to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of sr - doped cobalt perovskites , thinking of a percolative transition at t@xmath19 .    in summary \n , we consider that our data confirm the existence , in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , of the temperature window @xmath31 proposed by dagotto , moreo and hotta@xcite , where probably the coexistence of a phase separated regime of metallic and insulating regions could be taking place . \n such window is not observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , a material with a conventional second - order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition at its curie temperature . \n the dgi of the ministry of science of technology of spain is acknowledged for financial support under project feder mat2001 -

{"ContextTokens": 2086, "GeneratedTokens": 101, "SynthesizedBody": "inclusive charged particle distributions have been studied for a long time to derive the general properties of hadronic interactions at high energies . \n a large body of the experimental data on charge particle production spectra in baryon - baryon , gamma - baryon and gamma - gamma collisions has been accumulated during last forty years . however , the underlying dynamics of hadron production in high energy particle interactions is still not fully understood . \n recently , a new unified approach to describe the particle production spectra shape was proposed  @xcite . \n it was suggested to approximate the charged particle spectra as function of the particle s transverse momentum by a sum of an exponential ( boltzmann - like ) and a power law statistical distributions : @xmath0 where @xmath1 with m equal to the produced hadron mass . \n @xmath2 are the free parameters to be determined by fit to the data . the detailed arguments for this particular choice are given in  @xcite . \n for the charged hadron spectra a mass of hadrons is assumed to be equal to the pion mass . \n therefore , the hadroproduction process in baryon - baryon high energy interactions could be decomposed into at least two distinct parts . \n these parts are characterized by two different sources of produced hadrons . the first one is associated with the baryon valence quarks and a quark - gluon cloud coupled to the valence quarks . \n those partons preexist long time before the interaction and could be considered as being a thermalized statistical ensemble . when a coherence of these partonic systems is destroyed via strong interaction between the two colliding baryons these partons \n hadronize into particles released from the collision . \n the hadrons from this source are distributed presumably according to the boltzmann - like exponential statistical distribution in transverse plane w.r.t . the interaction axis . \n the second source of hadrons is directly related to the virtual partons exchanged between two colliding partonic systems . in qcd \n this mechanism is described by the bfkl pomeron exchange . \n the radiated partons from this pomeron have presumably a typical for the pqcd power - law spectrum . \n schematically figure  [ fig ] shows these two sources of particles produced in high energy baryonic collisions . \n this explanation is qualitative , however .      in this paper \n an attempt to study hadroproduction in heavy - ion collisions according to the introduced model is taken . in these collisions , due to a large number of colliding partons , extremely high energy densities , comparing to those in @xmath3-collisions , can be obtained . \n the experimental data measured in auau collisions at @xmath4 gev / n by phenix  @xcite and pbpb collisions at @xmath5 tev / n by alice  @xcite are considered here . since the centre - of - mass energies per nucleon in these experiments are varied by a factor @xmath6 , a unified approach considering the energy density is suggested . \n the energy density in heavy ion interactions is known to depend not only on the centre - of - mass energy , but also on the centrality of the collision . \n hence , while the energy densities that can be reached at rhic  @xcite and at lhc  @xcite differ significantly , the energy density in central collisions at rhic might be of the same order as that in peripheral collisions at lhc .    therefore , we use a simple parameterization  @xcite for the initial energy density which is motivated by several model calculations . \n @xmath7 where @xmath8gev/@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 gev  @xcite . here \n the second factor is responsible for the incident energy dependence , @xmath13 is the c.m . \n collision energy , and the third one shows the dependence on the number of binary parton - parton collisions @xmath14 which is related to the centrality of the collision .    according to the introduced model , the exponential term stands for the radiation of thermalized particles with distributions similar to boltzmann - like thermodynamics . \n fitting the introduced formula ( eq .  [ eq : exppl ] ) to the measured experimental data allows to extract only the boltzmann - like statistical distribution from the whole statistical ensemble of produced hadrons . \n this exponential distribution is characterized by a parameter @xmath15 analogous to the temperature in classical thermodynamics , which value is obtained from the fit . \n therefore , it is interesting to study , how this temperature @xmath15 vary with the energy density obtained in the collision . \n figure  [ tee ] shows this temperature @xmath15 as function of energy density . \n as it was expected , the energy density obtained in central collisions at rhic is similar to those in peripherial collisions at lhc , therefore a smooth transition between these two experiments is observed . \n one can notice the interesting behavior of the temperature as function of energy density ( @xmath16 ) , which is in a good agreement with the stefan - boltzmann law . \n another observation on the temperature of the final state particles is that for high energy densities @xmath15 reaches a certain limit . \n this can be explained from qgp theory that considers the phase transition temperature @xmath17 from qgp to hadrons : the system cools until it reaches the critical temperature , thus , the temperature of the final state should be always below @xmath17 . indeed , for high values of @xmath18 one can notice , that the oberved critical temperature is @xmath19 mev , that is similar to previous theoretical observations  @xcite .    in conclusion , \n the experimental results on charged hadron production in heavy - ion collisions obtained in the phenix and alice experiments have been analyzed in the framework of the new approach . \n this approach allows to extract a part of the whole statistical ensemble of produced hadrons , those described by the boltzmann - like statistical distribution only . \n this exponential distribution is characterized by a parameter @xmath15 analogous to the temperature in classical thermodynamics . \n it is found that the parameter @xmath15 depends universally on the collision energy density rather than on the collision energy . \n finally , the observed behavior of @xmath15 is formally similar to the stefan - boltzmann law well known in classic thermodynamics .    99 a.  a.  bylinkin and a.  a.  rostovtsev , `` systematic studies of hadron production spectra in collider experiments .

{"ContextTokens": 4057, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "supernova ( sn ) 1987a occurred in the large magellanic cloud . \n it has been extensively studied in all wavelengths from radio to @xmath1-ray . \n the initial short outburst of radio emission @xcite is attributed to the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated by the sn shock propagated in the free wind of presupernova star , which was the blue supergiant ( bsg ) @xcite . \n after about 3 years radio emission was detected again @xcite as well as the monotonically increased x - ray emission @xcite . \n this second increase of emission is attributed to the entrance of the outer sn shock into the thermalized bsg wind and then in the h  ii region occupied by much more dense matter , consists of the swept up wind of red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor star @xcite .    to describe the observed properties of nonthermal emission of sn  1987a we use here a nonlinear kinetic theory . \n it couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite . \n therefore in spherically symmetric approach it is able to quite definitely predict the evolution of gas density , pressure , mass velocity , together with the energy spectrum and the spatial distribution of cosmic ray ( cr ) nuclei and electrons at any given evolutionary epoch @xmath4 , and the properties of the nonthermal radiation produced in snrs due to these accelerated crs . \n the application of this theory to individual snrs ( see * ? ? ? \n * for a review ) has provided the explanation of the observed snr properties under the assumption of strong interior magnetic field . \n it was also shown that this strong field leads to the concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the shock . \n recent observations with the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray telescopes in space make it possible to resolve such filamentary structures , which are the result of strong synchrotron losses of the emitting multi - tev electrons in strong magnetic fields downstream of the outer sn shock @xcite . \n application of the nonlinear theory to sn  1987a @xcite explained the properties of the observed radioemission . \n it predicted also the continuous increase of radioemission with roughly constant rate during the period from 1999 to 2006 yr , which was confirmed by further measurements @xcite . \n we analyze here radio data for more extended period of observation @xcite together with the chandra measurements of x - ray emission @xcite which provides a strong constraint on the amount of the nonthermal synchrotron emission at the same energies 0.5 - 10  kev . it is demonstrated that this constrain gives the evidence of strongly enhanced ( amplified ) magnetic field inside the snr , that in turn provides a better fit of radio data than in our previous study . \n we use canonical values of stellar ejecta mass @xmath5 , distance @xmath6  kpc , hydrodynamic explosion energy @xmath7  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n during an initial period the shell material has a broad distribution in velocity @xmath8 . \n the fastest part of this ejecta distribution can be described by a power law @xmath9 . \n we use a value @xmath10 appropriate for sn  1987a @xcite . \n the interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) creates a strong shock there which heats the thermal gas and accelerates particles diffusively to a nonthermal cr component of comparable energy density . \n strongly nonuniform csm is a result of interaction of progenitors winds : dense slow rsg wind and subsequent fast and diluted bsg wind . during initial period after the explosion the sn shock propagated in the free bsg wind and reached after about a day @xmath11 the termination shock in bsg wind , situated at the radial distance @xmath12  cm @xcite . \n after that the sn shock propagates in the thermalized bsg wind of density @xmath13 \n . considerable rapid decrease of the sn shock speed occurred during the days @xmath14 @xcite showed that sn shock entered the h  ii region of density @xmath15 . \n therefore we model the csm density distribution at distances @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18  cm is the contact discontinuity between two winds , @xmath19 is the scale of the smooth transition between them . \n the analysis of the rapidly increasing x - ray emission provides the evidence that h  ii region in turn is not uniform : at day @xmath20 the sn shock begins to interact with the dense inner ring . \n its radial behavior can be represented in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22  cm , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . \n such a gas radial profile is close to what was extracted from the above analysis @xcite . \n we adopt here for the gas number density @xmath25 the following values : @xmath26  @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xmath27 and @xmath29  @xmath27 . here \n @xmath30 is the mass of proton . \n the value @xmath28 \n @xmath27 which is by a factor of 1.5 lower than was used in our previous study @xcite , provides a good compromise between the sn shock dynamics seen in radio and in x - ray emissions ( see below ) . \n note , that the actual structure of the h  ii region , especially the dense inner ring , is essentially nonspherically symmetric . \n nevertheless since our spherically symmetric theory reproduces the sn shock evolution @xmath31 consistent with the existing data , one can expect that it gives a good estimate for the production of crs and their subsequent nonthermal emission . \n a rather high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg is needed to reproduce the observed steep radio spectrum @xcite . \n we believe that the required strength of the magnetic field have to be attributed to nonlinear field amplification at the sn shock by cr acceleration itself . according to plasma physical considerations @xcite , the existing csm magnetic field \n can indeed be significantly amplified at a strong shock by cr streaming instabilities . \n in fact , for all the thoroughly studied young snrs , the ratio of magnetic field energy density @xmath33 in the upstream region of the shock precursor to the cr pressure @xmath34 is about the same @xcite . here \n @xmath35 is the far upstream field presumably amplified by crs of highest energy , @xmath36 is the total shock compression ratio . within an error of about 50 percent we have @xmath37 cr pressure in young snrs \n has a typical value @xmath38 , therefore we adopt here upstream magnetic field @xmath39 since the process of magnetic field amplification is not included in our theory we simply postulate the existence of far upstream field @xmath40 given by eq.(3 ) . \n the spectrum of crs produced by strong modified shock is very hard so that crs with highest energies have a largest contribution in their energy content . \n these the most energetic crs produce field amplification on their spacial scale that is the precursor size . \n therefore crs with lower energies already see the amplified field @xmath40 . \n we will argue that such a high field , that is by a factor of ten larger than used in our previous study @xcite , is indeed required to fit the x - ray data . \n it also gives a better fit of radio data . \n we start our consideration from the snr evolutionary epoch @xmath41  d , when the outer sn shock has a radius @xmath42 and speed @xmath43  km / s . \n these values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 according to our calculations @xcite correspond to the end of sn shock propagation in the free bsg wind region @xmath46 . \n we neglect the contribution of crs accelerated in the region @xmath46 , because due to a high gas density the number of crs produced in the region @xmath16 very soon becomes dominant . \n calculated shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath45 shown in fig.[f1]a as a function of time are in satisfactory agreement with the values obtained on the basis of radio and x - ray measurements . \n note that radio data compared with x - ray data gives larger shock size at any given time @xmath4 and calculated radius @xmath31 goes between these two sets    to fit the spectral shape of the observed radio emission we assume a proton injection rate @xmath47 , which is a fraction of gas particles involved into the acceleration at the from of sn shock . \n this leads to a significant nonlinear modification of the shock : as it is seen in fig.[f1]b total shock compression ratio @xmath48 is essentially larger and a subshock compression ratio @xmath49 is lower than classical value 4 .    since the sn  1987a is very young crs despite of very efficient acceleration \n accumulated only 7% of the explosion energy @xmath50 ( see fig.[f1]c ) . \n note that the injection is expected to be strongly suppressed at the quasiperpendicular part of the shock , therefore one should renormalize the results for the nucleonic spectrum , calculated within the spherically symmetric model . \n the lack of symmetry in the actual snr can be approximately taken into account by a renormalization factor @xmath51 , which diminishes the nucleonic cr production efficiency , calculated in the spherical model , and all effects associated with it ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . with this renormalization \n the crs inside sn  1987a already contain @xmath52 since during the last 15  yrs the shock speed and the gas density are almost constant cr energy content grows roughly linearly with time . \n it gives the natural explanation of the linear increase of the radio emission detected during this evolutionary period . \n strongly modified sn shock generates cr spectrum @xmath53 , which is very steep at momenta @xmath54 , with index @xmath55 . \n cr electrons with such a spectrum produces synchrotron radioemission spectrum @xmath56 with spectral index @xmath57 , that very well corresponds to the experiment , as it is seen in fig.[f2 ] , where we present synchrotron energy spectra @xmath58 , calculated for five subsequent epoch together with the experimental data . \n note that cr spectrum has a concave shape : it becomes flatter at higher momenta @xmath59 . as a consequence synchrotron spectrum @xmath60 \n is also concave as it is clearly seen in fig.[f2 ] at @xmath61  hz . \n radio data reveal this property in good consistency with theoretical prediction .    strong downstream magnetic field @xmath62  mg , that corresponds to the upstream field @xmath63  mg ( see fig.[f1 ] ) , provides synchrotron cooling of electrons with momenta @xmath64 that in turn makes synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies @xmath65  hz very steep ( see fig.[f2 ] ) . concave shape of electrons continuously produced at the shock front together with their synchrotron cooling lead to a formation of two peaks in synchrotron energy spectrum @xmath58 . \n the first one at @xmath66  hz corresponds to cr electron momentum @xmath67 above which synchrotron energy looses are relevant , whereas the second peak at @xmath68  hz corresponds to the maximum momentum @xmath69 of accelerated electrons . under this condition calculated synchrotron flux at frequency @xmath70  hz , which corresponds to the photon energy @xmath71  kev , \n is below the measured flux at the epochs @xmath72  d. since the contribution of the nonthermal radiation in the observed x - ray emission of sn  1987a is not very well known ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , the observed x - ray flux has to be considered as the upper limit for the expected nonthermal emission . at early epoch @xmath73 \n d however the calculated flux exceeds the measured one ( see the curve , corresponding @xmath74  d in fig.[f2 ] ) . \n this can be considered as indication , that the actual magnetic field @xmath40 is few times larger then given by the eq.(3 ) . \n to illustrate the situation expected at considerably lower magnetic field we present in fig.[f3 ] synchrotron energy spectra calculated at the same set of parameters as before except magnetic field , which was taken @xmath75  @xmath76 g independent of time . \n since the interior magnetic field @xmath77  mg ( @xmath78 ) is essentially lower in this case , synchrotron losses of high energy cr electrons are considerably smaller compared with the previous case . \n due to this fact synchrotron spectra considerably exceeds at any given epoch the measured chandra flux . \n therefore we can conclude , that the actual interior magnetic field strength is not lower than @xmath79  mg . \n projected radial profile of the nonthermal x - ray emission at high interior magnetic field @xmath80  mg is characterized by an extremely sharp peak of thickness @xmath81 just behind the sn shock . since the thermal x - rays have much wider radial distribution it provides the possibility for experimental determination of the nonthermal x - ray contribution in the observed emission . \n experimental determination of the x - ray spectrum at @xmath82  hz ( @xmath83  kev ) is the another possibility to discriminate the nonthermal emission . \n such kind of measurements can be done with space instrument suzaku . \n completely different possibility to have the synchrotron flux , which fit the radio data and goes below chandra data , is low field scenario , when the magnetic field is as low as @xmath84  @xmath76 g . in such a case \n the cutoff frequency of synchrotron spectrum @xmath85 is lower than @xmath86  hz and calculated fluxes go down exponentially at @xmath87 below chandra points . \n however the value @xmath84 \n @xmath76 g is unrealistically small for such a dense medium , which we have in sn  1987a . \n in addition the effective energy of electrons @xmath88 which radiate at @xmath89  ghz in the interior field @xmath80  @xmath76 g is about 5  gev . \n the electron spectrum at gev - energies is characterized by a power low index @xmath90 that is considerably smaller than what is required for the observed radio spectrum . note that as it is seen in fig.[f3 ] even the field @xmath91  mg is too small to have a good fit of radio data as in fig.[f2 ] . therefore low field scenario should be rejected . \n calculated @xmath1-ray integral flux shown in fig.[f4 ] at all energies is dominated by the @xmath92-decay component . \n since the sn shock is strongly modified @xmath1-ray spectrum at energies @xmath93  tev is very hard : @xmath94 . at the current epoch \n the expected @xmath1-ray energy flux at tev - energies is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3s ) and during the next four years it expect to grow by a factor of two . \n this flux is by a factor of five lower compared with our previous prediction @xcite , because we use here renormalization factor @xmath96 , which reduces the number of accelerated crs calculated within spherically symmetric approach . \n the existence of strongly asymmetric csm structure , which is dense inner ring , makes our prediction of @xmath1-ray flux uncertain . \n according to the rough estimate this uncertainty is not very large , about a factor of two , due to the stronger sn shock deceleration in denser medium . at the moment \n there are only upper limits of tev emission obtained by cangaroo @xcite and hess @xcite instruments ( see fig.[f4 ] ) . \n the kinetic nonlinear model for cr acceleration in snrs has been in detail applied to sn  1987a , in order to compare its results with observational properties.we find that quite a reasonable consistency with most of the observational data can be achieved . \n the evidence of the efficient cr production leading to a strong shock modification comes from radio data . \n significant shock modification leads to the steep and concave cr spectrum which very well fits the observed radioemission spectrum , under the condition of extremely high downstream magnetic field strength @xmath32  mg . to be consistent also with the chandra measurements of the x - ray flux , which has to be considered as an upper limit for the nonthermal x - ray emission , even larger interior field \n @xmath0  mg is needed . \n such a high field provides a strong synchrotron losses of cr electrons emitting nonthermal x - rays , that makes the high frequency part of the synchrotron spectrum much more steeper and provides a consistency with the experiment . \n the expected @xmath92-decay @xmath1-ray energy flux at the current epoch is about @xmath95  erg/(@xmath3  s ) at energies @xmath97  tev . \n therefore the detection of @xmath1-ray emission at these energies would imply clear evidence for a hadronic origin and for a strong magnetic field amplification inside sn  1987a .", "StartTimeOffset": 396401264464, "RequestID": "50e19af33d984d7391d7e60bf4f79b79", "TotalTokens": 4242}
{"ContextTokens": 2397, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "sometimes , when carrying out a preliminary computation in order to be sure that well understood llimits of a problem are handled correctly , results which are interesting in their own right emerge . \n i will now discuss one such result which i have obtained as part of such a preliminary study of the hubbard model .    the hubbard model at half - filling is equivalent to a heisenberg anti - ferromagnet ( haf ) and it is important to show that core treats this limiit correctly . \n this was shown to be the case for the spin-1/2 haf in ref.@xcite . \n what that paper did not address was the subtle question of how the physics of the one - dimensional anti - ferromagnet changes when the spin-1/2 on each lattice site is replaced by spin @xmath1 . in 1983 \n it was argued by f.d.m . \n haldane , ref.@xcite that when @xmath1 is a half - integer , then the spectrum has no mass - gap , but when @xmath1 is an integer , a mass - gap develops . in this talk \n i describe a core computation for the spin-1/2 and spin-1 anti - ferromagnet which not only supports haldane s conjecture , but shows how the spin-1 case leads to an understanding of a more general class of theories defined by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 about which , until now , very little was known . . \n the core method consists of two parts . \n first , a theorem which defines the hamiltonian analogue of wilson s exact renormalization group transformation ; second , a set of approximation procedures which render the calculation of the _ renormalized hamiltonian _ doable . \n core replaces the lagrangian notion of integrating out degrees of freedom by that of throwing away hilbert space states ; i.e. , defining a ojection operator , @xmath3 , which acts on the original hilbert space , @xmath4 to create the space of _ retained states _ @xmath5 . \n the central feature of this approach is a formula which relates the original hamiltonian , @xmath6 , to a _ \n renormalized hamiltonian _ , @xmath7 , which acts on @xmath8 and which has , in a sense which was made precise in ref.@xcite , exactly the same low energy physics as @xmath6 . \n this formula is @xmath9 } [ [ t(t ) h t(t ) ] ] \\sqrt{[[t(t)^2 ] ] }   \\label{basicform}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and where we have defined @xmath11= p o p$ ] for any operator @xmath12 which acts on @xmath4 . \n it was explained in ref.@xcite that @xmath13 is an extensive operator and can be written as a sum of finite - range connected operators ; i.e. , @xmath14 where each @xmath15 can be computed on a finite sublattice of the original infinite lattice . \n although this formula involves an infinite number of terms examples have shown that a highly accurate approximation to @xmath13 only requires computing a few terms in the cluster expansion , typically range-2 and/or range-3 terms are adequate . \n to obtain the hamiltonian for a general heisenberg anti - ferromagnet set @xmath16 in eq.[betaham ] . \n the complete discusion of a range-2 calculation for the spin-1/2 haf appears in ref.@xcite and only a brief review of the results will be discussed here . \n all core computations begin with a choice of a thinning procedure and the procedure used in ref.@xcite was based upon dividing the lattice into three site blocks @xmath17 , and solving the corresponding block - hamiltonian ( obtained by restricting the full hamiltonian to those terms which are completely contained in block @xmath17 ) , keeping a small set of low - lying eigenstates . since the haf hamiltonian has an @xmath18 symmetry its eigenstates fall into degenerate multiplets and to guarantee that the renormalized hamiltonian has the same symmetry as the original it is necessary to keep full multiplets . \n three - site blocks were chosen for the spin-1/2 haf because that is the smallest size block for which a non - trivial core computation can be done . \n this is because the eigenstates of the two - site block - hamiltonian fall into spin-0 and spin-1 multiplets , with the spin-0 state having the lowest energy and keeping only the lowest lying multiplet would amount to keeping a single state , a trivial renormalization group transformation . \n going to three sites avoids this problem since the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian fall into two spin-1/2 multiplets and one spin-3/2 multiplet . in this case one of the spin-1/2 multiplets has the lowest energy and so truncating to the space generated by keeping only these two - states per block leads to a renormalized hamiltonian for which the operator @xmath19 is a multiple of the unit matrix and @xmath20 is , up to a multiplicative constant which is less than unity , exactly the same starting hamiltonian ; i.e. , the spin-1/2 haf hamiltonian is at a fixed point of the core transformation . \n iterating this calculation shows the spin-1/2 haf is massless , in agreement with what is known about this system . \n the same calculation produces a ground - state energy density which is within one - percent of the exact answer .      applying the same three site blocking to the spin-1 haf yields a different result . in this case \n the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian fall into a spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 multiplet , with the spin-1 multiplet having the lowest energy . \n truncating to the space generated by keeping only the spin-1 multiplet per block gives , as in the spin-1/2 case , @xmath19 proportional to the unit matrix , but now @xmath20 takes the more general form @xmath21 thus , after one three site blocking the core analysis of the spn-1 haf turns into the study of renormalization group flows for the theory defined by @xmath22 where i have ignored the term proportional to the identiy operator . except for the special values @xmath23 \n very little is known about the hamiltonian eq.[genham ] . the case @xmath24 is special , in that it can be solved for the groundstate , which is a valence - bond solid with a non - vanishing mass gap . moreover , when @xmath25 the theory can be solved by means of the bethe - ansatz and is massless . \n finally , when @xmath26 the theory becomes @xmath27 symmetric and it is conjectured that the mass gap vanishes at this point too , although no exact result is known for this case .    unlike the spin-1/2 case sensible core computations can be done for the spin-1 system defined by eq.[genham ] using either two or three - site blocking . \n if two - site blocks are used , then the states of the block hamiltonian fall into a spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 representation and keeping the spin-0 and spin-1 states defines a non - trivial renormalization group transformation . \n the determination that the spin-0 and spin-1 multiplets are the ones to keep is made by studying the @xmath28 dependence of their energies . \n this shows that one of these representations always lies lowest in energy and that they become degenerate and then cros at @xmath24 . \n similarly , the eigenstates of the three - site hamiltonian divide into one spin-3 , two spin-2 , three spin-1 and one spin-0 representations of @xmath18 and a study of the @xmath28 dependence of the eigenenergies shows that the lowest lying spin-0 and spin-1 states are the ones to keep because one or the other of these multiplets always lies lowest in energy and they become degenerate and cross at @xmath24 . since either two or three site blocking leads to the same truncation algorithm i study the two - site blocking procedure because it is easier to carry out . \n the approximate , range-2 , two - site blocking core computation of the mass gap for @xmath29 is shown in the figure . \n several points should be made about this plot . \n first , the core computation solves the @xmath24 case exactly . \n analysis of the flow at this point shows that at each renormalized hamiltonian is isomorphic to a dimerized spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnet and the fixed point is the place where one of the two nearest neighbor couplings vanish . \n furthermore , all of the hamiltonians defined by eq.[genham ] flow to the same massive fixed point for the range of @xmath28 shown in the graph . \n the general picture which emerges from this calculation is that there are three fixed points to the flow in this region , an attractive , massive fixed point at @xmath24 ( the valence - bond solid ) and two repulsive massles fixed points near @xmath30 . \n the fact that the mass gap does nt vanish for @xmath31 but for a value of @xmath28 which is 10% further from the valence bond solid point is typical of what occurs in range-2 approximations . \n going to range-3 or better should reduce this error by an order of magnitude . \n the reason i cut off the plot at @xmath32 , before the massgap goes to zero , is that at this point the theory becomes @xmath27 symmetric ( a fact which is obvious from the core computation ) and so the spin-0 and spin-2 representations become degenerate . because the program i wrote to do this calculation just grabbed the four lowest lying states the calculation destroys the manifest @xmath18 symmetry.a clearly a more careful programming job has to be done to go beyond this pont keeping the symmetry intact . \n note , the calculated mass gap is shown by the solid curve , the dotted curve is just included to heuristically remind the reader of what might be expected in an exact calculation . \n note , the spin-1 haf at @xmath16 lies quite close to the @xmath24 point where the core computation is exact and is well within in the basin of attraction of the massive theory , thus providing the advertised support for the haldane conjecture .", "StartTimeOffset": 407842620844, "RequestID": "9754ca6fd02b4045af8376eff07996fd", "TotalTokens": 2546}

space factors are also taken into account . in the decay of parton \n / beam cluster , higher hadronic resonance states up to mass of 2gev can be produced in our model . \n to summarize , the main different points from original version are 1 ) baryonic cluster formation . \n 2 ) inclusion of higher hadronic resonance up to mass of 2gev . \n 3 ) exact conservation of flavor , i.e. ( baryon number , charge , etc ) . \n 4 ) reasonable total momentum conservation : total momentum is conserved within 10% at rhic energy for central au+au collision . \n since our version of parton cascade code differs from original version of vni , we have to check the model parameters . \n first , particle spectra from @xmath1 collisions at @xmath24gev calculated by the modified version of vni are studied to see the model parameter dependence . here \n we see the @xmath0-factor dependence as mentioned in ref .  @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig : pp_exp ] , experimental data on pseudorapidity distributions ( left panel ) and the invariant cross sections ( right panel ) are compared to the calculation of the parton cascade model with different parameters on the treatment of so - called @xmath0-factor . \n the calculations ( upper three figures ) are done by adding the constant factor to the reading - order pqcd cross sections : @xmath25 with values @xmath26 . while bottom figure corresponds to the calculation changing the @xmath27 scale in the running coupling constant @xmath28 as @xmath29 with the value @xmath30 . \n we also plot the contribution from parton cluster decay in the left panel with dotted lines . \n the contribution of parton cluster decay which is come from interacted parton coalescence changes according to the choice of the correction scheme . \n we can fit the @xmath1 data of pseudorapidity distributions with different correction schemes as seen in fig . \n [ fig : pp_exp ] by changing the parameter ( in actual code , parv(91 ) ) which controls the multiplicity from beam cluster . \n we have to check the model with various elementary data including incident energy dependence in order to fix model parameters . \n next we will present some results on nuclear collisions with those parameters . \n the baryon stopping problem is one of the important element in nucleus - nucleus collisions . \n original version of vni implicitly assumed baryon free region at midrapidity , because baryonic parton cluster formation is not included . \n baryons only come from beam cluster , not parton cluster formation in the original version of vni . \n we can now discuss the baryon stopping problem with our modified version of vni . \n we have calculated the net proton distribution at sps energy to show the reliability of the modeling of beam cluster formation in the parton cascade model . \n [ fig : pbpb_rap ] compares the parton cascade calculation for pb+pb collision at the laboratory energy of @xmath31 agev with the @xmath0-factor 1.0 ( original version uses @xmath32 ) of net protons with the data  @xcite . \n it is seen that contribution from parton cluster is neglibigly small , thus baryon stopping behavior is fully explained by soft physics ( in this case , beam cluster decay ) when we chose the @xmath0-factor 1.0 at sps energies . it should be noted that there is no microscopic dynamics in the modeling of the beam cluster formation in the parton cascade model , but it is a simple fit to the data of @xmath4 collisions . \n the @xmath0-factor dependence of both net proton and charged particle rapidity distribution are studied in fig . \n [ fig : rap ] in terms of net proton distribution , there is no strong @xmath0-factor dependence . \n we can see that parton cluster formation and its decay predict almost baryon free at mid - rapidity region regardless of the choice of @xmath0-factor , though there are lots of protons and antiprotons at mid - rapidity . \n we conclude that hard parton scattering plays no rule for the baryon stopping within a parton cascade model . \n however , note that string based model like hijing / b  @xcite predicts proton rapidity density of 10 and urqmd predicts  @xcite 12.5 at mid - rapidity . however , as pointed out in ref . \n @xcite , charged hadron multiplicity is strongly depend on how to chose the leading order correction scheme . \n [ fig : rap_netq ] displays the net baryon number distributions as a function of rapidity obtained by parton distribution from parton cascade before hadronization with the @xmath0-factor of 1 ( left ) and 2.5 ( right ) . \n net baryon number of time - like partons are distributed around mid rapidity region but its contribution are small as consistent with the net proton distribution in fig . \n [ fig : rap ] . \n in summary , first , we have checked that different treatments for the inclusion of higher -

{"ContextTokens": 3152, "GeneratedTokens": 260, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational wave astronomy inherently relies on high power resonant optical systems . \n the power of the probe light circulating in a cavity is the ultimate lever utilized to increase the sensitivity of a position measurement of a gravitational wave detector test masses carrying information about gravitational wave signals . \n the projected continuous wave ( cw ) light power pushes 0.8  mw value in the second generation of gravitational wave detectors , such as advanced ligo ( now in operation ) , advanced virgo and kagra , planned to become operational in the next few months @xcite . while this power value is by far lower \n if compared with the optical damage limit of the cavity mirrors , it is high enough to initiate various nonlinear processes resulting in depletion of the probe light and in generation of optical harmonics adding noise to the recorded signal and hindering the desirable sensitivity increase . technical solution allowing suppressing the nonlinear interactions are needed to push the limits of gravitational wave astronomy and to widen the horizon of observable events associated with gravitational wave emission . \n resonant opto - mechanical oscillations are expected to have the lowest power threshold if compared with the other nonlinear processes in the cavities , it may cause undesirable parametric instability ( pi ) @xcite . \n the pi occurs due to interaction of optical cavity modes and mechanical modes of the cavity mirrors . \n the photons of the probe light confined in a selected , usually fundamental , cavity mode pumped at frequency @xmath3 are parametrically converted to mechanical phonons of the cavity mirrors ( having frequency @xmath4 ) as well as lower frequency , or stokes , photons emitted into high order optical modes having frequency @xmath5 . \n the power threshold of pi is inversely proportional to the product of quality factors of the optical and mechanical modes participating in the process , so desirable reduction of the optical as well as mechanical attenuation results in undesirable reduction of the pi threshold . \n the phenomenon of pi was studied and validated experimentally in a table top fabry - perot resonator @xcite as well as in whispering gallery mode resonators @xcite . \n recently pi was observed in full scaled advanced ligo interferometer @xcite at relatively small circulating power @xmath6  kw as compared with @xmath7  mw planned in a advanced ligo . \n efficiency of pi depends on phase matching , comprising nonzero overlap integral and energy conservation , of the optical and mechanical modes . \n there is a significant probability that these conditions are always fulfilled in long - base gravitational wave detectors because of dense spectrum of optical modes of large cavities and dense spectrum of mechanical modes of large area cavity mirrors . since the mirrors involved into the system \n are not identical , they have slightly different associated mechanical frequencies that can lead to pi . \n several techniques of reducing pi impact have been studied recently . \n they involve either braking the phase matching of the nonlinear process by changing frequency spectra of the modes participating in the ip process , or reducing pi efficiency by damping nonessential modes . \n for instance , one can move the opto - mechanical system out of resonance by controlling surface temperature of the mirrors @xcite . \n this is possible since the optical ( @xmath3 and @xmath8 ) and mechanical ( @xmath4 ) eigenfrequencies of the system depend on the mirror temperature @xmath9 in different ways , so the pi favorable condition @xmath10 , ultimately breaks . \n the drawback of this technique is related to its lack of selectivity . \n all the modes of the optical cavity move at nearly the same pace , and while one pair of stokes and mechanical modes comes out of the resonance , another pair comes in . this drawback can be partially suppressed by modulation of the temperature of the mirror surface . \n alternative stabilization method involves damping of mechanical modes either in a passive or an active way . \n it was found that introducing an annular strip at the rims of cavity mirrors reduces quality ( q- ) factors of elastic modes @xcite . \n however , this strip reduces q - factor of the modes within the whole spectrum , including reception band of the antenna ( @xmath11  hz ) . \n this is undesirable , since low mechanical attenuation at these frequencies is essential for achieving the desirable detection sensitivity . \n active electro - mechanical feedback allows reducing q - factor of several particular elastic modes @xcite . \n the method is too selective to suppress all high - frequency modes in the entire bandwidth of interest ( @xmath12  khz ) and , hence , does not solve the problem of instability of highly overmoded opto - mechanical system . \n therefore , a universal method of pi suppression is still needed . \n we here propose a solution based on optimization of the shape of the cavity mirrors leading to increase of the diffraction losses of all high - order optical modes of the optical cavity and subsequent increase of the pi threshold . \n note that diffraction losses a cavity modes can be increased rather significantly by properly shaping mirrors of the cavity @xcite , however , with loss increase of main mode which is inappropriate for laser gravitational detector detector . \n we propose the method allows realizing an optical cavity containing only one family of low loss bounded modes . \n this is achievable in the case of large area optical mirrors . in a realistic gravity wave detector , \n though , the size of the mirrors is limited and suppression of the high - order modes is associated with loss increase of the fundamental mode family . \n we study this practically interesting case using numerical simulations and show that it is feasible to increase the pi threshold at least by an order of magnitude by proper shaping mirrors of a ligo interferometer keeping diffraction loss of main mode at acceptable low level . \n we show that the stability of the modified interferometer with respect to the mirror tilt and shape variations is acceptable . \n finally , we found that the optimized cavity can still be interrogated using conventional gaussian beams . \n the lowest pi intracavity threshold power evaluated for a fabry - perot ( fp ) resonator can be found from expression @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the round trip optical attenuation coefficient of the stokes mode , @xmath15 is the mass of the mirror , or test mass , @xmath16 is the quality factor of the elastic mode , @xmath17 is the speed of light in the vacuum , @xmath18 is a mismatching factor , @xmath19 is volume of the mirror , @xmath20 is the mechanical mode displacement , @xmath21 is the same normal displacement on the mirror surface , and @xmath22 is distribution of main and stokes optical modes on mirror surface . the integration is performed over mirror volume ( @xmath23 ) and mirror surface ( @xmath24 ) .    equation ( [ p ] ) is obtained for the all - resonant case : @xmath25 . substituting to eq . \n ( [ p ] ) parameters of ligo system , presented in table  ( [ param ] ) , and assuming full overlapping ( @xmath26 ) , we find that the pi threshold power , @xmath27 , is more than two orders of magnitude smaller if compared with the envisioned power level @xmath28 @xcite . to increase the threshold towards the desirable value we propose to increase @xmath14 to @xmath29 by inducing leakage of the stokes light out of the cavity due to enhanced diffraction of the high order optical modes . \n this increase results in a small practically acceptable increase of the attenuation of the fundamental mode @xmath30 . \n .parameters of ligo used in calculations [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      round trip loss ( red curve ) not exceeds 5 ppm , @xmath31 round trip loss ( blue curve ) is approximately @xmath32 ppm and ratio of these losses ( green curve ) reach a local maximum . \n this figure corresponds to the @xmath33 parameters set in table  ( [ table1 ] ) . \n , scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and gaussian one.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the tolerance requirements to approach the parameters described in table  ( [ table1 ] ) are reasonable . \n for example , for variant 3 in table  [ table1 ] the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 have to hold with accuracy about @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath38 respectively to keep the value of the loss within 3  db of the predicted values . \n it means that shape of the mirrors has to be manufactured within tolerance @xmath39 , which is practically feasible . \n another important factor is related to the dynamic stability of the modified fp cavity , which is discussed in the next section . \n the optimization of the mirrors shape results in reduction of the radiative loss of the higher order fp modes . as the consequence , \n the resonator sensitivity to the tilt of the mirrors increases if compared with the sensitivity of a conventional fp resonator . \n the tilt lifts orthogonality and results in linear coupling among the optical modes . \n the coupling is largest for the axial symmetric and the dipole modes . \n it is reasonable to expect that the angle sensitivity of the cavity attenuation is approximately proportional to the square root of the clipping loss value of the dipole mode . \n there is no known way of accurate analytical evaluation of the loss increase due to mirror tilt . \n moreover , the numerical simulations become rather involved since the tilt breaks the symmetry of the system . to evaluate this effect \n we use method of successive approximations that is based on fusion of the both numerical and analytical methods . according to this method , the round trip loss depends on small tilt angle @xmath40 of one of the mirrors of the fp cavity as @xmath41,\\\\ \\nonumber      u_{00,00 } & \\equiv    \\int |\\psi_{00}(x)|^2\\ , x^3\\ , dx ,      \\quad   \\int |\\psi_{j } ( x)|^2x\\ , dx=1\\,,\\\\      u_{j,00 } & \\equiv    \\int \\psi^*_{j } ( x)\\psi_{00 } ( x)\\ , x^2\\ , dx\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the wave number , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the calculated numerically forward trip eigenvalue and eigenvector of the unperturbed problem ( no tilt ) \n , @xmath45 is a permissible angle to characterize tilt stability . \n numeric calculations for parameters sets 1,2,3 listed in table  [ table1 ] give the following permissible tilt angles : @xmath46 to figure out if this value is large , we calculate similar number for current ligo interferometer ( table  [ param ] ) and find @xmath47rad . \n in other words , the dynamic range of the mirror angle deviation of conventional interferometer is an order of magnitude better than one of the interferometer with modified mirrors . \n this is expected as the loss parameter of the first dipole mode is approximately 1,000  ppm ( 10  ppm ) for the single mode ( conventional ) resonator . \n the considered here model of a fp resonator is a simplification of the realistic ligo system with one exception . \n the last one includes two fp resonators and a recycling mirror that allows increasing the effective finesse of the multi - resonator system . \n it is possible to show that the ligo resonator effective loss is proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are power transmission coefficients of the input and recycling mirrors , respectively , and @xmath51 is the attenuation per round trip in the fp resonator . \n in advanced ligo interferometer @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , so the effective transmission coefficient is about @xmath54  ppm , whereas diffraction loss @xmath55  ppm . \n hence , increase of diffraction loss of the fundamental mode by about an order of magnitude ( to @xmath0  ppm ) seems to be acceptable to use squeezing about @xmath56 . \n the increase of the attenuation of the dipole mode beyond 100  ppm results in reduction of pi in accordance with eq . \n we have shown that one can reduce impact of parametric instability of an interferometric gravity wave detector by optimizing geometrical shape of its mirrors . \n the improvement stems from the dependence of the threshold of the instability on the losses of the optical modes involved in the process . \n modification of the mirror shape increases the diffraction loss of the higher order optical modes resulting in the instability threshold increase , occurring at the cost of scrutinizing the mirror tilt stability requirements . to explain the effect , we have created a semi - analytical model of the diffraction loss of a fabry - perot cavity having an arbitrary mirror shape and found that engineered increase of diffraction loss of the high order modes with necessity leads to larger sensitivity of the fundamental mode loss to the mirror tilt . \n optimizing the ratio of the losses of the cavity modes it is possible to achieve a significant suppression of the opto - mechanic instability and also keep acceptable tolerances of the system implementation . \n we validated results of our predictions with numerical simulations . \n the authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with william kells . \n mikhail v. poplavskiy and sergey p. vyatchanin acknowledge support from the russian foundation for basic research ( grant no . \n 14 -

{"ContextTokens": 3608, "GeneratedTokens": 266, "SynthesizedBody": "a neutron star , born with a non - degenerate companion , initially spins down because of the drag of the magnetic dipole torque . \n a wind from the hot surface of the companion disperses the pulsed signal and it is radio silent . \n later in the companion s evolution when it overflows the roche lobe , mass transfer commences to spin up the neutron star . \n it has begun what is believed to be its evolution from an old star with long period and fairly high magnetic field to a millisecond ( ms ) pulsar with low field @xcite . during the intermediate stage it emits x - rays because the surface and accretion ring are heated to high temperature . \n accreting canonical neutron stars would take only @xmath0 y at an accretion rate of @xmath1/y to attain a period of 2 ms ( = 500 hz ) and any asymmetry in the accretion pattern would cause millisecond variability in x - ray emission as was foreseen many years ago @xcite . \n this expectation has been realized in the last several years in numerous discoveries made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) . \n ( see van der klis for a critical review and discussion @xcite . ) \n one of the big surprises is that most of the frequencies observed in these objects , generally interpreted as spin frequencies , seem to be clustered in a small band , or spike at @xmath2 hz . \n several suggestions as to the origin of frequency clustering and much relevant research has been published . in one scenario , \n a small quadrupole distortion provided by a thermally induced density asymmetry creates gravitational waves whose torque balances that applied by accreting matter at the observed critical frequencies @xcite . \n alternately , rossby waves may be excited in the crust of the neutron star which trigger a thermal runaway of the r - mode , reducing the spin below the excitation frequency , at which time accretion may again spin up the star . \n this cycle may be repeated several times before the donor star is consumed @xcite . \n we propose yet another mechanism \n a natural extension of our earlier work  that could _ temporarily _ stall spinup for an epoch of @xmath3 y and therefore lead to a frequency clustering in the population , while allowing a further evolution to the ms pulsar stage @xcite . \n the density in the interior of neutron stars is a few times nuclear density . at such densities \n it is quite plausible that quarks lose their association with particular hadrons \n the more compressible deconfined quark matter phase replaces the normal phase in the core of the star . \n such a quark matter core does not endow the hybrid star itself with any remarkable property aside from reducing the limiting mass , generally to values @xmath4small compared to models of neutron stars that are made purely of neutrons  but quite in agreement with observed masses @xcite . \n moreover , there are grounds to believe that neutron star masses do in fact fall in a very small interval , bounded from below by the chandrasekhar limit on the iron core mass in the pre - supernova star , and above by the neutron star mass which is limited by any one of three possible phase transitions , hyperonization , kaon condensation and quark deconfinement @xcite . \n we shall assume therefore that canonical pulsars  like the crab and more slowly rotating ones  have a quark matter core essentially from birth and that neutron stars fall in a narrow mass range .    by comparison , \n millisecond pulsars are centrifugally flattened in the equatorial plane and the density is diluted in the interior . \n we shall suppose that the critical phase transition density lies between the diluted density of ms pulsars and the density at the center of canonical pulsars . \n then as a ms pulsar spins down , or as a canonical neutron star at some stage begins accreting matter from a companion and is spun up , a change in density distribution paced by the changing centrifugal force will , in some critical frequency range , cause a change of phase of matter in an expanding region of the core . in the case of spindown of an isolated ms pulsar , self - gravity and the weight of the surrounding part of \n the star will squeeze the more compressible high - density phase that is forming in the interior . \n conversely , an accreting neutron star that is being spun up , will , over time , spin out the already present quark phase . in either case , the moment of inertia will progressively alter with the change of phase of matter and therefore the star s spin rate will adjust to conserve angular momentum that is not being carried off by radiation or supplied by accreted matter fast enough . \n for this reason , a spin anomaly should occur in both types of objects , ms pulsars and x - ray neutron stars in binaries , if it occurs in either . \n the phase change manifests itself as a temporary governer on spin causing changes in rotational frequency to stall in about the same range in the two types of objects . \n the population of x - ray accreters should exhibit more objects in the critical frequency range than in neighboring ones . \n this appears to be the meaning of recent discoveries made with the rxte @xcite . \n the effect of a phase transition on the population of ms pulsars is less direct since it involves a convolution of our results for x - ray accreters . \n previously , it was found for ms pulsars that the mixed phase in a model star converts to pure quark matter , first at the center and then in an expanding region , paced by the slow loss of angular momentum to radiation @xcite . \n the consequent decrease in the moment of inertia could even introduce an era of _ spinup _ lasting for @xmath5 years or @xmath6 of the spindown time @xcite . \n the anomalous spinup of our model star occurred in a small frequency band around 220 hz @xcite . \n such a response of the moment of inertia to a change of phase occasioned by changing spin is very like the so - called `` backbending '' in rotating nuclei caused by coriolis quenching of bcs nucleon spin pairing predicted by mottelson and valatin @xcite and discovered in the 1970s @xcite . \n ( compare figs . \n [ nucleusf ] and [ oif ] . ) \n it is clear from the foregoing discussion that in our model , the particular details of the accretion process do not determine in what range the spinup stalls for a time . \n we therefore use a simple schematic model of accretion in which the spin - up torque of the accreting matter causes a change in the star s angular momentum @xmath7 according to the relation @xcite @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ( @xmath10 ) . \n the first term represents the torque applied by the accreting matter and the second by the magnetic field of the neutron star and the viscosity of matter in the accretion ring . \n the star s magnetic moment is denoted by @xmath11 , the co - rotating radius by @xmath12 , the inner edge of the accretion ring by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the alfn radius at which the magnetic energy density equals the total kinetic energy density of the accreting matter by @xmath15^{1/7}$ ] . \n the above equation can be written as a time evolution equation for the angular velocity @xmath16 of the accreting star ; @xmath17 the moment of inertia @xmath18 of ms pulsars or of neutron star accreters has to be computed in gr without making the usual assumption of slow rotation . \n we use a previously obtained expression for the moment of inertia of a rotating star @xcite . \n the magnetic field @xmath19 is believed to decay only weakly due to ohmic resistance in canonical pulsars , but very significantly while accreting matter from a companion . \n this era can last up to @xmath20 y and cause field decay by several orders of magnitude . for a review of the literature and several evolutionary scenarios , see ref . \n although there is no consensus concerning the magnetic field decay , observationally , we know that canonical pulsars have fields of @xmath21 , while ms pulsars have fields that lie in the range @xmath22 . \n we shall rely on this observational fact , and assume that the field decays according to @xmath23 e^{-t / t_{\\rm d}}$ ] with @xmath24 at the start of accretion , @xmath25 g ,  @xmath26 g , and @xmath27 yr . \n such a decay to an asymptotic value seems to be a feature of some treatments of the magnetic field evolution @xcite . \n the frequency attained after a few million years of accretion will be independent of the initial value . \n we take @xmath28 hz . \n the theory and parameters used to describe our model neutron star are precisely those used in previous publications @xcite . \n its initial mass is @xmath29 , close to the mass limit of the rotating star of @xmath30 . \n quark matter is treated in a version of the mit bag model with the three light flavor quarks ( @xmath31 mev ) as described in ref . \n a value of the bag constant @xmath32 mev is employed , as in @xcite . \n the transition between these two phases of a medium with two independent conserved charges ( baryon and electric ) is described in ref . \n @xcite . \n figure [ fig : it ] shows how the moment of inertia changes for a neutron star in a binary system that is spun up by mass accretion according to eq . \n ( [ eq : dodt.1 ] ) . in one case \n we assume that a phase transition between quark matter and confined hadronic matter occurs , and in the other that it does not . \n this accounts for the different initial moments of inertia , and also , as we see , the response to spinup . \n three _ average _ accretion rates are assumed , @xmath33 , 10 and 100 ( where @xmath34 is in units of @xmath35/y ) . \n the corresponding spin evolution of accreting neutron stars as determined by the changing moment of inertia and the evolution equation ( [ spinevolution ] ) is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : nue ] . in both figs . \n [ fig : it ] and [ fig : nue ] we assume that @xmath36 is accreted . \n otherwise the maximum frequency attained is less . \n we compute a frequency distribution of x - ray stars in low - mass binaries ( lmxbs ) from fig . \n [ fig : nue ] , for _ one _ accretion rate , by assuming that neutron stars begin their accretion evolution at the average rate of one per million years . \n a different rate will only shift some neutron stars from one bin to an adjacent one . \n the donor masses in the binaries are believed to range between @xmath37 and we assume a uniform distribution in this range . \n the resulting frequency distribution of x - ray neutron stars is shown in fig . \n [ fig : bin ] ; it is striking . \n spinout of the quark matter core as the neutron star spins up is signalled by a spike in the distribution which would be absent if there were no phase transition in our model of the neutron star . \n the position of the spike depends only on the stellar model . \n but the weight of the spike as compared to the high frequency tail depends sensitively on the weight with which the donor masses are assigned , the initial mass function of the accreting neutron stars ( for which we have taken only one mass ) , and to a minor degree on the accretion rate . a donor of mass @xmath38 contributes only to the spike , while all greater masses contribute to the spike and to higher frequency x - ray stars . \n objects above about 400 hz are unstable to collapse to very high - spin black holes \n . accretors of lower initial mass than we assume would contribute to the long high - frequency tail as well , possibly , to the spike . \n theoretically , a phase transition can ( but not necessarily does ) cause a distinct clustering in frequency of x - ray accreters , which is independent of details of accretion , such as rate , mass accreted so long as it exceeds a small minimum value ( @xmath39 ) , or indeed to the particular description of accretion mechanism that we employ . as emphasized , the position of the peak is an intrinsic property of our model star . \n but the transition can also occur unheralded by any remarkable signal @xcite . \n the apparent frequency clustering of x - ray neutron stars is about 100 hz higher than calculated . \n this discrepancy should not be surprising in view of our ignorance of the equation of state  above saturation density of nuclear matter and the necessarily crude representation of hadronic matter in the two phases in the absence of relevant solutions to the fundamental qcd theory of strong interactions . \n but however crude any model of hadronic matter may be , the physics underlying the effect of a phase transition on spin rate is robust , although not inevitable . \n we have cited an analogous phenomenon discovered in rotating nuclei @xcite .    the data in fig . \n [ fig : bin ] is gathered from tables 24 of the review article of van der klis concerning discoveries made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite . \n the interpretation of millisecond oscillations in the x - ray emission , either that found in bursts or of the difference between twin quasi - periodic oscillations in x - ray brightness , is ambiguous in some cases . \n for example , some of the burst data near 600 hz may actually represent twice the rotational frequency of the star . \n for this and other caveats , see the review article @xcite . \n nevertheless , the basic feature will probably survive  a clustering of x - ray neutron stars at moderate spin and a high spin tail . \n certainly there are high spin _ \n pulsars_. a histogram of _ ms pulsar _ \n frequencies shows a concentration around 200 hz , and a tail extending to @xmath40 hz as shown in fig . \n [ fig : princeton ] . \n so both the ( sparse ) data on x - ray objects and on ms pulsars seem to agree on a peak in the number of stars at moderate spin and on attenuation at high spin . for ms pulsars \n the attenuation may be partly a selection effect due to interstellar dispersion of the radio signal .    to summarize , we suggest that the apparent clustering in rotation frequency of accreting x - ray neutron stars in low - mass binaries may be caused by the progressive conversion of quark matter in the core to confined hadronic matter , paced by the slow spinup due to mass accretion . when conversion is completed , normal accretion driven spinup resumes . to distinguish this conjecture from others \n , one would have to discover the inverse phenomenon  a spin anomaly near the same frequency in an isolated ms pulsar @xcite . if such a discovery were made , and the apparent clustering of x - ray accreters is confirmed , we would have some degree of confidence in the hypothesis that a phase of matter such as existed in the very early universe , is reformed in a cold state during the birth of neutron stars . + \n this work was supported by the director , office of energy research , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of nuclear physics , of the u.s . \n department of energy under contract de - ac03 - 76sf00098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 431937070663, "RequestID": "e4fba77e96af481095fb53b631431107", "TotalTokens": 3874}

the enhanced decay of the condensate could also be understood from two- and three - body inelastic collisions between condensate and thermal atoms . \n also , two- and three - body loss rate constants were not known accurately and both processes were expected to contribute about equally to the decay @xcite . \n therefore the rate constants had to be determined from a fit . \n recently , we have accurately determined these two- and three - body loss rate constants over a range of magnetic field values  @xcite . \n we transferred @xmath7he@xmath8  atoms from a magnetic trap into an optical dipole trap and measured , both for atoms in the  and  state , the two- and three - body loss rate constants as a function of an applied magnetic field and with a ( quasi-)pure bec . in this paper \n we extend the previous experiment to partially condensed clouds with a large thermal fraction in order to investigate atomic transfer . to reduce two- and three - body losses we study long time scales and work at small magnetic field using  atoms that , in contrast to  atoms , only show three - body losses . \n the time evolution of the density of a trapped atomic gas can be described as @xmath9 the first term on the right takes into account one - body loss , which causes exponential decay with a time constant @xmath0 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the rate coefficients for two- and three - body loss , respectively , and are defined such that they explicitly include the loss of two and three atoms per loss event . \n the constants in front of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 and @xmath13 for a bec , while @xmath14 for a thermal gas  @xcite . \n the rate coefficients are obtained by measuring the number of trapped atoms after a variable hold time . \n the analysis of this data requires integration of eq . \n [ densityevolution ] over space . because a bec and a thermal cloud have different density distributions , extracting two- and three - body loss rate coefficients from partially condensed samples becomes very difficult , and experiments usually focus on either a pure bec or a thermal sample . \n in sec.2 of their paper , zin _ et al . _ \n @xcite have derived a simple model for the decay of the thermal and bec components of a partially condensed cloud in thermal equilibrium below the temperature threshold for bose - einstein condensation . \n the essential assumption of the model is that thermal equilibrium holds during one - body decay of a condensate . \n although two- and three - body losses may be incorporated in the model , this complicates the discussion and therefore we here ensure those to be negligible compared to the one - body losses by using low enough densities . \n if an atom is removed from the thermal cloud by , for instance , a collision with a background atom , then there is a place free in the otherwise saturated thermal distribution , which can be filled by a bec atom , thus maintaining the size of the thermal cloud at the expense of the bec . \n this transfer of atoms from the condensate to the thermal cloud enhances the decay of the condensate and increases the lifetime of the thermal cloud .    for the whole cloud , containing @xmath15 atoms , decay is exponential with time constant @xmath0 . \n the model then predicts that the thermal cloud will also decay exponentially , however with a larger time constant , while the condensate is expected to decay non - exponentially  @xcite : @xmath16 here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of condensed atoms and number of thermal atoms , respectively , and @xmath19 . \n the equations show that the thermal cloud is expected to decay exponentially with a time constant @xmath20 , independent of @xmath17 , which is assumed to be nonzero . for the bec \n a non - exponential decay is expected if an appreciable amount of thermal atoms is present . \n the model is valid up to the point that there are no bec atoms left or thermal equilibrium can not be assumed anymore . \n starting with a partially condensed cloud finally leads to the complete depletion of the bec ;

[ assumption ] is easily fulfilled throughout the decay since @xmath39 . \n we also observe that the temperature changes very little during the decay ( see the insets in fig . \n [ lifetimedata ] ) . at short hold times , the loss is dominated by three - body recombination with a rate constant of @xmath40  cm@xmath34s@xmath42  @xcite . \n two - body loss by penning ionization is strongly suppressed for the spin - stretched states  and  @xcite , while for  the spin - dipole interaction also does not contribute to two - body losses because the atom is in the lowest spin state  @xcite . \n [ lifetimedata ] clearly shows that , for hold times longer than 10  s , the loss of the total atom number becomes exponential , indicating the regime of one - body loss . in both measurements the initial density of the bec is @xmath43  @xmath33 . \n the thermal cloud initially has a density @xmath44  @xmath33 , which after 40  s has decreased to @xmath45  @xmath33 . \n the thermalization rate decreases in that time from @xmath46  s@xmath42 to @xmath47  s@xmath42 , still much larger than the one - body decay rate of approximately 0.05  s@xmath42 , ensuring sufficiently rapid thermal equilibration . \n we observe a faster decay of the bec fraction than the thermal fraction , eventually leading to a full depletion of the condensate , as expected from the atomic transfer model . \n inspection of the decay of the thermal cloud for times longer than 10 s clearly shows that the thermal cloud decays with a larger time constant than the whole cloud . \n fitting an exponential decay function to the data at longer hold times yields @xmath48  s , @xmath49  s and @xmath50 for the data of fig .  [ lifetimedata](a ) , and @xmath51  s , @xmath52 s and @xmath53 for fig . \n [ lifetimedata](b ) , where we give @xmath54-uncertainties . \n we attribute the relatively small lifetime to off - resonant scattering of the dipole trap light or resonant excitation by stray light , which could also explain the difference in the obtained lifetimes ( our background pressure would limit the lifetime to @xmath2100  s ) . \n we conclude that the thermal fraction decays significantly slower than the bec fraction and that the measured lifetime ratio is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xmath55 .    to compare the measurements of the bec fraction with the atomic transfer model we first fit an exponential decay @xmath56 to the total atom number for long hold times to obtain the overall lifetime @xmath0 as well as @xmath57 . \n here @xmath57 is the _ apparent _ atom number at @xmath58=0 in the absence of three - body loss . in the second step , \n we fit an exponential decay @xmath59 to the thermal fraction , with only the _ apparent _ bec fraction @xmath60 as a fit parameter . finally , with the obtained parameters @xmath57 , @xmath0 and @xmath60 , we numerically solve eq . \n [ modelequation2 ] to obtain @xmath61 . \n the fit results are shown in fig . \n [ lifetimedata ] as solid lines . \n the @xmath54 errors in the fit parameters are reflected in the band around the theoretical curve for @xmath17 . \n we observe that the atomic transfer model describes the time evolution of the thermal and bec fraction very well . \n our data provides direct verification of the atomic transfer model . the relatively short lifetime @xmath0 \n @xmath62  20  s , together with a large scattering length , provide optimal conditions to see this effect . \n also , at the relatively small numbers of trapped atoms needed to demonstrate atomic transfer , mcp detection allows better fitting of the bec fraction compared to absorption imaging . \n atomic transfer is most directly visible in the one - body loss regime , but is important in the two- and three - body regime as well , as was theoretically discussed in ref . \n @xcite . as a final remark \n we note that one should take care using a bec for loss measurements \n . the thermal fraction may be small in the initial stage of bec decay , but can dramatically increase after long hold times affecting the decay of the condensate , which will finally become non - exponential . \n we thank jacques bouma for technical support . \n this work was financially supported by the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) . \n s.  k.  acknowledges financial support from the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) via a vidi grant . \n 17ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12 \n & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop   @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( )", "StartTimeOffset": 446346557521, "RequestID": "7979f192b37742e68d9ace358f92503e", "TotalTokens": 4110}
{"ContextTokens": 3719, "GeneratedTokens": 155, "SynthesizedBody": "in general the problem of causality is closely connected with basic philosophical problems . \n the main philosophical problem concerns a relation between matter and spirit . \n there are two extreme points of view on this problem :    matter is primary and spirit is secondary ;    spirit is primary and matter is secondary . in connection with this topic \n we should remember the discussion between einstein and tagore . in this discussion \n einstein upheld a materialistic view ( 1 . ) and tagore upheld an idealistic one ( 2 . ) . \n i think that in some sense these extremes can meet or some medium point of view is possible . \n but at first i determine some characteristic features of these extreme views as i understand them :    a materialistic view    there is a common or physical or objective time and space ( space - time ) ,    there is a unified ( physical ) law ,    there are a theoretical predictability for space - time events and a world order ,    a person ( human ) is a part of material world , he has no a free will ;    an idealistic view    an individual spirit is free from time and space ,    any spaces and laws can be formed by consciousness ( or consensus ) ,    an individual spirit is unpredictable ,    a person ( human ) is an incarnation of an individual spirit which has a free will .    a materialistic view ( 1 . \n ) is confirmed by advances of natural science . an idealistic view ( 2 . ) \n can be confirmed by demonstrations of parapsychology phenomena . \n my opinion is that there are space - time with a unified law and the world order . \n being `` normal '' an individual acts in the framework of the world order but may be he ( his spirit ) can also escape ( in a certain sense , sometimes or often ) from the material world and space - time . \n thus i think that intermediate states also are possible .    in any case \n a knowledge of a unified law gives significant advantages for the civilization , in creation of new technical devices . \n thus the object of my present investigation is a unified law of matter . \n the quantum mechanics description can not pretend to this role because it gives probabilistic predictions in principle . \n ( in the known expression by einstein `` god does not play dice '' just a unified law is considered as god . )    in this connection i consider a unified local field theory . \n the whole history of pre - quantum physics naturally led to the idea of unified field theory for description of matter . \n all particles of matter and its apparent mutual influence must be represented by some solution of an appropriate field model which must be nonlinear . \n also this model must be local , i.e. it is represented by some purely differential system of equations . \n this is an essence of the ideas which was inspiring for many scientists in their working . \n let us mention just a few : a.  einstein , l.  de broglie , h.  weil , a.  eddington , g.  mie , e.  schrdinger , m.  born , l.  infeld , j.  plebansky , etc . \n but on the other hand the impressive success of quantum mechanics has eclipsed the idea of unified field theory which was in the air . \n the quantum mechanics is essentially a linear theory which is much more simple for investigation than nonlinear one . \n but the quantum mechanics gives the probabilistic predictions only . \n einstein , podolsky , and rosen in their famous article @xcite had advanced the arguments for the standpoint that quantum mechanical description of reality is incomplete . \n bohm and aharonov had proposed an example ( see also my article @xcite ) for demonstration the epr paradox in which two spin particles scatter in opposite directions . according to the quantum mechanical description for this experiment , a spin states of the individual particles are indeterminate until a measurement event . \n but as soon as we have measured a spin state for one particle then a spin state for another particle becomes determinate immediately . \n this resulting situation is connected with the conservation law of full angular momentum for the system of two particles . \n this situation looks as though there was an instantaneous interaction between space separate particles . \n it contradicts with the thesis for locality of interactions . \n thus quantum mechanics predicts nonlocal correlations between the events . \n well known aspect experiment @xcite for testing of also well known bell inequalities @xcite determines that there are the nonlocal correlations .    at first glance \n the existence of this nonlocal correlations rejects a possibility for description of matter by an unified local field theory . \n however , actually , this is not the fact . in the following i \n show that nonlocal correlations between events must exist in the framework of a unified local field theory of matter . \n actually the concept of unified local field theory for the material world is similar to the concept of ether , if we understand it in the broad sense but not a narrow mechanical one . \n this concept supposes only two basic properties : continuity and locality . \n mathematically these properties are expressed in the fact that we consider some purely differential field model or some system of equations with partial derivatives . to describe naturally the interactions between material objects , this system of equations must be nonlinear . \n we believe also that there is a model solution which is determinate in space - time . \n thus , according to this concept , we can consider some cauchy problem or the problem with initial condition for obtaining the world evolution .    within the framework of such theory a single elementary particle \n is represented by some space - localized solution . moreover , because , as we know , elementary particles have wave properties , this solution must have an appropriate wave part . \n the wave part is considered here in the sense of time fourier expansion for the solution in own coordinate system of the particle , where this part has the form of a standing wave . \n there is a simplest example for such standing wave even for the customary linear wave equation . \n these well known solutions of the wave equation in a spherical coordinate system include spherical harmonics . \n for the spherically symmetric case we have the standing wave @xmath0 which is formed by the sum of divergent and convergent spherical waves . \n with the help of lorentz transformation we can obtain the appropriate solution in the form of moving nondeliquescent wave packet \n . then own frequency @xmath1 transforms to wave vector @xmath2 such that @xmath3 using the linear relation between the wave vector and a vector of momentum we obtain @xmath4    a single elementary particle solution of a nonlinear field model may be called also as _ \n solitron_. this term has a similar sense that `` solitary wave '' or `` soliton '' . \n but usually the term `` soliton '' is used in mathematical context for some special solutions . \n it is significant , the concept of unified field theory supposes that all variety and evolution of the material world are represented by some space - time field configuration which is an exact solution of the nonlinear field model . \n it is evident that this solution is very very complicated but it is determinate on space - time by the field model with initial and boundary conditions . in the vicinity of a separate elementary particle \n this world solution is close to the appropriate single elementary particle solution , but each elementary particle behaves as the part of the world solution . \n thus the behavior of each elementary particle is connected with the whole space - time field configuration of the world solution .    for certain conditions it is possible to consider the world solution part connecting with a separate elementary particle as the appropriate solitron solution with slowly variable velocity . \n ( for the case of nonlinear electrodynamics see , for example , my article @xcite . ) \n this level for investigation of the world solution relates to the classical ( not quantum ) physics . \n it is evident that although the model is local , the world solution is nonlocal in character because it is determined on a whole space - time applicable domain . \n this means , in particular , that there are undoubtedly nonlocal correlations between space separate parts of the common world solution . \n this sentence may be explained with the help of the following simplest example . \n 0.35 mm    ( 104.67,90.00 ) ( 10,10)(0,1)80 ( 30,10)(0,1)80 ( 50,10)(0,1)80 ( 70,10)(0,1)80 ( 90,10)(0,1)80 ( 57,50.00)(1,0)40 ( 10.00,50.00 ) ( 10.00,25.00 ) ( 40.00,50.00 ) ( 6,47.00)(0,0)[rc]@xmath5 ( 6,24.67)(0,0)[rc]@xmath6 ( 40.00,44.50)(0,0)[ct]@xmath7 ( 10.00,5.00)(1,0)90 ( 104,5.00)(0,0)[lc]@xmath8 ( 10,5)(0,-1)2 ( 40,5)(0,-1)2 ( 40.00,1.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath9 ( 10.00,1.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath10    let us consider a customary plane wave travelling on axis @xmath8 with a fixed wave - length @xmath11 ( see fig . \n 1 ) such that @xmath12 \\quad . \\ ] ] this wave is the solution of the customary linear wave equation . \n at the points @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 the field evolution has the forms @xmath13 \\quad , \\\\ \n \\nonumber & & p:\\ ; f=\\sin [ ( 2\\pi/\\lambda)\\,x^0 ] \\quad , \\\\ \n \\nonumber & & q:\\ ; f=\\sin [ ( 2\\pi/\\lambda)\\,(x^0 { } - { } q ) ] \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus here there are the nonlocal correlations between the field evolution at the points @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 . \n totality of such nonlocal correlations is , in fact , the solution in space - time for the local field model . \n the possible world solution ( which is extremely more complicated than a plane wave ) is also the continuous set of nonlocal correlations for the field evolution at the points of three - dimensional space .    of course \n , if we make some excitation for field at the point @xmath5 then a propagation of this excitation from this point will have a finite speed . \n but in the scope of the world solution we do not be able to make this excitation or to modify arbitrarily this world solution . \n any excitations of the field at the point @xmath5 belong to the world solution which is a single whole . \n that is , in this case we must consider also all excitations coming to this point and we will have some standing wave near it . thus the world solution is rather a very complicated system of standing waves than progressing ones . \n the initial condition is a common cause of all field excitations and after a long evolution the different correlations may exist , even the strange ones . \n it can only be said quite positively that the world solution can be represented by fourier integral ( or series ) on orthogonal space - time harmonics which are essentially nonlocal . \n ( here we must remember how a dominant role is played by orthogonal functions in quantum approach . ) \n the key to understanding the appearance of momentary distant interaction in the experiment , which is considered in section [ sec2 ] , is contained in a concept of chance choice \n . within the framework of the world solution a chance choice is absent , but both experimenter and experimental apparatus are a part of this world solution . \n that is the orientation of particle spin detectors in the experiment under consideration is predetermined by the world solution . \n we speak about a chance choice because we do not know the world solution .    as experimentalists \n , we think that we establish the initial conditions for the process under investigation but may be this is too conceitedly and the veritable initial condition was established earlier . but as theorists , we can already calculate many correlations between space - time events . \n thus we can suppose that the quantum mechanical description is the level for investigation of the world solution . \n this level take into consideration , in particular , the global or nonlocal aspects of this solution . \n nonlocality was founded in quantum mechanics from the outset . in schrdinger \n s picture a free elementary particle ( which have a determinate momentum ) is related with a plane wave having a constant amplitude on the whole space . in this case \n the quantum mechanical description does not determine a position of the particle . \n that is we have the representation of a free elementary particle by a non space - localized wave that accentuates just nonlocal aspect of matter .    as we see , there is nonlocality also in the framework of unified local field theory . \n but such theory supposes a solitron model for free elementary particle that is intuitively more preferable . \n furthermore according to this concept there is a deterministic description of matter .    thus having a unified mathematical model for matter \n we must also take into consideration the whole of the material world evolution from a start point when the initial condition was determined . and \n we can say that there is the global causality in the space - time universe . \n as we see the unified field theory approach can give a strong determinancy of events in material world . \n but my opinion is that we must also take into consideration some things which are outside from the space - time framework of the physical world . \n suppose here by definition that these things include spirits . \n because a spirit is outside from the material world or a world solution , he may have an influence on initial and boundary conditions . \n suppose that a spirit can partially modify the world solution , which is possible with the help of some dynamical boundary conditions . \n but these modifications must be again nonlocal in general . \n thus the world solution is determinate in general and a possible intervention of spirit must be unexpected and unusual in character . \n this spirit intervention also realizes a global space - time causality in a sense , but this causality is not explained by physical laws . \n i think that this is a reasonable way for introduction a concept of will to the picture of material world stated above . \n thus i believe that in the material world we have a partial nonlocal determinancy which however agree with a unified local field theory of matter .    in connection with the fact that i touch on philosophical problems in this article , i would like also refer to schrdinger s book @xcite including considerations which i accept in general . \n at present we consider a single atom and even a single electron as objects of technology . \n there is a concept of a single electron transistor @xcite and we can seriously consider prospects for building an avogadro - scale computer acting on bits @xcite . in such computer using the nuclear magnetic resonance one nuclear spin must store one bit of information \n .    traditional computation can do many useful things and this ability can become very much stronger with the possible avogadro - scale technology . but the traditional computation needs a determinate controlling . \n such controlling is possible if we have a unified field theory of matter in the sense that was stated above . \n this is one of the possible applications of the approach under review . \n but , of course , a realization for the paradigm of unified field theory will discover abilities which we do not know at the present time .    in connection with the approach of unified field theory \n i propose to consider the nonlinear electrodynamics model of born - infeld type with singularities @xcite . \n in particular , in the framework of this model the two fundamental long - range interactions ( electromagnetism and gravitation ) may be unified ( see my articles ) . \n einstein , a. , podolsky , b. , and rosen , n.

{"ContextTokens": 3516, "GeneratedTokens": 162, "SynthesizedBody": "because the gravitational interaction is so weak , a stochastic background of gravitational radiation ( the graviton background ) decouples from the matter in the universe at very early times . \n for this reason , the stochastic background of gravitational radiation , which is in principle observable at the present time , carries with it a picture of the state of the universe at very early times , when energy densities and temperatures were very large . \n the most interesting features of string theory are associated with its behavior at very high energies , near the planck scale . \n such high energies are unobtainable in present - day laboratories , and are unlikely to be reached for quite some time . \n they were , however , available during the very early history of the universe , so string theory can be probed by the predictions which it makes about that epoch . \n recent work has shown how the early universe might behave , if superstring theories are a correct description of nature @xcite . \n one of the robust predictions of this  string cosmology \" is that our present - day universe would contain a stochastic background of gravitational radiation @xcite , with a spectrum which is quite different than that predicted by many other early - universe cosmological models @xcite . in particular , the spectrum of gravitational waves predicted by string cosmology has rising amplitude with increasing frequency . \n this means that the radiation might have large enough amplitude to be observable by ground - based gravity - wave detectors , which operate at frequencies above @xmath0 . \n this also allows the spectrum to be consistent with observational bounds arising at @xmath1 from observations of the cosmic background radiation and at @xmath2 from observation of millisecond pulsar timing residuals .    in this short paper \n , we examine the spectrum of radiation produced by string cosmology , and determine the region of parameter space for which this radiation would be observable by the ( initial and advanced versions of the ) ligo detectors @xcite . \n in models of string cosmology @xcite , the universe passes through two early inflationary stages . the first of these \n is called the  dilaton - driven \" period and the second is the  string \" phase . \n each of these stages produces stochastic gravitational radiation ; the contribution of the dilaton - driven phase is currently better understood than that of the string phase .    in order to describe the background of gravitational radiation \n , it is conventional to use a spectral function @xmath3 which is determined by the energy density of the stochastic gravitational waves . \n this function of frequency is defined by [ e : defomegagw ] _ \n gw(f ) = 1 _ critical d _ \n gw d f. here @xmath4 is the ( present - day ) energy density in stochastic gravitational waves in the frequency range @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the critical energy - density required to just close the universe . \n this is given by [ e : crit ] _ \n critical = 3 c^2 h_0 ^ 2 8 g 1.6 10 ^ -8 h_100 ^ 2 ergs / cm^3 , where the hubble expansion rate @xmath7 is the rate at which our universe is currently expanding , [ e : hubble ] h_0 = h_100 100 = 3.2 10 ^ -18h_100 1 sec . \n because @xmath7 is not known exactly , it is defined in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath8 which is believed to lie in the range @xmath9 . \n the spectrum of gravitational radiation produced in the dilaton - driven and string phase was discussed in @xcite . in the simplest model , which we will use in this paper , \n it depends upon four parameters . \n the first pair of these are the frequency @xmath10 and the fractional energy density @xmath11 produced at the end of the dilaton - driven phase . \n the second pair of parameters are the maximal frequency @xmath12 above which gravitational radiation is not produced and the maximum fractional energy density @xmath13 , which occurs at that frequency . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ f : spec ] . \n an approximate form for the spectrum is @xcite [ e : approx ] _ \n gw(f)= where = is the logarithmic slope of the spectrum produced in the string phase . \n if we assume that there is no late entropy production and make reasonable choices for the number of effective degrees of freedom , then two of the four parameters may be determined in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath14 at the onset of radiation domination immediately following the string phase of expansion @xcite , f_1= 1.3 10 ^ 10 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^1/2 and _ gw^max = 1 10 ^ -7 h_100 ^ -2 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^2 . \n more complicated models and spectra were discussed in @xcite . \n the ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined by the basic physical parameters of string cosmology models , the values of the hubble parameter and the string coupling parameter at the end of the dilaton - driven phase and the onset of the string phase @xcite . \n a number of authors @xcite have shown how one can use a network of two or more gravitational wave antennae to detect a stochastic background of gravitational radiation . \n the basic idea is to correlate the signals from separated detectors , and to search for a correlated strain produced by the gravitational - wave background , which is buried in the intrinsic instrumental noise . \n it has been shown by these authors that after correlating signals for time @xmath17 ( we take @xmath18 ) the ratio of  signal \" to  noise \" ( squared ) is given by an integral over frequency @xmath19 : [ e : sovern ] ( s n ) ^2 = 9 h_0 ^ 4 50 ^4 t _ 0^df .    in order to detect a stochastic background with @xmath20 confidence the ratio @xmath21 needs to be at least @xmath22 . in this equation , \n several different functions appear , which we now define . \n the instrument noise in the detectors is described by the one - sided noise power spectral densities @xmath23 . \n the ligo project is building two identical detectors , one in hanford washington and one in livingston louisiana , which we will refer to as the  initial \" detectors . \n after several years of operation , these detectors will be upgraded to so - called  advanced \" detectors . since the two detectors are identical in design , @xmath24 . \n the design goals for the detectors specify these functions @xcite . they are shown in fig .  [ \n f : noise ] . \n the next quantity which appears is the overlap reduction function @xmath25 . \n this function is determined by the relative locations and orientations of the arms of the two detectors , and is identical for both the initial and advanced ligo detectors . for the pair of ligo detectors ( f ) = -0.124842 j_0(x ) - 2.90014 + 3.00837 , where the @xmath26 are spherical bessel functions . \n the dimensionless frequency variable is @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the light - travel - time between the two ligo detector sites . \n this function is shown in fig . \n [ f : overlap ] \n .    equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) allows us to assess the detectability ( using initial or advanced ligo ) of any particular stochastic background @xmath3 . \n making use of the prediction from string cosmology , we may use equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) to assess the detectability of this stochastic background . for \n any given set of parameters we may numerically evaluate the signal to noise ratio @xmath29 ; if this value is greater than @xmath22 then with at least 90% confidence , the background can be detected by ligo . \n the regions of detectability in parameter space are shown in fig . \n [ f : init ] for the initial ligo detectors , and in fig . \n [ f : adva ] for the advanced ligo detectors . for these figures \n we have assumed @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n the observable regions for different values of these parameters can be obtained by simple scaling of the presented results .    at the moment , \n the most restrictive observational constraint on the spectral parameters comes from the standard model of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( ns ) @xcite . \n this restricts the total energy density in gravitons to less than that of approximately one massless degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium . \n this bound implies that _ \n gw(f ) d f = _ \n gw^s < 0.7 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100 . [ nucleo ] where we have assumed an allowed @xmath32 at ns , and have substituted in the spectrum ( [ e : approx ] ) . \n this bound is shown on figs . \n [ f : init],[f : adva ] . \n we also show the weaker  dilaton only \" bound , assuming no stochastic background is produced during the ( more poorly - understood ) string phase of expansion : _ \n gw^s < 2.1 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100 \n . this is obtained by setting @xmath33 in the previous equation , i.e. assuming that @xmath34 vanishes for @xmath35 . \n we note that if the  dilaton + string \" spectrum is correct , then the ns bounds rule out any hopes of observation by initial ligo . on the other hand , in the  dilaton only \" case , a detectable background is not ruled out by ns bounds ; it would be observable if the spectral peak falls into the detection bandpass between 50 and 200 hz ( figure 7 of @xcite ) . \n because the function @xmath36 decays rapidly at high and low frequencies , the asymptotic behavior of the 90% confidence contours for the advanced ligo detector in the high and low @xmath37 regions can be estimated analytically as follows ( _ gw^s)_90%= 7.4 10 ^ -10 h_100 ^ -2 ( f_s/100 ) ^3 ,  f_s100 ( _ gw^s)_90%= 2.6 10 ^ -11  h_100 ^ \n -2  ( f_s/20 ) ^0.4 ,  f_s20 similar estimates may be obtained for the initial ligo detector . \n in this short paper , we have shown how data from the the initial and advanced versions of ligo will be able to constrain string cosmology models of the early universe . in principle , this might also constrain the fundamental parameters of superstring theory . \n the initial ligo is sensitive only to a narrow region of parameter space and is only marginally above the required sensitivity , while the advanced ligo detector has far better detection possibilities . \n the simultaneous operation of other types of gravitational wave detectors which operate at higher frequencies , such as bar and resonant designs , ought to provide additional increase in sensitivity and therefore further constrain the parameter space . \n -0.5 in g. veneziano , phys . lett . * \n b265 * ( 1991 ) 287 . m. gasperini and g. veneziano , astropart \n * 1 * ( 1993 ) 317 ; mod . \n a8 * ( 1993 ) 3701 . \n r. brustein , m. gasperini , m. giovannini and g. veneziano phys . \n b361 * ( 1995 ) 45 . m. gasperini and m. giovannini , phys . rev . \n * d47 * ( 1993 ) 1519 . \n grishchuk , sov . \n jetp * 40 * ( 1975 ) 409 . \n m. s. turner , _ detectability of inflation produced gravitational waves _ , preprint fermilab - pub-96 - 169-a ( astro - ph/9607066 ) . \n b. allen , _ the stochastic gravity - wave background : sources and detection _ , in proceedings of the les houches school on astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation , springer - verlag , 1996 . \n a. abramovici , et . \n al . , science * 256 * ( 1992 ) 325 . \n r. brustein , _ spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave background _ , preprint bgu - ph-96 - 08 ( hep - th/9604159 ) . \n r. brustein , m. gasperini and g. veneziano , _ peak and endpoint of the relic graviton background in string cosmology _ \n , preprint cern - th-96 - 37 ( hep - th/9604084 ) . \n m. gasperini , _ relic gravitons from the pre - big - bang : what we know and what we do not know _ , preprint cern - th-96 - 186 ( hep - th/9607146 ) . \n a. buonanno , m. maggiore and c. ungarelli , _ spectrum of relic gravitational waves in string cosmology _ , preprint ifup - th-25 - 96 ( gr - qc/9605072 ) . \n m. galluccio , m. litterio and f. occhionero , _ graviton spectra in string cosmology _ , rome preprint ( gr - qc/9608007 ) . \n g. veneziano , _ string cosmology and relic gravitational radiation _ , preprint cern - th-96 - 37 ( hep - th/9606119 ) . \n p. michelson , mon . not . \n . soc . * 227 * ( 1987 ) 933 . \n n. christensen , phys . \n * d46 * ( 1992 ) 5250 . \n e. flanagan , phys . rev . \n * d48 * ( 1993 ) 2389 . \n @xmath38 note that the second term on the right hand side of equation ( b6 ) should read @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 , and that the sliding delay function shown in figure 2 on page 2394 is incorrect . \n v. f. schwartzmann , jetp lett . \n * 9 * ( 1969 ) 184 ; t. walker et al . \n , ap . j. * 376 * ( 1991 ) 51 .", "StartTimeOffset": 454560789151, "RequestID": "4f5346bfdc7a400886f5a58ae3dd12dc", "TotalTokens": 3678}

central peak and having velocities of 12001500 kms@xmath1 . \n the appearance of the h@xmath12 line was similar . \n the additional emission line components of z  and were already reported by @xcite and @xcite , which consider them as indications of bipolar jets . \n we suppose that all components indicating high velocities appear in bipolar outflow from the outbursting hot object . \n the 2006 outburst of z  and is a first one , when optical bipolar outflow from this system was observed . \n our note is devoted to this phenomenon , where preliminary results of one study of the h@xmath0 line are treated . \n the region of the line h@xmath0 was observed on eight nights in july , august and september 2006 with the photometrics ccd camera mounted on the coude spectrograph of the 2 m rcc telescope of the national astronomical observatory rozhen . during the last of these nights besides the region of the line h@xmath0 , that of h@xmath12 was also observed . \n the spectral resolution was 0.2 px@xmath1 on all occasions . \n some of the exposures were comparatively long to obtain better ratio signal to noise of the continuum although the central emission component of the h@xmath0 line was saturated in some cases ( table 1 ) . \n ever when we made more than one exposure per night , the spectra were added with the aim to improve the signal to noise ratio . \n the iraf package was used for data reduction . \n the additional emission components were fitted with a gaussian to measure their radial velocity and equivalent width . \n it was made only for those spectra where they are intensive enough ( table 2 ) . \n the inner uncertainty of the equivalent width in these cases is not more than 50 per cent . \n the h@xmath0 flux was obtained using the equivalent width and the @xmath13 flux supposing that it is practically equal to the continuum flux at the position of this line . for this aim \n we used the @xmath13 magnitudes of @xcite and @xcite taken very close to the time of our observations . \n the uncertainty of the continuum flux is not more than 10 per cent and that of the line flux  not more than 50 per cent . \n the fluxes were corrected for an interstellar extinction of @xmath14 according to the approach of @xcite . \n it was used the ephemeris @xmath15 , where the orbital period is based on both photometric and spectral data @xcite . \n .journal of observations . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]     this value is too great compared with the observed mass - loss rate of the hot compact component of the symbiotic systems during their active phases , which is most frequently about 10@xmath16 10@xmath17 m@xmath5yr@xmath1 @xcite . \n the great value follows from our assumption for spherical symmetry of the outflowing material and the observed high velocity \n . it can be in reasonable limits if the material does not flow in all directions , but only in some of them , related to areas with small angular sizes . \n the material can flow mainly in the polar areas , if it is prevented in equatorial one for example by an accretion disk . in this case \n the velocity in the polar areas increases to provide the mass ejection there . \n this supposition can be related to the existence of two kinds of absorption components indicating very different expansion velocities . \n we can assume that the dip feature of h@xmath0 is due to mass flow in the orbital plane with a moderate velocity . \n the flowing material , however , is prevented by the accretion disk and the direction of its motion changes . in this way it is ejected in a direction , perpendicular to the plane of the disk , like the gas flowing in that direction . \n all of the material gives rise to the high velocity components of the h@xmath0 line . \n thus the blue shifted absorption indicates motion probably in the front part of the wind which is projected on the stellar disk . \n then we can suppose that the weak emission feature with a velocity of 1500 kms@xmath1 appears in the nonocculted part of the back component of the wind .    as it is seen from the evolution of the spectrum in figs . \n [ ha_log ] and [ abs - em ] the blue - shifted absorption component disappears and an emission rises . \n thus two emission components on the two sides of the central peak form in july . the disappearance of the blue - shifted absorption and the rise of an emission is most probably due to decrease of the flow rate and/or increase of the number of the emitting atoms in that part of the wind which does not project on the stellar disk . \n if the absorption is related to the inner part of the wind and the emission  to its outer one , not projecting on the stellar disk , the evolution of the spectrum shows that the velocity in the front wind component ( stream ) decreases with the distance to the star . \n it is seen in fig . \n [ ha_log ] that the emission on the long - wavelengths side of the central peak increases compared to the continuum . \n it is seen also in the figure that the velocity of the line decreases from about 1500 kms@xmath1 to about 1200 kms@xmath1 . \n taking into account the fact that the distance covered by the emitting gas increases with time it can be concluded that the velocity in the back stream decreases with the distance to the star too . \n the h@xmath12 line had similar emission components , as it is seen on the unique frame taken in its region in september .    to know the energy emitted in the h@xmath0 high velocity components as well as the quantity of the emitting gas we calculated their line flux and emission measure . \n the emission measure was obtained supposing that the gas medium is optically thin and has a constant density . \n it is not possible to obtain the electron temperature and the electron density in the region where the outflow components are emitted from observation since we have no indication about the appearance in this region of certain lines giving information for these parameters . \n we suppose that the electron temperature is 20000 k and the mean electron density is about 10@xmath18 @xmath3 in the nebular portion of the streams . \n then we used recombination coefficient of 5.956@xmath19 @xmath20s@xmath1 for case b , corresponding to these temperature and density @xcite . \n we adopted a helium abundance of 0.1 @xcite and a distance to the system of 1.5 kpc according to @xcite . \n for the calculation of the emission measure we need to know the state of ionization of helium in the emitting region . \n the line 4686 was very weak ( as it is seen from our data ) during the period of our observations which means that singly ionized helium is dominant in the circumbinary nebula at the times close to the epoch of the maximal light . \n that is why we assume the state of ionization to be he@xmath21 in the region of the streams . \n the line flux and the emission measure are listed in table 2 . \n these data propose that the ejected matter increases till august 12 and after that decreases , which is probably due to decrease of the flow rate . \n we calculated also the mass of the nebular portion of the streams on the basis of the greatest emission measure observed on august 12 . \n it turned out to be about 8@xmath4 m@xmath5 for the front stream and 6@xmath4 m@xmath5 for the back one . \n we present results of high resolution spectral observations carried out in the region of the line h@xmath0 of the spectrum of the symbiotic binary z and close to the light maximum of its 2006 optical brightening . \n the line h@xmath0 had a blue - shifted absorption component with a velocity of about 1400 kms@xmath1 at the time of maximal light in july . \n this line had also additional emission components placed at 12001500 kms@xmath1 on the two sides of its central peak in july , august and september . \n the line h@xmath12 had similar components as far as it is seen on its unique frame . \n it is supposed that both the absorption and the emission components are signature of bipolar wind outflow from the hot compact object in this system . \n the different velocities observed at different spectra indicate probably the decrease of the flow velocity . \n the energy flux of the outflow components of the h@xmath0 line and their emission measure were calculated on the basis of @xmath13 photometric data from the literature taken during the time of the spectral observations . \n these quantities increased till august 12 and after that decreased , which is probably due to diminution of the flow rate . \n the mass of the nebular part of the streams on august 12 was obtained , which amounts to 68@xmath4 m@xmath5 . \n the authors thank their colleagues dr . h. \n markov , dr . d. kjurkchieva , a. ivanova

{"ContextTokens": 4094, "GeneratedTokens": 192, "SynthesizedBody": "graphics programs in high energy physics experiments are necessary to visualize the detectors geometry and display physics events . \n they help in the commissionning phase of the experiment in debugging and understanding the systems . \n they must provide an interactive access to the event data and their reconstruction through online and offline algorithms . \n as such they play an important role in the search and discovery of new physics . \n persint ( perspectively interacting ) is an interactive visualization program  @xcite which is developed primely for the atlas collaboration  @xcite . \n the display of objects and the interactivity between the user and objects or applications is realized through the use of the higz package  @xcite . \n facilities dedicated to the spatial navigation and the definition of the visualization properties are provided , in order to interactively set the viewing and viewed points , so as obtain the desired perspective . in \n parallel , applications may be launched through the use of dedicated interfaces , such as the interactive reconstruction and display of physics events . \n persint was originally developed as a tool for debugging and optimizing the atlas muon pattern and track reconstruction algorithm muonbox  @xcite . \n it was early realized that traditional event displays based on simple projections were not fit to the task of visualizing events in the toroidal , inhomogeneous field of the muon spectrometer . \n only a three - dimensional interactive tool with navigation capabilities is well suited for such a task . \n the program is now routinely used for event display of hits and reconstruction objects of complex monte carlo events and in testbeam applications , both online and offline . \n persint is used for the visualization of detector geometries : as such it is interfaced to amdb ( the atlas muon database ) and the agdd - xml atlas generic detector description . \n other applications include the visualization of the magnetic field , the level-1 muon trigger logic , the interactive generation of tracks , and the display of xml event hits . \n the program offers the following features  :    * 3-dimensional representation of objects in full volumes or wire frames * computation of hidden faces * highlight of volumes edges * lighting intensity effects on volume facets * detection of clashing volumes and highlight of intersections * boolean volume operations ( addition , subtraction , intersection ) * spatial navigation with real - time displacements * focal length adjustable at will ( from isometry to wide - angle ) * interfaces and access to applications * save to postscript * documentation      the core of the program is written in fortran90 . \n dynamic data objects are extensively exploited in order to minimize the memory usage which can become important when a large numbers of volume are displayed , a situation typical to modern hep experiments , both with respect to the detector description and the event data themselves . \n persint uses the following features of f90 :    * usage of modules , with procedure interfaces * polymorphism * recursive functions * dynamic arrays * allocate , for local memory management * pointers * string operations * array manipulations * free source forms    the graphics interface is higz  @xcite and in general the program makes extensive use of the cernlib  @xcite . \n it is built on 26000 lines on code and is part of the saclay muon software suite . as such it is interfaced directly to the geometrical database amdbsimrec ( 13000 lines ) , the magnetic field database bfielddtb ( 3500 lines ) and the track reconstruction algorithm muonbox ( 58000 lines )  @xcite . \n the code is highly modular , organized in patches . \n the xml section is such an example of a patch . \n it contains everything needed to parse , store transiently and generates volumes from standardized xml files . \n the computation of volumes with hidden faces is based on the analytical computation of facets edges in space . \n this computation also provides the detection of clashes and the highlights of the volumes intersections , and supports boolean volume operations . \n the program is designed to operate in standalone mode , keeping the possibility of integration in frameworks . \n it was for example successfully used in the context of the online software framework of the atlas testbeams . \n the program is released officially at cern on afs in a public directory   since version 2.00 for three platforms : linux , sun - solaris unix and compaq / alpha unix . \n this repository contains the source and executable files together with documentation and useful input databases , and for developers , the tools necessary to build , compile and load the code . \n the latest released version is 3.00 . \n the documentation can be found in the persint manual located in the public repository or on the dedicated persint web page  . \n this page provides updates on the releases . \n the program is designed around the command window and the higz display window . a typical view obtained with the display window \n is shown in figure  [ layout ] . \n the command window is used essentially to load files and type commands interpreted by the code and documented in the persint manual . \n the display window however is organized in such a way to provide maximum interactivity to avoid typing commands as much as possible . \n the display window is dedicated to the colour display of both the objects computed by the program for visualization and the graphical interfaces . \n the primary interface is the navigator . \n the navigator supports the navigation facilities necessary to survey the entire detector space and gives access to the various graphics applications provided by persint . \n its layout is shown in figure  [ nav ] . \n it consists in an ensemble of push buttons and gauges which can be clicked , so as to modify the visualization properties or access lower level interfaces .      the spatial navigation , as well as the modification of the visualization properties , \n are realized through the use of gauges which define the amplitudes of the movements of the viewing and viewed points and of the change in focal length of the observer eye , such as to obtain the desired perspective . \n each action is validated with the  * go * \" push button . \n alternatively , the navigation can be performed through real time displacements of the observer point . \n continuous displacements are obtained by dragging the cursor over the display itself , thus bypassing the use of the navigator . \n persint offers the possibility to modify interactively the visualization focal length . in the navigator \n , a sectioned gauge may be used to select the normal view , equivalent to a focal length of 35 mm , the isometric view , equivalent to an infinite focal length , or to increase or decrease the focal length at will . \n moreover , x , y , z , or @xmath0 projections of the volumes on display may be obtained by clicking dedicated push buttons ( see figure  [ nav ] ) . in the case of x , y , and z projections , the observing point position ( e.g. x@xmath1 or x@xmath2 ) can be modified by clicking the  displace viewing point \" 2d gauge on the corresponding half . in the case of @xmath0 projection , this same gauge can be used to define the value of @xmath0 \n . examples of visualization of the same volumes with different perspectives are presented in figure  [ expers ] . \n the interactive reconstruction and event display ( evd ) application of persint is dedicated to the reading of event hit files , the visualization of these hits , and the reconstruction of the event through coupling to the muonbox program  @xcite . \n the three - dimensional view of complex events is used to understand complex events and debug the reconstruction algorithms . \n figure  [ evd ] shows a display of a monte carlo event in the atlas muon spectrometer in the context of a high background environment . \n such events are generated with the geant3-based dice simulation  @xcite . \n all hits and activated muon chambers are displayed . \n the reconstructed track is displayed in blue . \n visual inspection confirms the efficiency of the reconstruction algorithm in terms of pattern recognition and fitting . \n the projective views allows to further examine the events , though it is necessary to restrict the investigation to a limited region of the apparatus . zooming on detectors \n is performed to very carefully check the event properties and reconstruction consistency , as illustrated in figure  [ evddcbil ] .        in figure \n [ evd ] one notes the interactive reconstruction and event display interface opened on top of the navigator . \n this interface is equipped with an ensemble of push - buttons to set the visual properties of the displayed event and to activate the reconstruction . \n a separate embedded window is used to display the statistics of the event . \n the statistics consist essentially in the number of hits of the event , the number of hits taken into account in the candidate tracks , the reconstructed momentum , and if required from the datacards in case of physics channels analysis , the reconstructed invariant mass . \n the interfacing between persint and muonbox makes it possible to act interactively on the event characteristics to understand which role they play . \n for instance , a hit tube or a strip can be removed interactively from the event . \n then , when re - running the reconstruction algorithms , this removed tube will not be taken into account . \n the persint evd was used in the design and optimization phase of the muon spectrometer , participating in the performance studies of the apparatus and reconstruction software  @xcite . \n it then contributed in refining the performances of this software on complex monte carlo physics channels  @xcite . \n the program is used in the context of muon testbeams to display events on either online of offline mode  @xcite . \n event displays are useful to testbeams in order to validate the commissioning of the entire chain of detectors and data acquisition . \n when data is recorded in a routine mode , the evd participate in the online monitoring and the quality control of the dataflow . \n an example of testbeam event is shown in figure  [ tb ] . \n it consists in a staight muon track reconstructed in the barrel stand of the h8 2002 muon system tests  @xcite . \n chambers misalignment is corrected using conditions alignment data . \n powerful graphics tool are necessary to develop and debug the geometrical descriptions of the complex hep detectors . \n not only 3d viewers and projective capabilities must be used , but also the possibility to automatically detect geometrical conflicts . \n an essential feature of geometry visualization programs is to be able to delineate precisely the volume edges . \n this is of primary importance in order to clearly identify the volumes boundaries in space and their possible interferences . \n such visual property offers a much better understanding and comprehension of the detector geometry to the end user . \n modern geometrical description in hep makes extensive use of boolean volume operations , which greatly simplifies the task of describing complicated geometries . \n visualization tools must therefore support such technology . \n the persint program is interfaced to the two detector description used for the atlas muon spectrometer : agdd - xml and amdb . \n the atlas generic detector description is based on standardized xml files . \n such a description is used to describe the muon spectrometer geometry  @xcite . \n this description is implemented in the reconstruction algorithm . \n the persint program benefits from an xml parser to interpret the corresponding geometrical description . \n the working of the interface to agdd is based on the representation of a fully clickable tree - like structure allowing selection of the desired volumes for display . \n an operating example is given in figure  [ xml ] , showing both the xml structure and the corresponding volumes , in this case one of the atlas endcap toroid . \n the interface offers the representation of the volume tree in its full depth . \n the user can deploy or hide sub - structures by clicking volume tree pointers appearing as arrows . \n conveniently , geometries can be visualized in parallel as they are being developped . after a possible modification , clicking on a a dedicated push button of the navigator \n ( see figure  [ nav ] ) results in the reloading of the database . \n the atlas muon database is an object - oriented database for simulation and reconstruction  . \n it is extensively used in the detectors and physics performance studies conducted since the origin of atlas  @xcite . in particular , it is used synchroneously by the dice geant3 simulation of the experiment  @xcite and the muon reconstruction program muonbox  @xcite . \n this database is heavily used to study the ongoing changes to the spectrometer layout  @xcite . \n such changes are caused by the need to take into account integration and access constraints . \n also , the possible staging of atlas will lead to multiple geometrical configuration , to be optimized by simulation . in this context of evolving geometries \n , persint provides a tool to carefully scrutinize and validate the geometrical databases . \n one of the important capabilities of persint is to detect and highlight intersecting or clashing volumes . \n an illustration is given in figure  [ clash ] , where a conflict between a muon chamber and the feet of the detector is observed . \n persint offers the rare feature of being able to compute fully and display volumes resulting from boolean operations . \n being given two initial supervolumes ( a supervolume is an ensemble of volumes ) , the program is able to perform the three basic operations ( addition , subtraction , intersection ) to generate a new supervolume . \n this facility is independent of the complexity of the initial objects . \n an example is shown in figure  [ labelvouss ] , which illustrates how the program can generate the voussoirs of the barrel toroid .        using this feature of persint , it is possible to generate complex - shaped volumes from very basic objects . \n the program provides , through the command mode , a set of instructions allowing to generate basic volumes and to perform boolean operations . \n the persint program is interfaced to a variety of application . \n they are all accessed through the navigator ( see figure  [ nav ] ) . \n the level 1 interface is the application allowing the interactive access to the level-1 muon trigger configuration datafiles and the visual representation of the variety of objects involved in the trigger decision chain . \n this interface is extensively described in  @xcite . \n the magnetic field interface provides a fully interactive 3d visualization of the magnetic field and the magnet elements . \n this application is coupled to the bfielddtb set of subroutines that read the field database and compute the field at any given point  . \n the field is visualized by means of arrows located at a series of lattice points . \n an example is shown in figure  [ magfield ] . \n the direction and length of the arrow correspond to the direction and magnitude of the b - field . \n the lattice , either 2d or 3d , is customized by the user in terms of mesh and spatial limits , allowing to build the vector field either in very localized regions or over large distances . \n the muon tracks interface is used to generate and compute tracks of muons throughout the entire detector system . \n it is coupled to muonbox , to the detector description and the magnetic field database , in order to compute the track s trajectory , taking into account the deflections in the field , the multiple scattering , and the energy loss in matter . \n performances are difficult to estimate , as the visualization programs have too face many possible situations in terms of user demand , and number of volumes to display . \n a test is performed here as follows : the display and navigation capability is estimated on a 2.8 ghz pentium 4 . \n it requires 0.65 s to compute and display the 2300 voulumes with 15000 facets of the muon precision chambers system . \n the real - time displacements are fluid ( @xmath3  10 views per second ) for a number of volumes @xmath4  400 . \n an event scan on testbeam data provides another performance measurement . in the exercise \n consisting in the display of events in loop with 6 chambers and typically 20 hits , it needs 0.02 s / event for bare evd . \n this an order of magnitude less than the time needed to reconstruct the event : 0.20 s / event . \n the present design of the program has strong advantages . \n the user can download a single executable binary files . \n no special dynamic library loading , no fancy apis need to be installed . the program is efficient even if operated remotely , e.g. on remote clusters from a x - terminal .    on the other side , \n the program has shortcomings . \n it uses a limited graphics interface ( 256 colors in the current version of higz , possibly extended to 1024 ) . \n it does not profit from the high performance capabilities of graphics cards when operated locally on pcs ( z - buffer ) .    in the developments under consideration , a migration to opengl is envisaged . however some of the features of the present design would be lost . \n for example , such technology based on z - buffer does nt allow to delineate the volume edges . \n this property is crucial for hep detectors . \n it is considered to integrate parts of persint in the root data analysis framework . \n the graphics capabilities of root would be enhanced by using the calculus of hidden faces and intersecting volumes . in parallel , the integration of persint in the athena atlas software framework for reconstruction and analysis can be studied . \n the utilization of persint will continue as an event and geometry display for the atlas experiment . \n it will be used as online evd in the h8 - 2003 muon testbeam , and in the h8 - 2004 atlas combined testbeam . \n it will have an important role to play in the commissioning of atlas , participating in the debug of the detector ( cosmics run , calibration runs , ... ) . \n finally it is a candidate for the atlas online evd for monitoring of data - taking . \n higz high level interface to graphics and zebra user s guide , cern program library long writeups * q120 * , application software group , computing and networks division , cern , geneva , switzerland , june 1995 .", "StartTimeOffset": 473422549601, "RequestID": "8a17c0c657734a0c9e33afb6deee2b74", "TotalTokens": 4286}

out chain was tested using the final components . as part of the integration test , \n the alice daq and trigger system were for the first time used for more than one sub - detector system . \n furthermore , beam test data is used for code validation of the alice software framework aliroot @xcite . \n particle tracking in alice is currently based on geant3 @xcite . the energy deposited by geant \n is transformed into the number of electron - hole pairs ( 3.6 ev/(e , h ) ) and then compared with a threshold . \n threshold fluctuations and noise are taken into account pixel by pixel . \n charge sharing is simulated assuming gaussian diffusion of e / h -

of - freedom , which are supposed to emerge as effective particles after spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd  @xcite , are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons . \n the latter are realized by the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons . \n they provide a hyperfine interaction between the constituent quarks on top of a confining linear potential . in refs . \n @xcite goldstone - boson exchange between the quarks has been treated within an instantaneous approximation with the consequence that baryon excitations come out as stable bound states rather than resonances with a finite life time . \n a possible way towards overcoming this problem is to take the dynamics of the goldstone bosons explicitly into account  @xcite . \n this will not only change the baryon mass spectrum , but it will also affect the electroweak structure of the baryons . the physical picture of baryons that emerges from a constituent - quark model with instantaneous confinement and dynamical goldstone - boson exchange between the constituent quarks is that of a three - quark core which is surrounded by a pseudoscalar meson cloud . \n this kind of picture is also supported by a recent calculation of electromagnetic nucleon form factors performed within the bethe - salpeter - dyson - schwinger framework  @xcite . \n the author found clear signals of missing pion - cloud effects  in the low-@xmath0 region . in the following \n we will report on our attempt to estimate the pion - cloud contribution to the nucleon form factors within the framework of a ( generalized ) constituent - quark model . \n according to our introductory remarks , we consider a nucleon as a system of three constituent quarks which can emit and absorb pions and interact via an instantaneous confinement potential . \n we make use of the point - form of relativistic quantum mechanics in connection with the bakamjian - thomas construction to formulate electron - nucleon scattering in a poincar - invariant way  @xcite . following the strategy of refs . \n @xcite we then calculate the invariant @xmath1-exchange amplitude , extract the electromagnetic nucleon current , analyze the covariant structure of the current and identify the electromagnetic nucleon form factors .    in the point - form of relativistic dynamics , \n all four components of the momentum operator become interaction dependent , whereas the generators of lorentz transformations stay free of interactions . as a consequence , \n one has simple rotation and boost properties of wave functions and angular - momentum addition works like in non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite . \n thanks to the bakamjian - thomas construction , the overall motion of the system can be neatly separated from the internal motion : @xmath2 i.e. the 4-momentum operator factorizes into an interaction -

stoichiometry . \n good charge collection requires a high carrier drift length , which typically occurs in high quality defect free material , and so the high performance of nasbs@xmath0 as a solar absorber is surprising . \n however , several soft lattice solar materials have been discovered , most notably ch@xmath4nh@xmath4pbi@xmath4 , @xcite where defects do not seem to play the same detrimental role as in more traditional materials such as cdte . \n @xcite here we report first principles calculations aimed at understanding the properties of this compound , especially in relation to its use as a solar absorber . \n the present calculations were performed within density functional theory ( dft ) . \n the electronic structure and optical properties were calculated using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , @xcite as implemented in the wien2k code . \n @xcite the total energy calculations and relaxation of the atomic coordinates was done using the perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . \n @xcite for this , relativity was treated at a scalar relativistic level for the valence states . \n the core states were treated relativistically . \n lapw sphere radii of @xmath5=2.2 bohr were used for all elements , along with a planewave sector basis cutoff determined by , @xmath6=9 ( here @xmath5 is the radius of the smallest lapw sphere , i.e. 2.2 bohr , and @xmath7 is the planewave cutoff ) . \n local orbitals were added to the basis for the s @xmath8 , na @xmath8 and @xmath2 , and sb @xmath9 semicore states . \n spin - orbit was included for the electronic and optical properties . \n the band gap is important for these , and accordingly these calculations were done using the modified becke - johnson ( mbj ) potential of tran and blaha . \n @xcite this functional gives band gaps in good accord with experiment for a wide variety of simple semiconductors and insulators and also appears to give reliable band shapes and optical properties , although at least in certain semiconductors the band masses are more similar to those obtained in standard density functional calculations than those from many body calculations . \n @xcite calculation of the transport function for conductivity was done using the boltztrap code . \n @xcite optical properties were calculated based on electric dipole transitions in the independent particle approximation as implemented in the wien2k code . the born effective charges and the dielectric tensor \n were calculated using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) with the pbe functional as implemented in the vasp code @xcite ( note that calculation of the dielectric tensor can not be done with the mbj potential , since it is not an energy functional and therefore can not be used to evaluate lattice response ) . \n the structure of nasbs@xmath0 has been refined into two different monoclinic groups , @xmath10 ( # 15 ) @xcite and @xmath11 ( # 12 ) . \n @xcite in addition there is a report of a triclinic structure @xmath12 ( # 2 ) . \n @xcite these are all centrosymmetric structures . \n the deviation from a cubic structure was discussed in terms of lone pair activity of sb \n we did calculations for the three reported structures , in each case using the lattice parameters from the diffraction experiments , and then relaxing the atomic positions subject to the spacegroup symmetry . \n we find that the energy for the @xmath11 structure is 0.127 ev per formula unit ( f.u . ) above the energy of the @xmath12 structure . \n the @xmath10 structure is 0.005 ev / f.u . \n higher than the @xmath12 structure . \n we did further calculations to address the issue of the ground state . specifically , we did full relaxations , including both lattice parameters , angles and internal coordinates . for this purpose \n we used the vasp code with three different density functionals , specifically the local density approximation ( lda ) , the pbe gga @xcite and the pbesol gga . \n @xcite we further did full relaxations of both the @xmath10 and the @xmath12 structures using vasp with lda , pbe , and pbesol @xcite functionals . \n these functionals differ in equilibrium volumes for solids . \n generally , at increased volume lattices tend to distort more strongly , as was noted in the case of pbtio@xmath4 , an oxide ferroelectric with a ground state particularly sensitive to volume . \n @xcite we find that the lda underestimates the unit cell volume of nasbs@xmath0 , yielding 175 @xmath13 , in comparison with the experimental volume of 192 @xmath13 at 300 k. the pbe functional yields 197 @xmath13 , while pbesol yields 184 @xmath13 . \n the lda predicts a monoclinic ground state , while the fully relaxed triclinic structure is @xmath14 2 mev / atom lower in energy for both pbe and pbesol . considering the very small energy , and the limitations of dft calculations \n we conclude that the ground state is monoclinic @xmath10 or possibly @xmath12 with an extremely small triclinic distortion from this monoclinic structure . \n the other monoclinic structure , @xmath11 , is , however , clearly not a feasible structure .    , showing s as large red spheres , sb as gold and na as blue . \n the left panel shows the layering , while the right panel shows a single layer ( note that there are two layers with opposite orientation of the s -

{"ContextTokens": 3471, "GeneratedTokens": 84, "SynthesizedBody": "oscillators directly generating femtosecond pulses with energy exceeding 100 nj are of interest for numerous applications including frequency conversion , metrology , micro - machining , etc . nowadays \n oscillators operating at mhz - repetition rates have reached the micro - joule pulse energy frontier without an extra - resonator amplification . \n an ingenious idea allowing such an advance is the pulse stretching , that suppresses the instabilities inherent to the high - peak - power oscillators @xcite . \n since the pulse is soliton in the negative group - delay - dispersion ( gdd ) regime , its stretching is linearly irreversible . \n the issue of pulse compressibility can be solved by a chirped - pulse oscillator ( cpo ) providing : i ) sufficient pulse stretching ( few picoseconds ) , ii ) broad spectrum ( more than 100 nm ) , and iii ) pulse compressibility down to few tens of femtoseconds @xcite . \n the remaining issue is that a high - energy oscillator ( including cpo ) is stable only within a confined region of gdd and pulse energy . \n the existing theory @xcite predicts that some minimum positive gdd is required for the cpo stabilization against the cw - amplification and this `` threshold '' gdd increases with the energy . \n it was found , that the gain saturation is a key factor determining the oscillator stability . \n however , the existing models do not take into account the gain dynamics and , thereby , some substantial features of the regime remain unexplored . \n for instance , it is unclear why the region of gdd and energy , where a single stable pulse exists , is confined @xcite .    here , for the first time to our knowledge , \n the theory of cpo taking into account the gain dynamics will be presented . \n as it will be shown , the gain dynamics provides an explanation for the confinement of the pulse stability region . \n the model demonstrates an existence of two main mechanisms of pulse destabilization : the satellite rise in front of the pulse and the cw - amplification . \n the cpo conception is based on the pulse energy ( @xmath0 ) scaling with the scaling of resonator period ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the averaged power ) . \n since the pulse peak power ( @xmath4 ) scales with the energy : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the pulse width ) , one has to stretch the pulse ( i.e. , to increase @xmath6 ) in order to reduce @xmath4 and , thereby , suppress the instabilities causing by the nonlinear effects inside a resonator ( e.g. , the self - focusing inside an active medium ) . \n however , in the solitonic regime ( i.e. , when the gdd is negative ) , such a stretching is linearly irreversible . \n this means that the femtosecond high - energy pulse can be produced by only nonlinear compression , which worsens its characteristics ( e.g. , enhances the noise ) . in the cpo \n , the picosecond pulse has an extremely wide spectrum due to large chirp . as a result , \n the pulse is linearly compressible down to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the pulse spectrum width ) . \n the experiments demonstrate that such a regime is very stable and reproducible @xcite . \n the pulse stability in the cpo can be explained by the combined action of two mechanisms : a pure phase mechanism and a frequency - dissipative one . \n the first mechanism is the balance of phase contributions from the pulse envelope @xmath9 : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the gdd coefficient , @xmath12 is the local time ranging from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) and the time - dependent phase @xmath15 : @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite . such a balance is possible if the pulse is chirped . however , a pure phase balance is not sufficient for pulse stabilization as the pulse spreads , i.e. some dissipative effects are required to form a quasi - soliton . \n the pulse lengthening due to gdd can be compensated by its shortening owing to frequency filtering if the pulse is chirped @xcite . \n the chirp results in frequency deviation at the pulse front and tail , and the filter cuts off the high- and low - frequency wings of the pulse , thus the pulse shortens .    the cpo can be described on the basis of the distributed generalized complex cubic - quintic nonlinear ginzburg - landau model @xcite :    @xmath17 + \\left [ { \\left ( { \\kappa   - i\\gamma } \\right)p(z , t ) - \\kappa \\zeta p(z , t)^2 } \\right]a(z , t).\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 is the propagation distance normalized to the cavity length ( i.e. , the cavity round - trip number , in fact ) . \n @xmath19 is the instant power , @xmath20 is the square of the inverse spectral filter bandwidth . \n the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the self - phase and self - amplitude modulation coefficients , respectively . \n parameter @xmath23 describes saturation of the self - amplitude modulation . in a broadband solid - state oscillator , for example \n , parameter @xmath20 is the square of the inverse gain band width multiplied by the saturated gain coefficient . \n parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by the kerr - lens mode locking mechanism @xcite .    the @xmath24-parameter is the spectrally independent saturable net - loss coefficient , which depends on the instant pulse energy @xmath25 . \n below , such a dependence will be referred as the dynamic gain saturation . \n it was found @xcite , that a heavily - chirped pulse in cpo can be described as the soliton - like solution of eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) in the limit of time - independent @xmath24 . in this case , the simplest energy - dependence of the @xmath24-parameter is @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . \n the spectrum of the chirped soliton - like pulse has a lorentz profile truncated at some frequency @xmath30 , where the central frequency @xmath310 corresponds to the cpo carrier frequency @xcite . \n the chirped soliton - like pulse is stable within the region of its existence , i.e. within the region of @xmath32 @xcite . \n positivity of @xmath24 , i.e. stability against the cw - amplification ( vacuum stability ) , can be provided by a certain minimum positive gdd growing with energy . \n nevertheless , the existing theory does not take into account the time dependence of @xmath24 provided by the dynamic gain saturation . \n let us consider some numerical estimations . \n the gain saturation fluency for a ti : sapphire oscillator is @xmath330.8 j/@xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the emission cross - section , @xmath36 is the emission frequency , @xmath37 is the planck s constant ) . \n then , the gain variation due to gain saturation per one resonator round - trip is @xmath380.2 ( @xmath391 ps , the mode area @xmath40 equals to 130 @xmath41m@xmath42 , @xmath43200 nj ; and the peak power is close to the stability limit , which is defined by the self - phase modulation coefficient @xmath444.5 mw@xmath45 ) . that is the gain variation per one cavity round - trip \n is not negligible unlike that in a low - energy femtosecond oscillator operating in the solitonic regime . \n below , the extended theory of cpo taking into account the dynamic gain saturation will be considered . \n the cubic nonlinear limit of eq . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) admits the chirped soliton - like solution @xcite : @xmath46^{1 + i\\psi } \\exp \\left [ { i\\omega \\left ( { t - \\upsilon z } \\right ) } + i\\phi z   \\right],\\ ] ] which is frequency ( @xmath47)- and phase ( @xmath48)-shifted and time - delayed ( @xmath49 ) in the presence of the dynamic gain saturation ( @xmath50 is the dimensionless chirp ) :    @xmath51    the pulse parameters are :    @xmath52    in eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) \n @xmath53 is the net - loss coefficient , @xmath54 is the gain at the pulse peak taking into account its time - delay with propagation , @xmath55 . \n one can see a clear manifestation of the dynamic gain saturation : the time - delay and the frequency shift appear . \n [ f1 ] shows the gdd - dependence of the chirp parameter @xmath50 for two fixed @xmath22 . \n one can see , that the chirp ( @xmath56 ) increases with gdd and its value is sufficiently large to provide an efficient compression ( the pulse width after compression is @xmath57 ) . \n growth of the self - amplitude modulation decreases @xmath56 due to reduction of the relative contribution of the self - phase modulation in comparison with the self - amplitude modulation .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     on the other hand , both gdd and pump decrease destabilizes the pulse , as well ( @xmath58 in figs . \n [ f3],[f4],[f6 ] ) . \n the destabilizing mechanism is an appearance of satellite in front of the pulse ( dashed curve in figs . \n [ f3 ] ) . as a result of the dynamic gain saturation , the energy transfer from the pulse to satellite destabilizes the cpo . \n to determine the operational range of cpo in terms of dispersion and energy variations , an effect of the dynamic gain saturation on the cpo stability has been studied numerically for the first time to our knowledge . \n it has been found , that the dynamic gain saturation has a strong impact on a cpo dynamics in contrast to a low - energy (  10 nj ) mode - locked solid - state oscillator . \n first , there is some minimum positive net - gdd providing the oscillator stabilization . below this value \n the pulse is destroyed by excitation of the satellite before the pulse . \n such a satellite is clearly visible in the experiment and can co - exist stably with the pulse within some narrow gdd - range . \n second , there is some maximum gdd and its excess fragments the pulse front owing to the cw - amplification . \n third , the highest pulse energy at a given repetition rate is limited because the maximum and minimum gdds stabilizing the pulse merge . \n the work was supported by the austrian national science fund ( fonds zur frderung der wissentschaftlichen forschung ( fwf ) , projects no . \n p20293 and p17973 ) and by the max - planck gesellschaft ( institut fr quantenoptik ) . \n a.apolonski ( department fr physik der ludwig - maximilians - universitt mnchen ) is gratefully acknowledged for active discussions and providing the experimental data concerning the high - energy ti : sapphire cpos . \n s. h. cho , b. e. bouma , e. p. ippen , j. g. fujimoto , `` low - repetition - rate high - peak - power kerr - lens mode - locked tial@xmath59o@xmath60 laser with a multiple - pass cavity , '' _ opt . \n * 24 * , pp . 417419 , 1999 . \n a. fernandez , t. fuji , a. poppe , a. frbach , f. krausz , a. apolonski , `` chirped - pulse oscillators : a route to high - power femtosecond pulses without external amplification , '' _ opt . \n lett . _ * 29 * , pp . 13661368 , 2004 . v. l.kalashnikov , e. podivilov , a. chernykh , s. naumov , a. fernandez , r. graf , a. apolonski , `` approaching the microjoule frontier with femtosecond laser oscillators : theory and comparison with experiment , '' * new j. phys . * * 7 * , p. 217 \n v. l. kalashnikov , e. podivilov , a. chernykh , a. apolonski , `` chirped - pulse oscillators : theory and experiment , '' _ appl . \n _ b * 83 * , pp . 503510 , 2006 . \n a. fernndez , a. apolonski , _ \n private communication_. v. l. kalashnikov , a. fernndez , a. apolonski , `` high - order dispersion in chirped - pulse oscillators , '' _ optics express _ , pp . 42064216 , 2008 . h. a. haus , j. g. fujimoto , e. p. ippen , `` structures for additive pulse mode locking , '' _ j. opt \n . soc . am . \n b _ * 8 * , pp . 20682076 , 1991 . b. proctor , e. westwig , f. wise , `` characterization of a kerr - lens mode - locked ti : sapphire laser with positive group - velocity dispersion , '' _ opt . \n * 18 * , pp . 16541656 , 1993 . n. n. akhmediev , a. ankiewicz , _ solitons : nonlinear pulses and beams _ , chapman & hall , london , 1997 . v. l. kalashnikov , i. g. poloyko , v. p. mikhailov , d. von der linde , `` dynamical gain saturation in kerr - lens mde - locked cw solid - state lasers , '' _ optical and quantum electronics _ * 31 * , pp . 369365 , 1999 . v. l. kalashnikov , v. p. kalosha , v. p. mikhailov , i. g. poloyko , `` self - mode locking of four - mirror - cavity solid - state lasers by kerr self - focusing , '' _ j. opt . \n b _ * 12 * , pp . \n 462467 , 1995 .", "StartTimeOffset": 537145785900, "RequestID": "d858733086bf44e984063edbcafd2fba", "TotalTokens": 3555}

the connection between axps and sgrs is intriguing but not yet clear . \n the results here summarize those reported by gavriil & kaspi ( 2001 ) . \n the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) . \n our observations consist primarily of short snapshots taken on a monthly basis . \n in addition , we used a handful of archival observations ; the exposures in these observations vary . \n phase - coherent timing of axps has shown that the rotational stability of some axps is comparable to those of some radio pulsars . \n the rotational stability of 1e  2259.1 + 586 , first reported by kaspi , chakrabarty , & steinberger ( 1999 ) , has now persisted over 4.5  yr , although the inclusion of @xmath5 has recently been necessary . \n 4u  0142 + 61  has been an extremely stable rotator over 4.4  yr of _ rxte _ monitoring . for rxs \n j170849.0400910 , phase coherent timing has been accomplished in the 1.4  yr since the glitch reported by kaspi , lackey , & chakrabarty ( 2000 ) . in these data , \n we find a significant positive @xmath5 . \n this indicates a decay of the negative @xmath0 , expected for long - term glitch recovery , as seen in glitching radio pulsars ( e.g. shemar & lyne 1996 ) . \n 1e  1841045  shows rotational stability but with considerably higher red noise ( see gotthelf et al . \n , this volume ) . \n 1e  1048.15937  has exhibited far noisier behavior , making phase - coherent timing using monthly and weekly observations virtually impossible . \n interestingly there is a correlation between timing stability and @xmath0 : the sources with the smallest @xmath0 are the most stable . \n arrival time residuals for 1e  2259.1 + 586 , 4u  0142 + 61  and rxs  j170849.0400910  are shown in figure  [ fig : res ] . \n axp spectra are generally best fit by a two - component model consisting of a photoelectrically absorbed blackbody with a hard power - law tail ( israel et al . \n whether these two components are physically distinct is an open question ( see zel , psaltis , & kaspi 2001 ) . to investigate this \n , we compared the pulse profile morphology of the axps in two energy bands . figure  [ fig : energy ] displays the average pulse profiles of rxs  j170849.0400910 , 1e  2259.1 + 586   and 1e  1048.15937  in the energy bands 24  kev and 68  kev . from figure \n [ fig : energy ] it is clear that axp pulse profiles exhibit different degrees of energy dependence ; rxs  j170849.0400910  shows high energy dependence , while 1e  1048.15937  shows no energy dependence . \n we have also used our _ rxte _ data to monitor the pulsed flux of the axps as a function of time . \n rapid ( @xmath6 months ) flux variability would challenge the magnetar model and accreting sources generally show flux variability correlated with @xmath0 . \n given the large field - of - view of the pca and the low count rates for the sources relative to the background , total flux measurements are difficult with our _ rxte _ data . \n instead , we have determined the pulsed component of the flux , by using the off - pulse emission as a background estimator . \n the flux time series for 1e  2259.1 + 586 , 4u  0142 + 61  and rxs  j170849.0400910 are displayed in figure  [ fig : flux ] . \n we do not find evidence for any large variability in the pulsed flux for any source , and have set @xmath7 upper limits on variations @xmath12030% ( depending on the source ) . \n this is surprising given previous reports of large ( factor of 510 ) total flux variations in 1e  2259.1 + 586  and 4u  0142 + 61  ( baykal & swank 1996 ; oosterbroek et al . 1998 ) . \n assuming a constant pulsed fraction , this suggests that more than one of the axps happen to be much more quiescent during the _ rxte _ monitoring than in the past . \n iwasawa , koyama , & halpern ( 1992 ) reported a significant change in the pulse morphology of 1e  2259.1 + 586  in 1.214  kev _ ginga _ observations obtained in 1990 , such that the leading pulse had amplitude roughly half that of the trailing pulse . \n if correct , this has important implications for the magnetar model , which predicts such pulse morphology changes in the event of a restructuring of the magnetic field , as might occur following a major sgr - like outburst . \n motivated by this finding , we searched for pulse profile changes in our _ rxte _ observations of all the axps . \n we have not detected any large pulse profile variations . \n this justifies our other analysis procedures which assume a fixed profile . \n we rule out variations in features having amplitude @xmath820% of the peak amplitude at the @xmath7 level , although the limit depends on source and integration time . \n baykal , a. & swank , j. 1996 , apj , 460 , 470 cordes , j.  m. & helfand , d.  j. 1980 , apj , 239 , 640 gavriil , f.  p. & kaspi , v.  m. 2001 , apj , in press , http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0107422 gotthelf , e.  v. , gavriil , f. , kaspi , v.  m. , vasisht , g. , & chakrabarty , d. 2001 , this volume israel , g. , mereghetti , s. , & stella , l. 2002 ( memorie della societa astronomica italiana ) , in press israel , g.  l. , oosterbroek , t. , angelini , l. , campana , s. , mereghetti , s. , parmar , a.  n. , segreto , a. , stella , l. , van paradijs , j. , & white , n.  e. 1999 , a&a , 346 , 929 iwasawa , k. , koyama , k. , & halpern , j.  p. 1992 \n , pasj , 44 , 9 kaspi , v.  m. , chakrabarty , d. , & steinberger , j. 1999 , apj , 525 , l33 kaspi , v.  m. , lackey , j.  r. , & chakrabarty , d. 2000 , apj , 537 , l31 kouveliotou , c. , dieters , s. , strohmayer , t. , van paradijs , j. , fishman , g.  j. , meegan , c.  a. , hurley , k. , kommers , j. , smith , i. , frail , d. , & murakami , t. 1998 , nature , 393 , 235 oosterbroek , t. , parmar , a.  n. , mereghetti , s. , & israel , g.  l. 1998 , a&a , 334 , 925 zel , f. , psaltis , d. , & kaspi , v.  m. 2001 , apj , in press , http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0105372 shemar , s.  l. & lyne , a.  g. 1996 , mnras , 282 , 677", "StartTimeOffset": 544718020695, "RequestID": "fbb06b9b81dd4b9bb287ede199f77404", "TotalTokens": 2679}

continuous coverage of the spectral shape of extragalactic vhe emitters over more than 4 decades of energy . \n the large majority of extragalactic tev emitting objects are blazars , radio - loud active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet closely oriented toward the earth , as described in @xcite . here \n , we discuss a method , recently published in @xcite , to derive an upper limit on the redshift of a blazar , based on the comparison between the spectral index at gev energies as measured by lat ( unaffected by the cosmological absorption up to redshifts far beyond those of interest here ) and the tev spectrum corrected for the absorption . \n starting from the derived limits , we find a simple law relating these values to real redshift , which can be used to guess the distance of unknown redshift blazars . \n we assume a cosmological scenario with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n the photon flux emitted by a blazar in both gev and tev regimes can be well approximated by power laws , of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the power - law index . at vhe , \n the photons of the spectrum interact with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , via electron - positron pair creation . \n quantitatively , the effect is an exponential attenuation of the flux by a factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical depth , a function of both photon energy and source redshift . \n thus , the observed differential energy spectrum from a blazar , @xmath12 , is related to the emitted one , @xmath13 , according to @xmath14 .    in order to estimate a safe upper limit to the source distance \n , we can reasonably assume that the intrinsic spectrum at tev energies can not be harder than that in the adjacent gev band . \n indeed , from the brightest objects studied at both gev and tev energies it appears that the sed is continuous , with a broad peak not requiring additional spectral components @xcite . \n hence , a natural assumption is to require that the slope measured in the gev energy range is a limit value for the power - law index of the de - absorbed tev spectrum .    for the study \n , we consider the blazar sample listed in table  [ table_values ] and containing all the extragalactic tev emitters located at redshift larger than @xmath15 , detected by lat after taking 5.5 months of data @xcite . in order to estimate the redshift @xmath0 for which the tev spectral slope equals to the gev one \n , the measured spectral points of each source have been corrected for the corresponding absorption factor @xcite , starting from redshift @xmath15 , and the resulting spectrum fitted with a power law . \n the procedure , applied in fine steps of redshift , is iterated until the slope of the de - absorbed spectrum equals to the one measured by lat . \n the corresponding redshift , @xmath0 , reported in table  [ table_values ] , is the limit value on the source distance .    among the 16 sources considered in this study , \n 14 blazars have well -

[ fig_tc10 ] . \n the straight line fit from figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] and  [ fig_lilj1 ] comes in as second lowest . \n the lowest curve corresponds to eq . \n ( [ rijas ] ) and the upper curve to dividing the @xmath29 fit of column six of table  [ tab_as ] by the @xmath40 fit of the same column . \n as suspected this curve looks rather fanciful . \n however , using a log scale for the abscissa would stretch the range on the left , and one should have in mind that the absolute differences between all three fits are quite small . \n systematic errors at @xmath50 can be read off on the right - hand side of the figure and are seen to be less than  4% . \n we have studied the approach of su(2 ) lgt to its quantum continuum limit by investigating the scaling behavior of a number of length scales with definitions based on the deconfinement phase transition , the gradient flow and the cooling flow . while the deconfining scale @xmath51 is uniquely defined ( [ ntau ] ) , one has considerable freedom in the definition of gradient and cooling flow scales . \n they depend on the choice of observables and target values of the flow . \n we considered :    1 . \n energy densities @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 defined by eqs . \n ( [ e0 ] , [ e1 ] , [ e4 ] ) . \n @xmath52 is up to normalization the wilson action and @xmath53 in essence an equivalent definition . \n @xmath54 , introduced in @xcite , averages over four plaquettes . \n target values @xmath55 and @xmath56 , ( @xmath57 ) are defined by eqs . \n ( [ yi01 ] , [ yi02 ] , [ cyi01 ] , [ cyi02 ] ) . \n they are constructed so that the initial scaling behavior of either the gradient or the cooling flow of either @xmath52 , @xmath53 or @xmath54 matches that of the deconfinement length @xmath17 ( altogether @xmath58 distinct definitions ) .    for ratios of these length scales , corrections to scaling are supposed to be of order @xmath59 in the lattice spacing as illustrated in figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] , [ fig_lilj1 ] , [ fig_lilj2 ] , [ fig_scaling2 ] and  [ fig_tc10 ] . in these figures \n the cooling length scale @xmath40 , which relies on the @xmath52 energy density and a @xmath60 target value ( [ cyi02 ] ) , is used as reference scale by the following reasons :    1 .   scaling violations of ratios of scales \n are then rather symmetrically distributed above and below  1 . \n @xmath52 is easier to calculate than @xmath54 and estimates from the same statistics result in smaller error bars for the @xmath52 length scale . \n no scaling advantages were found for @xmath54 scales . \n @xmath53 is essentially equivalent to @xmath52 with the benefit for @xmath52 that the wilson action is implemented in the program anyhow . \n the cooling flow is faster and easier to calculate than the gradient flow and there is no noticeable loss of accuracy as anticipated in ref . \n as the cooling method @xcite was an answer to difficulties encountered when trying to calculate the topological charge in a paper by lscher and one of the authors @xcite , it appears that the cooling scale could have been introduced 30 years before the gradient scale @xcite . \n the magnitude of scaling violations we find for ratios of length scales is close to that reported in ref . \n @xcite for su(3 ) when comparing the @xmath52 with the @xmath54 flow . \n the su(2 ) scaling region begins at @xmath61 where we find corrections to scaling in the 10% range . \n deeper in the scaling region , at @xmath62 , they become reduced to slightly less than  5% .    scaling corrections for the ratio @xmath63 fall into the range provided by the other scales as is seen in figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] and  [ fig_lilj1 ] . \n the significant advantage of the gradient scale , and to an even greater extent the cooling scale , over the deconfinement scale is that we can far more easily follow the scaling behavior towards the continuum limit . on the other hand , \n there are no ambiguities in the definition of the deconfinement scale , which makes it kind of ideal to define initial scaling values as discussed in sections  [ sec_grad ] and  [ sec_cool ] . \n we have used two rather different approaches for analyzing our data . for figs . \n [ fig_lilj ] to  [ fig_lilj2 ] we simply calculate @xmath64 from jackknife bins of the data and perform the linear 2-parameter fit ( [ rij ] ) using the @xmath31 dependence @xmath43 from the same data . \n while this is straightforward , one does not connect with the asymptotic @xmath65 scale .    to connect with asymptotic scaling , we relied on truncated forms of eq . \n ( [ fas ] ) based on ref \n .  @xcite . \n the normalization constants of our asymptotic scaling fits are collected in table  [ tab_as ] . \n a common fixed parameter ensures that scaling corrections for ratios are  @xmath31 . \n systematic errors due to distinct truncations of the fits are found around 10% . \n for the gradient and cooling scales the finally accepted fits of column six rely on three free parameters , one of them being the normalization constant that yields the continuum estimate . for @xmath29 four fit parameters \n are needed despite the fact that there are only five data points . comparing in fig . \n [ fig_tc10 ] the ratio of the @xmath29 and @xmath40 fit with direct fits of the @xmath66 ratios indicates overfitting , though @xmath29 data on larger lattices is needed to be conclusive . \n while the lattice spacing is exponentially small in @xmath25 , asymptotic scaling corrections come in powers of @xmath67 . \n as is seen in fig . \n [ fig_ascaling ] , they range at @xmath61 from 30% to 36% . \n the scales cluster together , so that the relative deviations at @xmath68 reproduce the previously encountered 10% range .    for ratio estimates \n it turns out that one should not divide the asymptotic scaling estimates by one another , but perform the fit ( [ rijas ] ) for the jackknifed @xmath69 ratios of the data , where the common fixed parameter is set to zero to enforce @xmath70 corrections . a decisive difference to the previous approach ( [ rij ] ) remains : the @xmath31 behavior is no longer enforced for our data at hand , but only in the continuum limit . \n indeed , some of the fits make use of this possibility . \n compare fig . \n [ fig_scaling2 ] with figs . \n [ fig_lilj1 ] and  [ fig_lilj2 ] . despite the differences in the approach to the continuum limit , \n the obtained curves look similar . \n the continuum limit estimates of our ratios are collected in tables  [ tab_rij ] and  [ tab_ratb ] using , respectively , ( [ rij ] ) and ( [ rijas ] ) . \n differences due to the distinct fit forms stay below 1.3% . \n this is in most cases larger than the statistical errors . \n the different fit forms allow one to get an idea of the systematic errors possible .    in conclusion \n , we hope that the methods outlined are also of some value for studying the approach of physically realistic theories like qcd to their continuum limits . \n though such data rely on large scale calculations on supercomputers , it is presumably safe to assume that their quality is not better than that of our su(2 ) data . \n david clarke was in part supported by the us department of energy ( doe ) under contract de - sc0010102 . \n our calculations used resources of the national energy

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see figure 1 ) . \n @xcite have recently presented high resolution spectra for ucsds , providing the first rotational velocity and accurate radial velocity measurements for these sources . \n the high @xmath5 = 65@xmath615  km / s of the l subdwarf 2mass  j0532 + 8246 @xcite suggests that the lowest mass halo stars may not lose their angular momentum as efficiently as more massive stars . \n they also find that one of the first l subdwarfs to be identified , lsr  1610 - 0040 @xcite , has mixed m dwarf and subdwarf spectral features , a conclusion also reached by @xcite on the basis of near - infrared spectroscopy . \n this source appears to be peculiar , even among the small number of ucsds now known . \n @xcite provides a compendium of 16 currently known ucsds , an increase of 60% since cool stars 13 . \n this increase has been driven by new proper motion search programs using red optical photographic plate surveys ( e.g. , superblink , @xcite ; and the supercosmos sky survey [ sss ] , @xcite ) and serendipitous discoveries in near - infrared catalogs such as 2mass . \n new discoveries include two ultracool extreme subdwarfs @xcite , tripling the number of known ultracool esdms ; and a new l subdwarf , sdss 1256 - 0224 , reported by @xcite . \n while red optical proper motion surveys have been successful , the spectral energy distributions of cooler ucsds peak around 1  @xmath4 ( a balance of reduced t@xmath0 and increased absorption by h@xmath3 ; see figure  1 ) , so near - infrared measurements become increasingly useful . \n indeed , the ukidss survey with its 1  @xmath4 @xmath7-band should be highly sensitive to ucsds @xcite . \n the recent inception of near - infrared proper motion surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ; j.  d.  kirkpatrick , 2007 , in prep . ) will likely expand the known ucsd population substantially in the near term . \n spectral types for ucsds are currently based on extrapolations of schemes developed for earlier - type m subdwarfs @xcite , based on tio and cah bands in the 62007300   region . \n these features become inadequate in the ucsd regime as tio and cah bands decline due to condensation ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; wide , pressure - broadened na  i and k  i lines suppress adjacent features @xcite ; and the sources themselves become exceedingly faint at optical wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite have suggested the use of the same red optical features used to classify l dwarfs as diagnostics for ucsd classification , and the direct comparison of l subdwarf spectra to l dwarf spectral standards ( see figure  2 ) . at near - infrared wavelengths , useful diagnostics are largely limited to the @xmath8-band region ( figure  1 ) , and work is progressing in this direction ( burgasser et al . , in prep . ) .    an issue to consider in the classification of ucsds \n is the division of metallicity classes . \n strong , blanketing molecular bands results in greater spectral sensitivity to metallicity and chemistry effects . \n the current population of ucsds may already span a fairly broad range of metallicities , as suggested by comparisons to atmospheric models ( * ? ? ? \n * see figure  2 above ) ; and the metallicities of early - type sdms may not ( and perhaps need not ) correspond to those of late - type sdms and sdls . in addition , even slightly metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath9 -0.5 ) `` mild '' ucsds are spectrally distinct ( figure  1 ) , and a `` d / sd '' designation for these objects has been suggested . \n this group would encompass slightly metal - poor t dwarfs , distinguished by depressed @xmath10-band peaks ( due to h@xmath3 absorption ) and enhanced @xmath7-band peaks ( possibly related to the red wing of the k  i doublet at 0.77  @xmath4 ; @xcite ) ; and several recent discoveries of so - called `` blue '' l dwarfs @xcite that may also be metal - poor . \n i briefly summarize other issues that have arisen in recent studies of ucsds . \n the interested reader is encouraged to examine the literature for further discussion .    _ \n dust formation : _ one of the defining properties of l field dwarfs is the formation of condensate dust in their photospheres , driving the depletion of gaseous tio , vo , cah , al  i , ca  i and ti  i in the photosphere @xcite . \n however , several late - type subdwarfs exhibit features from these species when it is absent in their dwarf counterparts ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see figure  2 above ) . \n their persistence suggests that condensate formation may be inhibited in metal - poor atmospheres ; chemical modeling of this effect is needed . \n _ spectral modeling : _ attempts to derive physical properties for ucsds based on spectral model fits have met with mixed results ( e.g.  @xcite ) . \n the difficulties stem from the same issues that arise when modeling ultracool dwarf spectra ; e.g. , complex molecular opacities , and chemistry and condensate grain formation . \n there are new concerted efforts to develop better metal - poor atmosphere models in the ucsd regime ( @xcite ; schweitzer , hauschildt & wawrzyn , these proceedings ) . _ \n binaries : _ binary systems are useful laboratories for studying detailed properties , testing formation theories and finding low temeprature sources as companions ( see splinter session overview by h.  bouy ) . there have been a couple of studies targeting m subdwarfs for companions ( * ?

ion recombination occurs through radiative recombination ( rr ) , dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , three - body recombination , and ct . \n line emission is due to rr , dr , ct , and electron impact excitation ( eie ) . \n bound - bound transitions due to photoabsorption can be important . \n free electrons are assumed to have a predominately maxwellian velocity distribution with a kinetic temperature @xmath1 determined by the balance between the processes of heating ( photoelectric , mechanical , cosmic ray , etc . ) and cooling ( predominantly inelastic collisions between electrons and other particles ) . \n together these various processes determine the ionization structure , the electron temperature , the level populations of excited states , and all emission and absorption features . \n the observed spectrum results from transport of radiation through the depth - dependent physical conditions . \n no analytical solutions are possible because of the intricacies , and large - scale numerical simulations must be performed instead .    interpreting the spectra of photoionized cosmic sources \n is carried out using spectral simulation codes such as cloudy ( ferland et al . \n 1998 ) , ion ( netzer 1996 ; kaspi et al . \n 2001 ) , nebu ( pquignot et al . \n 2001 ) and xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) . codes which have the capabilities of modeling stars with extended outflowing atmospheres ( i.e. , stellar winds ) have been written by hamann & koesterke ( 2000 ) , haser et al . \n ( 1998 ) , hillier & miller ( 1998 ) , short et al . \n ( 2001 ) , and others . \n fundamental to the reliability of these simulations and any inferred astrophysical conclusions is an accurate understanding of the underlying atomic physics which produces the observed spectra . in this overview \n we will briefly outline some of the most glaring atomic data needs which were presented at this conference . \n reliable atomic data are needed for nearly every atomic process involving the first 30 elements of the periodic table . \n the vast quantity of needed data is overwhelming . given the limited resources currently devoted worldwide to this task , it will likely take decades to produce all the needed data . here \n we attempt to identify high priority atomic data needs . in specific , our aim is to help researchers identify and address those uncertainties in our understanding of atomic physics which have the largest impact on our ability to address the fundamental questions in astrophysics .    the easiest selection criterion which can be used to prioritize the needed atomic data is for researchers to focus on the twelve most abundant elements , namely h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe . \n but even within this set of twelve , the amount of needed atomic data is still vast . to provide further guidance \n , we discuss below some of the specific atomic physics which needs to be better understood for astrophysics . \n our discussion focuses on those issues which were raised during the conference as being important for the understanding of photoionized plasmas . \n the review here is complementary to the recent article by ferland et al . \n ( 1998 ) which also discusses the atomic data needs for modeling photoionized plasmas . \n the importance in photoionized plasmas of ct on h and other atoms , as well as on h@xmath2 , has long been recognized ( e.g. , pquignot et al . \n 1978 ; pquignot & aldrovandi 1986 ) . at the relevant temperatures ( @xmath3  ev ) , ct on h is the dominant recombination mechanism for many one- to four - times charged ions in photoionized plasmas ( kingdon & ferland 1996 ) . \n surprisingly , modeling has also shown that ct on h of iron ions five - times charged and higher can significantly affect photoionized plasmas ( ferland et al . \n this may also hold for ions of other elements . \n total ct rates are needed for ionization balance calculations . \n state specific partial rates are needed for line emission predictions . \n most of the rates currently being used for plasma modeling have been calculated using a landau - zener ( lz ) approximation and are not expected to be reliable to better than a factor of @xmath4 , but the error may be even larger . \n recent laboratory measurements have shown lz calculations can be off by an order of magnitude ( thompson et al . \n much theoretical and experimental work is needed to provide reliable ct rates for modeling cosmic plasmas . \n dr rates at the low temperatures appropriate for photoionized plasmas are theoretically and computationally challenging . \n it is particularly difficult to calculate accurate resonance energies for dr resonances at electron - ion relative energies close to zero ev . \n laboratory measurements have consistantly found errors even in state - of - the - art theory for resonance energies and strengths below @xmath4  ev ( dewitt et al . \n 1996 ; schippers et al . 1998 ; schippers et al . \n 2001 ; savin et al . \n these near zero ev resonances often dominate the dr rate in photoionized plasmas . \n care also needs to be given to states which are forbidden to autoionize in ls coupling . \n recent measurements of dr onto c  iv have shown the importance at low temperatures of dr via these ls forbidden autoionizing states ( mannervik et al . \n 1998 ; schippers et al .  2001 ) . \n currently , the majority of dr rates for modeling photoionized plasmas come from older calculations . \n these rates , given the computational power available at the time and the theoretical approximations used to make the calculations tractable , are expected to be somewhat unreliable , particularly at low temperatures . \n this lack of reliable low temperature dr rates is one of the dominants uncertainties in the ionization balance in photoionized plasmas ( ferland et al . \n 1998 ) . \n modern calculational techniques can be used to produce the needed dr rates \n . however , given the discrepancies found between theory and experiment at low energies , it is clear that improvements to the theoretical techniques are called for . \n until these needed theoretical advances are achieved , the only way to produce reliable low temperature dr rates will involve a co - ordinated effort between laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . \n many plasma diagnostics used for interpreting spectra of agn , h ii regions , and pne use eie - generated line emission from transitions between low - lying energy levels of various atomic ions ( osterbrock 1989 ) . \n the upper state in the observed transitions can be populated by direct eie ( a one - step processes ) or by resonant eie ( a two - step processes ) . particularly challenging to calculate \n is the contribution to the total eie rate due to resonant eie . \n this channel involves dielectronic capture to an excited ( autoionizing ) state of the recombined system which then autoionizes to the upper level of interest in the initial ion . \n this indirect excitation process is the dominant population mechanism for many important transitions . \n for example , for @xmath5 and @xmath6 transition within the valence shell , calculations carried out including resonance effects can yield eie rates over an order of magnitude larger than calculations which do not account for resonances ( oliva , pasquali , & reconditi 1996 ) . for situations where resonance eie is important , reliable eie rates requires knowing the position of those autoionizing levels lying within @xmath7  ev of the ground state ( oliva et al . \n 1996 ) . accurately determining these resonance energies is extremely challenging theoretically and experimentally . \n reliable energy levels are important for modeling and interpreting spectra from stellar winds of hot stars . bound - bound photoabsorption transitions between 800 and 1300   can dramatically affect stellar spectrum ( hillier 2001 ) and type ia supernovae spectra ( pauldrach et al . \n a significant number of these transitions are due to states involving electrons in @xmath8 levels , up to @xmath9 in some situations ( kurucz 2001 ) . \n for many ions , no accurate measured wavelengths exist for the corresponding transitions . \n theoretical energy levels must be used and the resulting wavelengths can be shifted by @xmath10    or sometimes more ( haser et al . \n once the energy levels are reliably known , then improved ( photoabsorption ) oscillator strengths can be calculated . \n of all the cosmically - abundant heavy metals in stellar atmospheres , iron has the richest spectrum . \n of particular importance for understanding stellar atmospheres and wind are states involving @xmath11 levels in fe iv , v , and vi . \n the article by hillier ( 2001 ) in this conference proceedings briefly discusses and demonstrates the importance of these high - lying levels in models of stellar winds from o stars . \n the majority of pi cross sections currently used by astrophysicists for valence shell electrons come from opacity project ( op ) calculations ( opacity project team 1995 ) \n . the op energy levels are uncertain by 1 - 2% ( verner , barthel , & tytler 1994 ) . \n this translated directly into uncertainties in the resonance structure of the pi cross section and can introduce significant uncertainties when calculating pi rates due to spectral lines ( verner et al . \n accurate knowledge of this resonance structure is particularly important in the wavelength regions around h i ly@xmath0 , he i k@xmath0 , and he ii ly@xmath0 , as well as near other astrophysically important lines . to reduce the effects of accidental coincidences between resonances and spectral lines , \n op results are often averaged over resonances ( verner et al . \n 1996 , kallman & bautista 2001 ) . \n it is also worth noting that the op assumption of @xmath12-coupling is not satisfactory for closed shell systems ( verner et al . \n 1994 ) . \n recent laboratory advances have finally allowed pi measurements of valence shell for a few astrophysically important singly- and doubly - charged ions ( e.g.  kjeldsen et al .  1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) . \n reasonable agreement has been found between theory and experiment for most of these systems . \n but for fe ii , which is one of the astrophysically most important ions ( viotti , vittone , & friedjung 1988 ) , significant discrepancies remain ( kjeldsen 2000 ) . \n innershell pi of ions plays an important role in determining the ionization and thermal structures and line emission of x - ray photoionized plasmas . \n the innershell pi cross sections currently used for modeling these plasmas have been calculated using a hartree - slater central field approximation ( reilman & manson 1979 ; verner et al . \n the calculations do not account for any of the structure in the pi cross section near the innershell ionization thresholds . \n to date , these calculations have been benchmarked only with measurements on atoms . \n multielectron ionization can occur as a result of innershell pi . \n this is due to auger processes which occur as the electronic structure of the ion relaxes to fill the innershell hole . \n auger yields are currently estimated using theoretical and experimental results for atoms from the early 1970 s ( kaastra & mewe 1993 and references therein ) . \n these estimates have never been tested for ions and their reliability is highly questionable . \n shortcomings in our current theoretical and experimental capabilities in atomic physics as well as a lack of available atomic data hinder our ability to infer reliably the properties of many cosmic plasmas . \n this in turn limits our ability to address many of the fundamental issues in astrophysics . in order to help improve the situation , we have attempted to list here some of the most glaring atomic data needs for a better understanding of photoionized cosmic plasmas . \n it is our hope that this review will help to guide the future research of theoretical and experimental atomic physicists . \n given the current resources being devoted to removing the above described uncertainties in our understanding of atomic physics , it seems likely that it will require decades to remove these uncertainties and provide data needed by the astrophysicists . \n the author thanks gary ferland , d.  john hillier , kirk korista , and bob kurucz for helpful suggestions regarding this article . \n dws is supported by nasa space astrophysics research and analysis program grant nag5 -

mello spectra . \n evidently a term with this period deserves further investigation .      at the next step \n we had applied the wavelet analysis to all the nutation series to investigate the time variations of the fcn period ( phase ) and amplitude , which is the main goal of our study . for this analysis we used program wwz , developed by the american association of variable star observers and available as executable at the http://www.aavso.org/cdata/wwz.shtml . \n theoretical background of this method can be found in  @xcite . \n the results of the wavelet analysis are presented in figures  [ fig : wwz_up][fig : wwz_ea ] . \n figure  [ fig : wwz_mean ] presents the final results of the present investigation . \n it should be mentioned that based on the comparison of fcn amplitudes found here and previous investigations @xcite , we consider the results obtained before 1990 seems to be not very reliable .    of course , an important question arising from the obtained result is whether the variations of the period found from our analysis is an actual geophysical signal or an artifact caused by inadequate computational procedures . \n one can see that large increasing of the fcn period after @xmath11998 corresponds to relatively low amplitude of the fcn oscillation . \n we have performed some tests to estimate how result of wavelet analysis depends on variable amplitude of input signal .    for test purposes we used several artificial signals , and also we constructed new series as original one normalized by found variations of the fcn amplitude . \n the latter provides the fcn contribution series with near - unity amplitude with all other peculiarities inherited from real nutation series . \n the variations of the period found for the test series are practically the same as for real data . \n after all test , our conclusion is that found variations of the fcn period can not be explained by computational errors . \n besides , the results of spectral analysis made for different subset of data also corroborate our conclusion .    one of the important points to be investigated is the edge effect which may lead to misinterpreting of the results of the wavelet analysis for the first and the last epochs . for this purpose \n we performed a special test with wwz . \n we computed the fcn period and amplitude variations for several series starting with original one and cutting the first and the last 200 points from it . \n then this process was repeated and in that way four test series were obtained , each starts 200 days later and ends 200 days earlier than previous one . \n figures [ fig : wwz_edge_p ] and [ fig : wwz_edge_a ] show the result of this test .    from this test \n , we can conclude that the edge effect may affect the result at the first and the last 5001000 days of the interval under investigation . \n evidently , this fact should be accounted for to determinate the start point for prediction of the fcn contribution to nutation . \n variations of the fcn amplitude found in this investigation are close to ones used in the mhb2000 model , except the edge intervals ( see figure  [ fig : ampcomp ] ) \n . a reasons of these discrepancies may be insufficient quality of the vlbi data in the earlier 1980th and the edge effect present in the wavelet analysis results , as discussed above .    as a supplement test \n , we computed variations of the fcn amplitudes immediately from the vlbi series . for this purpose \n we used the smoothed differences between observed nutation angles and model described above . \n taking into account that the fcn contributions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two projections of the same variations in the earth rotation velocity , we can compute the fcn amplitude as @xmath4 . \n figure  [ fig : ampl_ma ] shows the result of comparison . comparing figures [ fig : ampcomp ] and [ fig : ampl_ma ] \n one can see that the direct computation of the fcn amplitude shows better agreement with the mhb2000 model . \n we can expect that amplitude estimates obtained with wwz method are not good enough at the edges of the time interval ( see also the discussion of the edge effect in wavelet analysis above ) . \n comparison of the fcn phase variations found in this study and computed from the amplitudes of sine and cosine fcn terms of the mhb2000 model is presented in figure  [ fig : phasecomp ] , after removing the linear phase change corresponding to the fcn with permanent period . \n one can see that the fcn phase variations are similar in two approaches , though ours provides more smooth variations , and so for the fcn period variations . \n the fcn period ( phase ) most likely varies with time . \n probably , change in the period is physically connected with change in amplitude . on the other hand \n , one can see that the variations of the fcn period show clear periodicity with a period about 5 years , whereas variations of the fcn amplitude does not show such an effect . \n another reason of the observed behavior of the fcn period maybe variability of the fcn phase . \n analogous effect was found also at the chandler frequency @xcite , for which dependence of the period on amplitude , and the phase jump occurred during the period of the lowest amplitude were also found . \n it is interesting , that the chandler wobble period also decreased in @xmath119861988 , and increased in @xmath119891996 ( see @xcite ) \n . unfortunately , polar motion series studied in those papers are much shorter than one analyzed here to perform a reliable comparison .    variations of fcn amplitudes show several possible epochs of the excitation of the fcn , most of them are close to ones detected in @xcite . \n some tests we performed allow us to make a conclusion that investigated nutation series really contain such a signal with variable amplitude and period ( phase ) . \n however , as stated above , we interpret the differences between observed nutation and the iau2000a model as the fcn contribution , which may be too strong assumption . \n possible interference of the fcn and other nutation frequencies should be carefully investigated . \n in particular , the authors of @xcite pointed out a possible interference with near - yearly nutation terms , but the investigated period of observations seems to be long enough to separate these frequencies by spectral and wavelet analysis . \n authors are grateful to prof . \n vineamin vityazev for useful advices on the spectral and wavelet analysis and t.  shirai for fruitful discussion on fcn issues .", "StartTimeOffset": 599298675844, "RequestID": "e4ca8bd98265444a9ec62a1923f5c110", "TotalTokens": 2999}

low momentum limit , one may compute the neutron scattering strength @xmath15 the exact analytic form of the limiting eq.([potential6 ] ) is given by @xmath16 employing this optical potential model with @xmath17 , the total neutron cross section in the long wavelength limit may be analytically computed , @xmath18 as plotted in fig.[fig1 ] . \n the peaks in the neutron cross section correspond to comfortably fitting the neutron wave within the spherical model optical potential wells of the nuclei . \n the well radius @xmath19 varies with @xmath20 in accordance with eq.([potential1 ] ) . \n while the model solved above refers the absorption of one neutron by one spherical nucleus , when the model is applied an ultra - low momentum neutron in a condensed matter electrode of a chemical cell , the very long neutron wave length spans many nuclei . \n this gives rise to collective quantum coherent effects in the neutron - nuclei interaction . \n the following experimental nuclear transmutations have been previously reported using light water solutions of one molar @xmath21 in electrolytic cells . \n small plastic micro - spheres were coated with thin films of nickel which were then employed to construct electrodes . \n the granular thin film structure of the electrodes allowed for large effective surface areas for the nickel hydride . \n if there exists sufficiently large flux of protons moving through the nickel and if the surface of the nickel hydride film is saturated with hydrogen atoms and thereby protons , then nuclear transmutations could be measured to take place with a yield that is plotted as functions of @xmath6 . \n the magnitude of the transmuted nuclear yields varies from one experimental run to to another . \n the variations will depend on the isotopic composition of the metallic hydride cathode and anode , various ions found in solution and the nano - scale uniformity of the electrode fabrication processes . \n however , the distribution of the yields versus atomic number appear to be understandable in terms of the total cross sections for neutron absorption in the ultra - low momentum limit , i.e. in terms of the above calculated neutron scattering strength .    in fig.[fig2 ] , we plot the reported transmutation yield versus atomic mass number for a moderately productive run@xcite employing a nickel cathode and compare the observed shape of the yield function and the shape of the ultra - low momentum neutron scattering strength . in fig.[fig3 ] \n we plot the reported transmutation yield versus atomic mass number for a very productive run@xcite employing a nickel cathode and again compare the observed shape of the yield function and the shape of the ultra - low momentum neutron scattering strength . \n similar experimental results@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite have been found employing titanium hydride , palladium hydride , and layered pd - ni metallic hydride electrodes . in all such experimental runs , \n the agreement between the multi - peak transmutation yields and the neutron scattering strength is quite satisfactory . \n let us conclude with some comments on the nature of the peaks in the theoretical neutron scattering strengths shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in varying the atomic mass number @xmath6 , we are in reality varying the radius @xmath22 of the optical potential well . when the neutron wavelength within the well reaches resonance with the radius of the well@xcite a peak appears in the scattering strength . if we associate resonant couplings with the ability of the neutron to be virtually trapped in a region neighboring the nucleus , then for intervals of atomic mass numbers about and under the resonant peaks we would expect to obtain neutron halo nuclei@xcite@xcite . \n the spherical optical potential well@xcite predicts the halo nuclei stability valleys@xcite and thus the peaks in observed nuclear transmutation abundances . \n finally , the neutrons yielding the abundances in our local solar system and galaxy have often been previously assumed to arise entirely from stellar nucleosynthetic processes and supernova explosions . \n however , such assumptions may presently be regarded as suspect@xcite@xcite . \n it appears entirely possible that ultra - low momentum neutron absorption may have an important role to play in the nuclear abundances not only in chemical cells but also in our local solar system and galaxy . \n g. h. miley , g. narne , m. j. williams , j. a. patterson , j. nix , d. cravens , h. hora , `` quantitative observation of transmutation products occurring in thin -

{"ContextTokens": 3096, "GeneratedTokens": 170, "SynthesizedBody": "studies of galaxy populations much benefit from the coordinated efforts of multiwavelength observations , which allow for a deeper insight into different galaxy properties and evolution . \n one of the best examples of these coordinated efforts is the _ great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) _ \n ( p.i . : m. giavalisco ) , with 320 arcmin@xmath0 of the sky fully covered with deep observations from x - rays through radio wavelengths . \n both north and south goods fields have been designed to be a unique case of _ hst _ coverage : they have deep and homogeneous maps in four broad - band _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ filters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . \n the large amount of science produced over the last years using goods data demonstrates the importance of _ hst _ treasury and other major - telescope legacy programs .    near and mid - ir selected galaxies constitute quite unbiased tracers of two different astrophysical properties : stellar mass and star - formation / agn activity , respectively . \n although , in general , these galaxies populations are studied separately , a joint analysis of results allows to better understand the interplay between star formation , agn activity and stellar - mass growth at different cosmic times . in the study of near- and mid - ir - selected galaxies , deep \n data have had a major role in the following aspects : 1 ) the determination of optical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , 2 ) the computation of precise ( @xmath3 ) photometric redshifts , as a complement to existing spectroscopic redshifts and 3 ) galaxy morphology . \n the two former aspects have been of key importance to conduct complete studies of galaxy luminosity evolution and stellar mass assembly . \n an important landmark in the study of near - ir - selected galaxies has been the k20 survey @xcite , which included part of the goods - south among their fields . \n the first science results obtained by the k20 survey have soon been extended after the progressive public releases of the deeper _ isaac - vlt _ @xmath4 and @xmath5-band data in the goods - south ( p.is . : c. cesarsky , e. giallongo ) . finally , after the launch of _ spitzer _ in 2003 ( p.i . \n : m. werner ) , both goods fields have been observed with _ irac _ at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath6 ( p.i . \n : m. dickinson ) .    at the typical depths of the goods data ( 21 - 22 vega mag ) , \n @xmath5-selected galaxies mostly span the redshift range @xmath7 , but @xmath8 of these galaxies are found at higher @xmath9 redshifts @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n the latter include extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) , which have been the subject of many studies looking for the progenitors of present - day massive ellipticals @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite \n .    the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath5-band luminosity function ( lf ) has been studied up to @xmath10 with the k20 survey @xcite , and then extended up to redshift @xmath11 using goods and other datasets @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite . \n all these works agree in a mild but still significant increase of the bright end of this lf from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . at the same time , the overall number density of galaxies decreases , making the near - ir luminosity density to be nearly constant with redshift ( cf . \n figure [ fig1 ] ) . \n multiwavelength sed modelling has also allowed to obtain stellar - mass estimates for near - ir - selected galaxies . \n the redshift evolution of galaxy number densities is differential with stellar mass : while the density of moderately massive galaxies ( @xmath14 ) continuosly increases from redshift @xmath15 down to @xmath16 , virtually all of the most massive ( @xmath17 ) galaxies appear to be in place by @xmath18 @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . \n the formation epoch of the most massive galaxies seems to be constrained to the redshift range @xmath19 , as no evidence of such galaxies has been found at @xmath20 in the goods - south field , indicating that these objects must be very rare ( if any exists ) at very high redshifts @xcite . \n moreover , during the last years , a general consensus has been achieved on the redshift evolution of the total stellar mass density : half of the stellar mass has been assembled in galaxies before the universe was 30 - 40% of its present age @xcite@xcite@xcite .    ) and with on - going star formation ( @xmath21 ) . \n the cosmology adopted has @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24.,width=340 ] \n the study of mid - ir selected galaxies has been a subject of major interest in european astronomy since the launch of the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ \n e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n the amount of energy contained in the extragalactic ir background ( @xmath25 ) is comparable to that in the optical background @xcite , which emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of mid- and far - ir galaxy populations in the general context of galaxy evolution . \n after _ iso _ set the first constraints on the mid - ir universe up to redshift @xmath26 , _ spitzer _ has allowed us to prove that mid - ir galaxies have in fact a significant contribution up to higher @xmath27 redshifts , e.g.@xcite . \n a sort of ` downsizing ' effect is observed in the typical stellar masses of the galaxies hosting the bulk of ir activity : at @xmath28 , most of the ir activity is found in @xmath29 $ \\sim$}}~}10^{11 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] galaxies , while at @xmath30 , an important fraction of the ir activity is concentrated in intermediate - mass galaxies , with @xmath31 @xcite@xcite .    a result that might have come as a surprise is the large fraction of massive galaxies that are experiencing an ultra - luminous ir phase at high redshifts @xcite@xcite . \n very recent results suggest that the agn contribution to this ir phase at @xmath28 might be much more important than previously thought @xcite . \n the mid - ir lf strongly evolves from @xmath32 to 1 @xcite@xcite . \n but , after removing to our best current knowledge the agn contribution at high redshifts , the mid - ir lf associated with star formation shows only a modest evolution from @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite . \n this is reflected in the observed evolution of the bolometric ir ( @xmath21 ) luminosity density , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] . from this figure , \n it is clear that the amount of energy associated with on - going star formation is significantly larger than the light produced by the stars already locked in galaxies at @xmath35 $ \\sim$}}~}0.6 - 0.7 $ ] , while the balance is reversed at lower redshifts . \n the @xmath36 luminosity related to star formation can be interpreted as the gradient of the evolution of the assembled stellar mass . by @xmath37 , \n 80% of the present - day stellar mass is already in place @xcite , so there is only a minor amount of star formation still needed afterwards to finish assembling our local universe . \n cimatti , a. , mignoli , m. , daddi , e. , et al . , 2002 , \n a&a , 392 , 395 caputi k.i . , \n dunlop , j.s . \n , mclure , r.j . , \n roche , n.d . \n , 2005 , mnras , 361 , 607 caputi k.i . , \n mclure , r.j . , dunlop j.s . , \n et al . , 2006 , mnras , 366 , 609 grazian , a. , fontana , a. , de santis , c. , et al . , 2006 , a&a , 449 , 951 smail i. , owen , f.n . , \n morrison , g.e . \n , et al . , 2002 , apj , 581 , 844 roche , n.d . , \n dunlop , j.s . , \n almaini , o. , 2003 , mnras , 346 , 803 caputi k.i . \n , dunlop , j.s . , mclure , r.j . , \n roche , n.d . \n , 2004 , mnras , 353 , 30 roche , n.d . , dunlop j.s . , \n caputi k.i . , et al . , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 74 pozzetti , l. , cimatti , a. , zamorani , g. , et al . , 2003 , a&a , 402 , 837 saracco , p. , fiano , a. , chincarini , g. , et al . , 2006 , mnras , 367 , 349 arnouts , s. , walcher , c.j . , le fvre , o. , et al . , 2007 , a&a , submitted ( arxiv:0705.2438 ) saracco , p. , longhetti , m. , severgnini , p. , et al . , 2005 , mnras , 357 , l40 thomas , d. , maraston , c. , bender , r. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 621 , 673 franceschini , a. , rodighiero , g. , cassata , p. , et al . , 2006 , a&a , 453 , 397 renzini , a. , 2006 , ara&a , 44 , 141 pozzetti , l. , bolzonella , m. , lamareille , f. , et al . , 2007 , a&a , submitted ( arxiv:0704.1600 ) dunlop , j.s . , mclure , r.j . , \n cirasuolo , m. , 2007 , mnras , 376 , 1054 fontana , a. , pozzetti , l. , donnarumma , i. , et al . , 2004 , \n a&a , 424 , 23 aussel , h. , cesarsky , c.j . , \n elbaz , d. , et al . , 1999 , \n , 342 , 313 genzel , r. & cesarsky , c.j . , 2000 , \n ara&a , 38 , 761 franceschini , a. , aussel , h. , cesarsky , c.j . , et al . , 2001 , a&a . , 378 \n , 1 dole , h. , lagache , g. , puget , j .- l . \n , et al . , 2006 , a&a , 451 , 417 caputi k.i . , dole , h. , lagache , g. , et al . \n , 2006 , apj , 637 , 727 hammer f. , flores , h. , elbaz , d. , et al . , 2005 , a&a , 430 , 115 daddi , e. , dickinson , m. , chary , r. , et al . , 2005 , \n apj , 631 , l13 caputi , k.i . , \n dole , h. , lagache , g. , et al . \n , 2006 , a&a , 454 , 143 daddi , e. , alexander , d. m. , dickinson , m. , et al . , 2007 , \n apj , submitted ( arxiv:0705.2832 ) le floch , e. , papovich , c. , dole , h. , et al . , 2005 , apj , 632 , 169 caputi , k.i . , \n lagache , g. , yan , l. , et al . , 2007 , apj , 660 , 97", "StartTimeOffset": 623930855551, "RequestID": "9c37a7b33cb247c38f733ad5f93a5a2a", "TotalTokens": 3266}
{"ContextTokens": 3152, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "thanks to the progress of telescope technology and the detection technique of recent years , it is expected that we will meet with a situation where a large scale of high - quality data is continuously generated by such as subaru telescope , sloan digital sky survey an so on . the way of traditional analysis , however , appears to be insufficient for using the large amount of data effectively and efficiently and getting the maximum scientific results . \n although many people recognize the importance of research that uses the multi - wavelength data , such research actually needs considerable effort . \n one reason is that , for each data set , one needs to learn how to reduce and analyze the data , and even needs to know where the analysis tools are available . \n to overcome such situation and maximize the scientific return from a big project like subaru and alma , it is important to construct an environment where user can access to the science - ready data with very few effort . \n national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) started its vo project ( japanese virtual observatory \n jvo ) in 2002 . \n the objectives of the jvo project are to provide a seamless access to the distributed data service in the vo , and to provide user - friendly analysis environment . \n this paper describes our recent progress on the second objective . \n , is an optical - infrared 8.2  m telescope operated by national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) at mt . \n mauna kea hawai . \n subaru has seven open use instruments : ciao , comics , focus , ircs , suprimecam , hds and moircs . \n cisco is no longer available for open - use . using these instruments , \n observation can be made for wavelengths from optical ( 300 nm ) to infrared ( 20 @xmath0 m ) with spectrum resolution up to @xmath1 ( hds ) . \n the total amount of public data for each instrument is shown in figure  [ fig : totalamount ] . \n as of october 2006 , 8 tb of data is archived in the public area . \n more than 70% of the data are from the suprimecam , which is a mosaic of ten 2048 @xmath2 4096 ccds and covers a 34 x 27 field of view with a pixel scale of 0.20  . \n more than 90% of all the data requests are for the suprimecam , so our current priority issue is how to improve the usability of the suprimecam data . \n figure  [ fig : subaruarchive ] shows the flow of data taken by the subaru . \n the data are registered in the subaru telescope archive system ( starts ) as soon as the data are acquired by the instruments , so an observer retrieves his data from stars during and/or after the observation . \n the data of stars is mirrored to the mitaka advanced stars ( mastars ) , so the observer can retrieve the data also from the mastars . \n starts and mastars are not public data archive . to use the system , you need to get an account on the subaru computing system for stars or an account on the mitaka computing system for mastars . \n the data that passed 18 months of a proprietary period becomes publicly available through the , and system . \n the smoka system provides various query modes for the subaru archive , and it is described in enoki et al . \n the jvo system provides a vo standard access interface to the subaru archive . \n currently only the data of suprimecam is available from the jvo . \n the amount of data , especially of suprimecam , is very large , so it is important to provide a way to analyze the data without moving the data to a remote users machine . \n one of the ways to do so is to login to the subaru or mitaka computing system and analyze the data on the machine . \n it is , however , not practical to use the visualization tool from a remote machine , especially when accessing through a slow network . \n another solution is to provide a web service , through which one can access to the data analysis software and visualize the data in a compact graphical format such as gif , jpeg and png . recently \n a lot of open source framework are available for making such a service , and it has been realized that interactivity of the web based service can be improved by using ajax technique as demonstrated by the google map service . another important point is to provide the data in a form that detector and environment dependencies are removed . \n those dependencies are usually not known by an archive user , so it should be properly reduced by a data provider . \n the quality of the data reduction is improved as the experience is accumulated and the reduction software is also evolves continuously , so it is adequate to reduce the data on demand with the most developed algorithm . \n it is also important to provide the way to reduce the data with older version software for assuring data reproducibility to enable later same analysis . by providing the data in such a manner , \n a data provider can control the quality of data by putting a tag representing a version of reduction software in the fits header . \n the reduction process is hidden from a user , and the user does not need to take care about most of part of data reduction . \n so , we have decided to provide such a service on the japanese virtual observatory ( jvo ) web portal . \n the data reduction processes are concentrated on the jvo servers , so computing resources need to be integrated in a scalable manner to the jvo . \n we have developed a web service based grid computing system . \n this system is composed of four services : monitoring and discovering service ( mds ) , data analysis service ( das ) , data search service ( dss ) and storage service ( srs ) . figure  [ fig : subarupipeline ] shows an example of suprimecam response ( flat frame ) calculation system , which is showing how each service interacts each other . \n the mds manages the status of each das , and schedules the job submission requested by a grid client . \n each das server periodically report its status , such as load average , number of running job and job status , and the status is stored on an mds database . \n a grid client queries to the mds to ask which server is free for a job submission . \n the mds returns a service endpoint url that is appropriate for the job submission . \n the client submit the job , and wait it to finish . \n while waiting , the client periodically polling to the mds for querying the job status . \n the das sends a query to the dss to get subaru raw data , the dss returns the urls for the data , the das retrieves the data and starts analysis . \n when a job status is changed to `` finish '' , the client queries the das for an url to retrieve the result . \n the url is passed to the srs , the result is stored on the storage of the srs , and the metadata of the result is registered on the dss . \n the interactions between each service and client are made by exchanged a soap message . \n the interface of each service is defined in the web service description language ( wsdl ) . \n several examples of the defined interfaces are described in java interface as follows :    .... mds interface     void reportstatus(string hostid , double load , int njob )     serviceinfo resolveservice(string serviceid )     void reportjobstatus(string hostid , int jobid , string status )     string getjobstatus(string hostid , int jobid )     ...    das interface     int submitjob(string command , string argv )     string getresulturl(int jobid )     string query(int jobid )     string finalize(int jobid )     ...    srs interface     int copyasync(string src , string dest )     void copy(string src , string dest )     void finalize(int jobid )     ...    dss interface     vodata performquery(select select )     ... ....    the ` reportstatus ` interface is used by a das server to report its load average and the number of submitted jobs . \n the ` resolveservice ` interface is used by a grid client to decide which server to submit a job . \n the returned ` serviceinfo ` contains an endpoint url . \n the ` submitjob ` interface is used to submit a job to the das server , which returns a job i d and it is used for polling the job status . \n the ` getresulturl ` interface returns an access url for retrieving the result . \n the ` copyasync ` and ` copy ` interface are used to transfer data between two servers or just to copy the data inside the same server . \n the former interface is used for data transfer that is expected to take long time . \n the ` performquery ` interface is used for querying the data by astronomical data query language ( ) , and return the result in format .    a web form based gui for calculating a response frame of suprimecam ccd is made for easy job submission as shown in figure  [ fig : subaruflat ] . \n the * observation * section of the gui is used for browsing the number of exposures for each filter on each day . the observation period for calculating a response frame \n is determined here . usually select a period of successive suprimecam observations , which typically lasts one week . at the section of * \n create flat calibration frames * , one can select a filter and/or a chip for which a flat calibration frame is calculated . after submitting the jobs \n , the job status can be viewed at the section of * job status*. the status changes from `` running '' to `` data transfer '' and then to `` finished '' if an error does not happen . \n the mds server manages a database that contains static information ( host name , ip address , cpu type , memory size ) and status ( load average , number of submitted jobs , living and enabled flags ) of each das server , which can been seen on the mds web page as shown in figure  [ fig : mds ] . \n the living flag stays `` true '' while the mds are receiving a hear beat message from the das server . \n when a successive five minutes of disconnection happens , the flag changes to `` false '' , and the server is recognized as `` unavailable '' . \n the `` enabled '' flag is used to prohibit the job submission to the server . when the flag is `` false '' , a job is not submitted to the server . \n the japanese virtual observatory ( ) is a vo portal service , which federates the distributed vo services and provides data analysis environment through a web browser . \n jvo is especially going to provide analysis environment utilizing the subaru data . \n the subaru data currently available on the jvo are : subaru deep field catalog ( sds , sxds ) , suprimecam chip image , and suprimecam mosaic image . \n we are preparing to provide reduced data of the other subaru instruments . \n we are also going to implement the data analysis interface for : reduction of raw data with user specified parameters , image manipulation , spectrum fitting , catalog creation from a image , and so on . \n these data analysis will be executed on the server side , so any plugin tools are required to be installed on the user s machine . \n we are going to integrate the grid computing system described above to the jvo portal so that enough amount of computing resource is provided to a user . \n an overview of the jvo system is shown in figure  [ fig : overviewjvo ] . \n the details of the jvo system were described in elsewhere ( shirasaki et al . \n 2006 , shirasaki et al . \n 2006b , tanaka et al . \n 2006 , ohishi et al . \n figure  [ fig : searchresult ] shows the result of cross match query between the catalogs of subaru suprimecam ( optical ) and spitzer ( infrared ) . \n the jvo provides several visualization tools such as jvo data viewer , jvoplot , by vo india and by cds . \n the voplot and aladin are java applets . \n the jvo data viewer and jvoplot are server side web applications , so the data itself are not transfered to the local machine ; they are converted to compact - sized graphics and transfered to the user s web browser . \n it is especially convenient to view the large data set . \n figure  [ fig : subarudataservice ] shows the result of query for reduced suprimecam data . \n the service returns a link to the reduced data , the link invokes the on - the - fly data reduction web application , and then a fits file the reduced image is returned . \n the search result includes also the links to the raw and response frames . \n the reduction procedure consists of bias subtraction , flat fielding , distortion correction , and astrometric calibration . \n the flat frames are calculated in advance by the response calculation service described above , and registered on the database . \n the typical time to execute the reduction is about 10 sec . \n once the reduced data are generated , it is stored on a cash area to avoid repetitions of the same reduction on the same data . \n the construction of the subaru advanced data and analysis service has just started this year ( 2006 ) . \n currently the data of suprimecam is a primary target of the development , but data of other instruments will be available from the jvo . \n the grid computing system are constructed to obtain enough computing resource to analyze all the suprimecam data in reasonably short time . \n the jvo portal service is available for everyone at ` http://jvo.nao.ac.jp/portal ` , where currently only the limited functionality is publicly available . to use all the jvo functionality , \n user registration will be required . \n this work was supported by the jsps core - to - core program , grant - in - aid for information

{"ContextTokens": 3757, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the very early motivations for introducing confinement in experimental studies of liquids and glass formers was the general agreement that there might exist a typical lengthscale measuring the dynamical molecular cooperativity @xcite . \n this quantity is suspected to increase with decreasing temperature , and to contribute to the observed anomalous properties of the structural relaxation such as super - arrhenian slowing - down in fragile compounds . introducing a maximum size to the system by means of a porous matrix \n gives the opportunity to emphasize experimental evidence of those dynamical cooperative clusters . \n up to now , most theoretical expectations and more or less direct experimental studies converge to state that the characteristic size of these cooperative rearranging regions ( crr ) does not exceed a few molecular sizes . \n confinement effects have been mostly scrutinized in porous materials presenting cavities of nanometric dimension . \n a large variety of materials has been used , often silicates within different geometries , either isotropic ( fractal aerogels , interconnected vycors , aerosils or gelsils ) or template - controlled ( mcm-41 , sba-15 ) . \n several experimental difficulties are encountered in such studies due to the unavoidable powder averaging of the measured observables and to the huge surface to volume ratio that is reached . \n indeed , the surface contribution to the free energy of the confined liquid can not be ignored anymore , and the awaited ultimate finite - size effects can be masked by dominant interfacial solid - liquid interactions @xcite . \n experimental evidence of such surface contribution was reported on simple liquids like toluene @xcite , as a stretching of the dynamical self - correlation functions toward longer times , and a non - vanishing static contribution within experimental resolution . \n these data were interpreted by a very large distribution of correlation times , starting from very slow reorientations imposed by a pinning at the pore surface , to bulk - like dynamics at the center . \n such a broadening of molecular dynamics frequencies over several decades is supported by numerical simulations @xcite . \n this onset of glass - like dynamics in simple liquids appears as an essential consequence of confinement , but is not the only one , for also the structure and the thermodynamical stable and metastable states are affected @xcite . \n these interrelated effects remain partly misunderstood even for simple fluids . \n a large effort towards a better understanding of more complex confined fluids is timely , for they are introduced in an increasing number of innovative applications of nanosciences ( lab - on - chip , nanofluidics ... ) . \n liquid crystals ( lc ) are test - systems in order to investigate fluids with an increasing degree on complexity . \n their structure is characterized by anisotropic order parameters giving rise to typical sequences of nematic or smectic phases . \n however , their molecular nature allows one to confidently assign dynamical contributions in terms of rotations , translational diffusion or librations , accessible to a large number of techniques like dielectric spectroscopy @xcite , neutron quasielastic scattering or light scattering ( photon correlation spectroscopy , optical kerr effect @xcite ) . \n both these structural and dynamical aspects have been widely studied on bulk samples , and make lc s model systems particularly suited to experimental investigations of confinement effects on complex fluids . like more simple liquids , the thermodynamics of confined lc s is also profoundly modified . \n one of the most striking effect is the instability of the translational smectic ordering with respect to the quenched disorder field introduced by an irregular solid / lc interface @xcite . \n this leads to a very important depression of the melting temperature of the confined crystalline phase , and the suppression of the nematic to smectic continuous transition , replaced by a frustrated short - range ( nanometric ) smectic ordering @xcite . \n we report in this paper new experimental data depicting structural and dynamical features of a confined lc in a nanoporous material of very low dimensionality . \n fully hydrogenated liquid crystal ( lc ) 4-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ( 8cb ) was purchased from sigma - aldrich and used without further purification . \n columnar porous silicon ( psi ) matrices were obtained from a heavily doped ( 100 ) oriented silicon substrate by electrochemical etching @xcite . \n a porosity of 60 % , made of a parallel arrangement of not - connected channels ( diameter @xmath0 300 ) is obtained , aligned in a layer of thickness @xmath0 30 @xmath1 m . \n this very large aspect ratio induces a quasi one - dimensional character of the porous structure , preferentially aligned on the macroscopic lengthscale . \n thermal oxidation of the structure can be further performed , leading to a transparent layer well suited to investigations by optical techniques . \n 8cb was confined into psi by capillary wetting from the liquid phase under vapour pressure in a vaccuum chamber and at a temperature of 60c , well above the n - i transition temperature . \n the excess of lc was then removed by squeezing the wafers between whatman filtration papers . \n the complete filling of the pores was characterized by confocal microraman spectroscopy @xcite . \n neutron diffraction experiments were performed on the g6.1 double - axis diffractometer ( cold neutron guide ) at the laboratoire lon brillouin ( llb , cnrs / cea , saclay ) , with an incident wavelength of 4.71 . \n quasielastic incoherent neutron scattering experiments were carried out on the time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer g6.2 at the llb , with a resolution of 107 @xmath1ev fwhm . the covered momentum transfer ( q ) range was about 0.4 to 1.9 @xmath2 . \n the temperature was controlled to better than 0.1 k over a range from 100 k to 340 k using a cryoloop . \n numerical deconvolution of tof spectra were carried out following standard procedures using the `` qensh '' software provided by the llb . \n for both diffraction and tof experiments , eight filled porous silicon wafers were stacked parallel to each other in a cylindrical aluminium cell , representing a total amount of confined lc of about 20 mg . \n ellipsometry experiments were carried out with a horiba jobin - yvon uvisel spectrometer , in the visible range ( @xmath3 from 410 to 830 nm ) . \n the measured ellipsometric angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are related respectively to the amplitude ratio and to the phase difference between the complex reflexion coefficients ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) of the sample ( resp . parallel or perpendicular to the incident plane ) . from these two angles , new quantities are defined according to :    @xmath8    these functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 were fitted versus the wavelength using the horiba `` deltapsi2 '' software provided with the apparatus . \n the sample was modelled as a porous silica layer top of a silicon substrate . \n the dielectric dispersions of silicon and silica were described using standard library data . \n the dielectric dispersion of the organic liquid crystal was modeled by a uniaxial anisotropic single oscillator . \n the porosity of the layer was described using a classical anisotropic bruggeman model @xcite mixing silica and void dispersions for the empty matrix , or silica and 8cb dispersions for the filled matrix . \n brillouin scattering was performed with a triple pass tandem of fabry - perot ( sandercock model ) with a kr@xmath11 ion laser ( coherent ) at a wavelength of 647 nm . \n laser power was kept at a few tens of mw in order to avoid a too big heating due to absorption of the bulk silicon supporting the film . at too high counting rates a shutter obturates the photomultiplier inducing discontinuities in the spectra . \n typical spectra were accumulated during several hours . \n spectra were fitted by an apparatus function convoluted to damped oscillator profiles ( brillouin lines ) and a debye relaxor . \n all results presented hereafter were obtained close to room temperature , in the smectic phase of 8cb ( bulk or confined ) @xcite . in this temperature range , \n the liquid crystal 8cb confined in psi experiences smectic ordering that remains short - range ( sro , @xmath12 ) due to quenshed disorder effects imposed by solid - liquid interfacial interactions @xcite . \n these effects destroy the bulk second order nematic to smectic phase transition . as a consequence , \n the bragg peak associated to this smectic sro and appearing at @xmath13 ( at a working wavelength of 4.7 ) is significantly broader than the experimental resolution . \n figure [ ellipso ] displays ellipsometric spectra measured on empty porous silica and porous silica filled with 8cb . \n the interference fringes are due to multiple reflections at interfaces of the porous layer . \n it is therefore possible to deduce an estimation of the layer thickness , and typical values between 2.5 and 5 @xmath1 m ( depending on the sample ) were found , in good agreement with independent sem results . \n a simple comparison of both curves shows strong differences in the amplitude modulation of those fringes , as a consequence of the dispersion of the optical index of the confined liquid crystalline phase . \n this observation can be used as a direct characterization of a proper filling of the porous layer with 8cb . \n a semi - quantitative analysis was performed using the model described in section [ expellipso ] . \n best fits agree with an optical uniaxial birefringence of the filled porous layer of about @xmath14 , with an optical axis aligned with the direction of the nanopores . \n the important differences in the ellipsometric data allow to separate unambiguously this additional birefrengence due to the liquid crystal from the natural optical anisotropy of the empty porous layer . \n these two contributions can be further more distinguished through the temperature dependence of the liquid crystal contribution . \n from the orientation of this measured optical anisotropy , it can be concluded that the orientational order parameter of the confined 8cb strongly couples to the one - dimensional character of the porous matrix . \n @xmath2 ) by 8cb confined into porous silicon . the inset sketches the experimental setup . \n the sample macroscopic orientation is defined by the angle @xmath15 between the silicon wafer plane and the incident beam . ] \n figure [ mosa ] shows the intensity of the bragg peak associated to the smectic sro measured at constant @xmath16 @xmath2 , while rotating the sample plane by an angle @xmath15 with respect to the neutron incident beam . \n the best fit using an arbitrary lorentzian form indicates that the maximum of the bragg reflexion is peaked at @xmath17 , which corresponds to the sample orientation @xmath18 where the @xmath19 vector is parallel to the nanochannels of the porous silicon layer . \n the linewidth is about 17hwhm . within this rather small mosaicity , \n the director of the smectic layers is obviously well aligned with the silicon channels axis . \n both ellipsometry and neutron diffraction results show that 8cb confined in porous silicon displays in the meantime orientational and translational order parameters that are macroscopically one - dimensionally oriented through a strong coupling with the peculiar low dimensionality of the matrix . \n accordingly , the molecular dynamics of the confined phase might be also affected by this anisotropic ordering . whereas translational diffusion should in some extent depend on the local properties of the smectic sro domains \n , the rotational molecular relaxations should be more sensitive to orientational parameters . in this section , \n we report brillouin and quasielastic neutron scattering results , that complementary probe the molecular relaxations in the picosecond time range . \n figure [ brillouin ] shows the comparison of brillouin spectra obtained on porous silica filled with 8cb or on the separated constituents . \n the black line is the best fit according to the procedure detailed in section [ expbri ] . \n the brillouin doublets appearing on the spectra have different origins : the one at the lowest frequency is a longitudinal mode propagating tangentially to the surface , whereas at the highest frequency appears a longitudinal mode propagating mainly along the pores perpendicular to the surface . \n the response of the bulk liquid crystal consists in a single quasielastic lorentzian line of about 5 ghz hwhm ( i.e. @xmath20 ps ) . \n the symmetry of the experimental setup suggests to assign this line to uniaxial rotation of the molecules around their long axis . \n the response of an empty porous silica matrix reveals strong brillouin modes , sitting on a very broad quasielastic contribution ( more than 35 ghz ) . \n comparatively , the brillouin spectrum of a filled porous layer can be described by a weighted linear combination of these individual responses , assuming a broadening of the acoustic modes . \n this damping is due to the coupling of the solid matrix to the viscosity of the liquid crystal ( poroelasticity effect ) \n . a quasielastic contribution of about the same width as for the bulk 8cb can be seen on the data , suggesting that the uniaxial molecular rotations are only weakly affected by the confinement . \n quasielastic neutron scattering experiments were performed , in order to probe additional relaxations . \n figure [ mibemol ] shows the tof spectra measured on bulk 8cb and 8cb / psi . \n spectra were fitted using one lorentzian plus one elastic ( resolution limited ) components . for bulk 8cb \n , the quasielastic contribution has a linewidth of about 0.25 mev ( @xmath21 ps ) . \n its occurence at large values of momentum transfer together with the presence of an elastic contribution would suggest that it also reflects localized reorientations ( rotations , end - chain relaxations ... ) . \n @xmath2 , on ( a ) bulk 8cb , and ( b ) 8cb confined in porous silicon . ]    for 8cb confined in porous silicon , figure [ mibemol](b ) reports a significant increase of the elastic contribution , together with a decrease of the quasielastic linewidth down to 0.16 mev . \n this moderate slowing down of the fast reorientational motions agrees with the brillouin results , and confirms that rotational molecular dynamics seem to be only weakly disturbed by the anisotropic confinement in porous silicon . on the other hand \n , the increase of the elastic contribution suggests that slow relaxations ( slower than the tof energy resolution ) or long range translational diffusion might be much more affected . \n this is expected from a heterogeneous propagation of a surface induced slowing - down through the inner pore volume . \n we report in this note new experimental results on a smectic liquid crystal confined into a low dimensional , macroscopically oriented porous silicon layer , which has been introduced recently @xcite . \n the combination of a large panel of complementary techniques allows one to probe in parallel the structural and dynamical behavior of the confined molecules . \n it is shown that both orientational and translational order parameters of the confined liquid crystal couple to the anisotropy of the silicon matrix , and give rise to unusual structural properties reminiscent for some aspects of electric or magnetic field effects on bulk liquid crystals . \n the picosecond molecular dynamics of this oriented short - range ordered confined smectic phase were probed by light and neutron scattering techniques , suggesting that mainly large amplitude motions like long axis tumbling or long range translational diffusion , should be affected by anisotropic confinement effects . \n the authors are thankful to j .- \n m . zanotti and b. frick , for expert advice on neutron scattering experiments and fruitful discussion , and also m. stchakovsky for precious help on spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements .", "StartTimeOffset": 651398933156, "RequestID": "96cc425bc05e4a63badbe4ac0e4b3daa", "TotalTokens": 3868}

hollenbach et al . \n @xcite ) , and for the case relevant here where the radiation field arises externally ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ; strzer & hollenbach @xcite ) . in the simplest analysis , ultraviolet radiation heats the disc surface , raising the sound speed to @xmath1 . beyond a radius , \n @xmath2 the heated gas is unbound and flows away as a thermal wind . \n both lyman continuum euv photons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and less energetic far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation ( @xmath5 ) can contribute to disc mass loss . \n however , for @xmath6 , fuv - driven flows ( for which the sound speed in the heated layer is @xmath7 , as compared to @xmath8 for euv - driven flows ) have @xmath9 that is substantially larger than the radii of principal interest for planet formation . in this paper \n we therefore concentrate on euv - driven mass loss , while noting that the effects of fuv radiation will also be important for lower mass stars . \n to estimate the strength of ultraviolet radiation in clusters of varying richness , we first need the emission from an individual star . for stars with @xmath10 , we obtain the luminosity and effective temperature @xmath11 from stellar models computed by schaller et al . \n ( @xcite ) for a metallicity @xmath12 ( for these purposes , differences in metallicity are of secondary importance ) . \n we use the model output closest to @xmath13 , which should be appropriate for young clusters of any age given the very short pre - main - sequence phase of the massive stars that dominate the uv flux . the model output \n is then combined with theoretical stellar atmosphere models by kurucz ( e.g. buser & kurucz @xcite ) to yield the euv and fuv output as a function of stellar mass . \n [ fig1 ] shows the euv and fuv luminosity as a function of stellar mass . a negligible fraction of the total flux is emitted in the euv by stars with @xmath14 , which corresponds to a mass @xmath15 . \n the fraction of flux in the euv band then rises roughly linearly with increasing @xmath11 to @xmath16 of the total for @xmath17 stars with @xmath18 . \n significant fluxes of fuv radiation are produced by lower mass stars with @xmath19 .    for a standard mass function \n the most massive stars are rare . \n [ fig1 ] also shows which stars dominate the output of euv and fuv radiation in a cluster . \n we assume a kroupa , tout & gilmore ( @xcite ) mass function for @xmath20 , and a salpeter ( @xcite ) form , @xmath21 , for higher masses . \n both the fuv and ( especially ) the euv flux is expected to be dominated by the most massive star in a cluster .    using this mass function , with a low mass cutoff at @xmath22 , and a high mass cutoff at @xmath23 , we generated realizations of clusters with number of members @xmath24 ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . \n [ fig2 ] shows the resultant integrated euv luminosities . \n the median luminosity rises steeply for smaller clusters , which do not fully sample the high mass end of the mass function , and becomes linear only for larger clusters with @xmath27 . \n the dependence of the luminosity on the single most massive star that a cluster happens to have implies a large dispersion in the integrated luminosity . \n the range of luminosities that encompasses 90% of the probability distribution spans almost 3 orders of magnitude at @xmath28 , and is still a factor of @xmath29 at @xmath30 . \n this implies that otherwise similar clusters in which the maximum stellar mass varies can have widely different uv environments , leading to substantial dispersion in the predicted lifetimes of circumstellar discs . \n the theory of euv - driven flows from discs provides a prediction for how the mass loss rate scales with the flux of ionizing photons . in the simplest analysis , \n the mass loss rate for a disc of fixed radius , at distance @xmath31 from a source emitting a flux of ionizing photons @xmath32 , scales as ( bertoldi & mckee @xcite ; johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) , @xmath33 more sophisticated analysis are available ( strzer & hollenbach @xcite ; richling & yorke @xcite ) , but are hardly warranted here given the uncertainties .    to calibrate the predicted disc lifetime , we make use of the results obtained in orion . the most massive star in the orion trapezium , @xmath34 ori c , has a mass estimated at around @xmath35 ( hillenbrand @xcite ) . \n both this mass , and the estimated ionizing flux in orion of the order of @xmath36 , fall withing the range expected for clusters with @xmath37 . within orion , \n one of the best studied evaporating discs , hst 182413 , at a projected distance of 0.12 pc from @xmath34 ori c , has an estimated mass loss rate @xmath38 . \n the disc radius @xmath39 is @xmath40 , and the estimated disc mass @xmath41 ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) . \n this disc mass is consistent with the upper end of the distribution of disc masses inferred from mm - wavelength observations by osterloh & beckwith ( @xcite ) . for this object , \n the characteristic disc lifetime is therefore @xmath42 .    for planet formation , \n we are interested in smaller discs than that which presently surrounds hst 182413 . \n these will have smaller mass loss rates , which in the case of euv - dominated flows scale as @xmath43 ( johnstone , hollenbach & bally @xcite ) . scaling to a solar system sized disc ( 30 au ) , and assuming conservatively that the mass remains similar to that of hst 182413 , we obtain @xmath44 as a simple estimator of the disc survival time for @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n this estimate of the time available for planet formation before the disc is destroyed is certainly crude , and in particular ignores completely the effects of angular momentum transport in the disc . \n however , viscosity will tend to _ hasten _ disc destruction by moving material to larger radii where it can be lost via photoevaporation more easily . \n [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the predicted disc lifetime on the size of the cluster , for discs located at distances @xmath31 from the principal source of ionizing radiation . for smaller clusters \n this will typically be a single massive star , while for rich clusters with @xmath47 or larger several stars will contribute . \n we assume that , as in orion , these stars are formed near the cluster centre ( bonnell & davies @xcite ) , and thus can be treated as a single radiation source . \n if in reality the massive stars were instead distributed throughout the cluster , that would result in a _ \n larger _ volume over which significant ablation of discs would occur . \n similarly , mixing of the cluster over timescales shorter than the disc lifetime increases the fraction of stars whose discs are affected by photoevaporation .    by construction , the dependence shown in fig . \n [ fig3 ] is consistent with a destruction timescale of a few @xmath48 yr in the inner ( @xmath49 pc ) part of orion near @xmath34 ori c. it is also consistent with observed disc lifetimes of a few myr , extending upwards to more than @xmath50 yr , in poor clusters with just a few hundred members . \n a large dispersion in disc lifetime is expected in this case .    for clusters richer than orion , the volume over which photoevaporation significantly curtails the disc lifetime grows . for large @xmath24 , @xmath51 , and the volume within which mass loss is significant scales as @xmath52 . \n thus , for rich clusters , a larger fraction of the discs will be ablated by the action of the radiation field , even if the central cluster density remains constant . for @xmath53 , \n the disc lifetime is expected to be severely curtailed ( less than a few @xmath48 yr ) out to distances of the order of 1 pc , and to be significantly reduced ( to @xmath54 yr , an order of magnitude below the value inferred for isolated discs ) , out to distances of perhaps 3  5 pc .      in the solar system , \n the observation that the gas fraction of the outer planets varies substantially has been taken to imply that these planets formed at roughly the epoch when the gas disc was being dissipated , probably at about a few @xmath55 yr ( e.g. shu , johnstone & hollenbach @xcite ; strzer & hollenbach @xcite ) . \n a few myr is also the typical theoretical estimate for the time required for a growing core at 5 au to reach a mass where it can rapidly accrete gas from the disc in a runaway manner ( pollack et al . \n somewhat shorter timescales are derived if the cores initially migrate inwards through the gas disc , but subsequently halt and accrete the gas at smaller radii ( papaloizou & terquem @xcite ) . \n these timescales suggest that a disc lifetime of @xmath56 yr might well pose difficulties for giant planet formation , at least in some theoretical models , while lifetimes closer to @xmath26 yr would very probably preclude giant planet formation . from fig . \n [ fig3 ] , this suggests that giant planet formation will be strongly suppressed in clusters with @xmath57 stars out to around 1 pc , and possibly at substantially larger radii . \n we also note that since short period planets ( analagous to that orbiting 51 peg ) are unlikely to have been formed _ in situ _ \n ( bodenheimer , hubickyj & lissauer @xcite ) , the disc must survive for a significant additional time , subsequent to planet formation , to allow inward migration through the gas disc ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson @xcite ) . some additional reduction in the frequency of such systems would then result . \n low mass planets are largely unaffected by these considerations . indeed , since rapid inward migration through the disc \n can substantially deplete the population of such objects ( e.g. ward @xcite , and references therein ) , the rapid removal of the gas could in principle even enhance the initial frequency of low mass planets in clusters . \n the conclusion that rapid disc destruction in clusters severely reduces the probability of planet formation can be evaded in two ways . \n first , massive planets might form from the disc via direct hydrodynamic collapse ( e.g. boss @xcite , @xcite ; cameron @xcite ) . \n if this process occurs at all , it is most likely at very early times when the disc is massive and vulnerable to gravitational instability . \n a detection of massive planets around systems where the disc lifetime was very short would constitute indirect but persuasive evidence for the importance of this process . \n second , if there is a significant delay between the epoch of low mass and high mass star formation , planets could have time to form before the discs began to be exposed to ionizing radiation . in orion , observations suggest that at least some low mass star formation appears to have been underway well before the formation of the high mass members of the cluster ( palla & stahler @xcite ) , while in some theoretical models for high mass star formation prior low mass star formation is a necessary ingredient ( bonnell , bate & zinnecker @xcite ) . more generally , \n unless star formation in a cluster is somehow synchronized to better than the sound crossing time of the gas in the star forming region , there is bound to be some spread in the times at which stars form . since high mass stars are relatively scarce , this would typically lead to some low mass stars in the cluster forming well before the first massive star turns on and begins the process of disc destruction . \n as searches for extrasolar planets extend beyond the immediate solar neighbourhood , it will become possible to study how the frequency and properties of extrasolar planetary systems depend upon the star formation environment . in this paper , i have argued that in what may be the typical setting for star formation ( clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand @xcite )  a cluster containing a mix of high and low mass stars \n photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs severely limits the time available for giant planet formation . \n observations indicate that discs are being rapidly destroyed by this process within a few tenths of a pc of orion s trapezium , and the effect will be stronger in richer clusters . for a cluster of @xmath26 stars , \n the disc lifetime is likely to be significantly reduced when compared to that of discs around isolated stars , out to a distance from the cluster centre of several pc . \n unless planets form contemporaneously with the disc itself ( boss @xcite ) , or there is a significant delay ( perhaps @xmath56 yr or more ) between the epochs of low mass and high mass star formation , the fraction of stars in rich clusters with massive planets is likely to be small . \n this provides both a possible explanation for the apparent dearth of massive , short - period planets in 47 tucanae ( gilliland et al . \n @xcite ; brown et al . \n @xcite ) , and suggests that planet formation could also be noticeably suppressed in substantially less dense clustered environments .", "StartTimeOffset": 660414365050, "RequestID": "528b1e3b4c0b40438c372ca5481f3090", "TotalTokens": 4189}

r diagram of the local field population and 2m1207a . like the young m \n dwarf au mic ( gl 803 ) , 2m1207a lies @xmath28 magnitudes above the main sequence in the @xmath29 vs @xmath30 diagram , confirming youth .    _ \n the secondary : _ the usual procedure for analyzing 2m1207b is to assume a bolometric correction appropriate to late - l dwarfs , and then fit the luminosity to evolutionary models . \n @xcite estimated @xmath31 for 70 pc , @xcite estimated @xmath32 for 59 pc , and @xcite estimated @xmath33 for 53 pc . \n the trigonometric parallax would therefore support the last two estimates . \n @xcite , however , noted an inconsistency with this procedure . \n they argued that their h and k - band near - infrared spectra of 2m1207b were best fit by an effective temperature of @xmath34k . \n however , for the @xmath35 fits , the expected effective temperature is more like @xmath36 k. they suggest the best resolution is that 2m1207b is viewed through an edge - on gray disk , and that therefore it is more luminous than otherwise estimated . \n 2m1207b is then a @xmath37 planetary mass brown dwarf . \n the wide separation and mass ratio ( @xmath38 ) suggests this planetary - mass object did not form through core accretion @xcite .    without rejecting the possibility of a edge - on disk \n , we argue that available evidence does not rule out a low temperature for 2m1207b . in figure  2 , we plot colors and absolute magnitudes for late - m , l and t dwarfs with parallaxes @xcite . \n all the previous attempts to fit 2m1207b noted that it is red compared to field brown dwarfs , which can be attributed to having more dust in the photosphere . \n the faintness at j - band measured by @xcite ( @xmath39 ) is supported by the nicmos f110 m measurement of @xcite ( @xmath40 ) . \n @xcite measured @xmath41 and @xmath42 for 2m1207b . on the other hand , it is clear from mohanty et al.s ( 2007 ) ( @xmath43 ) spectrum that there is deep water absorption but little methane absorption . we conclude that 2m1207b has a spectral energy distribution that is l - type , but very red . \n reversing the usual procedure , in figure  3 we plot the required k - band bolometric correction required to fit the @xcite models at an age of 10 myr . observed bolometric corrections for field l and t dwarfs from @xcite as a function of temperature for an assumed age of @xmath44 are also shown . \n the l to t transition is believed to occur at @xmath45k , and can be marked in figure 3 by the change in bolometric corrections . \n the transition is related to the change in dust properties in photosphere ( see kirkpatrick 2005 for a review ) , and some of the first fits to late - l dwarf spectra gave incorrect values of @xmath46k due to the failure of cooler models to resemble the real spectra . \n this simply reflects the extreme difficulty of modelling the temperature range 1200 - 1400k , and indeed in light of this , no models succeed in fully explaining both the blue hook and brightening in j - band of field t dwarfs . \n analysis of the luminosity ( see kirkpatrick ) has been the most reliable way to derive temperatures . \n this history suggests to us that the existing fit must be viewed with caution  while apparently very good , it is inconsistent with the absolute magnitudes unless an edge - on disk is invoked . \n although mohanty et al . show that the dusty models do fit the observed color of 2m1207b , it must be noted that the same models predict very red colors for field l dwarfs , which are not observed . \n indeed , @xcite note that `` the dusty and cond models represent extreme situations which bracket the more likely intermediate case resulting from complex , and presently not understood , thermochemical and dynamical processes . '' \n we think it plausible that existing dusty models fail to properly model the dust in low surface gravity dwarfs , and that 2m1207b might therefore be @xmath47k , as expected for the @xmath48 model . as an example how this might occur , \n we note that @xcite invokes a parameter , @xmath49 , that characterizes the thickness of the clouds , and argues that the wide range of colors for field objects near @xmath50k is due to changes in this parameter in otherwise similar brown dwarfs . in one case , @xcite is able to fit an l6.5 dwarf with @xmath51k or @xmath52k ( without methane absorption ) by varying @xmath49 by only 100k . \n evidently an extremely red color like 2m1207b could be obtained for a low @xmath53 with @xmath54k  that is , a very thick cloud compared to field l dwarfs . \n this would be the opposite situation from field t dwarfs , where the cloud becomes thinner ( @xmath49 increases . ) similarly , in the @xcite models , a parameter , @xmath55 , represents sedimentation , and redder colors are produced by smaller values of @xmath55 ( i.e. , less precipitation and thicker clouds . ) \n regardless of how the proper degree of dust is produced , if our speculation that @xmath56k is correct , the implied @xmath57 would require that more of 2m1207b s energy is escaping at wavelengths longward of 3 microns than in field l dwarfs . \n in any case , the observed colors and spectrum do not match any field brown dwarf , so there is not much doubt that atmosphere is dustier , but a low temperature remains speculative . \n unfortunately , there is a third problem with estimating the mass of 2m1207b . \n @xcite have investigated the dependence of the structure models to the initial conditions , and found that the luminosity is very sensitive to the initial conditions for up to 100 myr . in specifically discussing the case of 2m1207b \n , they note that for a `` warm start '' rather than usually assumed `` hot start , '' the best fit mass is @xmath58 rather than @xmath59 . \n the situation , therefore , is that given the now known distance , 2m1207b may be @xmath60 _ if _ current structural models are correct , the red color implies a cool temperature , and there is no disk , but both @xcite and @xcite present plausible scenarios in which the mass is higher . \n we have measured the trigonometric parallax of 2m1207 and found that the distance and space motion are consistent , as expected , with membership in the tw hydrae association . indeed \n , 2m1207 now has a more precise distance determination than tw hya itself . \n there are no difficulties in modelling the primary : it is a @xmath1 mass brown dwarf that is accreting from a circumstellar disk . \n the faint secondary remains problematic . because we do not know the appropriate initial conditions , \n do not have a model atmosphere that reproduces the colors , and do not know whether or not it is observed through a disk , a case can be made that 2m1207b s mass is as low as @xmath61 or as high as @xmath62 . our best estimate is @xmath48 if 2m1207b is not viewed through a disk . \n further study of this planetary mass object is needed ; we particularly need to know if it has an effective temperature of @xmath63k , @xmath64k , or even less . \n we thank eric mamajek and davy kirkpatrick for useful discussions . \n we thank charlie finch for his initial reduction of the parallax data . \n we thank the anonymous referee for a discussion of the tsuji paper . \n we also thank the members of the smarts consortium , without whom the parallax observations could not have been made . \n support for this work was provided by nasa research grant nng06gj03 g . \n the recons parallax program has been supported by the nasa / nsf nstars project , nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) , the national science foundation ( grant ast 05 - 07711 ) , and georgia state university . research has benefitted from the m , l , and t dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org and maintained by chris gelino , davy kirkpatrick , and adam burgasser . \n rrr @xmath65 & @xmath66 & + @xmath67 & @xmath68 & + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & + @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath80 ( mas ) & @xmath81 + @xmath82 ( mas ) & @xmath83 + @xmath84 ( mas ) & @xmath85 + @xmath29 & @xmath86 & + @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 + @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 + @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 + mass ( @xmath96 ) & @xmath97 & @xmath98 +", "StartTimeOffset": 664222138359, "RequestID": "732d619cbf95444b8258c0e2db796371", "TotalTokens": 3622}

{"ContextTokens": 4070, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "the systematic investigation of melting kinetics in alloys , and particular in eutectic and peritectic systems , is much less developed than the investigation of solidification ( for a recent review on solidification see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . \n microstructures , being at the center of materials science and engineering , are formed during the solidification process and , in this sense , the melting process is less attractive for practical applications . \n however , the interfacial pattern selection problem during the melting process might be very interesting . \n for example , in our previous publications @xcite we discussed a free boundary problem for two moving interfaces that strongly interact via the diffusion field in the liquid layer between them . \n this problem arises in the context of liquid film migration during the partial melting of solid alloys @xcite and could also be relevant to the sintering process in the presence of the liquid phase @xcite . for the melting of one - phase alloys to proceed in this way \n , the local equilibrium concentrations have to be different for the two interfaces providing the driving force for the process . \n it is by now well accepted ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the difference of the equilibrium states at the melting and solidification fronts is due to the coherency strain energy which is important only at the melting front because of the sharp concentration profile ahead the moving melting front . \n the other source of elastic deformations during the melting process , even in pure materials , is the density difference between the solid and the liquid phase . \n if the melt inclusion is entirely inside the solid matrix , inhomogeneous elastic deformations inevitably arise . \n the peculiar behavior of the melting kinetics in such systems was discussed in @xcite . \n the main purpose of this paper is to describe the problem of contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems along the boundary between two solid phases ( see fig . 1 and fig . \n the local concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces in such systems are different because of the chemical difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases , and weak coherency strain effects are not so important here . if we also assume that the liquid phase extends up to the sample surfaces , the mentioned elastic deformations due the density difference are not important either , because a weak hydrodynamic flow inside the liquid phase compensates the density difference . \n we concentrate here on the velocity selection problem during the melting along the solid - solid interface . \n the presence of the triple junction ( see fig.1b and fig . \n 2b ) plays a crucial role in this process . in the classical problem of dendritic growth , where the triple junction is not present , the velocity selection is controlled by tiny singular effects of the anisotropy of the surface energy ( for review see @xcite ) . \n the triple junction produces a very strong perturbation of the liquid - solid interfaces and controls the velocity selection . \n the other important difference compared to the classical dendritic problem is that the kinetics of the contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems is controlled by the diffusion inside the needle - like liquid phase and not in the outer phase . \n all features of the contact melting process mentioned so far are common for both systems . \n there is , however , important difference between eutectic and peritectic systems . in the eutectic system ( fig . \n 1 ) both interfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 are melting fronts while in the peritectic system ( fig.2 ) the @xmath0 interface is a solidification front if the temperature @xmath4 is above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 . \n in other words , during the melting of peritectic systems the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies . \n it means that , additionally to the formation of the liquid phase , the polymorphic transition @xmath6 occurs . in this context \n the contact melting in the peritectic system is similar to the process of liquid film migration , mentioned above , where the liquid film is also located between melting and solidification fronts .    finally , we discuss in this paper the evolution of the solid - solid interface due to surface diffusion . \n this process inevitably arises due to the deviation of the interface from a flat configuration in the vicinity of a triple junction . \n we show , however , that surface diffusion does not play a controlling role in the melting kinetics , and only allows for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface . \n we consider the two - dimensional problem of the simultaneous melting of two eutectic phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 along the boundary between them . the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction \n are schematically presented in fig.1 . \n the compositions of the solid phases are close to their equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the eutectic temperature . \n we assume that diffusion in the solid phases is very slow . \n the temperature of the sample , @xmath4 , is slightly above the eutectic temperature @xmath9 ( for the notations see fig.1 ) . at small overheating the concentration field in the liquid \n , @xmath10 obeys the laplace equation @xmath11 we assume local equilibrium at the liquid - solid interfaces . \n then the concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces are : @xmath12 here the notations of the different concentrations are clear from the phase diagram ( fig . \n 1a ) ; the capillary lengths are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface energy of the @xmath15 interface , @xmath16 is atomic volume which is assumed to be the same in all three phases , @xmath17 is the free energy of the liquid phase per atom and @xmath18 is its second derivative with respect to @xmath19 . \n the mass balance conditions at these interfaces read : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase . \n ( [ equil])-([mass ] ) are written for the case of small angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the triple junction . \n this leads to the small angles along the whole interface , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n in this case we can use the so - called `` lubrication '' approximation for the solution of the laplace equation . in this approximation one \n neglects the derivatives with respect to the `` slow '' @xmath27 variable as compared with the derivatives with respect to the `` fast '' @xmath28 variable :    @xmath29    the slow variable functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be found from the boundary condition , eq . \n ( [ equil ] ) : @xmath32 from eqs . \n ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ concentration ] ) we find the following relations , @xmath33 which together with eqs . \n ( [ constant ] ) and ( [ equil ] ) form a closed system of two second order differential equations for the front profiles @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n they are subject to the boundary conditions at the triple junction : @xmath36 @xmath37 ( see fig . \n it follows from eqs . \n ( [ prof ] ) and ( [ bound1 ] ) that @xmath38 where @xmath39 . \n we also find from eq . \n ( [ bound2 ] ) that @xmath40 the relation ( [ match ] ) allows to eliminate the profile @xmath41 and to write the closed equation for the profile @xmath42 . \n moreover , one can integrate this equation once with respect to @xmath27 and finally obtains a nonlinear first order differential equation for the profile @xmath42 : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the dimensionless overheating above the eutectic temperature . \n let us introduce the dimensionless coordinates : @xmath45 then eq . ( [ first ] ) takes the form @xmath46 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 : @xmath48 the solution of this equation starts at the origin with @xmath49 and should have parabolic asymptotics @xmath50 for large values of @xmath51 . \n it turns out that such a smooth solution exists only if the parameter @xmath52 . in other words \n , this is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem which leads to the selection of the velocity @xmath53 : @xmath54 we see that the posed problem has a relatively simple , essentially analytical solution . \n the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction are schematically presented in fig.2 . \n the temperature of the sample is @xmath4 and slightly above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 ( for the notations see fig.2a ) . \n overheating is assumed to be small and the compositions of the solid phases are close to the equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the peritectic temperature . \n ( [ laplace])-([mass ] ) are valid also for the peritectic system where @xmath55 should be replace by @xmath56 and in the second equation in ( [ equil ] ) one should change the sign in front of the capillary term , @xmath57 this reflects the fact that the equilibrium between the @xmath3-phase and the liquid phase corresponds to the negative slope of the liquidus line for the peritectic phase diagram and to the positive slope for the eutectic diagram . as a result , eqs . \n ( [ match])-([angle ] ) remain the same and eq . \n ( [ first ] ) is replaced by @xmath58    we note that the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the peritectic system ( fig . \n 2 ) are negative if we define them in the same way as for the eutectic system : @xmath61 thus , replacing @xmath62 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 by @xmath65 , we recover eq . \n ( [ basic ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 finally , for the steady - state velocity we obtain @xmath68 as we have already noted in the introduction , the interface @xmath69 represents now a solidification front . during the melting , in the peritectic system , \n the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies . \n in addition to the formation of the liquid phase the polymorphic transition @xmath6 takes place . \n we have already mentioned that diffusion along the solid - solid interface plays an important role allowing the necessary rotation of the structure in the vicinity of the triple junction , @xmath70 ( see fig . \n 1b and fig . \n at the same time , far away from the triple junction , the solid - solid interface is parallel to the @xmath27 axis ( @xmath71 ) .    the corresponding surface diffusion equation which describes the @xmath72 interface has been discussed in @xcite and , essentially , it is given by the classical mullins equation @xcite : @xmath73 in this description the diffusion takes place inside of layer of the thickness @xmath74 ( diffusion coefficient is @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 is the corresponding capillary length : @xmath77 } { 2(c_{\\beta}-c_{\\alpha})^2f_{\\alpha}''(c_{\\alpha})f_{\\beta}''(c_{\\beta})}.\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is the free energy of the @xmath79 phase per atom . \n the solution of this equation which has a proper behavior at large values of @xmath27 and satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath84/q;\\,\\,\\,\\,b=[\\kappa(0)/q+\\theta]/(q\\sqrt{3}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 . \n this solution is uniquely defined because the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath22 and @xmath86 are known from the solution given in the previous sections . \n the velocity is given by eqs . \n ( [ velocity ] ) and ( [ velocity1 ] ) for the eutectic and peritectic systems respectively ; the angle @xmath22 is given by eq . \n ( [ angle ] ) for both cases and the curvature of the @xmath87 interface at the triple junction , @xmath88 , is also known since we have already found the concentrations at the triple junction . \n the procedure of calculation of @xmath86 is straightforward but tedious and involves new thermodynamical parameters . \n therefore , we explain this procedure only schematically : the concentrations in the solid phases at the triple junction can be calculated , on one hand , using the condition of local equilibrium with the liquid phase ( along the @xmath89 interface ) and , on the other hand , using the condition of local equilibrium between two solid phases ( along the @xmath90 interface ) . at the triple junction \n these compositions should coincide . \n the capillary corrections to the equilibrium solid concentrations can be written similar to eq . \n ( [ equil ] ) for all there interfaces . \n since the profiles @xmath41 and @xmath42 have been already found , the mentioned continuity condition allows to calculate the curvature @xmath86 of the solid - solid interface . \n we note , however , that the term @xmath91 in eq . \n ( [ ab ] ) is of order @xmath92 and can be neglected compared to @xmath22 for small @xmath60 . \n this means that the tedious calculations explained above are not needed in the limit of small @xmath60 . \n we also note that the characteristic length scales of the solid - solid interfacial pattern are small compared to the characteristic length scales of the melt structures by the same small parameter @xmath93 . \n moreover , the diffusional flux along the solid - solid interface has a nonzero value at the triple junction . in principal , this flux has to be taken into account in the description of the diffusional field in the liquid phase . \n this effect has been neglected in the previous sections . \n more careful analysis shows that corrections to eq . \n ( 6 ) due to this effects are small by the same small parameter , @xmath94 thus , in the limit of small @xmath60 the surface diffusion process has no influence on the kinetics of the contact melting and allows only for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface inside the relatively small region in the vicinity of the triple junction . \n we have developed and analyzed a relatively simple model for the melting kinetics along the solid - solid inter - phase boundaries in eutectic and peritectic systems . \n the process is controlled by the diffusion inside the liquid phase and the existence of the triple junction is crucial for the velocity selection problem . \n the additional assumption of small opening angles @xmath95 at the triple junction plays only a technical role and allows to solve the posed problem essentially analytically using the lubrication approximation for the diffusion field in the liquid phase . \n the obtained scaling results for the dependence of the steady - state velocity of the moving pattern on the overheating , which are exact in the limit of small angles , can still be used for the moderate values of the angles with only prefactors of the order of unity missing . \n we note the obtained scaling relation , @xmath96 , is similar to the scaling relation in eutectic growth . using eq . \n ( [ velocity ] ) and characteristic values of the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 we estimate the characteristic velocity to be of the order of @xmath101 . \n we hope that our results will stimulate some new model experiments on contact melting phenomena . \n 99 h. mller - krumbhaar h , kurz w , brener ea . \n solidification . in : \n kostorz g. editor . \n phase transformations in materials : willey - vch , weinheim , 2002 p.81 . \n temkin de , acta mater . \n 2005;53:2733 brener ea , temkin de . \n lett 2005;94:184501 muschik t , kaysser wa , hehenkamp t. acta metall 1989;37:603 yoon dn , hupmann wj acta metall 1979;27 : 973 yoon dn . int . \n rev 1995;40:149 yoon dn , cahn jw , handwerker ca , blendell je , y. j. baik yj , in : interface migration and control of microstructures . \n . metals . park . \n ohio 1985 , p. 19 . \n brener ea , marchenko vi . \n jetp lett 1992;56:368 brener ea , iordanskii sv , marchenko vi . \n lett 1998;82:1506 kessler d , koplik j , levine h , adv . \n phys 1988;37:255 brener ea , and melnikov vi . adv .", "StartTimeOffset": 674159213536, "RequestID": "38a5165af7d74c6090f2b7684d6b1786", "TotalTokens": 4189}

type accelerator at higher energy . \n the original design of the facility , coupled to developments in superconducting rf technology , makes it feasible to triple the initial design value of cebaf s beam energy to 12  gev in a cost - effective manner \n .    the research program with the 12 gev upgrade will provide breakthroughs in two key areas : ( 1 ) mapping gluonic excitations of mesons and understanding the origin of quark confinement and ( 2 ) searches for physics beyond the standard model . \n the upgrade will also provide important advances in two additional areas : ( 3 ) a direct exploration of the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon and ( 4 ) the physics of nuclei to understand the qcd basis for the nucleon - nucleon force and how nucleons and mesons arise as an approximation to the underlying quark - gluon structure . \n an overview of the upgrade research program is given in its conceptual design report@xcite . \n lattice qcd calculations@xcite have convincingly illustrated the linear quark - quark potential necessary for confinement . \n the quark and anti - quark in a meson are sources of color electric flux , which is trapped in a flux tube connecting the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . however , very little is still known about the direct excitation of that flux tube . \n the observation of such direct manifestations of gluonic degrees of freedom will provide understanding of confinement@xcite . \n the quantum numbers of the flux tube , added to those of a @xmath2 meson , can produce exotic hybrids with unique @xmath3 quantum numbers . \n these excitations can be probed far more effectively with photons than with @xmath4- or k - mesons , because the quark spins are aligned in the virtual vector - meson component of the photon . for a full partial - wave analysis of such excitations \n linearly polarized photons are a requisite . \n the gluex research program will be focused on a definitive measurement of the spectrum of exotic hybrid mesons , expected in a mass range from 1 to 2.5 gev / c@xmath5 . \n one of the more compelling new opportunities with the 12 gev upgrade will be a highly accurate measurement of the weak charge of the electron , via the parity -

weak theory . \n examples of additional pvdis measurements are the value of @xmath8 as @xmath9 , the search for evidence of charge symmetry violation at the partonic level , and the characterization of novel higher - twist effects . \n the pvdis program will require the use of a new large - acceptance spectrometer / detector package , that can in parallel be used for a broad program of exclusive and semi - inclusive reaction processes . \n a main focus of the research program will be the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) through the study of exclusive processes at large momentum transfer . \n the gpds can be considered as overlap integrals between different components of the hadronic wave function@xcite , governed by the selection of the final state . \n measurements of these gpds will thus make it possible to map out quark and gluon wave functions . \n the orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin can be directly accessed through gpds . \n factorization is an essential ingredient in the extraction of gpds . for deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) \n scaling has been shown to be valid already at 6 gev , but for other processes this has still to be established experimentally . \n , on the right the projected determination of various combinations of polarized valence and sea quark distributions from semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering . ] \n one of the most fundamental properties of the nucleon is the structure of its quark distributions at higher @xmath6-values , where the physics of the valence quarks is cleanly exposed . \n the 12 gev upgrade will for the first time ( by providing the necessary combination of high beam intensity and reach in @xmath10 ) allow to map out the valence quark distributions at large @xmath6 with high precision . \n most dynamical models predict that in the limit where a single valence up or down quark carries all of the momentum of the nucleon ( @xmath9 ) , it will also carry all of the spin polarization . \n recent data from hall a for the first time show a hint of a possible upturn in the neutron polarization asymmetry @xmath11 at an @xmath6-value of @xmath120.6 . \n figure [ highx ] ( left ) shows how @xmath11 can be measured up to @xmath6-values close to 0.8 outside the nucleon resonance region with the 12 gev upgrade . \n there is a similar lack of data on other deep inelastic scattering observables in this region . \n one example is the ratio of down to up quarks in the proton , @xmath8 , whose large-@xmath6 behavior is intimately related to the fact that the proton and neutron are the stable building blocks of nuclei . \n this ratio requires measurement of the structure function of the neutron as well as of the proton . \n information about the neutron has so far been extracted from inclusive deuterium data , where it is difficult to disentangle from nuclear effects at large @xmath6 . \n figure [ doveru ] shows the precision with which this fundamental ratio can be measured with the 12 gev upgrade . the proposed experiment will utilize a novel technique ; detection of the slowly recoiling proton spectator \n will @xmath13 scattering events on a nearly on - shell neutron in a deuteron target . \n an independent measurement of @xmath8 can be made by exploiting the mirror symmetry of @xmath14 = 3 nuclei in simultaneous measurements with @xmath15he and @xmath15h targets . \n both methods are designed to largely eliminate the nuclear corrections , thereby permitting the @xmath16 ratio to be extracted with unprecedented precision .    - and @xmath17-quark momentum distributions , @xmath8 , at large @xmath6 . \n the shaded band represents the uncertainty in existing measurements due to nuclear fermi motion effects . ] \n the precise way in which the spin of the nucleon is distributed among its quark and gluon constituents is one of the most fundamental questions that can be addressed in nonperturbative qcd . \n most of the experiments so far have focused on measuring the total quark and gluon contribution to the nucleon spin in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering . in recent years \n the focus has moved to the investigation of specific aspects of the nucleon spin , such as the flavor asymmetries of sea quark distributions and quark transverse spin ( transversity ) distributions . \n the mapping of the flavor dependence of polarized valence and sea quark distributions and the determination of the quark transversity distributions require semi - inclusive measurements , in which the detected final - state hadron reveals information about the spin , flavor , and charge of the @xmath18 quark participating in the deep - inelastic process . \n the 12 gev upgrade will provide a unique opportunity to perform semi - inclusive measurements with high precision over a wide kinematic range , producing a detailed picture of the spin structure of the nucleon . \n figure [ highx ] ( right ) shows how polarized valence and sea quark distributions can be extracted from semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering by detecting the leading @xmath19 and @xmath20 hadrons .    at 12 gev \n , the details of the nucleon - nucleon force can be probed at distance scales much less than the pion compton wave length , where the effects of two - pion exchange , vector - meson exchange , and quark exchange all compete . although well - constrained phenomenologically by the large body of pp and np elastic scattering data , it is not yet understood under \n what circumstances the effective nuclear force can be described in terms of the exchange of mesons , and when it is more efficient to describe the force in terms of the underlying quark - gluon exchange forces . \n alternatively , the atomic nucleus can be used as a laboratory to study how the underlying qcd non - abelian degrees of freedom manifest themselves . \n the idea is here to strike a quark inside the nucleus with such velocity that one can uniquely witness how hadrons emerge on their path through the nucleus . \n our present sketchy understanding of this process will be vastly improved with the 12-gev program at jlab . \n at present cebaf accelerates electrons to 6 gev by recirculating the beam four times through two superconducting linacs , each producing an energy gain of 600 mev per pass . \n both linac tunnels provide sufficient space to install five additional newly designed cryomodules . \n the new cryomodules will each provide over 100 mv ( compared to the 28 mv from the existing ones ) , by increasing the gradient to 20 mv / m and the number of cavity cells from five to seven . \n this will result in a maximum energy gain per pass of 2.2 gev , providing a maximum beam energy to the existing halls a , b and c of 11 gev . \n the new hall d will be provided with the desired maximum energy of 12 gev by adding a tenth arc and recirculating the beam a fifth time through one linac . \n a total of 90 @xmath21a of cw beam can be provided at the maximum beam energy . \n further modifications required are changing the dipoles in the arcs from c - type to h - type magnets , replacing a large number of power supplies and doubling the capacity of the central helium liquifier . \n the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) in hall b is used for experiments that require the detection of several , loosely correlated particles in the hadronic final state at a limited luminosity . \n the clas12 detector has evolved from clas to meet the basic requirements for the study of the structure of nucleons and nuclei with the cebaf 12 gev upgrade . \n the main features are : 1 ) an operating luminosity of @xmath22 10@xmath23 @xmath24s@xmath25 for hydrogen targets , a ten - fold increase over current clas operating conditions ; 2 ) detection capabilities and particle identification for forward - going high momentum charged and neutral particles ; 3 ) improved hermeticity for the detection of charged particles and photons . \n clas12 makes use of several existing detector components . \n major new components include new superconducting torus coils that cover only the forward - angle range , a new gas erenkov counter for pion identification , additions to the electromagnetic calorimeters , and the central detector . \n the hall c facility has generally been used for experiments which require high luminosity at moderate resolution . \n the core spectrometers are the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) and the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) . \n the hms has a maximum momentum of 7.6 gev / c . at a 12-gev jefferson lab \n , the sos spectrometer will be replaced by a new magnetic spectrometer , the super high momentum spectrometer ( shms ) , powerful enough to analyze charged particles with momenta approaching that of the highest energy beam . charged particles with such high momenta \n are boosted by relativistic kinematics into the forward detection hemisphere . \n therefore , the shms is designed through the use of a small horizontal bend magnet to achieve angles down to 5.5@xmath26 ( and up to 25@xmath26 ) . \n the shms will cover a solid angle up to 5 msr , and boasts a large momentum and target acceptance . \n the magnetic spectrometer pair will be rigidly connected to a central pivot . \n the present base instrumentation in hall a has been used for experiments which require high luminosity and high resolution in momentum and/or angle of at least one of the reaction products . \n the central elements are the two high resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) , to which recently a third spectrometer has been added with a large acceptance ( bigbite ) . \n the beamline into hall a will be upgraded so that the hall will be able to accept the full range of beam energies available for two major purposes . \n the first will be to continue the use of the three existing spectrometers . the second purpose for hall a will be to stage major installation experiments . with a diameter of over 50 m , hall a is the largest experimental hall at jefferson lab and \n can easily accommodate major installations such as the proposed parity - violation setups . \n the gluex experiment will be housed in a new aboveground experimental hall ( hall d ) located at the east end of the cebaf north linac . a collimated beam of linearly polarized photons ( with 40% polarization ) of energy 8.5 to 9 gev , optimum for the production of exotic hybrids in its expected mass range , \n will be produced via coherent bremsstrahlung with 12 gev electrons . \n this requires carefully aligned thin diamond crystal radiators . \n the scattered electron from the bremsstrahlung will be tagged with sufficient precision to determine the photon energy to within 0.1% . \n the gluex detector uses an existing 2.25 t superconducting solenoid that is currently being refurbished . \n an existing 3000-element lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter will be reconfigured to match the downstream aperture of the solenoid . \n inside the full length of the solenoid , a lead and scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter will provide position and energy measurement for photons and tof information for charged particles . \n a simple start counter will surround the 30 cm long liquid hydrogen target . \n this in turn will be surrounded by cylindrical straw - tube drift - chambers which will fill the region between the target and the cylindrical calorimeter . \n planar drift chambers will be placed inside the solenoid downstream of the target to provide accurate track reconstruction for charged particles going in the forward direction . \n this detector configuration has 4@xmath4 hermeticity and momentum / energy and position information for charged particles and photons produced from incoming 9 gev photons . \n it has been carefully optimized to carry out partial wave analysis of many - particle final states . \n the final planned photon flux is @xmath27 photons / s . at this flux \n the experiment will accumulate in one year of running a factor of 100 more meson data than are presently available even from pion production . \n in april of 2004 the us department of energy ( doe ) signed cd-0 approval for the 12 gev upgrade project , acknowledging the mission need for this project . \n then , in february of 2006 doe approved the preliminary baseline range through the second critical decision . \n two further review processes in increasing level of detail , spaced 12 to 18 months apart , have to be successfully passed before construction funding for the project will be allocated . \n the 12 gev upgrade project is the only large construction project underway at the nuclear physics program office in the doe office of science . at present 11 gev beam to at least one hall and the start of the first experiments \n is expected in 2012 , with full operations in all four halls to commence by late 2014 .    at jefferson lab \n a plan for the next upgrade , involving an electron - ion collider is already being developed . \n initial design studies have yielded a promising concept for up to 150 gev protons colliding with up to 7 gev electrons ( or positrons ) at a luminosity of close to @xmath28 @xmath24s@xmath25 , thus at a center - of - mass energy of up to 65 gev . both electrons or positrons and protons \n would be circulating in two storage rings with four interaction regions at maximum polarization for either beam . \n light ions up to mass @xmath12 40 would also be available .      9 , 2005 , http://www.jlab.org/div_dept + /physics_division / gev / doe_review / cdr_for_science_review.pdf . \n g.s . bali _ \n et al . _ , \n proceedings of int . conf . \n on quark confinement and the hadron spectrum , world scientific , 1995 , p. 225 . \n n. isgur , r. kokoski and j. paton , ; + s. godfrey and j. napolitano , . \n x. ji , ; a. radyushkin , .", "StartTimeOffset": 685444951893, "RequestID": "a519bb5227b547dfa5f90bef3981aecf", "TotalTokens": 4214}
{"ContextTokens": 3525, "GeneratedTokens": 198, "SynthesizedBody": "due to its large center of mass energy the lhc provides an ideal opportunity to test bfkl - driven observables @xcite . among them both central production processes , such as heavy quark production @xcite , forward production of high @xmath0 jets @xcite and drell - yan pairs @xcite , and processes with hard events in both forward and backward direction , _ i.e. _ forward - backward ( ` mueller - navelet ' ) jets @xcite and forward @xmath1 boson production combined with a backward jet @xcite . \n an observable of particular interest is given by forward / backward jets with a rapidity gap ( ` mueller - tang ' jets ) . \n this process is special since it allows to probe the non - forward bfkl kernel , unlike the previously mentioned processes restricted to the forward case . from a phenomenological point of view \n the description in terms of the non - forward bfkl green s function is of relevance , since the latter describes a color singlet @xmath2-channel exchange . unlike configurations which merely suppress emissions above a certain veto scale , \n the non - forward bfkl green s function therefore describes a @xmath2-channel exchange with emissions into the gap region intrinsically absent . \n while the non - forward bfkl kernel is currently available at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite , only the virtual nlo corrections to the impact factors @xcite are currently known ; phenomenological studies , see _ \n @xcite , are therefore limited to leading order ( lo ) impact factors . as \n nlo corrections to bfkl observables are often found to be size - able , this limitation to lo impact factors is currently one of the main drawbacks of bfkl phenomenology . a powerful tool to overcome this limitation is given by lipatov s effective action  @xcite . \n it is given in terms of the conventional qcd action to which a new induced term is added . \n the latter contains a new effective degree of freedom , the reggeized gluon , which has been introduced in order to achieve a gauge invariant factorization of qcd amplitudes in the high energy limit . \n the determination of higher order corrections within this effective action is at first plagued by both technical and conceptual difficulties . \n loop corrections show a new type of divergence , which is not present in usual qcd feynman diagrams . supplementing the qcd action with the additional induced term leads to an apparent over - counting problem . \n these problems have been addressed and resolved recently , first in the context of lo transition kernels  @xcite and later on in the calculation of nlo corrections to the forward quark - initiated jet vertex @xcite and the quark contribution to the two - loop gluon trajectory @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite .    in this contribution \n we present some details of the determination of the missing real nlo correction to the quark -

cone singularity @xmath15 . \n as discussed in  @xcite this pole should be treated as a cauchy principal value . \n the starting point for the determination of the quark induced mueller - tang jet impact factors is given by the quark - quark scattering amplitude with color singlet exchange . in the high energy limit such a scattering amplitude factorizes ( in terms of a transverse convolution integral ) into the two reggeized gluon exchange in the color singlet ( which can be understood as the lowest order contribution to the perturbative pomeron ) and two impact factors ( which describe the coupling of the two reggeized gluon state to the external quarks ) , see fig . \n [ fig : mt ] .        due to high energy factorization , the longitudinal part of the loop integral _ \n i.e. _ the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) integration , can be entirely associated with the upper ( lower ) impact factor . at cross -

{"ContextTokens": 2238, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "to provide accurate observational constraints for pre - main sequence evolutionary models , and thereby improve our understanding of star - formation , it is crucial to measure as accurately as possible the properties ( age , mass , luminosity , etc . ) of individual young stars . \n the determination of most of these parameters , however , depends critically on the often poorly known distance to the object under consideration . while the average distance to nearby low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g.  taurus or @xmath0ophiuchus ) has been estimated to about 20% precision using indirect methods ( elias 1978a , b ; kenyon et al . \n 1994 ; knude & hog 1998 ; bertout & genova 2006 ) , the line - of - sight depth of these regions is largely unknown , and accurate distances to individual objects are still missing . \n even the highly successful hipparchos mission ( perryman et al .  1997 ) did little to improve the situation ( bertout et al . \n 1999 ) because young stars are still heavily embedded in their parental clouds and are , therefore , faint in the optical bands observed by hipparchos . \n low - mass young stars often generate non - thermal continuum emission produced by the interaction of free electrons with the intense magnetic fields that tend to exist near their surfaces ( e.g.feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) . \n if the magnetic field intensity and the electron energy are sufficient , the resulting compact radio emission can be detected with very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi e.g.andr et al . \n the relatively recent possibility of accurately calibrating the phase of vlbi observations of faint , compact radio sources using nearby quasars makes it possible to measure the absolute position of these objects ( or , more precisely , the angular offset between them and the calibrating quasar ) to better than a tenth of a milli - arcsecond ( brisken et al . \n 2000 , 2002 ; loinard et al .  2005 , 2007 ; torres et al .  2007 ; xu et al . \n 2006 ; hachisuka et al . \n 2006 ; hirota et al . \n 2007 ; sandstrom et al .  2007 ) . \n this level of precision is sufficient to constrain the trigonometric parallax of sources within a few hundred parsecs of the sun ( in particular of nearby young stars ) with a precision better than a few percents using multi - epoch vlbi observations . with this goal in mind \n , we have initiated a large project aimed at accurately measuring the trigonometric parallax of a sample of magnetically active young stars in the most prominent and often - studied northern star - forming regions within 1 kpc of the sun ( taurus , @xmath0ophiuchus , perseus , serpens , etc . ) using the 10-element very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) . here \n , we will summarize the results obtained so far in taurus and ophiuchus . \n all the observations used here were obtained in the continuum at 3.6 cm ( 8.42 ghz ) with the _ very long baseline array _ ( vlba ) of the _ national radio astronomy observatory _ ( nrao ) . \n a total of 7 sources were studied so far : three in taurus ( t tau , hubble 4 , and hde  283572 ) , and four in ophiuchus ( s1 , doar21 , vssg14 , and wl5 ) . in all cases , \n between 6 and 12 observations spread over 1.5 to 2 years were obtained . \n the data were edited and calibrated following the standard vlba procedures for phase - referenced observations ( see loinard et al . \n 2007 , and torres et al . \n 2007 for details ) . \n the displacement of the sources on the celestial sphere is the combination of their trigonometric parallax ( @xmath1 ) and their proper motions ( @xmath2 ) . for isolated sources ( such as hubble 4 , and hde  283572 in our case ) , it is common to consider linear and uniform proper motions , so the right ascension and the declination vary as a function of time @xmath3 as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinates of the source at a given reference epoch , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the components of the proper motion , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the projections over @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , of the parallactic ellipse .    for sources in multiple systems , however , the proper motions are affected by the gravitational influence of the other members of the system . as a consequence , \n the motions are curved and accelerated , rather than linear and uniform . if the orbital period is long compared with the timespan covered by the observations ( as will be the case for t tau see loinard et al . \n 2003 ) , it is sufficient to include a uniform acceleration in the fit . \n this leads to functions of the form :    .distances to the sources in taurus and ophiuchus [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the proper motions at a reference epoch , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the projections of the uniform acceleration ( see fig \n .  1 for a comparison between fits with and without acceleration terms ) . \n finally , if a source is a member of a multiple system whose orbital period is shorter than , or comparable with the timespan covered by the observations ( as will be the case for all ophiuchus sources ) , then a full keplerian fit is needed , but additionnal observations are required to properly constrain that fit . \n these observations are currently being obtained for all ophiuchus sources , but are not yet analyzed . as a consequence , \n the fits presented bellow for the ophiuchus sources are based on eqs . \n [ uni1 ] and [ uni2 ] . \n the resulting uncertainties will be much larger than for the sources in taurus because the orbital motions generate an unmodelled scatter around the mean positions of the sources . \n these increased errors should disappear once we include the new observations , and perform a full keplerian fit . \n the distance to the seven sources studied here are given in tab .  1 . \n for the taurus sources , hipparchos parralaxes ( bertout et al . \n 1999 ) , and/or estimates based on a modified convergent point method ( bertout & genova 2006 ) are available . \n our measurements are always consistent with these values , but are one to two orders of magnitude more accurate . only one other source in taurus ( v773 tau ; lestrade et al.1999 ) \n has a vlbi - based parallax determination . taking the mean of that and our 3 measurements \n , we estimate the mean distance to the taurus cluster to be @xmath18 = 137 pc . \n the dispersion about that mean leads to a full width at half maximum depth of about 20 pc , comparable to the linear extent of taurus on the plane of the sky . \n traditionnaly assumed to be at a distance of 165 pc ( chini 1981 ) , ophiuchus has recently been proposed to be somewhat nearer , at 120 pc ( knude & hog 1998 ) . \n interestingly , two of our sources are consistent with the traditionnal value , but the other two are consistent with a distance of 120 pc . since ophiuchus is only a few parsecs across on the plane of the sky , it is very unlikely to be 40 pc deep . \n it is noteworthy that the two sources at about 120 pc ( s1 and doar21 ) are associated with the sub - condensation oph a , whereas the two sources at @xmath19 165 pc ( vssg14 and wl5 ) are associated with the condensation oph b ( see motte et al . \n 1998 for an overview of the ophiuchus complex ) . \n thus , a plausible explanation of our results is that two physically unrelated star - forming regions are located along the line - of - sight toward ophiuchus . \n interestingly , knude & hog ( 1998 ) noticed an effect that would be consistent with this possibility in their analysis of extinction towards ophiuchus . while a clear extinction step was clearly visible at 120 pc \n , extinction was apparently extending up to about 160 pc . \n additional vlbi observations will be needed to confirm the existence of two regions of star - formation towards ophiuchus , and to investigate at which distance the other condensations in ophiuchus are located . \n the present results show that vlba observations of non - thermal sources associated with young stars have the potential to improve very significantly our knowledge of the space distribution of star - forming regions in the solar neighborod . \n indeed , the precision obtained by these measurements is even sufficient to probe the 3d structure of star - forming regions . coupled with pre - main sequence evolutionnary models , such information could be used to reconstruct the history of star - formation with individual regions .", "StartTimeOffset": 705412110100, "RequestID": "fcdb096afb654c958278e4c565f54812", "TotalTokens": 2452}
{"ContextTokens": 3734, "GeneratedTokens": 224, "SynthesizedBody": "a long standing goal in optics is the development and improvement of precision optical metrology . in the first paper on weak values in 1988 @xcite , aharanov , \n albert and vaidman suggested that the weak value effect might be used as an amplifier in order to measure ( in the case they were considering ) the value of a small magnetic field by looking at the anomalously large deflection of a beam of atoms traversing a stern - gerlach apparatus . \n the general validity of this weak value effect was later shown experimentally in an optical context by ritchie _ \n @xcite , who replaced the magnetic spin with transverse polarization , and brunner _ et al . _ \n @xcite , who illustrated the pervasiveness of the weak value effect in common optical telecom networks . \n more recently , the amplification properties of this weak value effect have been exploited in similar optical systems to precisely measure beam deflection @xcite , phase shifts @xcite , frequency shifts @xcite , time delays @xcite , and even temperature shifts @xcite , by using either polarization or which - path degrees of freedom . \n although these experiments can be described using classical wave optics @xcite , the analysis using quantum techniques provides additional insight and allows for future extension to cases with no classical counterpart . \n hence , we shall continue to use a quantum approach in this work as well . \n our theoretical analysis begins with the rochester setup @xcite , where the tilt of a moving mirror within an interferometer is detected from the signal on a split - detector . \n while this setup has a sub - picoradian resolution with only milliwatts of laser power , there are a number of ways this can be improved to yield even greater sensitivity . \n a generic shortcoming of weak - value - related metrological techniques is the fact that only a small fraction of the events are `` post - selected '' , while the vast majority of events are intentionally thrown away . \n the main goal of the current work is to investigate how this situation can be further improved if those events are recycled . \n this will be done by taking photons which are not post - selected and reinjecting them back into the interferometer , so that eventually , every photon can be post - selected in principle . \n we will see that this strategy does indeed lead to an improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio of the desired parameter , effectively given by the power increase of the split - detection signal . \n moreover , since the existing single - pass weak - value amplification already achieves the sensitivity of standard measurement techniques ( such as homodyne detection ) but with lower technical noise @xcite , the improvements from recycling should _ exceed _ the sensitivity of the standard techniques . \n we note that because we employ not just a single pass , but many passes of a given photon through the interferometer , the simple weak value formula used in the first paper on the subject @xcite will no longer suffice , and we must develop a theoretical formalism for multiple passes that will account for the amplification of the deflection , as well as the probability of reaching the detector after some number of traversals . \n while the recycling scheme is an important advance in its own right ( and can be generically applied to all weak value amplification schemes ) , it also lends itself to further enhancement if combined with other precision metrology techniques currently in use . \n for example , the inclusion of a spatial filter or parity - flipping element to zeno - stabilize the beam , or the use of a squeezed reference beam @xcite could significantly reduce degradation effects and quantum noise , respectively . \n the recycling technique , therefore , sets the stage for combined weak value / quantum light amplification strategies for future research . \n furthermore , though our present work focuses on a novel pulsed recycling method , possible extensions to continuous wave operation may allow for the use of power recycling @xcite and signal recycling @xcite techniques , both of which are in use in modern gravitational wave detectors @xcite . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section \n [ sec : qual ] we give a heuristic estimation of the expected gains from a recycling setup based on qualitative power considerations and accessible laboratory conditions . in section  [ sec : collimated ] we analytically compute the exact recycling solution for a particular setup under the assumption that the beam can stay perfectly collimated . in section  [ sec : diverging ] we relax this assumption with a numerical treatment including diffraction effects . \n we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n our baseline for comparison will be the rochester continuous wave ( cw ) sagnac interferometric scheme described in @xcite . \n we wish to improve the detected signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by using a combination of pulsed laser operation with the same average power output and a design that sends the undetected portion of each pulse back into the interferometer . \n such a setup is illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup ] for reference . \n however , before committing to a particular recycling design we can make fairly general estimations about the increases in sensitivity that we expect from any similar recycling scheme .     between the clockwise ( @xmath0 ) and counter - clockwise ( @xmath1 ) traveling paths . \n the piezo - driven mirror imparts a transverse momentum kick @xmath2 that differs by a sign for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 paths . \n a split detector is placed at the dark port to measure a resulting pulse deflection . \n the h - polarized part of the pulse that exits the bright port is rotated again by the active pc back to v before being confined by the pbs and mirror to return the pulse to the interferometer through the pc , now _ \n inactive_. ]      the constraints on how much we can increase the power collected by the dark port detector in order to improve the measurement sensitivity depend crucially on the relative time scales involved , which include :    1 .   the pulse duration @xmath3 being emitted by the laser . for typical lasers \n this can vary between @xmath4 ns and @xmath5  fs reasonably , which correspond to pulse lengths of @xmath6 m and @xmath7 m , respectively . \n 2 .   the repetition period @xmath8 of the laser . for typical lasers \n the repetition rate @xmath9 can vary from @xmath4  hz to several ghz reasonably . \n 3 .   the traversal period @xmath10 of the interferometer setup . \n this is determined by the physical size of the setup . as an upper - bound estimate , a @xmath11 \n m long recycling setup will have a total period of @xmath12 ns . \n the gating time @xmath13 for adding new pulses to the interferometer . \n this will determine the minimum inter - pulse spacing @xmath14 inside the interferometer . \n this also must be strictly less than the time between pulses emitted by the laser @xmath15 so that every new laser pulse can be injected . for a pockels cell , @xmath16 ns . \n these are summarized in table  [ tab : timescales ] . \n .relevant time scales for a recycling experiment . [ \n cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ] \n and @xmath17 . in order of \n ( blue , solid ) , ( red , dashed ) , ( purple , dot - dashed ) , and ( brown , dotted ) we show weak initial diverging lenses with extreme focal lengths @xmath18 and no lens . \n the ( black , dashed ) curve shows the scaling given by power considerations in eq .  . \n here @xmath19 refers to the snr of a single unrecycled pulse with an optimally chosen focal length of @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the accumulated snr over @xmath22 traversals for the indicated lens choices . \n , width=288 ]    by assuming a collimated beam , we have so far neglected beam propagation effects in the analysis , as well as any lens effects that could further change the detection physics . in order to incorporate these effects , \n we now alter our measurement operators and pursue a numerical approach . \n we find that these effects may slightly enhance the snr gains from recycling before saturation due to the finite detector size , but do not fundamentally alter the basic power - scaling behavior . \n for that reason , it will be sufficient to illustrate only the weak - value regime as an example .    extending the collimated analysis in section  [ sec : collimated ] to include beam propagation leads to a replacement of the measurement operators with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the carrier momentum of the pulse , and @xmath26 is the propagation length from piezo to 50:50 beam splitter @xcite \n . the number density will then involve the composite measurement operator @xmath27 adding a diverging lens with focal length @xmath28 also modifies the initial state with an operator @xmath29 . \n hence , powers of the following modified operators will appear in the full solution ,    [ eq : recursiveparts ] @xmath30    which can be simplified recursively , as detailed in appendix  [ sec : recursiveappendix ] . \n the effect of a diverging lens is considered for comparison with the unrecycled experiment in ref . \n @xcite , where such a lens was able to enhance sensitivity . \n table  [ tab : numericalparameters ] shows the parameters which describe the laser and experimental geometry . \n our choice of @xmath25 corresponds to the 780 - 800 nm lasers used in @xcite , and the 3-meter interferometer length @xmath26 is taken from the generous upper bound estimate discussed in section  [ sec : qual ] as a worst case scenario for beam divergence effects . for the weak - value regime of small @xmath31 and @xmath32 \n such that @xmath33 , we found that it was more computationally efficient to expand the sine and cosine functions in to second order in @xmath2 and fourth order in @xmath32 , as shown in appendix  [ sec : truncation ] . to test the validity of this truncation \n , we initially set the interferometer length @xmath26 to zero so that a comparison could be made with the previously calculated collimated solutions . \n we restrict our attention to the snr gains achieved by recycling a single pulse for @xmath22 traversals , since adding more pulses leads to a simple scaling of the single pulse result . \n the snr gains for different choices of initial diverging lens are shown in fig . \n [ fig : snrplateaus ] , where they are compared to the ideal power - scaling curve that we expect from our qualitative considerations given by . in all cases , \n the expected gains roughly follow the qualitative power scaling rule for a large number of traversals before saturating due to the beam growing larger than the finite size of the split - detector . \n note that the beam divergence mitigates the snr decay that was observed for the collimated case , even without beam stabilization due to flipping or zeno reshaping . \n by investigating the optical design shown in fig .  [ \n fig : setup ] , we have shown how a single optical pulse can be trapped inside the interferometer until the photons all exit the dark port and are `` post - selected , '' greatly boosting the sensitivity of the precision measurement . \n the added power accumulated at the detector within a fixed duration of time is the dominant source of sensitivity gain . \n further increases are achievable by trapping multiple pulses in the interferometer simultaneously . \n the number of trapped pulses is limited by the length of the pulses , the gating frequency of current pockels cells , and the physical size of the interferometer . \n we carefully analyzed the case of a collimated beam and showed that repeated post - selections cause a walk - off effect in the recycled pulse , which tends to diminish the snr . \n however , we also showed that these walk - off effects can be easily corrected by zeno reshaping , or by a parity flip , which reflects the beam around its optic axis on each traversal . \n somewhat surprisingly , the gains with parity correction can even exceed those expected from the power scaling . including propagation effects \n does not destroy the sensitivity gain shown for the collimated case , but instead can produce additional enhancement .    while these sensitivity gains alone are a substantial improvement over the original idea , the combination of these techniques with other established metrology techniques  such as the use of a squeezed reference beam \n could further increase the sensitivity beyond that indicated here . \n we acknowledge support from the us army research office grants no . \n 62270phii : stir , and no . w911nf-09 - 0 - 01417 , as well as the national science foundation grant no . dmr-0844899 . \n 27ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] \n + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) \n @noop `` , ''   ( ) , @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) in  @noop _ _  ( ,  )  pp . \n @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ) \n using equations and from above , an exact recursive simplification can be constructed . \n written explicitly in the momentum basis we have @xmath34 where the functions @xmath35 are given by the recursion relation @xmath36 the overall measurement operator is then given simply by multiplying the unitary operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the right . \n note that each pulse retains the phase and momentum information accumulated from previous traversals . \n given an input gaussian profile as in , we find @xmath39 with @xmath40    the solution with no initial diverging lens is given by taking limit @xmath41 , which modifies equation   with the replacement @xmath42 . \n similarly , setting @xmath43 recovers the collimated solution as expected . \n truncating the measurement operators that include propagation effects to second order in @xmath2 and fourth order in @xmath32 for the weak value regime produces the expressions ,    [ eq : approximateexpansions ] @xmath44{\\langle p \\rvert } , \\nonumber \\\\   { \\hat{\\bm u}}_\\ell^2 { \\hat{\\bm m}}_+ & = \\int \\ ! \\mathrm{d}p{\\lvert p\\rangle}e^{-ip^2\\ell / k_0}\\ , \\times \\\\   & \\qquad \\left[1 - \\frac{\\phi^2}{8 } + \\frac{\\phi^4}{384 } + \\frac{ik\\phi}{2}\\partial_p - \\frac{ik\\phi^3}{48}\\partial_p \n \\right.\\nonumber \\\\   & \\qquad\\quad\\left . \n + \\frac{k^2}{2}\\partial_p^2 - \\frac{k^2\\phi^2}{16}\\partial_p^2\\right]{\\langle p \\rvert } . \n \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]", "StartTimeOffset": 715315470859, "RequestID": "d49be6be4b3942708bf561e20b7e9511", "TotalTokens": 3958}

( 2002 , 2003 ) present five possible channels for the formation of sdb stars , three of them will form sdbs in binary systems . \n [ fig4 ] shows the orbital period distribution predicted by their favoured model . \n the plot also presents our data in the form of vertical ticks on the horizontal axis . \n most of the binaries in our sample seem to have formed via the second common envelope ( ce ) ejection channel ( short period binaries with wd companions ) , some via the first ce ejection channel ( short to intermediate periods with main sequence companions ) . \n their models predict the formation of a large number of long period binaries via the first roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) channel ( first suggested by tutukov &  yungleson 1990 ) . up to this day \n we have only detected one of such system with an orbital period of a few hundred days in our sample . \n we seem to be missing a very large population of binaries with large orbital periods . \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 ) \n ( 100,0)(10,20 ) ( 0,0 )    our sample suffers from several important biases :    * \\1 . \n targets have been selected from 3 main surveys , pg , kpd and ec . \n the pg survey is biased against companions of g and k spectral type as any target with a spectrum showing caii h - lines was taken off the survey . \n this should be taken into account when looking at the companions of sdbs as most of the ones from the pg survey will be wds instead of main sequence stars . \n this has important consequences when one intends to compare binary formation models with observations . \n it is difficult to assess how important this bias is . \n a second important bias is given by the resolution of the spectra . \n up to now we have used intermediate resolution spectrographs to measure radial velocities . \n longer period systems will show smaller amplitude radial velocities and we are probably missing them . \n the use of higher resolution spectrographs might change significantly the picture we have at the moment . * \n \\3 . only now , after almost four years of observations , is the time baseline getting long enough to detect the longer period systems . \n this can explain the dearth of long period systems compared to han et al.s ( 2003 ) predictions . \n all targets we have observed are bright ( v @xmath9 14.5 ) . \n it is also well known that the pg survey is incomplete at bright magnitudes due to saturation of the plates . \n all targets are in the disk of the galaxy ( see fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n the more sdbs we study the more binaries we find , the fraction we find being of the order of 2/3 in agreement with maxted et al . \n most of the binaries found seemed to have formed via the first and second ce ejection phases but we are starting to find systems that might have formed through the first rlof as predicted by han et al . \n ( 2003 ) . \n the int is operated on the island of la palma by the ing in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the iac . \n we thank patt for their support of this program . \n the radcliffe telescope is operated by the south african astronomical observatory .", "StartTimeOffset": 725986892291, "RequestID": "e3f263200aee4025bb14fb423e9a8858", "TotalTokens": 2918}

dimensional systems to high levels with high precision . \n we study the hamiltonians associated with the complex cubic potential @xmath11 @xmath12 and with the complex hnon - heiles potential @xmath13 @xmath14 both hamiltonians are not hermitian . \n rather , they respect the @xmath0 symmetry and the @xmath15 parity : @xmath16=0,&\\qquad & [ h,{\\cal p}_y]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the total parity @xmath17 , the time reversal @xmath18 , and the @xmath15 parity @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 although the hamiltonians are complex , the secular equations are real due to the @xmath0 symmetry \n . they can only depend on @xmath21 . \n therefore , both systems are invariant under @xmath22 . \n since the @xmath15 parity is an unbroken symmetry , we can diagonalize @xmath23 and @xmath19 simultaneously . \n all the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 are also eigenfunctions of @xmath19 with eigenvalues @xmath24 . \n we use different methods to compute the eigenvalues of each system . \n we found complex conjugate pairs when the levels cross between same @xmath15-parity states . at higher level \n , the level crossing happens at smaller coupling constant . \n this indicates that no matter how small the coupling constant is , there are always complex eigenvalues at high enough levels . \n it shows the rich structure in the two -

element method ( fem ) . \n the fem results for eigenvalues with @xmath11 potential are shown as crosses in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] . * \n the third method is based on the expansion in two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis @xcite . \n we first analytically compute the non - vanishing matrix elements of the full hamiltonian on the two - dimensional ho eigenfunctions basis . depending on the precision requirement \n , we truncate the sparse matrix to a finite size . and the eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian can be obtained by numerically diagonalizing this finite matrix . \n this method is a mixture of analytic and numerical techniques . \n it turns out that this is the best way to compute the eigenvalues of the two - dimensional complex hamiltonians . \n the results are shown as dots in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] and crosses in fig . \n [ fig : hh_re ] and fig . \n [ fig : hh_im ] .    from fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] we can clearly to see that all three methods provide consistent informations about the real part of the eigenvalues . and fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] shows the two numerical methods are consistent on the imaginary part of the eigenvalues . \n using perturbation theory , we calculate the eigenvalues as power series of the coupling constant @xmath26 . here are the first few terms for the first 10 eigenvalues : @xmath27 we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series . \n the results are shown as lines in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_re ] . from the figure \n , we may see that some pad expansions have poles and cross each others .    in the same figure , \n we show the real parts of eigenvalues from fem as crosses and from ho expansions as dots . \n the two sets of numerical results clearly agree with each other . and \n surprisingly , up to the crossing points , the pad expansions fit the numerical results very well . \n although the hamiltonian @xmath30 has @xmath0 symmetry , some energy eigenvalues are complex . \n the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by two numerical methods are shown in fig . \n [ fig : xy2_im ] .     with the complex cubic potential . \n lines are from perturbative expansion using @xmath29 pad . \n crosses are results using fem . \n dots are results using the method based on two -

heiles potential , a similar patten appears . the energy eigenvalues become complex when @xmath35 . \n there are special features for this interaction .    * first , there are all rational numbers in every term of eigenvalues in the perturbation expansion . * \n second , there are an accident degeneracy between odd and even @xmath15-parity . most of the energy levels are degenerated , but interestingly , not all of them . \n for example , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , but @xmath39 . \n in fact , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same up to the order of @xmath21 , but for the order of @xmath42 and higher , they separate . \n this patten remains the same for higher exciting states : * * for even @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc . \n * * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc . \n * * for odd @xmath46 , @xmath49 starting from the order of @xmath42 . * third , @xmath50 appears to be non - alternating in signs in the expansion . and \n this is a unique case up to @xmath51 . \n here are the first few terms for the first 21 eigenvalues : @xmath52 as in the previous section , we actually continue this expansion up to the order of @xmath28 , then use @xmath29 pad to extract the information from the divergent series . \n the results are shown as lines in fig . \n [ fig : hh_re ] . \n the results from ho expansions are shown as crosses in the same figure . once again , we found the pad expansions fit the numerical results up to the crossing points . \n the @xmath0 symmetry is also broken in this hamiltonian . \n some eigenvalues cross and form complex conjugate pairs . \n the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues by ho expansions are shown in fig . \n [ fig : hh_im ] .     with the complex hnon - heiles potential . \n lines are from perturbative expansion using @xmath29 pad . \n crosses are from ho expansions . \n even @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath53 '' and odd @xmath15-parity states are using `` @xmath54''.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     with the complex hnon -

hermitian potentials as in ref . \n it could also be due to the level contraction instead of level repulsion in the non - hermitian quantum mechanics . \n the results indicate that there is no critical value of the coupling constant to have reality in this degenerated setup . in the analogue with the @xmath6 interaction studied in ref . \n @xcite , it is possible that small enough coupling constant exhibits entire real spectrum in the non -

either @xmath7 or @xmath8 is a fitted parameter . for the photometry we fit for @xmath7 plus \n the remaining parameters and set @xmath8 = 0.75 as is appropriate for variation dominated by an irradiation effect . \n this produces an ephemeris with minimum light at phase zero : @xmath9 figure [ 6026 ] shows the light curve folded on this ephemeris and the sine curve fit . \n the rms variation of the data from the fitted sine curve is 0.010 magnitude . \n the remaining parameters from the sine fitting are @xmath10 mag ( instrumental ) and @xmath11 mag . \n as with ngc 6026 , the light curve of ngc 6337 in figure [ 6337 ] shows apparently well - behaved periodic variability . \n the periodogram showed periodic variability with a strong one day alias . \n the peak with the most power was located at a period of 0.173 days . \n since ngc 6337 appears as a ring , the nebular background close to the central star is at a minimum , allowing more accurate photometry . \n this , along with the obvious slope to each night of observation allowed all but the highest peak to be rejected . \n the corresponding period was taken as a starting point for fitting a sine curve of the same form as equation 1 , for ngc 6026 . \n the derived photometric ephemeris for minimum light in ngc 6337 is then @xmath12 figure [ 6337 ] shows the light curve folded on this ephemeris and the sine curve fit . \n the rms variation of the data from the fitted sine curve is 0.016 magnitude . \n the remaining parameters from the sine fitting are @xmath13 mag ( instrumental ) and @xmath14 mag . \n the short orbital periods allow limits to be placed on several of the binary system parameters . taking the masses of both css to be @xmath15 , typical of cspne \n , kepler s 2nd law gives the binary separation as a function of secondary mass . \n the small deviation from a sine curve , short orbital periods , and significant reflection effects observed in the two systems suggest that the companions are cool dwarf stars which do not fill , or just fill , their roche lobes . \n to find an upper limit for the secondary masses , i will assume that both secondaries are main sequence stars and do not fill their roche lobes . \n this condition is met for the two systems , according to their corresponding orbital periods and for @xmath16 , by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n these correspond to binary separations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . \n a few comments may be made about the binary system inclinations as well . \n corradi et al . \n ( 2000 ) show that the ring - like structure of ngc 6337 is the narrow waist of a nearly pole - on bipolar pn . \n the inclination of the pn then must be @xmath21 for the bright inner ring to have no apparent ellipticity . \n ngc 6026 does not appear ring - shaped , but as a partial ellipse with a very faint south - east edge . \n if this pn is what bond ( 2000 ) refers to as a `` wedding ring '' pn , then the inclination must be intermediate and can be roughly determined from the ellipticity of the observed pn . \n the ellipse measures @xmath22 , giving an inclination of @xmath23 . \n if the binary mechanism for shaping pne is correct , then the close binary css must have inclinations equal to those of the pne . \n finally , previous studies have found the fraction of detectable close binary cspne to be @xmath24 ( bond 2000 ) . \n the binary fraction found here is 25% , much higher than previous studies , though the low number of statistics means that the results are reasonably similar . \n since the sample observed in this study was not randomly selected , but was based on the classifications of soker ( 1997 ) , it would be interesting to increase the number of cspne observed . \n if the 25% binary fraction persisted , the binary mechanism for pn shaping would be strongly supported , specifically the scenario outlined by soker ( 1997 ) . \n i would like to thank bill bagnuolo , doug gies , and bill nelson for their generous support and todd henry and alberto miranda for their assistance with the ctio 0.9 m telescope . \n this research was funded by georgia state university .", "StartTimeOffset": 761778969575, "RequestID": "b420c63fa7eb411d9bbb582f57e10782", "TotalTokens": 2036}

nucleus collisions around 1 - 2 a gev , as well as in proton and pion induced reactions . in order to provide absolute measurements of invariant mass distributions \n a good knowledge of the dielectron reconstruction efficiency is mandatory , which can be achieved by means of well known calibration reactions , as the @xmath3 channel . + \n a proton - proton run was done on january 2004 at 2.2gev , to measure the @xmath3 reaction through an exclusive reconstruction of the hadronic ( @xmath1 ) and the dielectron ( @xmath2 ) dalitz decays , whose branching ratios are known . \n this fact allows to use the @xmath3 channel as a calibration reaction for the dielectron identification , in order to normalize the dielectron yields in theavy ions experiments . \n the study of the @xmath0 meson is of particular interest for several reasons . in the vicinity of the threshold the production of the @xmath0 meson \n was studied extensively and the inclusive cross sections are well known@xcite , while at higher energies the uncertainties are larger . moreover the observed electron pair invariant mass distribution for the @xmath0 dalitz decay branch can be used to check contributions from other sources ( such as @xmath4 dalitz , combinatorial background , etc . ) as well as the lepton trigger efficiency . \n in addition , if both protons and both leptons are detected , the reconstruction of this decay mode is kinematically complete without requiring an additional photon detector , and a missing mass technique can be applied . \n this would allow to separate the @xmath0 dalitz from all other sources and to map the effective acceptance of the spectrometer . \n in hades , however , the main algorithm for particle identification requires a combination of momentum and time - of - flight measurements . in the pp experiment it was not possible to use a start detector as a time reference , because of the high number of secondaries produced . \n this means that there is no common start time reference for tracks in the same event , but in general the data acquisition is started by the fastest particle which crosses the time - of - flight wall . in this case \n we measure the difference in time with respect to the fastest particle , instead of the real time - of - flight . \n thus it was necessary to develop an algorithm to reconstruct the start time of the reaction , and make particle identification possible . \n + the used algorithm relies on identifying one particle in the event and calculate its theoretical time - of - flight : from the assumed mass and the measured momentum we calculate the time - of - flight of the particle , thus the offset to the real start time of the reaction . \n the first kind of identification comes from the cherenkov detector , which is hadron blind and can select electron / positron tracks . if a lepton candidate is not found , a negative charged track in the same event is assumed as a negative pion . \n finally , we recalculate the time - of - flight of the other particles inside the same event using the extrapolated reaction time . in this way we obtained an average time resolution of 340 ps and an efficiency of about 92% for events with a lepton , and a resolution of 440 ps and an efficiency of about 93% for events with a negative pion . \n + after the start time reconstruction it is possible to use the recalculated time - of - flight in order to identify particles , for exclusive analysis of @xmath0 decay channels . \n the main goal of the p+p experiment was to verify the dielectron reconstruction efficiency needed for a correct interpretation of the hi data , by means of the well known @xmath0 meson decays into hadronic@xcite and electromagnetic channels@xcite . in the simulation we assumed resonant production of the meson via @xmath5 , with the dalitz matrix element taken from ref .  . \n for the eta hadronic decay the matrix element from ref .   has been implemented , and for the @xmath0 dalitz decay the vector dominance model ( vdm ) was assumed . \n in addition a full cocktail of reaction channels based on measured proton - proton cross sections@xcite was generated . \n simulated events were processed through the hades geant code and reconstructed with the same analysis program used for the experimental data . \n reconstruction of the @xmath6 reaction started with charged particle identification ( pid ) based on momentum and reconstructed time of flight . \n after pid a kinematical condition was used on events with two protons and two charged pions : by imposing a cut of @xmath7 around the @xmath4 region in the four - particle missing mass we selected the @xmath8 reaction , @xmath9 being determined from a fit to the missing @xmath4 peak . \n the missing - mass resolution was further improved with a kinematical refit of the full event@xcite . \n finally , the @xmath0 mesons were identified in the two - proton missing - mass distribution shown in the left plot of fig . \n [ etahad_plot ] . \n a prominent @xmath0 peak , centered at the expected position , is clearly visible on top of a non - resonant three - pion background . by fitting the distribution by means of a gaussian plus a background function , \n we obtain the value of the @xmath0 mass with a resolution of 2.5% , and evaluate the hadronic production yield . \n moreover , by fitting the pp missing mass peak in various @xmath10 slices@xcite , the angular distribution on the @xmath0 meson emission has been evaluated and compared to simulation , by using the anisotropic angular model verified by the disto collaboration@xcite(right plot of fig . \n [ etahad_plot ] ) . \n the two distributions are in agreement within error bars , showing that the hadron efficiency is understood in the covered phase space region . \n center -

particle missing mass around the missing photon peak . the left side of fig . \n [ etadal_plot ] shows the proton - proton missing mass distribution , obtained after a kinematical refit was applied to the @xmath12 events with a constraint on a missing photon . \n the prominent peaks centered at 140 and 546 @xmath13 correspond to the @xmath4 and @xmath0 mesons respectively . \n the istribution is dominated by events @xmath14 ( branching ratio @xmath15 ) where one of the decay photons produces a conversion pair . however , as the simulation also shows , it can be completely removed by conditions on the quality of the track reconstruction and the pair opening angle . the right plot of fig . \n [ etadal_plot ] shows the invariant mass distribution of dielectron pairs coming from the @xmath0 decay after the conversion rejection@xcite , in comparison with simulation by using qed ( point -

called @xmath8-temperature @xcite , at which the solvent mediated attractive and repulsive interactions between the monomers cancel . \n in this situation the scaling properties of the polymer chain can be described by that of a simple random walk ( rw ) . \n then , the scaling laws ( [ sawscaling ] ) hold with exponents @xmath9 . at temperatures below the @xmath8-point , \n the polymer undergoes a collapse transition and passes to a globule regime with a scaling exponent @xmath10 . \n as established by de gennes @xcite , the scaling properties of saws can be studied in the language of field theory , by mapping the @xmath11-symmetrical spin model at its critical point to polymer field theory by a formal @xmath12 limit . in this way , \n the powerful renormalization group ( rg ) methods , which are traditionally used to quantitatively describe the critical behaviour of magnetic systems and to determine the critical exponents , can be applied to polymer solutions . in the frames of the rg , \n the scaling behaviour of the model is determined by the stability and physical accessibility of a corresponding fixed point ( fp ) . for a polymer chain , the crossover from the rw regime to that of \n the saw corresponds to the interchange of stability between the gaussian ( g ) fixed point ( corresponding to absence of interaction between monomers ) and the polymer ( p ) fixed point . \n the scaling of a saw is governed in by exponents ( 1 ) that belong to the @xmath13 universality class . \n these are the most prominent scaling exponents in polymer physics , however , there are more . on the one hand , there is a series of exponents governing the scaling of polymers of complex topology  star polymers and networks @xcite . on the other hand , the scaling laws ( 1 ) may change if e.g. disorder in the system gives rise to a separate stable fp . \n both cases are considered below . \n the present communication aims to attract attention to appearance of new scaling laws related to a constraint on the polymer system in the form of a disordered environment or to a more complex architecture of the polymers . \n in particular , we will be interested in investigating the interplay of different aspects of complexity appearing simultaneously such as the degree of branching of the polymer , its possibly inhomogeneous composition and the type of disorder in the environment . \n we derive and calculate the scaling exponents for the corresponding universality classes and discuss the relevant observable phenomena . \n the outline of this paper is as follows : we first describe different possible scenarios of scaling behaviour and present the field - theoretical description for models of polymers in these scenarios . \n we then discuss the results and the underlying physical phenomena . \n our discussion encompasses previous results @xcite as well as recent extensions @xcite . \n from the point of view of rg transformation , the scaling exponents ( 1 ) originate from anomalous dimensions of local operators evaluated at the stable fp . \n the scaling laws can be altered by connecting single polymer chains into more complex structures , which in the language of field theory amounts to the appearance of new composite operators . \n the most simple non - trivial representative of the class of branched polymers is the so - called star polymer , which consists of linear chains , linked together at one of their end - points . for a star with @xmath14 arms each with @xmath3 steps ( monomers ) , the number of possible configurations scales as @xcite : @xmath15 the second part shows the power law in terms of the size @xmath16 of a single chain of @xmath3 monomers on microscopic step length @xmath17 . \n the exponents @xmath18 , @xmath19 are universal star exponents , depending on the space dimension @xmath6 and number of arms @xmath14 . \n this includes the single polymer chain with @xmath20 or @xmath21 . \n some results on star polymers can be found in refs . \n @xcite . \n linking together polymers of different species , results in non - homogeneous polymer stars , which may have a richer scaling behaviour @xcite . \n a particular case is the copolymer star , consisting of polymer chains with two different @xmath8-temperatures . \n let @xmath22 chains be in the good solvent condition while further @xmath23 chains of the star polymer are at their @xmath8-temperature . \n then the partition function of this star copolymer scales as@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a family of copolymer star exponents and @xmath26 indicates one of eight possible fps in this ternary polymer scenario @xcite . \n what is the influence of structural disorder on the scaling laws eqs.(2),(3 ) ? \n such structural disorder may be present in a solution in terms of a porous medium . \n it has been shown however , that uncorrelated point - like defects of weak concentration will not induce any change of polymer scaling behaviour @xcite : the polymer fp , as for saw on a pure lattice , remains stable and physically accessible . \n more interesting is the case of so - called long - range - correlated disorder , where the distribution of structural defects is characterised by a correlation function that decays with a power law @xmath1 @xcite for large @xmath2 . \n the non - trivial influence of long - range ( lr ) disorder on the scaling properties of single polymer chains and star polymers has recently been worked out in the frames of the field - theoretical approach @xcite . \n as mentioned earlier , the statistics of flexible polymer chains can be extracted in the formal limit @xmath27 of an @xmath28-vector model at its critical point . \n similarly , the scaling of a polymer experiencing lr correlated disorder can be studied using the effective hamiltonian : @xmath29\\label{lag } { + } \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}\\delta(k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4)\\times } \\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n \\frac{u_0}{4 ! } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_1}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_2 } \\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_3}\\vec{\\varphi}^{\\alpha}_{k_4}\\right . \n % \\nonumber\\\\ & & { -}\\left.\\frac{w_0}{4!}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1}^n |k_1-k_2|^{a -

physical region .    here \n , it is our intention to investigate a higher order approximation to confirm the stability of the lr disorder fp in the physical region also within the @xmath39-expansion . \n we use the second - order rg @xmath40-functions of the @xmath28-component model in lr correlated disorder , as derived in ref . \n @xcite . converting these to continuous differential equations , and passing to the @xmath41 limit \n we find : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a rescaling parameter , @xmath44 . \n looking for the fps of this rg flow , we find the lr disorder induced fp @xmath45 , @xmath46+@xmath47 . \n this fp is stable and physically accessible for @xmath48 or equivalently @xmath49 . taking into account , that according to eq . \n ( [ lag ] ) lr disorder should be relevant for @xmath50 , these second order results establish the presence of the lr fixed point in the physical region of ( @xmath51 ) . \n as explained in ref.@xcite , the study of @xmath14-arm star configurations in this theory is given in terms of the anomalous dimensions of complex composite operators , containing products of @xmath14 zero - component fields . \n the presence of a new stable fixed point leads to different values of the scaling exponents for polymers . in particular , for star polymers , the first order expressions for the exponents @xmath52 for a star in a pure solvent and for a star influenced by long - range correlated disorder ( lr ) read : @xmath53 note the decrease of @xmath18 at fixed @xmath54 with increasing @xmath55 ( i.e. when the correlation of the disorder becomes stronger ) . \n however , the behaviour for chain polymers @xmath56 differs : in this case the exponents @xmath57 increase for increasing @xmath55 . \n omitting factors of @xmath58 , let @xmath59 be the free energy of a star polymer in the pure solvent and @xmath60 its free energy in a porous medium . \n then we can estimate the free energy difference of a star polymer with respect to the two environments : @xmath61 the difference in the free energy consists of two terms . \n the first is independent of the polymer architecture and simply takes into account the change in chemical potential per monomer . \n two polymers of the same molecular weight ( same total number of monomers @xmath62 ) will experience the same difference . \n the second term which grows with @xmath63 is architecture dependent . \n following eqs . \n ( [ change ] ) , we see that this term has different signs for chain polymers ( @xmath64 ) , and star polymers ( @xmath65 ) . thus , even though both may be expected to be expelled from the correlated environment , this effect is weakened for linear polymers and enhanced for star polymers of the same molecular weight . \n the first term could in principle be cancelled out if the pure part of the solution is exchanged by a second porous medium which however displays short range ( sr ) disorder with the same chemical potential @xmath66 . \n static architecture induced separation results , see fig.[star ] . \n exploring further aspects of complexity , we consider star polymers built from chains of species with different @xmath8-temperatures ( copolymer stars ) . depending on the temperature , one or more of inter- and \n intra - chain interactions may vanish , and additional fps appear for the inter - chain interaction . \n a species with vanishing intra - chain interaction is represented by rws avoiding the other species . \n this situation may also be used to describe the diffusion of particles near an absorbing polymer @xcite . \n the moments of the resulting flow near the polymer turn out to be multi - fractal @xcite . the scaling exponents of copolymer stars also determine the scaling of corresponding copolymer networks @xcite and play role in a number of other phenomena , given below .    treating the model of star copolymers in a porous medium by the rg approach \n , we have found different scenarios of scaling behaviour and corresponding values for scaling exponents @xcite . to summarise some results for the exponents , \n let us first introduce some notations . \n each regime is denoted by two letters , corresponding to species 1 and 2 respectively and reflecting , whether it behaves like random walk ( @xmath16 ) or self - avoiding walk @xmath67 . \n the index @xmath68 denotes the presence of long - range - correlated disorder . \n the index @xmath69 corresponds to the situation , when species @xmath70 and @xmath21 interact with each other . when disorder is absent , we reproduce known results @xcite for the cases of two interacting random walks \n @xmath71 , two interacting saws @xmath72 and saws interacting with random walks @xmath73 : @xmath74 @xmath75 is equivalent to the exponent of a homogeneous star polymer of @xmath76 arms . turning on the long - range - correlated disorder , \n we obtain estimates for the exponent @xmath77 for different regimes in a new universality class : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the exponent for the homogeneous star with @xmath80 arms in long - range - correlated disorder , @xmath81 and @xmath82 describe @xmath23 random walks , interacting with @xmath22 rws and saws respectively , in lr disorder .    besides the usual polymer exponents describing statistical properties like end - to - end distance or number of configurations , polymers of complex structure ( e.g. star copolymers ) \n are characterised by the full set of star exponents . \n these star exponents form a basis to determine the scaling of complex copolymer networks @xcite . \n they are important for a wide range of phenomena , some examples are given by the absorption of diffusive particles in the vicinity of an absorbing polymer @xcite , the effective interaction in colloids of star polymers @xcite , the transition of double stranded to single stranded dna @xcite . as we have demonstrated in this paper polymer scaling behaviour is influenced in a non trivial way by correlated structural disorder . \n further investigations are under way to complete the quantitative description of the scenarios of complex polymer behaviour in correlated environments . \n we acknowledge support by a  marie curie international incoming fellowship \" ( v.b . ) and austrian fwf under project no . \n p19583-n20 ( yu.h ) . \n see , e.g. : g .- p . de gennes , _ scaling concepts in polymer physics _ , cornell university press , ithaca and london , 1979 ; l. schfer , _ universal properties of polymer solutions as explained by the renormalization group _ , springer , berlin , 1999 . \n v. blavatska , c. von ferber and yu . \n holovatch , _ polymers in media with long -

{"ContextTokens": 3699, "GeneratedTokens": 190, "SynthesizedBody": "much recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on the electronic transport properties of nanowires , motivated by promises of novel electronic devices and the basic scientific challenges that they present . \n one of the key findings in nanowire devices is that the coulomb interaction plays a crucial role in determining device properties . \n for example , electrostatics in carbon nanotubes ( nts ) leads to unexpected behavior of intra - tube _ \n junctions@xcite , of intra - tube schottky junctions@xcite , and of fermi level pinning at contacts between nts and metals@xcite . \n the importance of _ intra_-tube coulomb interactions naturally leads to the question of how _ \n inter_-tube interactions might influence device behavior . answering \n this question is gaining increasing importance as experimental devices based on multiple nanotubes are becoming more common@xcite [ an example is shown in fig . \n 1(a ) ] , and also to address the question of device packing density .    in this paper \n , we present self - consistent calculations based on the non - equilibrium green s function technique for planar carbon nanotube transistors containing multiple parallel nts . by analyzing the variations of the transistor characteristics with nt separation , we establish a length scale below which inter - tube interactions become important . \n while for small channel lengths this length scale depends on the channel length , for long channel devices it becomes independent of the channel length and is essentially determined by the gate oxide thickness . \n importantly , this length scale depends exponentially on the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the nts , and can be substantially reduced by embedding the nts in a high-@xmath1 dielectric in the channel and using embedded contacts . \n figure 1(b - e ) shows the device under consideration : infinitely long single - wall zigzag nts laying on metal electrodes at their two ends and on a dielectric in the channel region . a planar gate 10 nm below the dielectric surface controls the device behavior . \n we take a spacing of 0.3 nm between    the nt and the metal or dielectric , and assume that the nt cross - section remains circular , a good approximation for the nts considered heredeformation . \n the electronic properties of the nt are described using a tight - binding approach with one @xmath2 orbital per carbon atom , and a coupling @xmath3 ev between nearest - neighbor atoms . \n semiconducting tubes are ( 17,0 ) nts ( band gap of 0.55 ev , diameter of 1.33 nm ) while metallic tubes are ( 18,0 ) nts ( diameter of 1.41 nm ) . \n we take the nt midgap as the energy reference level , and use a metal workfunction of 5.5 ev , putting the metal fermi level 1 ev below the nt midgap . \n the gate insulator dielectric constant is that of sio@xmath4    to apply the non - equilibrium green s function formalismdatta , leonardiccn to this system , we divide the nt in principle layers , with each layer corresponding to a ring of the zigzag nt . \n the main quantity of interest is the green s function @xmath5 , from which one can obtain the transmission probability @xmath6 and the zero bias conductance    @xmath7 de\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the fermi function . \n @xmath5 is calculated by solving the matrix equation    @xmath9 ^{-1}\\text { , } \\label{gr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the isolated nt and @xmath11 is the electrostatic potential evaluated at the position of each layer . the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the interaction of the scattering region with the semi - infinite nt leads . in our tight - binding representation , \n the hamiltonian matrix elements for layer @xmath14 are @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of atoms around a nt ring ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 here ) and @xmath20 labels each of the nt bands . in this representation \n , we assume that the electrostatic potential on every atom of a ring is the same , a good approximation in this case since @xmath11 varies slowly over the nt diameter . \n the electrostatic potential is calculated by solving poisson s equation in three - dimensional coordinates on a variable grid with the source charge on the nt , and with boundary conditions at the source , drain , and gate surfaces , and at the vacuum / dielectric interface . \n this is done by combining a finite difference approach in the directions parallel to the nt and perpendicular to the substrate with a fast fourier transform in the direction perpendicular to the nts . \n once the three - dimensional electrostatic potential is obtained , the value for @xmath11 on each ring is taken as the average of the electrostatic potentials on the points on the nt nearest and furthest from the substrate , at the position of each ring .    to obtain the charge density , we note that our tight - binding technique provides the total charge on each layer of the nt , which needs to be spatially distributed . \n we assume a uniform distribution of the charge in the azimuthal direction , and spatially distribute the total charge in the radial and axial directions with a gaussian smearing function . the three - dimensional charge density \n is then given by @xmath21where @xmath22 \\\\ \n \\left [ -(r - r)^{2}/2\\sigma _ { r}^{2}\\right ] $ ] with @xmath23 the tube radius , @xmath24 the position of ring @xmath14 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 the smearing lengths in the axial and radial directions respectively ( this expression for @xmath27 is valid when @xmath28 , and we used values of @xmath29 nm and @xmath30 nm ) . \n our overall procedure is to solve the coupled set of nonlinear eqs @xmath31 self - consistently for a given gate - source voltage at zero drain - source bias . \n figure 1(e ) shows the unit cells for our calculations to study semiconducting - semiconducting and semiconducting - metallic interactions . \n we first discuss interactions between semiconducting nts . \n the conductance of the nt transistor as a function of the gate - source voltage is plotted in fig . 2 for different values of the separation between the nts . \n clearly , as the nt separation is reduced , the ntfet characteristics degrade ; in the range of gate voltages studied , the current can not be completely turned on for the smallest tube separation , while the behavior in the off state is essentially independent of tube separation . \n this behavior arises because of the charge induced on the nts by the gate voltage , and by interactions between nts at the contact . as shown in fig . \n 2a , the off state corresponds to the fermi level in the middle of the nt bandgap in the channel , with little charge on the nts , so coulomb interactions in the channel between neighboring nts are negligible . \n the on state however consists of making the nt _ p_-type in the channel by raising the valence band above the fermi level with the gate voltage ( fig . \n 2b ) ; this creates a large positive charge on the nt which interacts with the charge on neighboring nts , and lowers the electron energy . \n this pushes the bands down , and reduces the conductance .    while interactions in the channel play an important role in determining device behavior \n , nt - nt interactions also affects the contacts . because of the mismatch between the metal and nt workfunctions , \n contacts between nts and metals are governed by charge transfer between the metal and the nt , effectively doping the nt _ p_-type at the contact , with the metal fermi level just below the nt valence band edge in the contact@xcite . as the separation between nts decreases , the coulomb interactions between the positive charge at the contacts leads to a lowering of the bands ; at small enough separations , the valence band in the contact can be pushed below the metal fermi level . \n thus inter - tube interactions at the contacts can lead to modifications of the nt / metal contacts from ohmic to schottky . \n we find that this effect becomes important for inter - tube separations below @xmath32 nm ; the effects can be seen in the bottom curve of fig . \n 2 , where the on state conductance saturates to a value much smaller than the single - tube limit because of the schottky barrier . \n these effects of inter - tube interactions on contact properties can be mitigated by embedding the nts in the metal contact .    to quantify the role of coulomb interactions _ in the channel _ , we calculated the conductance versus gate voltage for devices with different channel lengths ; we plot in fig . \n 3 the conductance at @xmath33 versus tube separation , for several values of the channel length ( the smallest value of @xmath34 is large enough to avoid contact effects ) . the solid lines in the figure are fits of the form @xmath35 , from which we extract the value of @xmath36 at which the conductance decreases by more than 10% from its @xmath37 value . \n this length scale is plotted in fig . \n 4 as a function of channel length , and delimits regions where inter - tube interactions distort the single - tube behavior . clearly \n , very short channel devices can have very high packing densities , while long channel devices are limited to tube separations of 15 nm . a notable aspect of the results of fig . \n 4 is that the value of @xmath36 is independent of the channel length for large @xmath38 . at first glance \n , one would expect that a larger channel length leads to larger total charge on the nts and thus larger interaction energy . however , screening of the coulomb interaction by the planar gate leads to a different behavior , as we now discuss .    to derive approximate analytical expressions for the coulomb interactions between nts , we consider the simplified situation of fig . \n 5a : a nt of length @xmath38 is at a distance @xmath39 above a metallic substrate held a potential @xmath40 , and carries charge per unit length @xmath41 . \n we use an image potential construction to calculate the electrostatic potential @xmath42 at a distance @xmath36 from the charged tube , giving    @xmath43    in the long channel limit @xmath44 , eq . \n ( [ v ] ) becomes@xmath45the important point here is that in this limit the potential shift is independent of the channel length @xmath38 . \n taking a potential change of @xmath46 volts as a criterion for the importance of inter - tube effects , we obtain a separation@xmath47below which inter - tube effects become important . \n thus the gate oxide thickness @xmath39 sets the length scale @xmath48 . in the above expression \n , @xmath1 is the effective dielectric constant for the device geometry . for a simple comparison with our simulations \n we take @xmath1 as the dielectric constant of sio@xmath49 , and use the computed value of @xmath50 e / c atom in the on state . \n this gives @xmath51 nm in good agreement with our numerical results . \n a key point is that the length scale @xmath48 depends _ exponentially _ on the gate insulator dielectric constant ; thus , replacing sio@xmath49 with high-@xmath1 dielectric materials ( ntfets have been fabricated with hfo@xmath49@xcite , sro@xmath49@xcite and srtio@xmath52@xcite ) allows a reduction of @xmath53 to extremely small values , thus permitting high device densities . \n the general behavior of interactions between semiconducting nts can be understood from further analysis of eq . @xmath54 . near threshold , \n the charge on the nt can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the threshold voltage . \n substitution in eq . \n gives@xmath57hence , the gate voltage is rescaled and shifted by the interaction between nts . \n this behavior is indicated in the inset of fig . \n 2c , showing good collapse of the data after appropriate rescaling and shifting of @xmath58 .    the results discussed above focused on interactions between semiconducting nts \n . however , in multi - nt devices , there is often a mixture of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes . \n a question therefore is how the presence of nearby metallic nts affects the properties of the semiconducting nts . to address this issue \n , we performed calculations for the geometry depicted in fig . \n there , a semiconducting nt is separated from two metallic nts by a distance @xmath36 . \n figure 6 shows the calculated conductance vs gate voltage dependence for a 10 nm channel device . \n ( the conductance plotted here is that of the semiconducting nt only . for single electrodes making contact to all the nts \n , the conductance of the metallic tubes would have to be included to obtain the total device conductance . ) the behavior in fig . \n 6 is similar to that observed for interactions between semiconducting nts , i.e. a degradation of the characteristics with decreasing separation between the nts . \n however , because the charge on the metallic tubes is not strongly modulated by the gate voltage , the physics is somewhat different ; indeed , the metallic nts essentially consist of lines of constant potential . to their effect on the semiconducting nts we consider the situation of fig . \n 5b , where a line held at a constant potential @xmath59 is above a metallic plane held at potential @xmath58 . \n solution of the laplace equation for this geometry gives the potential on the nearby nt as@xmath60thus the presence of the metallic tubes shifts and rescales the gate voltage seen by the semiconducting tube . \n for small separations between the nts , the potential on the semiconducting nt approaches that of the metallic nt , which is larger than that of an isolated semiconducting nt . \n thus , at the contact , the fermi level is pushed above the valence band edge , leading to a schottky barrier and saturation of the conductance to lower values . \n the behavior expressed in eq . \n ( [ scaling ] ) can be verified by looking at the off state behavior , and scaling and shifting the gate voltage appropriately ; the inset in fig . \n 6 shows the resulting collapse of the data . \n in summary , we have shown that coulomb interactions between carbon nanotubes can have a strong influence on device behavior . \n below a characteristic length scale , interactions between nts can significantly degrade device behavior ; this can be understood in terms of a rescaling and shift of the applied gate voltage . for long channel devices , \n the tube separation above which interactions between nts is negligible becomes independent of the channel length , and is set by the gate oxide thickness . \n this length scale can be substantially reduced by using high-@xmath1 dielectrics , due to an exponential dependence on dielectric constant . while this paper focused on the static device properties \n , we expect that interactions during current flow ( e.g. coulomb drag ) would also have intriguing properties . \n we hope that this work will stimulate controlled experiments to further explore interactions between nanotubes . \n sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by sandia corporation , a lockheed martin company , for the united states department of energy under contract de -

energy interaction models are embedded including venus , qgsjet and sibyll ( refs . \n see in @xcite ) . \n the models are based on the gribov - regge - theory and qcd in accordance with accelerator data . \n extrapolations for the eas physics in the knee region are necessary due to the high interaction energy and for        the extreme forward direction . \n to compare kascade data with monte carlo expectations a detector simulation by geant is performed for each corsika simulated shower . \n + one test is the comparison of simulated integral muon trigger and hadron rates with the measurements . \n this test is sensitive to the energy spectrum of the hadrons which are produced in the forward direction at primary energies around 10 tev , where the chemical composition is roughly known ( fig.[fig : rate ] ) . for higher primary energies \n the hadronic part of the interaction models are tested by comparisons of different hadronic observables in ranges of shower sizes @xcite . in general \n it is seen that the high - energy interaction models predict a too large number of hadrons at sea level compared with the measurements . \n + nonparametric multivariate methods like `` neural networks '' or analyses based on the `` bayesian decision rules '' are applied to the kascade data for the estimation of the energy and mass of the cosmic rays on an event - by - event basis . \n the necessary `` a - priori '' information in form of probability density distributions are won by detailed monte carlo simulations with large statistics . \n + for the energy reconstruction the shower sizes @xmath9 and @xmath11 as parameters are used in a neural network analyses ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) . a parametric approach to the same data leads to compatible results ( fig.[fig : spec ] ) :     to @xmath13 at the knee position of @xmath14gev . ]    here a simultaneous fit to the @xmath9 and @xmath11 size spectra is performed . \n the kernel function of this fit contains the size - energy correlations for two primary masses ( proton and iron ) obtained by monte carlo simulations . \n + an analysis of the size - ratio @xmath15 calculated for each single event leads to results of the elemental composition for different energy ranges ( fig.[fig : comp ] ) . \n the measured distribution of these ratios is assumed to be a superposition of simulated distributions for different primary masses . \n the large iron sampling calorimeter of kascade allows to investigate the hadronic part of eas in terms of the chemical composition . for six different hadronic observables ( won by spatial and energy distributions of the hadrons ) the deviations of the mean values to expectations of pure proton and iron primaries in certain energy ranges \n are calculated . \n + besides the use of global parameters like the shower sizes , sets of different parameters are used for neural network and bayesian decision analyses . \n examples of such observables are the number of reconstructed hadrons in the calorimeter , their reconstructed energy sum , number of muons in the shower center , or parameters obtained by a fractal analysis of the hit pattern of muons and secondaries at the mwpc . \n the latter ones are sensitive to the structure of the shower core which is mass sensitive due to different shower developments of light and heavy particles in the atmosphere . in figure \n [ fig : comp ] results of a bayesian analyses and of a separate neural net analysis using the fractal parameters are shown . \n + as the tendency of the results of each described method is consistent with a heavier primary mass after the knee region , but the absolute scale strongly depends on the particle component of which the observables are constructed from , the syllogism is that the balance of the energy and number of particles between the muonic , electromagnetic and hadronic part in the eas differs for simulations and the real shower development . \n first results of the kascade experiment can be summarized by following statements : all secondary particle components of the showers display a kink in the size spectra . \n this strongly supports an astrophysical origin of the `` knee '' , rather than effects of the interaction of the primaries in the atmosphere . the knee is sharper for the light primary component than for the heavy one . \n this result follows from the measurement as an increasing average mass of the primary cosmic rays above the observed kink , together with the energy dependent mass classification of single air showers . but \n none of the high - energy interaction models en vogue is able to fit the data of all observables consistently \n .    9 h.o . \n klages et al . \n kascade collaboration , nucl . \n b ( proc . suppl . ) 52b ( 1997 ) 92 . \n d. heck et al . , fzka 6019 , forschungszentrum karlsruhe ( 1998 ) . \n t. antoni et al . \n kascade collaboration , proc . \n 26@xmath16 icrc , salt lake city , utah 1999 ; published as : k.h . \n kampert ( editor ) , fzka 6345 , forschungszentrum karlsruhe ( 1999 ) . t. antoni et al . \n kascade collaboration , j. phys . \n g : nucl . part . \n phys . 25 ( 1999 ) 2161 .", "StartTimeOffset": 802355506342, "RequestID": "6dba0061cc0c45408ad28f8ec75504bc", "TotalTokens": 2104}

ray peaks . \n there is no question that the observations obtained from @xmath1 and xmm have significantly advanced our understanding of the interactions between the central agn and the thermal gas in galaxy groups and clusters . \n it is clear that over a wide range of system masses the central agn has the ability to disrupt the thermal gas in the dense cores of these systems . \n a detailed understanding of these central interactions requires the addition of targeted multi - frequency radio data that is selected to probe both the relevant spatial scales for the system in question as well as a wide frequency range ( including low frequencies ) to track the radio outburst history of the central agn .    in this paper \n we presented a few cases of sources where new radio observations have changed the view of the system under study . in the case of abell 4059 \n it appears that the x - ray cavities are likely still undergoing active injection from the central agn and thus are not buoyantly rising detached lobes . \n the radio observations of the central source in abell 2597 reveal extended structures along several different position angles which are suggestive of multiple outbursts along possibly different initial directions . \n in the case of abell 262 the new radio observations reveal multiple structures along roughly the same position angle . these distinct structures may be signatures of different outburst episodes . \n adding up the total energy input into the icm from all radio outbursts seen in abell 262 suggests that the agn is more powerful than previously thought and is within a factor of two of being powerful enough to offset cooling over several outburst episodes . \n the presence of the extended radio emission toward the eastern region of abell 262 suggests that the low frequency radio flux is originating from detached buoyant lobes from past agn outbursts . using the observed projected offset of the radio structures from the cluster cores in abell 2597 and abell 262 together with the buoyant velocity in the systems we estimate a repetition timescale for the central agn of a few @xmath7 yr . \n this is significantly shorter than the typical assumption of @xmath8 yr . \n although there is some evidence of an x - ray deficit associated with one of the eastern emission regions in abell 262 we note that it is relatively difficult to detect x - ray cavities once they are located beyond the densest parts of the cluster cores @xcite . in these cases , \n low frequency radio observations provide an important tool for tracing the total energy input into the system to determine if it is sufficient to offset the radiative cooling . \n finally , in the case of ngc 507 we note that sensitive , high resolution radio images allow us to trace the interactions of the western radio lobe with the central x - ray structure . \n these observations also show the clear correspondence between the eastern radio lobe and the southern portion of the sharp surface - brightness discontinuity in the system . \n l. anderson , e.  l. blanton , t.  e. clarke et al . : in preparation e.  l. blanton , c.  l. sarazin , b.  r. mcnamara et al . : \n apj * 612 * , 817 ( 2004 ) y .- y . \n choi , c.  s. reynolds , s. heinz et al . \n : apj * 606 * , 185 ( 2004 ) t.  e. clarke , e.  l. blanton , c.  l. sarazin et al . : in preparation t.  e. clarke , c.  l. sarazin , e.  l. blanton et al . : apj * 625 * , 748 ( 2005 ) t.  a. ensslin , s. heinz : a&a * 384 * , 27 ( 2002 ) a.c . \n fabian et al : apj * 436 * , 63 ( 1994 ) a.  c. fabian , a. celotti , k.  m. blundell et al . \n : mnras * 331 * , 369 ( 2002 ) s. heinz , y .- y . \n choi , c.  s. reynolds et al . \n : apj * 569 * , 79 ( 2002 ) z. huang , c.  l. sarazin : apj * 496 * , 728 ( 1998 ) r.  p. kraft , w.  r. forman , e. churazov et al . \n : apj * 601 * , 221 ( 2004 ) b.  r. mcnamara , m.  w. wise , p.  e.  j. nulsen et al . : apj * 562 * , 149 , ( 2001 ) c.  p. odea , s.  a. baum , j. mack , et al . \n : apj * 612 * , 131 ( 2004 ) w.  r. oegerle , l. cowie , a. davidsen , et al . : apj * 560 * , 187 ( 2001 ) p. parma , h.  r. de ruiter , c. fanti et al . : \n a&as * 64 * , 135 ( 1986 ) j.  r. peterson , a.  c. fabian : physics reports * 427 * , 1 ( 2006 ) c.  l. sarazin , j.  o. burns , k. roettiger et al . \n : apj * 447 * , 559 ( 1995 )", "StartTimeOffset": 814613686636, "RequestID": "86b9b2af96d84c788ae3cf0c1cc1420b", "TotalTokens": 4155}
{"ContextTokens": 3855, "GeneratedTokens": 248, "SynthesizedBody": "on saturday , august 16th 2008 , usain bolt shattered the world record of 100 meter dash in the bird s nest at the beijing olympics 2008 . in a spectacular run dubbed `` the greatest 100 meter performance in the history of the event '' by michael johnson , bolt finished at 9.69 seconds , improving his own previous world record from earlier this year by 0.03 seconds . \n however , the most impressive fact about this run was the way in which he did it : after accelerating away from the rest of the field , he looked to his sides when two seconds and 20 meters remained , and when that noting he was completely alone , he started celebrating ! \n he extended his arms , and appeared to almost dance along the track .    despite this , he broke the world record by 0.03 seconds . \n but , needless to say , this celebration left spectators and commentators all over the world wondering about one big question : what would the world record have been if he had _ not _ celebrated the last 20 meters ? \n bolt s coach , glen mills , recently suggested at a press conference of the golden league tournament in zrich , that the record could have been 9.52 seconds , or even better . \n we wanted to check this for ourselves , by attempting to measure bolt s position as a function of time , and extrapolate from the dynamics before the celebration began , into the last two seconds of the race . \n based on ( hopefully ) reasonable assumptions , we could then obtain an estimate of the new world record .    in this paper \n we analyze footage of the run obtained from various web sites and the norwegian broadcasting corporation ( nrk ) , with the goal of estimating this `` hypothetical '' world record . the main technical difficulty in performing this analysis lies in obtaining accurate distance measurements as a function of time for each runner . \n fortunately , this task is made considerably easier by the presence of a moving camera mounted to a rail along the track . \n this rail is bolted to the ground at regular intervals , and thereby provides the required standard ruler . using the methods detailed in the following sections , and properly taking into account all major sources of statistical uncertainty , we believe that our measurements are sufficiently accurate and robust to support interesting conclusions . \n our analysis is based on the following simple steps :    1 . \n we first obtained several different videos of the race from the internet ( nbc and bbc ) and the norwegian broadcasting company ( nrk ) , and printed out @xmath3 screen shots at different times from these . \n we then constructed a standard ruler by counting the total number of bolts ( called `` ticks '' in the following ) on the rail of the moving camera along the 100 meter track ( see figure [ fig : screenshot ] ) . \n we assumed the distance between these to be constant . \n 3 .   next , we drew lines orthogonal to the track , using whatever means most accurate for a given screen shot . for early and late frames , lines in the actual track itself ( e.g. , starting and finishing lines ) were most useful , while for intermediate frames , the lower right edge of the camera mount was utilized ( figure [ fig : screenshot ] ) . \n 4 .   for a given frame , we then read off the positions of usain bolt and richard thompson , the runner - up , with the ruler , and recorded these together with the time from the screen clock . \n next , we assigned an uncertainty to each distance measurement , by estimating how many ticks we believed we were off in a given frame . \n for later frames , when the camera angle is almost orthogonal to the track , this uncertainty is smaller than in the beginning of the race because of the camera perspective . \n 6 .   based on these uncertainties \n , we fitted a smooth spline with inverse variance weights to the data . \n this provided us with a smooth approximation to the runners positions as a function of time , and also with the first and second derivatives , i.e. , their speeds and accelerations . \n 7 .   to make the projections , we consider two cases : \n first , we conservatively assume that bolt would have been able to keep up with thompson s acceleration profile in the end race after 8 seconds of elapsed time , and project a new finishing time . \n second , given his clearly stronger acceleration around 6 seconds , we also consider the case in which he is able to maintain a @xmath40.5 m/@xmath5 higher acceleration than thompson through to the end . \n the final goal is the new projected world record , which is found by extrapolating the resulting motion profile to 100 meters . \n we also estimate the uncertainty in this number by repeating the above analysis 10000 times , each time adding a random fluctuation with specified uncertainties to each time and tick count . \n ccccccl 0.0 & -7.0 & 0.0 & -7.0 & 0.0 &

cameras located along the finishing line at slightly different positions . \n specifically , the clips were obtained from nrk , nbc , and bbc . \n unfortunately , the nrk and bbc clips were filmed with cameras positioned fairly close to the track , and the rail of the moving camera therefore disappears outside the field - of - view after about 6 seconds . \n this is not the case for the nbc clip , which was filmed from further away . even though the quality of this version is rather poor \n , it is possible to count the number of ticks to the end .    using these data sets \n , we measured the position of usain bolt and richard thompson at 16 different times in units of ticks . \n these are all listed in table [ tab : data ] . \n there are three issues that must be addressed before the tick counts listed in table [ tab : data ] can be translated into proper distance measurements . \n first , the camera rail is not visible entirely to the starting line , as the very first part is obscured by a camera man . \n the tick counts in table [ tab : data ] are therefore counted relative to the first visible tick . \n fortunately , it is not very problematic to extrapolate into the obscured region by using the distance between the visible ticks , and knowing that the distance between the starting lines for the 100 meter dash and 110 meter hurdles is precisely 10 meters . \n we estimate the number of obscured ticks to be @xmath6 . \n second , the precision of the screen clock is only a tenth of a second , and the clock also appears to truncate the time , not round off . \n we therefore add 0.05 seconds to each time measurement , and define our uncertainty in time to uniform between -0.05 and 0.05 seconds . \n finally , the screen clock is not calibrated perfectly with the stadium clock . \n ( see figure 1 for an example frame . ) \n a little more than half of all frames appear to be synchronized , while in the rest the screen clock is lagging behind by 0.1 seconds . \n we assume that the stadium clock is the correct one , and re - calibrate the screen clock by adding an additional 0.04 seconds to each time measurement .    with these assumptions , \n it is straightforward to calibrate both the clock and distance measurements , and this is done in the corresponding columns in table [ tab : data ] . \n with calibrated distance information ready at hand , it is straightforward to make the desired predictions . \n first , we compute a smooth spline @xcite , @xmath7 , through each of the two runners measured positions . \n a nice bonus of using splines is that we automatically obtain the second derivatives of @xmath8 ( ie . , \n acceleration ) at each time step , and also the first derivatives ( ie . , \n speed ) , @xmath9    to obtain a well - behaved spline , we impose three constraints . \n first , we add two auxiliary data points at @xmath10 and @xmath11 seconds . \n these are not measurements , but included only in order to guarantee sensible boundary conditions at each end : the first one implies that the starting velocity is zero , while the last one leads to a smooth acceleration at the finishing line . \n thirdly , we adopt a smooth spline stiffness parameter of @xmath12 @xcite to minimize unphysical fluctuations . \n the results are fairly insensitive to the specific value of this parameter . \n the resulting functions are plotted in figure [ fig : evolution ] . some interesting points to notice \n are the following :    * bolt and thompson are virtually neck by neck up to four seconds , corresponding to a distance of 35 meters . \n * bolt s olympic gold medal is essentially won between 4 and 8 seconds . \n * at 8 seconds bolt decelerates noticeably , and thompson equalizes and surpasses bolt s speed . \n note however that thompson is also not able to maintain his speed to the very end , but runs out of power after about 8.5 seconds . \n still , his acceleration is consistently higher than bolt s after 8 seconds . \n we are now in the position to quantitatively answer the original question : how fast would bolt really have run , if he had nt celebrated the last 2 seconds ? to make this projection , we consider the following two scenarios :    1 . \n bolt matches thompson s acceleration profile after 8 seconds . 2 . \n bolt maintains a 0.5 m / s@xmath0 higher acceleration than thompson after 8 seconds . \n the justification of scenario 1 is obvious , as bolt outran thompson between 4 and 8 seconds . \n the justification of scenario 2 is more speculative , as it is difficult to quantify exactly _ how much _ stronger bolt was . \n still , looking at the acceleration profiles in figure [ fig : evolution ] , and noting that bolt traditionally was considered a 200 meter specialist , a value of 0.5 m / s@xmath0 seems fairly realistic . \n then , for each scenario we compute a new trajectory for bolt by choosing initial conditions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and an acceleration profile as described above . \n the computation of these trajectories are performed by simply integrating equation [ eq : v_and_a ] with respect to time , @xmath15    in figure [ fig : end_run ] we compare the projected trajectories , @xmath16 ( dashed red line shows scenario 1 , dotted red line shows scenario 2 ) , with the actual trajectory , @xmath7 ( solid red line ) . for comparison , \n thompson s trajectory is indicated by a solid blue line . \n the projected new world record is the time for which @xmath16 equals 100 meter . including 95% statistical errors estimated by monte carlo simulations as described in section [ sec : method ] , \n we find that the new world record would be @xmath1 seconds in scenario 1 , and @xmath2 in scenario 2 . \n glen mills , usain bolt s coach , suggested that the world record could have been 9.52 seconds if bolt had not danced along the track in beijing for the last 20 meters . \n according to our calculations , that seems like an good , but perhaps slightly optimistic , estimate : depending on assumptions about bolt s acceleration at the end of the race , we find that his time would have been somewhere between 9.55 and 9.61 seconds , with a 95% statistical error of @xmath17 seconds . clearly , the uncertainties due to the assumptions about the acceleration are comparable to or larger than the statistical uncertainties \n . therefore , 9.52 seconds does by no means seem to be out of reach .    in figure \n [ fig : manipulated ] we show an illustration of how such a record would compare to the actual world record of 9.69 seconds , relative to the rest of the field : the left version of bolt shows his actual position at @xmath18 seconds , while the right version indicates his position in the new scenarios .    of course \n , there are potential several systematics errors involved in these calculations . for instance , it is impossible to know for sure whether usain might have been tired at the end , which of course would increase the world record beyond our estimates . on the other hand , judging from his facial expressions as he crossed the finishing line , this does nt immediately strike us as a very plausible hypothesis . \n another issue to consider is the wind . \n it is generally agreed that a tail wind speed of 1 m / s improves a 100 meter time by 0.05 seconds @xcite . \n further , for iaaf ( international association of athletics federations ) to acknowledge a given run as a record attempt , the wind speed must be less than + 2 m / s . \n when bolt ran in beijing , there was no measurable wind speed at all , and one can therefore safely assume that the world record could have been further decreased , perhaps by as much as 0.1 seconds , under more favorable wind conditions .      first and foremost , we would like to thank christian nitschke smith at nrk sporten for providing very useful high - resolution footage of the beijing 100 dash run , and also bbc and nbc for making their videos available on their web pages . \n second , we thank the pizza guy from peppe s who provided us with a very good half - n - half `` thai chicken '' and `` heavy heaven '' pizza on a late friday night . this article has been submitted to the american journal of physics . \n after it is published , it will be found at http://scitation.aip.org/ajp .", "StartTimeOffset": 828751439056,

range correlation effects in the data ( such as the decays of resonances ) , which are currently not accounted by the model .        in fig . \n 2 the dependence of @xmath18 on the transverse momentum region of accounted particles is shown . \n the correlation coefficient is studied as the function of the lower bound of the @xmath19 interval , and compared to the atlas experimental data @xcite . \n the qualitative agreement of @xmath18 with experimental data is found . \n the increase of @xmath20 is accompanied by the decrease of the multiplicity in the given transverse momentum region , which restricts the phase space for particle production and the number of `` active '' strings , which leads to the decrease of correlation coefficient . \n numerically , the model calculations overestimate the value of the correlation coefficient in the hard transverse momentum area . \n it could be an indication that the direct approach with the soft strings is applicable at the @xmath19 region below @xmath21 , and different processes ( such as jet fragmentation ) begin playing a role at higher @xmath19 . \n on the other hand , this dependence is very sensitive to the shape of the transverse momentum spectra . whereas , the description of the @xmath19 spectra in our approach has an effective character and does not account the jet production and other hard phenomena accurately . \n figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the dependence of @xmath18 on the @xmath22 at four energies , calculated in the monte carlo model , with a comparison to the experimental data @xcite . \n the model calculations do not discriminate pp and @xmath23 scattering . \n the model reproduces the growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and qualitatively describes the decrease of the correlation coefficient with with increase of the gap between pseudorapidity windows . \n note that the short - range effects , such as the resonances decays and jets , which could contribute to the correlation coefficient at small @xmath22 are not accounted by the model . \n the results indicate that taking into account of the string fusion effects improves the agreement with the data . \n the forward - backward multiplicity correlation strength in pp collisions at high energy is studied in the monte carlo model with string formation and fusion . \n the monte carlo model reasonably describes the main features of the behaviour of the correlation coefficient in a wide energy range , such as general growth of the correlation coefficient with collision energy and with increase of pseudorapidity window size . \n the decrease of @xmath18 with the increase of the gap between windows and with increase of the lower @xmath24 bound is also qualitatively described . \n it is found that the version of the model with inclusion of string fusion effects is better supported by the data compared to the case without string fusion . \n the authors acknowledge saint -

algorithm to extract the frequencies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n we generalize this method to avoid an interpolation preprocessing step , which generally adds high noise to the signal , and improve the system performance by using a new stop criterion to avoid overfitting problems . \n the experimental results are obtained comparing our methodology with the others known in literature ( see @xcite

signal @xmath3 and random errors @xmath4 : @xmath5 . \n the problem we are dealing with is how to estimate fundamental frequencies which may be present in the signal @xmath6 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n if @xmath7 is measured at uniform time steps ( even sampling ) there are a lot of tools to effectively solve the problem which are based on fourier analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n these methods , however , are usually unreliable for unevenly sampled data @xcite . for instance , the typical approach of resampling the data into an evenly sampled sequence , through interpolation , introduces a strong amplification of the noise which affects the effectiveness of all fourier based techniques which are strongly dependent on the noise level . to solve the problem of unevenly sampled data , we consider two classes of spectral estimators :    spectral estimators based on fourier trasform ( least squares methods ) ;    spectral estimators based on the eingevalues and eingevectors of the covariance matrix ( maximum likelihood methods ) . \n classic periodogram @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , lomb s periodogram @xcite , scargle s periodogram @xcite , dcdft @xcite are the methods of the first class that we use , while music @xcite , @xcite , and esprit @xcite belong to second class . \n the methods based on the covariance matrix are more recent and have great potentiality . \n starting by this consideration , we develop a method based on the music estimator . \n it is compared with classic methods to highlight the results . \n in the last years several papers dealed with learning in pca neural nets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite finding advantages , problems and difficulties of such neural networks . in what follows we shall use a robust hierarchical learning algorithm @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the weight vector of the @xmath10 output neuron at step @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the corresponding output , @xmath13 is the learning rate and @xmath14 is learning function because it has been experimentally shown that it is the best performing one in our problem @xcite , @xcite . \n our neural estimator ( ne ) can be summarized as follows :    * preprocessing : calculate and subtract the average pattern to obtain zero mean process with unity variance . \n interpolate input data if it is the case . \n * initialize the weight matrix and the other neural network parameters ; * input the @xmath15 pattern @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is the number of input components . * \n calculate the output for each neuron @xmath18 . * \n modify the

the weight matrix columns after the learning . \n the estimated signal frequencies are obtained as the peak locations of the function of following equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the @xmath23th neural network weight vector after learning , and @xmath24 is the pure sinusoidal vector . in the case of an interpolation preprocessing @xmath25^{h}$ ] . in the generalization to \n non interpolated input data , @xmath26^{h}$ ] where @xmath27 are the first @xmath28 components of the temporal coordinates of the uneven signal . \n when @xmath29 is the frequency of the @xmath23th sinusoidal component , @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in practice \n we have a peak near and in corrispondence of the component frequency . \n estimates are related to the highest peaks    furthermore , to optimize the performance of the pca neural networks , we stop the learning process when @xmath33 @xmath34 , so avoiding overfitting problems . \n in fact leaving the stop condition used in the ne causes to the ne to find periodicities not present in the signal , while the new condition preserves it from this problem . \n a simple example is illustrated in figure 2 where we can see how the frequency identification varies depending on the stop condition ( see next section for signal information ) . \n in fact , without the early stopping ( see figure 2.b ) , @xmath35 after @xmath36 epochs remains at a value between @xmath37 and @xmath38 and we can not know when the system reaches the best performance . \n the new stopping criterion , instead , permits to @xmath35 to have a final value about @xmath39 just after @xmath40 epochs ( see figure 2.a ) . \n many experiments on synthetic and real signals were made , and in this paper we present the results obtained with one specific real signal , which highlights the main features of our problem . \n the real signal is related to the cepheid su cygni @xcite . \n the sequence was obtained with the photometric technique ubvri and the sampling made from june to december 1977 . \n the light curve is composed by 21 samples , and has a period of @xmath41 , as shown in figure 1 . \n the first experiment is concerning the interpolation . in this case \n we apply three different methods by using the signal processing mathlab @xmath42 toolbox : linear , cubic and spline , because they are quite simple and the most used ones . in figure 3 \n there is a plotting of the interpolating functions and the frequency estimates obtained by the ne with the spline interpolated signal as input .    in this case , the parameters of the ne are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 . \n the estimate frequency interval is @xmath47 $ ] . \n the estimated frequency without interpolation is @xmath48 ( 1/jd ) . \n a comparison is made with the other methods cited in a previous section and the experimental results are shown in figure 4 and in table 1 . \n only the lomb s periodogram is in agreement with the right periodicity , but showing some spurious peaks . \n furthermore , if we enlarge the frequency window for the two best performing methods , while the ne continues to work well , the lomb s periodogram does not work at all as illustrated in figure 5 . \n in this paper we have illustrated an improved technique based on pca neural networks and music to estimate the frequency of unevenly sampled data . \n it has been shown that it obtains good results on real data ( here we used the su cygni light curve ) compared with other well - known methods . \n in fact , it obtains a good estimate of the signal frequency also with few unevenly sampled inputs , it reduces the noise problems related to input data interpolation , it optimizes the convergence by introducing an early stopping criterion , and , finally , it is more resistant to the dimension of the frequency windows . \n future research lines regard the introduction of genetic algorithms to optimize the weight initialization of the pca neural networks and to use filters to extract and identify one frequency at each time when dealing with multi - frequency signals . \n m. rasile , l. milano , r. tagliaferri

wigner convoluted with a gaussian to account for the experimental resolution ( figure 2 ) . \n the width @xmath6 was held fixed at the particle data book value . \n values obtained from the fit are shown in table  [ tab : tc ] . \n the value of the mass is consistent with the known value of the mass in the vacuum . \n in addition the fitted experimental resolution is consistent with simulations of the detector performance . \n the signal was then divided into 3 bins of @xmath7 , and corrections were made for acceptance and efficiencies . \n a fit was then done to the invariant yield resulting in the yield and inverse slope shown in the table . \n major contributors to the systematic error on dn / dy are the normalization of the background and its effect on the inverse slope , and the run - by - run variations from the electron - trigger . \n 3.4 in     about 62 m minimum bias events were used for the @xmath2 analysis . \n kaons were identified in the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) which covers @xmath8 . because of the limited coverage of the tof , the analysis preferentially accepted higher momentum @xmath9 as compared with the electron analysis . \n the invariant mass spectrum was generated by combining unlike sign pairs of kaons . \n the background shape was formed in a similar manner to the electrons by mixing pairs from events with similar centralities and vertices . \n the normalization in this case was determined by adjusting the integral of the background to @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the like sign combinations in each event . \n once again the signal was fit to a relativistic breit - wigner convoluted with a gaussian for the experimental resolution . since the resolution of the @xmath1 in the kk decay channel is rather insensitive to momentum effects , we chose to hold the experimental resolution fixed to the value obtained from the simulation - 1.2 mev . \n results of the fit are shown in the table and figure 3 . \n both the mass and width are consistent with pdg vacuum values . for both decay channels , @xmath6 and @xmath13 are highly correlated , when they are both allowed to vary in the fit . \n the data are then divided into bins of @xmath7 , corrections are made for acceptance and efficiencies and a fit is done to obtain the yield . because of the good signal to background in the kk channel , systematic errors are considerably smaller than in the electron channel . \n the systematic errors are dominated by the range in @xmath7 over which the fit was done , the run - by - run changes in efficiency , and the corrections due to the fiducial cuts . \n figure 4 shows a comparison of the data points from both the electron and kaon analyses . \n the fit shown in the figure is to all of the points . \n when fits were done to extract yields for comparison , the fits were done separately for the electron and kaon channels . \n the two data samples are consistent in both the yield and the inverse slope as can be seen by looking at the comparisons in figures 5 and 6 of the extracted inverse slopes and yields . \n within the substantial errors - particularly from the electron analysis - the yields of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are consistent with one another . \n because of the small fraction which decay inside the relevant volume , the effects from chiral symmetry restoration , particularly in dau collisions , are expected to be small . \n phenix will make further improvements to this analysis by including the data with a higher trigger threshold and improving systematic errors - particularly from background normalization in the electron channel . \n phenix also sees a clear @xmath16 signal , which , with a shorter lifetime than the @xmath1 will increase the number of decays in the fireball . \n in addition , effects in au - au collisions could be considerably stronger since energy densities are higher . \n further in the future , upgrades to phenix such as the hadron blind detector ( hbd ) will significantly enhance our capabilities to reject conversion and dalitz pairs which are the dominant source of background . \n this will open up the possibility of studying the @xmath17 as well as thermal di - electrons . \n .[tab : tc]results of fits to the invariant mass spectra and the yields for both the electron and kaon decay channels of the @xmath1 . \n statistical errors are listed first , followed by systematic errors .

what is main processes which cause such a drastic fall of solar activity ? to what extent our insight into the solar activity correct in general ?    for solving mentioned problems \n physicist direct their special attention to cosmogenic isotopes @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 . \n the study of these isotopes may give a lot of information about the dynamics of solar activity .    at present \n the most complete data about the solar activity and the intensity of cosmic rays are obtained by means of the above mentioned cosmogenic isotopes ( @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) formed in the earth s atmosphere . \n the main peculiarity of these isotopes and advantage as compared with others is the fact that there exist objects in nature ( e. g. tree rings , arctic and antarctic ices , algae with long life time , etc . ) which can `` fix '' i.e. `` memorize '' annual concentration of the mentioned isotopes , during period that prevails it s half - life time . \n to study the influence of solar activity ( modu1ation ) in the earth atmosphere on radiocarbon concentration during the maunder minimum we use experimental data obtained at the laboratory of nuclear physics of the tsu @xcite ( fig . \n first of all , it should be noted that experimental data cover the maunder minimum itself ( 1645 - 1720 yy ) ( fig . \n 2 ) and its neighboring periods ( 1600 - 1645 and 1715 - 1800 yy ) too . \n the measurements in @xcite were performed with one - year step , i.e. for every calendar year @xmath4 concentration is measured in the corresponding tree ring . \n the experimental samples of tree rings were obtained in lithuania . \n the value of @xmath4 concentration in relation to the international standard scale is calculated by the following formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath12 represents measured activities of the sample ( s ) , standard ( st ) and background ( b ) , respectively . experimental error \n does not exceed 0.2 - 0.3% . in order to extract variations of @xmath4 \n concentration originated only from the `` cosmic '' sources , it is necessary to exclude the influence of the earth s magnetic field . \n this influence has been widely discussed and to date the most accurate estimation is that : global change of geomagnetic field with period of 10 thousand years causes about 10% change in @xmath4 data . \n the following expression accounts for the geomagnetic field effect in @xmath4 concentration @xmath13 , \\ ] ] where t is current calendar year ( t is negative b.c . ) . \n as we mentioned above the effective tool for studying the solar activity dynamics during the maunder minimum is to reveal the cyclings in @xmath4 time dependence ( i.e. periodicities in experimental data given in fig.2 ) . for this purpose \n the method of spectral analysis has been used @xcite . the calculated power spectrum is shown in fig.3 . according to fig.3 the main peak at frequency 0.05 lies in high reliability interval ( 95% ) ( corresponding period @xmath2 year ) . \n small peak is observed at frequency 0.12 ( corresponding period @xmath3 year ) though it s reliability is comparatively low . \n 1 .   using the method of spectral analysis \n we have revealed variations in cosmogenic radiocarbon concentration in the earth atmosphere during the maunder minimum . \n periodicities of two types have been revealed in experimental data . \n 3 .   the reason of the mentioned periodicities is the solar activity . \n this means that in the maunder minimum period modulating action of the sun was weak , nevertheless cycling is preserved \n . it can be also said that in period of the maunder minimum the mechanism of solar dynamo still works . \n reduction of the number of the sunspots may be caused by the coincidence of the minima of any other long - term periodicities at the moment of the maunder minimum . \n kocharov , i.v . \n zhorzholiani , z.v . \n lomtatidze , r.y . \n metskvarishvili , s.l . \n tsereteli , radiocarbon , 1992 , v.34 , n2,p . \n 213 - 217 . \n kocharov , y. n. markov , r.y . \n metskvarishvili , s. l. tsereteli . \n materials of the seminar `` intensity of cosmic rays and cosmogen isotopes '' . 1983 . \n l. 101.[in russian ] i.v . \n zhorzholiani , p. g. kereselidze , et al . \n materials of intern . \n seminar `` experimental methods of astrophysical and geophysical phenomena study '' . 1988 . \n l. 114.[in russian ] g. m. jenkins , d. g. watts `` spectral analysis and its applications '' , holden - day , san francisco , cambridge , london , amsterdam 1969 . \n catalog of indices of solar and geliomagnetic activity . \n obninsk 1976.[in russian ]", "StartTimeOffset": 858541964903, "RequestID": "2777cfc1e75e420f9ca01fd16b8e8161", "TotalTokens": 1717}
{"ContextTokens": 3325, "GeneratedTokens": 259, "SynthesizedBody": "over the last five years , remarkable observational progress has been made in constructing large samples of local and distant galaxy clusters with the aim of quantifying the evolution of their space density and providing the basis for follow - up studies of their physical properties . \n the rosat satellite is largely responsible for this progress , both with all - sky survey data and pointed observations , which have been a gold mine for serendipitous discoveries . \n about a thousand clusters have now been selected from the rosat all - sky survey and several statistical complete subsamples have been used to obtain a firm measurement of the local abundance of clusters @xcite and their spatial distribution ( cf . \n bhringer this volume ) . \n serendipitous searches for distant clusters , selected as extended x - ray sources in deep pspc pointings @xcite , have boosted the number of known clusters at @xmath2 by an order of magnitude , being just a few before the rosat era . as we will show below , this recent work has complemented the original einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) @xcite , and has corroborated its findings .    in this paper \n , we provide a brief update on our current knowledge of the redshift dependent cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) @xcite from results published over the last year . \n the reader is referred to the contributions of h.  ebeling , i.  gioia , l.  jones , a.  vikhlinin in this volume for additional details and recent findings on specific surveys . \n we also report the most recent results from the rosat deep cluster survey ( rdcs ) which has allowed these studies to be pushed beyond @xmath3 for the first time . \n unless otherwise stated , we assume @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 . \n rosat distant cluster surveys @xcite , besides employing different x - ray selection methods , have adopted different strategies in terms of survey depth and solid angle . in fig.[fig : vmax ] , we show the sky coverage of three surveys which span a wide region of the solid angle  limiting flux plane , from the large , shallow emss survey @xcite , to the moderately deep 160 deg@xmath9 cfa survey @xcite , and the deep , small area ( 50 deg@xmath9 ) rdcs @xcite ( the other rosat surveys generally fill the space in between ) . \n this complementary coverage of the @xmath10 plane has the advantage of providing a better sampling of the xlf at different redshifts when results from various surveys are combined . as an example , we also show in fig.[fig : vmax ] the corresponding survey volume which is covered at @xmath11 for an @xmath12 cluster . \n this illustrates the good sensitivity of the rdcs for detecting very distant  common \" clusters , whereas a similar plot would show that the emss explores a larger volume for the most luminous rare systems ( @xmath13 ) .    in fig.[fig : \n xlf_all ] we show several measurements of the cluster xlf that have been published to date . \n sample sizes and median redshifts of each sample are also indicated . \n based on these data , several groups have argued that no significant evolution is observed in the space density of distant clusters with @xmath14\\ { \\raise -2.truept\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{$\\sim$}}\\raise5.truept \\hbox{$<$}\\ } } 3\\times 10^{44 } { \\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}}$ ] @xcite . as demonstrated by the rdcs , this trend persists out to @xmath15 . \n measurements of the distant xlf at @xmath16 are difficult with current samples , due to low number statistics . as a result \n , the evolution of the high end of the xlf has remained a hotly debated issue , ever since it was first reported in the emss @xcite . \n more recently , vikhlinin et al . \n @xcite have confirmed the emss findings by comparing the observed number of very luminous systems with the no evolution prediction . \n this result seems to be also in agreement with a preliminary analysis of the bright sharc sample @xcite ( fig . \n [ fig : xlf_all ] ) . \n the binned representation of the xlf in fig.[fig : xlf_all ] does not provide a full picture of the space density evolution observed in a given sample . for example , it fails to provide the statistical significance of a possible departure from no evolution models @xcite . \n the information contained in the rdcs can be more readily recovered by analyzing the unbinned @xmath17 distribution with a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) approach , which compares the observed cluster distribution on the @xmath17 plane with that expected from a given xlf model . \n we characterize the cluster xlf as an evolving schechter function , + @xmath18 , with @xmath19 ; where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two evolutionary parameters . \n different surveys find consistent values for the faint end slope @xmath22 , which is not observed to vary as a function of redshift ( fig . \n [ fig : xlf_all ] ) . \n for the local xlf , we use here the measurement of the bcs sample @xcite , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    for this analysis \n , we use a complete flux limited sample ( @xmath26 erg @xmath27 s@xmath6 ) of 81 spectroscopically confirmed rdcs clusters drawn from 33 deg@xmath9 ( @xmath28 ) . \n observed flux errors are included in the likelihood computation . \n the resulting @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 c.l . contours in the a - b plane are shown in fig . \n [ fig : like ] , for two different cosmologies . \n best fit values for the @xmath32 case are @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath30 errors ) . the no evolution model ( @xmath35 ) is excluded at more than a @xmath31 confidence level , even when the uncertainties of the local xlf are taken into account . \n the departure of our best fit model from the no - evolution scenario is due to the small number of observed clusters in the rdcs at @xmath36 with luminosities @xmath37 compared to the no - evolution prediction . \n interestingly , this effect is barely significant with a slightly shallower sample ( @xmath38 , 70 clusters ) . \n this evolutionary trend is similar to that observed in the emss @xcite .    by excluding the most luminous clusters from our ml analysis \n , we find that there is _ no evidence of evolution _ \n ( with @xmath30 confidence level ) at luminosities @xmath39 , confirming previous results obtained with smaller samples . a redshift dependent inspection of the likelihood also shows that little can be said on the evolution of the high end of the xlf at @xmath40 with the current rdcs sample . \n these findings lead to a consistent picture in which the comoving space density of the bulk of the cluster population is approximately constant out to @xmath41 , but the most luminous ( @xmath37 ) , presumably most massive clusters were indeed rarer at high redshifts . \n constraints on cosmological models based on this same rdcs sample are discussed elsewhere ( borgani et al . \n this volume ; @xcite ) . \n an inspection of fig . \n [ fig : vmax ] indicates that the rdcs probes an appreciable volume at high redshifts . the maximum sensitivity for clusters at @xmath42 \n is reached at fluxes below @xmath43 and for luminosities @xmath44 . \n the discovery of the first x - ray selected cluster ( rxj0848.9 + 4452 , fig . \n [ fig : c0848 ] ) at @xmath45 in the rdcs @xcite has confirmed these expectations . deep near - ir imagery and optical spectroscopy with keck / lris were required to secure this identification . \n this system has @xmath46 ( in rest frame [ 0.5 - 2 kev ] band ) and is found to lie only @xmath47 away ( @xmath48 comoving mpc ) from an ir selected cluster previously discovered by stanford et al . \n @xcite at @xmath49 , also known to be x - ray luminous with half the @xmath50 of rxj0848.9 . \n this is , most likely , the first example of a high - redshift supercluster consisting of two separate systems in an advanced stage of collapse . scheduled chandra and xmm observations of this field should provide important information on the temperature and metal enrichment of their intra - cluster media . \n recently , two additional faint rdcs candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed , using keck / lris and vlt / fors , as clusters at @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n it should be stressed that these clusters , with @xmath53 , are low surface brightness `` fluctuations '' in pspc images , and therefore the fraction of spurious candidates can be significant at these low fluxes . moreover , the spectroscopic follow - up work of such distant clusters is particularly time consuming , even with 8 - 10 meter class telescopes . \n although the optical identification is not yet complete at these faint flux levels , the high-@xmath54 tail of the rdcs can be used to set an interesting lower limit to the space density of clusters at @xmath55 . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ fig : xlf_new ] , where an extended rdcs sample has been used to obtain the best estimate of the xlf of distant clusters out to @xmath56 . \n such a sample contains 107 clusters drawn from a 47 deg@xmath9 area , with 8 clusters at @xmath57 . \n we also plot in fig . \n [ fig : xlf_new ] the best fit xlf model described above , at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    to better understand the constraints that these newly - identified high redshift clusters set on the xlf evolution , we have plotted in fig . \n [ fig : like ] ( right ) the loci of the a - b plane for which the corresponding xlf , @xmath60}(l , z)$ ] , predicts @xmath61 clusters at @xmath62 , for the entire rdcs sample . \n about 20 clusters would have to be identified in the no - evolution scenario . \n this seems very unlikely , unless the sample is severely incomplete at faint fluxes . \n given that 4 clusters have already been discovered , the portion of the a - b plane which is allowed by this preliminary analysis suggests that the evolution is still rather mild at @xmath42 , at luminosities just above @xmath63 . \n the next obvious step in the effort to understand cluster formation and evolution is to push the cluster ( or proto - cluster ) search out to even higher redshifts , namely out to @xmath64 where the signature of large scale stucture has already been unveiled @xcite . \n finding clusters around high-@xmath54 agn is a viable method ( e.g.@xcite ) , although not suitable for assessing the cluster abundance . \n serendipitous searches with chandra and xmm will of course be actively pursued , but it will take several years to build large enough survey areas , and furthermore , the spectroscopic follow - up of cluster candidates at @xmath65 may turn out to be too difficult with existing telescopes . \n while the short - term prospects for exploring the era at @xmath66 may appear somewhat bleak , it should be kept in mind that earlier this decade many theorists and observers were convinced that clusters at @xmath62 were either out of reach , or did not exist . \n borgani , s. , rosati , p. , tozzi , p. , & norman , c. 1999 , apj , 517 , 40 burke , d.j . \n 1997 , apj , 488 , l83 carilli , c.l . \n 1998 , apj , 494 , l143 crawford , c.s . & \n fabian , a.c . \n 1996 , mnras , 282 , 1483 de grandi et al . 1999 , apj , 514 , 148 dickinson m. et al . 1999 , \n apj , submitted ebeling , h. et al . \n 1997 , apj , 479 , l101 henry , j.p . \n 1992 , apj , 386 , 408 gioia , i.m . \n 1990 , apj , 356 , l35 jones , l.r . \n 1998 , apj , 495 , 100 nichol , r.c . \n et al . 1999 , apj , 521 , l21 page , m.j . , carrera , f.j . 1999 , mnras , in press rosati , p. 1998 , in wide field surveys in cosmology , 14th iap meeting ( paris , publ . \n : editions frontieres ) p.219 rosati , p. , et al . \n 1998 , apj , 492 , l21 rosati , p. et al . \n 1999 , aj , 118 , 76 stanford , s.a . \n 1997 , aj , 114 , 2232 steidel c.c . \n et al .  1999 , \n apj , 519 , 1 vikhlinin a. et al . \n 1998 , apj , 498 , l21", "StartTimeOffset": 864953078878, "RequestID": "0502371081294fadbb2796c67465e4ca", "TotalTokens": 3584}

order hyperbolic form . \n we propose to investigate the evolution equation of @xmath3 ( constraint propagation ) , @xmath4 for evaluating violation features of constraints . \n the character of constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) , will vary when we modify the original evolution equations . \n suppose we modify ( adjust ) ( [ ueq ] ) using constraints @xmath5 then ( [ ceq ] ) will also be modified as @xmath6 therefore , finding a proper adjustment @xmath7 is a quite important problem . \n hyperbolicity analysis may be a way to evaluate constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) @xcite \n . however , this requires ( [ ceq ] ) to be a first - order system which is easy to be broken . \n ( see e.g. detweiler - type adjustment @xcite in the adm formulation @xcite ) . \n furthermore hyperbolicity analysis only concerns the principal part of the equation , that may fail to analyze the detail evaluation of evolution . \n alternatively , we have proceeded an eigenvalue analysis of the whole rhs in ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) after a suitable homogenization , which may compensate for the above difficulties of hyperbolicity analysis . \n we propose to transform the constraint propagation equation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) , into fourier modes , @xmath8 then to analyze the eigenvalues , say @xmath9 , of the coefficient matrix , @xmath10 . \n we call @xmath9 and @xmath10 the constraint amplification factors ( cafs ) and constraint propagation matrix ( cp matrix ) , respectively . \n so far we have proposed the following heuristic conjectures @xcite :    * if the caf has a _ negative real - part _ ( the constraints are necessarily diminished ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a positive caf . * \n if the caf has a _ non - zero imaginary - part _ ( the constraints are propagating away ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a zero caf . \n we observe that this eigenvalue analysis requires the fixing of a particular background space - time , since the cafs depend on the dynamical variables , @xmath11 . \n the cafs indicate the evolution of constraint violations ( definitely its fourier modes ) . \n it is natural to assume that a divergence of constraint norm is related to the numerical blow -

valued operations all the matrices can be converted to this form . \n suppose that @xmath19 has @xmath20 different eigenvalues @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . \n let the multiplicity of @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . \n @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath26 where the cell size of @xmath27 is @xmath28 . \n the jordan matrix @xmath27 is then expressed using a jordan block @xmath29 , @xmath30 note that @xmath29 is @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . \n the minimum polynomial of @xmath19 is written as @xmath35 if @xmath27 is diagonal ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , then @xmath37 for that @xmath38 . if @xmath19 is diagonalizable ( i.e. @xmath36 for @xmath39 ) , then @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . \n we then have the following statement . \n the solution of @xmath40 can be expressed formally as @xmath41 [ propa ]    a proof is available by mathematical induction . \n suppose that @xmath42 is @xmath43 which is the maximal size @xmath27 . by direct calculation \n , we have that @xmath44 yields ( [ kino ] ) with @xmath45-polynomial of degree @xmath46 . then we see that ( [ kino ] ) is satisfied in general .    from this proposition , the highest power @xmath47 in @xmath48polynomial in ( [ kino ] ) \n is bounded by @xmath49 . \n the matrix @xmath27 in ( [ cp2 ] ) can be directly extended to the full cp matrix , @xmath19 , in ( [ cp ] ) . \n therefore the highest power @xmath50 in all constraints is bounded by @xmath51      the following propositions [ prop1 ] and [ prop2 ] give us the next theorem . \n asymptotically constrained evolution ( violation of constraints converges to zero ) is obtained if and only if all the real parts of the cafs are negative . \n [ theoremc1 ]    all the real part of cafs are negative @xmath52 asymptotically constrained evolution . \n [ prop1 ]    proof ) we use the expression ( [ kino ] ) . \n if @xmath53 for @xmath39 , then @xmath54 will converge to zero at @xmath55 no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are . \n @xmath56    asymptotically constrained evolution @xmath52 all the real parts of the cafs are negative . \n [ prop2 ]    proof ) we show the contrapositive . \n suppose there exists an eigenvalue @xmath57 of which the real -

part is positive , then constraints will diverge no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are \n . therefore we try to show that constraints will diverge when all the real - parts of eigenvalues are non - positive , and there exists @xmath23 such that @xmath66 and its jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal . \n since jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal , we see the power of @xmath48polynomial @xmath67 is greater than 1 in the expression ( [ kino ] ) . \n thus we have that ( [ kino ] ) will diverge in @xmath68 . @xmath56 \n two theorems will give us a guideline to analyze a constraint - violating mode of the system . \n the result supports our previous heuristic conjecture ( a ) , but also suggests an ill - behaving case when cafs are degenerated and its real - part is zero , when the associated jordan matrix is not diagonal . \n this indicates the importance of checking the diagonalizability of constraint propagation matrix @xmath19 .    along the line of our evaluation of constraint propagation equations ( [ cp ] ) \n , we propose a practical procedure for this classification in figure [ fig : flowchart ] . \n we think that this diagram will provide systematic predictions for obtaining a robust evolution system in any constrained dynamics . \n ( 85,75 ) ( -5,00 )    the present classification is only on the fixed background spacetime and only for @xmath69 . \n it is still not clear at what value the constraints are bounded if a limiting value exists . \n thus further modifications are underway . \n we are also applying the present classification scheme to various adjusted systems of the einstein equations ( adjusted adm , and further modified versions ) , together with numerical experiments . \n we hope to report on them in the near future . \n the current constraint analysis only concentrates to the evolution equations and does not include the effect of the boundary treatments . since the eigenvalues are evaluated locally , it will be possible to include the effect of numerical boundary conditions if they are expressed apparently in a part of the evolution equations . \n this is also the one direction to proceed our future research . \n meanwhile , we would like to remark that one of our proposed adjustments in @xcite contributes to enforce the computational ability of the black -

{"ContextTokens": 2671, "GeneratedTokens": 187, "SynthesizedBody": "the spin - ordered phase of bcc @xmath0he presents a difficult challenge to accurate theoretical description @xcite . \n the main problem is to explain why the transition temperature @xcite of 10@xmath2k is two orders of magnitude larger than the nuclear dipolar interaction @xmath310@xmath4k . \n we propose that magnetic ordering is due to correlations in the zero point atomic motion . in this respect \n it is similar to the current multiple - spin exchange ( mse ) model @xcite , though the zero - point atomic motion in our model however does not involve the exchange of atoms @xcite . \n this model has conceptual problems that arise from the fact that in order to fit experimental data , many exchange cycles involving a large number of atoms are needed . \n in fact , it is not sure that this expansion converges @xcite , i.e. may not be the spin - ordering mechanism . additionally , \n an overall consistent description of the experimental data has still not been achieved @xcite . \n it is therefore of interest to consider the possibility of another approach . \n the zero - point correlations we consider can be described as zero - point electric dipoles @xcite , and lower the energy of the ground state @xcite . \n this coherent state of oscillating electric dipoles modifies the transverse t@xmath5(110 ) phonon spectrum . \n we show here that this zero - point motion produces an oscillating magnetic polarization of the electronic cloud which interacts with the nuclear spin . \n this hyper - fine type interaction has the right order of magnitude to be related to the spin - ordering transition , and leads naturally to the distinct u2d2 antiferromagnetic phase . \n at temperatures which are high compared to the magnetic interactions ( t@xmath61mk ) , the local zero - point motion in bcc @xmath0he can be treated in the same way as in @xmath7he @xcite . \n we begin by observing @xcite that the crystal potential is highly anisotropic in the bcc phase , being especially wide and anharmonic along the major axes ( 100,010,001 ) . \n this means that the atomic wavefunctions will be particularly extended in these directions , resulting in dynamic - correlations , to reduce the overlap energy . \n the current treatment using variational wavefunction @xcite incorporates these correlations using a jastrow - type function in a self - consistent harmonic ( sch ) calculation . \n this gives a satisfactory description of the phonon branches , except for the transeverse t@xmath5(110 ) phonon , which in reality is much softer . \n introducing cubic terms soften the phonon spectra , but now ruins the good agreement with the other branches . \n we would like to describe the softening of this transverse phonon as resulting from the hybridization of the ( virtual ) harmonic phonon with a ( virtual ) local mode @xcite . the coupling is described as dipolar , where this zero - point dipole moment arises due to correlated atomic motion in the normal axes . \n the harmonic description of the crystal potential misses the low - lying vibration of the atoms due to the shallow ( even double - well ) potential in the normal directions , which is the one responsible for the dynamic correlations . \n we therefore treat them as two independent degrees of freedom . in this hybridization procedure \n we do rely on the sch calculation , taken from previous works @xcite . \n directional oscillation of the nucleus will break the rotational symmetry of the nuclear position relative to the electronic cloud . going beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation , \n the energy due to relative nuclear - electronic fluctuations is @xcite : @xmath8k , where @xmath9 is the electron mass , @xmath10 the nuclear mass , and @xmath11 the excitation energy of the he . \n this is of the order of the energy involved in the zero - point mixing of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 electronic levels : @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . since the nuclear motions are perfectly correlated this polarization results in zero - point dipolar interactions @xcite . \n the dipolar interaction energy @xmath1 , of the order of @xmath16 , is the energy associated with the zero - point correlated oscillations of the atoms along the major axes . \n the ground - state of the crystal in which the zero - point motion of the atoms is correlated may be described as a global state of quantum resonance between the two degenerate configurations shown in fig.1 , each of which minimizes the dipolar interaction energy @xcite .    due to the lower symmetry of the dipolar array ( fig.1 ) compared to the crystal symmetry , a coupling between the harmonic phonons and the dipolar modulation exists only along the ( 110 ) direction @xcite . at the edge of the brillouin zone \n this transverse phonon has the energy @xmath1 . \n in addition there appears a localized excitation of energy @xmath17 , which is involved in mass diffusion and contributes to the specific - heat @xcite , i.e. a quantum analogue of a point defect . \n there is good agreement of our approach with the experimental data for the t@xmath5(110 ) spectrum for bcc @xmath18he @xcite . \n this approch has the advantage over current techniques of explicitly describing the main quantum effect of the anisotropic and anharmonic potential . \n it also resolves previous inconsistencies relating to the properties of vacancies .    in bcc @xmath19he , sound velocity data indicates that the slope of the t@xmath5(110 ) phonon is about half of the sch calculation @xcite . \n we predict that this ratio should indeed be 0.5 , and therefore take half the energy of the calculated @xcite sch t@xmath5(110 ) phonon at the edge of the brillouin zone to be the bare dipole - flip energy @xmath20k at v=21.5cm@xmath0/mole . according to our model \n , the energy of the localized mode involved in thermally activated self - diffusion is @xmath22k . \n this value is in excellent agreement with the activation energy measured by x - ray diffraction , ultrasonics and nmr experiments @xcite at v=21.5cm@xmath0/mole . \n a similar activation energy is also obtained from the excess specific heat @xcite , and pressure measurements @xcite . \n we therefore establish the likely occurance of coherent zero - point dipoles in the ground - state of bcc @xmath19he . \n we now describe the magnetic interaction arising from our model . \n the lowest @xmath23 level of the he atom has the electrons in a spin @xmath24 state due to strong exchange interaction @xcite , of the order of 0.25ev . \n in addition this level is split into 3 sublevels with @xmath25 . \n the splitting , due to spin - orbit coupling @xcite , is of the order of @xmath26k .  in the ground state \n , the @xmath27 electrons will reside in the @xmath28 sublevel , with an oscillating magnetic moment @xmath29 of size @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the magnetic moment of an electron . because part of the magnetic moment is now in the @xmath23 state \n , there appears a net uncanceled moment of equal size in the @xmath32 component of the electronic wavefunction . in @xmath0he \n the nuclear magnetic spin @xmath33 will interact with the oscillating electronic magnetic moment , mainly due to the contact term of the @xmath32 electron at the nucleus . \n the magnetic interaction is of the hyper - fine type @xcite , and the energy associated with it , @xmath34 , is given by : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the nuclear magnetic moment and the calculation of the matrix element follows @xcite . \n we show below that the maximum value of @xmath37mk ( for v=24 cm@xmath0/mole ) , much larger than the direct nuclear dipole - dipole interaction , and is of the right magnitude to explain the high transition temperature of nuclear ordering in bcc @xmath0he .    in our model , \n the magnetic energy will change with pressure due to changes of the electronic magnetic polarization @xmath29 . \n the main effect as the solid is compressed , is that the 3 sub - levels ( @xmath38 ) broaden into partially overlapping bands . \n the effect of the broadening of the sub - levels with pressure can be approximated using the overlap integral of the three sub - levels : @xmath39 , where the overlap integral @xmath40 is calculated for the spin - orbit levels using a simple band calculation . the level broadening is the coulomb energy of the @xmath27 electrons due to overlapping wavefunctions on neighboring he nuclei @xcite . \n we find that the overlap factor @xmath41 is very sensitive to volume , changing from 1 at v=24 cm@xmath0/mole to @xmath42 at v=19 cm@xmath0/mole . \n one can see that as the volume decreases the broadening of the bands increase , thereby decreasing the net magnetic polarization of the oscillating electronic cloud . \n the strength of the magnetic interaction should be proportional to the measured curie - weiss temperature @xmath43 . \n in fig.2 we compare the normalized magnetic splitting @xmath44 with the normalized values of the measured @xcite @xmath43 . \n we find that the volume dependence of agrees very well . \n we now consider the symmetry of the ordered spin system . \n the existence of the hyper - fine splitting means that the simple quantum resonance condition on each site is broken . \n now , the two antiferoelectric configurations shown in fig . 1 are not degenerate , with an energy difference of @xmath44 per site . \n it is possible to restore the degeneracy of the overall ground state , and hence the quantum resonance condition . \n the possible arrangements of the nuclear spins that fulfill the resonance requirement on each simple sublattice are those that ensure an equal number of atoms with electronic and nuclear spins aligned ( and anti - aligned ) in both degenerate configurations of the electronic dipoles . \n these arrangements preserve the overall time - reversal symmetry of the system at zero field . \n we therefore end up with an u2d2 arrangements which is the symmetry of the ordered nuclear phase @xcite . \n we point - out that the u2d2 phase results from symmetry considerations , independent of any quantitative parameters ( as in mse @xcite ) . \n to conclude , our model enables us to describe the nuclear magnetic ordering of bcc @xmath0he using a single parameter , which is the thermal activation energy @xmath1 . \n experimental values of @xmath1 were measured in several experiments . \n the model describes correctly both the symmetry of the ordered phase and the volume dependence of the magnetic interactions . \n this work was supported by the israel science foundation , by the technion vpr fund for the promotion of research , the fulbright foreign scholarship grant , the center for advanced studies and nsf grant no . \n phy-98 -

2)predictive image coding ; 3)pso matching . instead of distributed stochastically in the entire matching space \n , we also devise a novel distribution pattern for particle initialization to bear the center - biased characteristics of common motion fields . \n as widely adopted , we measure the amount of computation and the quality of compensated video sequence by _ computation _ and _ peak signal - to - noise ratio_(psnr ) . \n computation is defined as the average number of the error function evaluations per mv generation . due to the minimum computational cost \n , we choose _ summed absolute difference_(sad ) as the error function which is defined as follows :    @xmath46    where the size of a mb is @xmath24 . \n + the motion estimate quality between the original @xmath47 and the compensated video sequences @xmath48 is measured in psnr which is defined as :    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the number of frames in the video sequence . \n zero - motion prejudgment(zmp ) was firstly introduced in @xcite . \n data shown in @xcite represented that in most of test sequences , more than 70% of the mbs are static which do not need the remaining search . \n so , significant reduction of computation is possible if we perform the zmp procedure before the follow - up predictive coding and pso matching routine . \n we first calculate the matching error(sad in this paper ) between the mb in the anchor frame and the mb at the same location in the target frame and then compare it to a predetermined threshold , saying @xmath52 . \n if the matching error is smaller than @xmath52 , we consider this mb static which do not need any further motion estimation , and return a @xmath53 $ ] as its motion vector(mv ) .      based on the center - biased characteristics in video sequences , that is , \n certain mbs are highly correlated in local regions of the frame , the encoder creates a prediction of a region of the current frame based on previously encoded and transmitted frames . \n if the frame is processed in raster order , the current - encoded mb should have four patterns of _ region of support_(ros ) that consists of the neighboring blocks whose mvs will be used to compute the predicted mv for prediction in fig . \n [ pre.pattern ] due to the limited computational cost . experiment mentioned in @xcite shows there is little psnr difference using these four ros patterns in the predictive coding routine , and ros type d consumes least amount of computation because of its simplest structure . \n thus , ros pattern d is adopted in this paper .      due to the spatial correlation characteristics between mbs in one frame , during the initiation period of the pso matching routine , we distribute the particles in four specific patterns(fig .  [ pattern.all ] ) with a view to reduce the computational cost but to achieve higher psnr . \n since frames are processed in raster order , the mb in the top - left corner in the frame , can not be predictive coded because there is no reference mb for prediction in the current - encoded frame . \n thus , for this condition , we simply skip the predictive coding and begin pso searching routine directly with the initial positions of particles in the pattern type b in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] .    for those mbs located at the leftmost column of frames , \n their reference mbs used in predictive coding are in the other side of the frame , thus may not be highly correlated and inefficient in prediction . \n so , we also solely perform the pso searching routine in this case , with the pattern type d in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] . and , for the last leftmost \n mb been processed in the frame , that is , the mb in the bottom - left corner , we use the pattern type c in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] instead . \n otherwise , pattern type a in fig . \n [ pattern.all ] is adopted . \n we put four particles in a rood shape with size zero(size refers to the distance between any vertex point and the center - point ) in the adjacent mbs and four particles in a rood shape with size one , and then rotate it by angle @xmath54 . with two rood shape in difference size \n , we try to balance the global exploration and local refined search in order for broader searching space as well as higher matching accuracy . \n moreover , we distribute particles equally in all directions(8 particles in 8 directions ) with a view to , in stochastic condition , find the matching mb in each direction with equal possibility . \n notably , if the position of a particle in the during initialization and a pso run is out of the boundary of the image frame , we simply put the particle in the position nearest to its intended position . \n generally , there are two widely adopted stopping criteria . \n fixed - iteration _ , that is , given a certain iteration time , saying @xmath31 , the search stops after @xmath31 times of iteration \n . the other is _ specified - threshold_. during a pso run , the most - fitted value found by the entire group @xmath55 , called the \n _ best so far _ \" value will be updated by the particles . for minimization problems , we specify a very small threshold @xmath56 , and if the change of @xmath55 during @xmath57 times of iteration is smaller than the threshold , we consider the group best value very near to the global optimum , thus the matching procedure stops . due to the center - biased characteristics of real - world motion fields , \n we adopt the fixed - iteration method in this paper for reducing the computational cost . \n we incorporate the zmp , the predictive coding and the pso matching routines together and propose a block - matching algorithm for motion estimation based on pso and zmp . \n the algorithm can be summarized in the pseudocode below : + \n we ve tested our pso - zmp algorithm on five test video sequences : akiyo , container , mother & daughter , news and silent within 100 image frames(except 90 frames in akiyo due to the limitation of the sequence length ) . \n pso matching is the core routine in our algorithm . in this paper , to balance between computational cost and compensated video quality , we adopt the standard pso with inertia weight@xcite which is widely considered as the defacto pso standard . \n we use the fixed - iteration stopping criterion with max 5 iterations . \n the max velocity is set to 5 . \n the inertia weight @xmath38 decreases linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 during a pso run and two acceleration factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 are set to 2.0 , as commonly did . \n * we divide a whole image frame into @xmath60 mbs in the simulation . * \n we select a zmp threshold @xmath52 for each test video sequence correspondingly based on data obtained in experiments . \n the parameters are shown in table  [ zmp.table ] . \n * we do not restrict the range of candidate matching mbs rigidly by a search window @xmath17 . instead , through the fixed - iteration and the setting of max velocity , particles search for the matching mb in an area more flexible and adaptable .    .zmp \n threshold @xmath52 for five test video sequences [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in this paper , we have proposed a fast block - based motion estimation algorithm based on _ particle swarm optimization_(pso ) with novel particle initiation patterns . applied successfully in many functional and combinatorial optimization problems \n , pso is proved to have a relevant stronger ability in global exploration . \n in addition , a _ zero -

{"ContextTokens": 2516, "GeneratedTokens": 203, "SynthesizedBody": "during several years , it was believed that the existence of free - standing two dimensional crystals was impossible , because they would be unstable and ultimately return to a three dimensional object@xcite . \n however , it appeared recently that isolated sheets of graphene could be obtained by mechanical exfoliation of a graphite crystal , which therefore proves the predictions of ref . to be inaccurate@xcite . \n the experimental accomplishment of synthesizing two - dimensional crystals has lead to the emergence of a truly new physics , since the particular properties of graphene can be considered as a bridge between quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and condensed matter physics@xcite . \n indeed , near the @xmath1 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , the one - particle energy dispersion is linear with the momentum , and therefore the corresponding quasiparticles could be described by a dirac - like hamiltonian . \n then , qed properties can be studied by investigating the electronic structure of graphene . \n later on , it was shown@xcite that the same technique could be used to obtain other compounds , opening the path to the investigation of a large number of two dimensional crystals . \n however , it seems that most of the experimental and theoretical efforts in this area are still focusing exclusively on graphene , primarily because of the high quality of samples that could be obtained . in the present paper , we investigate by means of ab - initio calculations the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , as they have been synthesized experimentally@xcite , as well as hypothetical two dimensional hexagonal crystals ( with a graphene like structure ) made of si and ge . \n to perform the calculations , we have used density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite as implemented in the code vasp ( vienna ab - initio simulation package)@xcite , within the framework of the paw ( projector augmented waves ) method @xcite . \n the local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) as well as the perdew burke ernzerhof@xcite variant of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) were used for the exchange - correlation potential . \n a cut - off of @xmath2 ev was used for the plane - wave expansion of the wave function to converge the relevant quantities . for brillouin zone integrations , \n a mesh of @xmath3 @xmath4-points@xcite was used for mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , while a mesh of @xmath5 was sufficient to describe two - dimensional silicon and germanium .    concerning the crystal structure mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 we used the experimental bulk values since it was noticed in ref . \n that @xmath6d crystals in these cases remains very close to their 3d parents . in this case , \n gga was used . \n for the two dimensional hexagonal crystals made of si and ge , we optimized the lattice parameter using either the lda or the gga \n . moreover , it appeared that the band structure obtained using either lda or gga were very similar , so we have chosen to show only results corresponding to lda . \n for all studies here , the c parameter was taken to be large enough to ensure that no interaction remains between layers , making them effectively isolated @xmath6d objects . \n there is a big interest in transition metal dichalcogenides , since due to their layered structure , they have extremely anisotropic properties , and therefore an intercalation process is easy to conduct . in particular , mos@xmath0 is used in the technology of li batteries . \n to investigate purely two - dimensional mos@xmath0 , we have used the bulk lattice parameter ( a @xmath7  ) , as reported in ref . \n since reduced dimensionality can sometimes leads to magnetic behavior in systems which are not magnetic in bulk , we checked the possibility to have a spin - polarized ground - state , but it was found that two - dimensional mos@xmath0 remains in a non - magnetic state .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : dos - mos2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    our calculated dos is presented in fig [ fig : dos - mos2 ] . \n as for three - dimensional mos@xmath0 , the two - dimensional variant of this compound is semiconducting : the bands on each side of the band gap are derived mainly from the mo - d states , which is what a calculation of three dimensional mos@xmath0 also shows@xcite . also , a large gap exists in the occupied states , separating the s - s states ( between -14 and -12 ev ) and the hybridized mo and s - p states ( between -6 and 0 ev ) .     the band structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig . \n [ fig : bnds - mos2 ] , we present the energy bands of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 . we see again a lot of similarities with three dimensional mos@xmath0 : the bands around the band - gap are relatively flat , as expected from the d character of the electron states at these energies . \n the band gap , which has a value of 1.78 ev , is direct , and occurs at the high - symmetry point @xmath1 , whereas for three dimensional mos@xmath0 the band gap is indirect@xcite . \n as for mos2 , the nbse@xmath0 structure is strongly layered , with each nb layer being sandwiched between two se layers , where weak van der waals forces are holding the whole geometry together . \n nbse@xmath0 is known to be a prototype to study charge density waves ( cdw ) , and is also a superconductor . here \n we focus only on the electronic structure of two - dimensional nbse@xmath0 and a lattice constant of @xmath8 @xcite was used to perform the calculation .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : dos - nbse2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as for mos@xmath0 , we have checked the existence of a magnetic solution , since the non spin - polarized dos ( fig . \n [ fig : dos - nbse2 ] ) is very peaked at the fermi level , but we found again a non - magnetic ground state . \n however , contrary to mos@xmath0 , two dimensional nbse@xmath0 is metallic , just like the three dimensional version of this compound . \n the dos of two - dimensional nbse@xmath0 shows a lot of similarities with the one of mos@xmath0 , with a large hybridization between nb and se states . \n in addition , the band state which is pinned at the fermi level is derived primarily from nd d - orbitals , and this band state becomes separated in energy from all other states ( fig . \n [ fig : bnds - nbse2 ] ) .    . \n the fermi level is put at zero ev . \n [ fig : bnds - nbse2 ] , scaledwidth=70.0% ] \n with four sp electrons in the valence band , silicon and germanium ( possibly together with bn ) are probably the closest to carbon from a chemical point of view . \n therefore , it is of interest to see if in their two - dimensional form they could present some similarities with graphene , and we have investigated this possibility here .    . \n lattice parameters of hexagonal si and ge computed with either lda or gga . [ tab : lattice ] [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]      , scaledwidth=70.0% ]     , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in table [ tab : lattice ] , we present our computed lattice parameters ( see computational section ) for hexagonal si and ge . \n as expected , they are larger than the one of graphene ( @xmath9  ) because of the larger radius of si and ge in comparison with c. also , because of the well - known overbinding of lda , gga gives lattice parameters which are larger than the ones given by lda . \n , scaledwidth=70.0% ]     , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we used these lattice parameters for the calculation of the corresponding densities of states and band structures . \n as seen in figs [ fig : dos - si ] and [ fig : bnds - si ] , two - dimensional silicon shows a lot of similarities with graphene : in particular the gap is also closing at the k point of the brillouin zone , and the dispersion around this point is linear . \n in contrast , two - dimensional germanium is quantitatively different from graphene : a conduction band is partially filled by electrons around the @xmath10 point and therefore the bands at the @xmath1 point are shifted up in energy , so that two - dimensional germanium is not a zero - gap material , but rather a poor metal . for three dimensional germanium , it is known that lda / gga gives a non band - gap behavior , and a more advanced technique like the gw approximation@xcite is required to obtain a band gap . \n however , our calculations with dft show that two - dimensional germanium is much more metallic than three - dimensional germanium , and therefore the metallic nature is here much more robust and is likely to be preserved even if a quasiparticle theory ( like the gw approximation ) would be used . \n we have studied by means of ab - initio calculations the electronic structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , as well as hypothetical graphene like structures of si and ge . \n we have found that two - dimensional silicon might from an electronic structure point of view be equivalent to graphene , with a linear dispersion of the electronic structure around the k - point . \n the possible advantage with si in this regard is that it probably is more easily interfaced with existing electronic devices and technologies . \n the obvious disadvantage is that sp@xmath11 bonded si is much less common than for c , and the synthesis of si in a graphene like structure is extremely demanding and is likely to represent a meta - stable material . \n the electronic structure of ge in the graphene structure results in a metallic behavior , and the electronic structure of two - dimensional mos@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 is quite similar to that of the three dimensional counterparts , with mos@xmath0 being a gapped system with a direct gap and nbse@xmath0 a metal . \n s.l . acknowledges financial support from anr pnano grant anr- 06-nano-053 - 02 and anr grant anr - blan07 - 1 - 186138 , as well as cines / ccrt for computer time . \n o. e. is grateful to snac and vr for support and to a kof initiative at uppsala university .", "StartTimeOffset": 918132740400, "RequestID": "954205c0330e410d8458b9469ebc626c", "TotalTokens": 2719}

like sharp cusp disappears and the peak gets smaller . \n furthermore , there appears a systematic crossing at low temperatures . \n ( iii ) the shape of the curve gets rounder and , eventually , becomes flat . \n these experimental findings are summarized in fig . \n these figures are reproduced from references [ 1 -

{"ContextTokens": 3728, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "transaction costs preclude perfect replication of contingent claims and introduce a tradeoff between the risk and return to hedging . a standard approach to dealing with this tradeoff \n is to use utility functions for evaluating hedging errors ( hodges and neuberger 1989 ) and the utility indifference principle for pricing options ( davis et al . \n in contrast to the elegance of black - scholes delta hedging , these models typically lack explicit solutions and require powerful numerical methods to obtain case - by - case approximations of optimal hedges .    in some situations the particular structure of the optimal hedging strategy \n is known , which facilitates numerical analysis . \n one example is the black - scholes model with proportional transaction costs , where the hedging strategy of a trader with cara utility function is defined by a no - trade region ( davis et al . \n when the hedger s stock holdings are outside this region , she carries out a trade that brings the stock position onto the nearest boundary point . \n numerical methods that approximate value functions have proved successful in this model , see , e.g. , monoyios ( 2004 ) . \n a different approach is presented in zakamouline ( 2006 ) who derives analytic approximations of the two boundaries of the no - trade region . \n motivated by asymptotic results in whalley and wilmott ( 1997 ) , his approach combines a clever guess of a parametric functional form with the estimation of coefficients as functions of model parameters . \n these estimations , however , require a numerical approximation of the optimal hedging strategy . \n in this paper we propose an alternative approach to derive explicit hedging strategies for general nonlinear transaction costs . \n the approach is based on genetic programming which offers several advantages over classical numerical approaches . \n first , by construction it is constrained to output closed - form expressions that are functions of the model parameters . \n second , it delivers efficient results at low cost by solving the two tasks of finding an optimal hedging strategy and a closed - form representation for it in one integrated process . \n third , no assumption is made on the functional form of the approximation . \n genetic programming therefore avoids the disadvantage of ex post calibration methods and , at the same time , offers a technique that deals with cases in which there is no a priori information on the structure of the optimal solution . \n the closed - form approximations of hedging strategies derived with this heuristic method can be directly tested in different market situations to verify their efficiency before their integration into an automated trading system . \n the hard work of obtaining these hedging strategies is left to the computer . \n once this is done , hedging is without sweat .    in the example considered in this paper \n we determine closed - form expressions for the hedging strategy of an option writer with cara utility function under proportional and quadratic transaction costs . \n the price of the underlying follows a geometric brownian motion . \n solutions to this problem with a large range of parameter values are derived at various requirements on the simplicity of hedging strategies , ranging from full - fledged computer programs to short analytic functions . \n parameters include volatility , interest rate , strike price of the european call , and transaction cost parameters . \n information available to the hedger consists of stock price , black - scholes delta and gamma , time to maturity , and current portfolio holdings , in addition to the parameter values which are random but constant until maturity of an option . \n our method produces better results than zakamouline ( 2006 ) when transaction costs are proportional . under \n quadratic transaction costs we find simple near - optimal linear trading strategies that consist of a trade intensity and a no - trade reference solution . \n the no - trade path can be interpreted as a modified black - scholes delta and the trade intensity as a modified gamma . in summary \n , the paper demonstrates the practical use of genetic programming in deriving hedges under nonlinear transaction costs . \n we consider the hedging problem faced by a risk -

500 autonomous sub - populations of hedging strategies deployed on separate worker processors arranged in a circle topology . from time to time , the worker processes send their best program to a master process ; exchange good candidate solutions with their neighbors ; and generate a new set of test options . the master process uses a separate large fixed set of options to identify the current globally best strategy . \n a byte code program representation is used for genetic recombination ( crossover and mutation ) , and a machine code representation ( nordin 1997 ) is used for fast computation of hedging decisions . \n a simple built - in compiler translates byte code to machine code . \n our software also contains a byte code disassembler whose output can be processed by a c compiler , or analyzed with maxima or similar tools for symbolic math manipulation . \n we first apply the genetic programming ( gp ) method to the model with proportional transaction costs ( with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . \n two different treatments will be applied . \n trading strategies are first evolved using the gp approach without any information about the structure of the optimal hedge strategies . we choose to ignore the knowledge that under proportional transaction costs the optimal strategy is defined by a no - trade region because under other cost structures such a priori information is typically not available . in a second treatment , we derive a simple analytic closed - form expression to approximate the no - trade region .      the structure of the hedging strategies is given by . \n strategies are represented as computer programs whose operators include arithmetic expressions as well as _ min _ , _ max _ , conditional assignments , and forward jumps ( conditional and unconditional ) . \n the output from a program is interpreted as a decision of how much stock to buy or sell given the current combination of option parameters and variables . \n the programs can be used as is in an automated trading application , although they may be difficult to analyze due to the occurrence of conditional jumps and assignments . \n [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] provides an illustration of our results for an example option and stock price path . as in figure \n [ fig : tradingpc ] , the left panel depicts trade volumes for each day and each stock position in @xmath54 $ ] for a typical trading strategy evolved with the gp algorithm , but in the this case with quadratic transaction costs . \n the left panel shows that the trade volume is approximately a linear function of the stock position for most stock positions and most periods in time . \n intersecting the graph with the horizontal plane at zero on the vertical axis , one obtains a curve through combinations of time and stock positions where there is no trade , and such that for other nearby points on the graph , the trade volume on the corresponding day is a constant fraction of the difference between the corresponding no - trade position and stock position . \n these observations suggest that linear trading strategies will provide good performance under quadratic transaction costs . \n the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : tradingqc ] shows the projection of the no - trade curve ( grey ) along with the gp hedge ( bold black ) , and the delta hedge ( dotted ) . \n also shown is the trade intensity ( black ) , defined as trade volume divided by the absolute difference between the current stock position and the no - trade stock position . \n the latter closely tracks the black - scholes delta . \n the hedging strategy adjusts the stock position towards the no - trade stock position , but this adjustment is quite slow , as the trade intensity is typically less than 20% . \n we therefore observe large deviations between actual stock holdings and the no - trade curve . \n closer to maturity the trade intensity is more volatile but then declines quickly ( resembling the widening of the no - trade region under proportional costs ) . \n this general pattern of sluggish adjustment leads to substantial savings in transaction costs compared to the black - scholes delta .      to explore the performance of linear hedging strategies under quadratic costs , we apply the gp algorithm to trading strategies of the form @xmath55\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the no - trade stock position and \n @xmath57 is the trading intensity , and both are analytic expressions . \n the functions are constrained to be independent of stock holdings but are allowed to depend on time , greeks , and the parameter vector @xmath30 which are suppressed in .    as in the proportional cost case , making use of information about the ( approximate ) structure of the optimal hedge leads to strategies that are slightly better than those obtained without such information . in the current case , the mean improvement in performance amounts to 0.3 cents per option . \n this improvement is of the same order of magnitude as in the proportional cost case , where the a priori information was known to be correct . \n we therefore conjecture that linear strategies of the form ( [ eq : stratqc ] ) are near - optimal for hedgers with cara utility functions and quadratic transaction costs when the initial stock position is not too far from its desired level . \n the following approximation was obtained by means of the same simplification approach as in section  [ sec : prop_notrade ] . \n it produces hedging decisions that perform as well as the best strategy in its class . for a given date @xmath58 , the no - trade stock position @xmath59 and the trading intensity @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 , as before . \n the paper demonstrates the merits of a gp approach to solving optimal hedging problems under transaction costs . \n this heuristic method delivers approximations that are analytic functions of various parameters describing the option contract , the dynamic of the underlying , and transaction costs . \n these explicit approximations to optimal hedging strategies can easily be tested and integrated into an automated trading system . \n other estimation methods , such as zakamouline s ( 2006 ) , derive closed - form approximations using ad hoc specifications of the functional form and an exact ( numerical ) solution for their calibration . \n in contrast to such approaches , ours is both simpler and more general , as it requires neither explicit solutions nor assumptions about functional forms . \n preliminary results indicate that our gp method also works well for exotic options , other nonlinear transaction costs and stochastic volatility models but that is beyond the scope of this short note . \n = 2em = -2em", "StartTimeOffset": 958957241156, "RequestID": "27ac23f5b12c435faba0f1784d9202d5", "TotalTokens": 3859}

optical applications mentioned above , the field parallel to an atomic dipole has to be maximized . in these cases , \n the dipole axis is given by the quantization axis of the scenario at hand . in a classical sense , \n the term dipole axis designates the direction from which the polar angle @xmath0 is measured that parameterizes the angular dipole radiation patterns ( see also fig .

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one could calculate the overlaps also in the case of a lens obeying the sine condition . \n however , due to the divergence of the ideal irradiance values towards the boundary of the lens aperture the calculation of the overlap with the simple modes discussed above does not appear to be meaningful . \n similar arguments apply when the virtual dipole is oriented orthogonal to the optical axis . since the ideal irradiance patterns have no rotational symmetry , the overlaps will always be smaller than their counterparts for the dipole axis being parallel to the optical axis . \n we have derived the ideal radiation patterns with which one achieves the maximum possible field strengths for several focusing devices . besides using these radiation patterns , it is of utmost importance to maximize the covered solid angle , as it is shown by eqs . \n [ eq : focusfield ] and [ eq : focusfield_ovl ] . \n thus , the maximum possible electric field strength is achieved by covering the full solid angle . \n also , the maximum possible effect in the interaction of light with single atoms will also only be found for full solid angle coverage , since scattering as well as absorption of photons is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude at the location of the atom  @xcite . \n this finding is in contrast to the statements made in other publications , where it was claimed that the power scattered by a single atom is already maximized for half solid angle illumination @xcite . according with the papers of van enk and kimble @xcite , we want to state once more that for optimum interaction of light with single atoms one has to shape the radiation incident onto the atom to resemble an electric dipole wave .", "StartTimeOffset": 981929857642, "RequestID": "dbe3f323f9494cea9a3585c33c4762c4", "TotalTokens": 4108}

[ fig : geometries ] . in the scheme \n the base of each detector is turned by an angle of 50@xmath2 to the horizontal . the most efficient way to pack fibres together to form inclined columns \n is not obvious . \n `` rows '' of fibres are defined along the layers in the direction of the detector base . for column angles between 30@xmath2 and 60@xmath2 \n the arrays can be formed in a way that all fibres of a column touch each other ( closed columns ) , but leaving gaps to the corresponding fibres in neighbouring columns . \n alternatively , the arrays can be formed with corresponding fibres of neighbouring columns touching ( closed rows ) , leaving gaps between fibres within a column . finally , for column angles @xmath5 below 30@xmath2 both columns and rows can be closed . for column angles of 30@xmath2 and 60@xmath2 \n the fibre centres are forming a hexagonal lattice . for a column angle of 45@xmath2 the fibre centres are forming a square lattice . \n the hexagonal packing , in which each fibre is surrounded by 6 touching fibres , has the highest packing density of @xmath7 0.90 . \n square and hexagonal packing geometry are used most often for fibre arrays . \n each geometry corresponds to a different overlap fraction , a different column pitch , a different detector width and length for a given number of layers and read - out pixels , and a different average thickness . \n the relevance of these design criteria for choosing the detector geometry vary with the specific application . \n primarily , the fibre array needs to provide a high enough light yield per read - out pixel to discriminate the signals against noise . \n light yield and detection efficiency depend on the diameter and overlap fraction as well as on the number of layers . \n secondly , the spatial resolution depends on fibre diameter and column pitch . a detector geometry with closed columns \n as shown in the figure will have a relatively large column pitch and a relatively small spatial overlap . \n this leads to low spatial resolution and low detection efficiency . \n both can be avoided by placing the layers not along the base of the detector , but with a smaller column pitch and larger spatial overlap . \n that will create a shift between the first fibres of each column and the base - line it was supposed to track . by occasionally ( every 3 or more columns ) moving the column position one full fibre diameter in the direction of the base - line \n the shift will be corrected . \n these geometries have the advantage of being better adapted to practical applications , but have less symmetry . for column angles above 60@xmath2 geometries with neither columns nor rows \n closed can be created in a similar way . in practice , only those fibre arrays can be built which allow precise mounting and alignment during all stages of the processing : gluing , bending , and installation . \n [ fig : design](left ) shows the ratio of the column pitch to the fibre radius , @xmath8 , i.e.  the distance between two fibre centres along the base direction in units of fibre radius , as a function of the column angle , @xmath5 . \n the main branch starting at a ratio @xmath9 2 corresponds to a geometry with both , closed rows and closed columns , for which @xmath10 . \n the branch splitting off at @xmath11 corresponds to a geometry with closed columns , where @xmath12 . \n the continuous curve is calculated for the geometry in which the rows are closed . \n the branch splitting off at @xmath13 follows a @xmath14 dependence and corresponds to closed columns . \n spatial overlap is important to avoid relying on the detection of events with only a grazing contact of the charged particle with the fibres . \n a particle which crosses the gap between two fibres in one of the layers needs to traverse a significant portion of the full fibre diameter in the other layer . fig . \n [ fig : design](right ) shows the overlap fraction , @xmath15 , which is the overlap of two neighbouring fibre columns in units of the fibre radius . \n it is directly related to the pitch to radius ratio by @xmath16 . \n fibre diameter and overlap fraction relate to the theoretical spatial resolution of fibre arrays expected from the geometry . for events \n in which exclusively one column was hit , the the spatial resolution is @xmath17 . for events in which the particle trajectory covered purely the inter -

out pixel . \n the increase in channel multiplicity for detectors with column angles of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is presented in fig . \n [ fig : multiplicities ] as a function of the incident angle @xmath3 . \n it is shown that the multiplicity increases gradually to smaller incident angles but steeper to higher angles . \n owing to the symmetry of the fibre arrays , a local maximum of the multiplicity appears for @xmath13 at @xmath1 30@xmath2 , and for @xmath27 at @xmath1 0@xmath2 . \n it is obvious that the columns must be aligned with the incident particle direction and the particle s divergence must be small to achieve a minimal multiplicity and an optimal spatial resolution . \n the simulation can further help to define the optimum threshold so that a detector becomes insensitive to incoming particles with large angles w.r.t  the nominal angle . \n that is important when a detector is exposed to a large number of background particles . \n the angular dependence of the detector efficiency is plotted in fig . \n [ fig : efficiency ] for 4 different relative thresholds . \n the relative threshold of 100% corresponds to the mean signal of a detector pixel for events with particles hitting the detector with nominal angle . \n the plateau width for 100% efficiency depends crucially on the threshold . for incident angles much smaller than the nominal angle \n only one fibre of each column is hit , but many neighbouring channels . \n thus , the probability for having a signal in at least one pixel above threshold is strongly dependent on the distribution of energy deposition and the value of the threshold , but almost independent on geometry and incident angle . \n when a set of fibres from a multi - layered fibre detector is coupled to a multi - channel read - out device a multitude of different fibre array geometries is possible . \n it is the experimenter s choice to select the geometry , which is matching the application best , according to the relevant design criteria . in this paper the dependence of column pitch and overlap ratio on the fibre array column angle \n is discussed . \n both criteria are also reflected by the thickness variation of a double layer , which is shown for a selection of column angles . \n the effect of diverging particles incident on fibre arrays with inclined columns was studied with the help of a monte carlo simulation . \n the resulting curves of channel multiplicity versus incident angle can be folded with the incident angle distribution of an experiment to get the average channel multiplicity . \n large multiplicities compromise the position resolution of the fibre arrays , which is the key issue for tracking detectors . with the choice of the detection threshold , the sensitivity of the detector to particles with large deviations to the nominal angle can be varied . \n this work was supported by the federal state of rhineland -

omegaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . \n ( the reason for introducing an electric field will become apparent in the next section . ) \n the experimentally measured numbers are the muon spin frequency @xmath32 and the magnetic field , which is measured with proton nmr , calibrated to the larmor precession frequency , @xmath33 , of a _ \n free _ proton . \n the anomaly is related to these two frequencies by @xmath34 @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . \n the tilde over @xmath32 means it has been corrected for the electric - field and pitch ( @xmath37 ) corrections  @xcite . \n the ratio @xmath38 is determined experimentally from the hyperfine structure of muonium , the @xmath39 atom  @xcite . as mentioned above , \n the recommended value of @xmath38 has changed slightly since the final results of e821 were published  @xcite , increasing the value of @xmath40 by @xmath41 , which is reflected in eq . \n ( [ blr - eq : amue821 ] ) .      in the 2001 data set , \n the systematic errors on the magnetic field were reduced to @xmath43  ppm . \n a number of contributions went into this small error , but one which we wish to emphasize here is the average magnetic field experienced by the muon ensemble . \n the magnetic field in eq . \n ( [ eq : blr - omegaa ] ) is an average that can be expressed as an integral of the product of the muon distribution times the magnetic field distribution over the storage region . \n since the moments of the muon distribution couple to the respective multipoles of the magnetic field , either one needs an exceedingly uniform magnetic field , or exceptionally good information on the muon orbits in the storage ring , to determine @xmath44 to sub - ppm precision . thus traditional magnetic focusing used in storage rings , which involves magnetic quadrupole and higher multipoles , will cause large uncertainties in the knowledge of @xmath44 . \n this problem was mitigated in the third cern experiment@xcite , and in e821 , by using electrostatic quadrupoles to provide the vertical focusing , freeing the magnetic - field design to be as close to a uniform dipole field as possible . \n examination of eq . \n ( [ eq : blr - omegaa ] ) shows that for @xmath45 , called `` the magic @xmath42 , '' an electric field will not contribute to @xmath32 . \n the electric - field effect vanishes for particles with the central momentum equal to @xmath46  gev / c , and is a small ( sub - ppm ) correction for other stored muons  @xcite . \n the cern experiment used a rectangular aperture , which at their 7.3  ppm level of precision did not cause problems in determining the average field . \n however , the large moments of a rectangular beam were not acceptable for the bnl experiment , which aimed at a factor - of - twenty improvement . \n thus a circular beam aperture was chosen for e821 , which resulted in a systematic error on @xmath44 of 0.03  ppm , certainly adequate for the experiment now proposed at fermilab . \n the experiment consists of repeated fills of the storage ring , each time introducing an ensemble of muons into a magnetic storage ring , and then measuring the two frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath33 . \n the muon lifetime is given by @xmath47s , and the data collection period is typically @xmath48 muon lifetimes in the ring . \n the @xmath0 precession period is 4.37  @xmath7s , and the cyclotron period is 149  ns . as the @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) decay , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are emitted in the decay @xmath53 . \n the high - energy decay electrons ( positrons ) carry information on the muon spin direction at the decay . \n thus as the spin turns relative to the momentum , the number of high - energy decay electrons is modulated by the frequency @xmath32 , as shown in fig . \n [ fg : blr - wiggle ] . \n the e821 storage ring was constructed as a `` super - ferric '' magnet  @xcite , meaning that the iron determined the shape of the magnetic field . \n thus @xmath54 needed to be well below saturation and was chosen to be 1.45  t. the resulting ring had a central orbit radius of 7.112  m , and 12 detector stations were placed symmetrically around the inner radius of the storage ring . \n the detector geometry and number were optimized to detect the high - energy decay electrons , which carry the largest asymmetry , and thus information on the muon spin direction at the time of decay . in this design , \n many of the lower - energy electrons miss the detectors , reducing background and pileup . \n the electrostatic quadrupoles  @xcite cover 43% of the ring , leaving significant gaps for the fast muon kicker@xcite and other objects in the ring . \n while alternate schemes for measuring @xmath1 have been proposed , the magic @xmath42 technique has a number of things in its favor . \n one of the most important is that since e821 , it is quite well understood and offers a straightforward path to a 0.1  ppm measurement , or perhaps somewhat beyond . \n its features are :    * high muon polarization and decay asymmetry ; * large storage ring with ample room for detectors , field mapping , kickers , etc . ; \n * muon injection , which has been shown to work ; * rates in the detectors that are easily handled with conventional technology ; \n * data are fit over many @xmath0 cycles , which is a powerful tool to unmask systematic errors that depend on time ; * precision magnetic field techniques which are well understood ; * well understood systematic errors . \n the fermilab proposal  @xcite uses the magic @xmath42 in the precision storage ring developed for e821 , with new detectors , electronics , along with improved magnetic field measurement and control . \n central to the new proposal is the use of features unique to fermilab that will provide copious proton bunches of @xmath55 protons at 10 to 20  ms intervals . \n this compares with @xmath56 protons per bunch at bnl , with a maximum of 12 bunches per machine cycle time of 2.7  s. the effective fill rate at bnl was 4.4  hz , compared with a projected rate of 18  hz at fermilab .    at bnl , pions 1.7% above the magic momentum decayed in an 80  m long fodo line , \n producing a beam that contained an equal number of pions , muons and electrons . \n a large hadronic `` flash '' accompanied the injection into the ring causing a significant baseline shift in the detectors near the injection point .    at fermilab , \n the recycler ring will be used to re - bunch each proton batch from the booster into four bunches with @xmath55 protons each . \n these will be extracted one at a time to a production target at the location of the present antiproton target . \n the antiproton debuncher ring will be used as a 900  m long pion decay line . \n the resulting pion flash will be decreased by a factor of 20 from the bnl level , and the muon flux will be significantly increased because of the ability to take zero - degree muons . the stored muon - per - proton ratio will be increased by a factor of 5 to 10 over bnl . \n segmented detectors  @xcite and new electronics should easily be able to handle the increased data rates per fill of the ring . \n the plan is to move the e821 muon storage ring to fermilab , and install it in a new building near the existing ap0 hall . \n the proposal was well received by the fermilab program advisory committee , but funding has not yet been secured . \n an optimistic schedule has the ring moved , re - assembled and shimmed by 2014 . \n we estimate that in two years of running on @xmath50 , we could achieve the goal of the @xmath57  ppm error . \n most of this running would be simultaneous with nova , using the extra booster batches that can not be used by the main injector program . \n if the main injector program is down , then @xmath0 can use the full booster beam . with further running \n we might be able to approach the 0.1  ppm level . during the project x era \n , we could achieve a a comparable error for @xmath49 . \n the muon anomalous magnetic moment has played an important role in the development of the standard model , and in constraining theories of physics beyond the standard model . \n e821 at the brookhaven lab ags achieved a factor of 13.5 in precision over the famous cern experiments of the 1970s , and reached a relative precision of @xmath3  ppm . \n the new muon @xmath0 collaboration has proposed to improve the error by a factor of four at fermilab . given the sensitivity of @xmath1 to a number of proposed extensions to the standard model , a more precise measurement , especially when combined with improvements in the knowledge of the hadronic contribution that are on the horizon , will provide valuable information for the interpretation of new phenomena that might be discovered at lhc . \n 90                      j. prades , e. de rafael and a. vainshtein , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 303 , ( 2010 ) ; and arxiv:0901.0306 , jan . \n 2009 . \n dominik stckinger , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 393 , ( 2010 ) ; and j. phys . * g 34 * , r45 ( 2007 ) .    andrzej czarnecki and william j. marciano , in _ lepton dipole moments _ , advanced series on directions in high energy physics -vol.20 , ed . \n b. lee roberts and william j. marciano , world scientific , p. 11 , ( 2010 ) ; and phys . rev . * \n d 64 * , 013014 ( 2001 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1008085477350, "RequestID": "1d58897b22084a6984e4a2c293e842a2", "TotalTokens": 3948}

{"ContextTokens": 3714, "GeneratedTokens": 307, "SynthesizedBody": "we live in a time where people increasingly turn to the web for help . \n our needs , however , often go far beyond mere information from existing webpages and we need help from real people . for example , we ask for answers to specific questions on _ stackoverflow.com_ , for donations on _ donorschoose.org_ , or for help on online social communities such as _ reddit.com_. in each of these cases a user performs a request , which we define as an act of asking formally for something . \n all these communities rely heavily on their members to help satisfy the request . yet \n , the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request remain largely unknown . \n understanding the dynamics and factors of successful requests has the potential to substantially improve such communities by educating users about better formulating requests and promoting likely - to - succeed requests @xcite . \n in addition to these practical benefits , understanding the factors that make a request successful has implications for questions in social psychology and linguistic pragmatics .    studies on the popular crowdfunding platform kickstarter have shown that the success of a request depends most crucially on _ what _ is being requested , that is , whether it is a small favor like an answer to a simple question or a large financial contribution @xcite . \n many other factors need to be controlled as well ; what the giver receives _ in return _ , _ when _ they are asking , and even group dynamics , since people are more likely to give to projects that others are already giving to @xcite . \n satisfying a request on peer - to - peer lending or crowd - funding platforms can also bring a reward , and this also can drive the selection process . \n it is extremely difficult to disentangle the effects of all these factors in determining what makes people satisfy requests , and what makes them select some requests over others .    in this paper \n , we develop a framework for controlling for each of these potential confounds while studying the role of two aspects that characterize compelling requests : _ social _ factors ( _ who _ is asking and how the recipient is related to the donor and community ) and _ linguistic _ factors ( _ how _ they are asking and what linguistic devices accompany successful requests ) . with the notable exception of @xcite ( @xcite ) , \n the effect of language on the success of requests has largely been ignored thus far . \n our goal is to understand what motivates people to give when they do not receive anything tangible in return . \n that is , we focus on the important special case of _ altruistic _ requests in which the giver receives no rewards . \n this controls for the incentive to obtain attractive rewards commonly offered on crowdfunding sites such as kickstarter ; the absence of external factors such as tangible rewards also makes the language itself all the more important in persuading others to help . in this domain \n we also do not need to consider crowdfunding - related marketing strategies such as emphasizing limited time offers ( scarcity ) or showing that other people made the same decision already ( social proof ) @xcite , which are known to manifest themselves in language @xcite . \n second , we focus on requests that a single user can fulfill , thereby additionally eliminating group behavior effects such as herding @xcite or completing donation biases @xcite . finally , we focus on one community in which _ what _ is being asked for is held constant . \n this allows us to explore a large number of different requests of different individual users , at different times , that all have the same goal . \n controlling for the request goal therefore allows us to study how to optimize a particular request solely by optimizing its presentation , and helps provide a direct practical benefit to the requester ( by contrast , advising a requester who needs something to instead ask for something different may be advice of limited practical use ) . \n we therefore chose to study donations in `` random acts of pizza '' , an online community devoted to giving away free pizza to strangers that ask for one . \n random acts of pizza ( raop ) is a community within the social news and entertainment website _ \n reddit.com_. users can submit requests for free pizza and if their story is compelling enough a fellow user might decide to send them one , `` _ _ because ... who does nt like helping out a stranger ? the purpose is to have fun , eat pizza and help each other out . \n together , we aim to restore faith in humanity , one slice at a time . \n _ '' a typical post might sound something like this : `` _ _ it s been a long time since my mother and i have had proper food . \n i ve been struggling to find any kind of work so i can supplement my mom s social security ... a real pizza would certainly lift our spirits _ _ @xcite . '' \n this platform addresses many of the potential confounds that complicate other platforms or studies : all requests ask for the same thing , a pizza , there are no additional incentives or rewards , each request is satisfied by a single user , users and requests are embedded in a social network within reddit , and requests are largely textual . \n this dataset thus provides us with an unusually clear picture of the effect of language and social factors on success . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : inspired by studies in crowdfunding , user - to - user evaluations in social networks , and helping behavior in social psychology , we introduce a variety of textual and social factors that are potentially associated with successful requests . \n we use topic modeling and automatic detection to extract a particularly complex factor , the _ narrative _ structure of requests . \n we employ a logistic regression framework to test what factors matter in the community , showing that narratives are significantly correlated with success , and that signaling gratitude , the intention to reciprocate in the future , supporting the narrative with additional evidence , as well as a high status of the user within the community further increase the chance of success . \n we do not find any support for theories predicting that positive sentiment , politeness , and user similarity are associated with success . \n thus , drawing from social psychology literature , our extracted high - level social features operationalize the relation between recipient and donor . \n we then demonstrate in a prediction task that the proposed model generalizes to unseen requests and significantly improves over several baselines . \n our dataset contains the entire history of the random acts of pizza subreddit from december 8 , 2010 to september 29 , 2013 ( 21,577 posts total ) . to compute user features \n we further crawled the entire lifetime history of posts and comments across all subreddits for all users involved in the raop subreddit ( 1.87 m submissions total ) . \n the community only publishes which _ users _ have given or received pizzas but not which _ requests _ were successful . in the case of successful users posting multiple times it is unclear which of the requests was actually successful . \n therefore , we restrict our analysis to users with a single request for which we can be certain whether or not it was successful , leaving us with 5728 pizza requests . \n we split this dataset into development ( 70% ) and test set ( 30% ) such that both sets mirror the average success rate in our dataset of 24.6% . \n all features are developed on the development test only while the test set is used only once to evaluate the prediction accuracy of our proposed model on held - out data . \n for a small number of requests ( 379 ) we further observe the identity of the benefactor through a `` thank you '' post by the beneficiary after the successful request . \n this enables us to reason about the impact of user similarity on giving . \n previous work on crowdfunding , helping behavior and user - to - user evaluations in social networks have pointed to a number of textual and social factors that could influence the success of a request . \n a person experiencing gratitude is more likely to behave prosocially towards their benefactor and others @xcite . \n however , gratitude is only one component of politeness @xcite . \n other indicators include deference , greetings , indirect language , apologizing and hedges . \n we ask a more general question : does a polite request make you more likely to be successful ? \n in social psychology , _ reciprocity _ refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action . \n people are more likely to help if they have received help themselves @xcite . since in altruistic domains \n , there is no possibility of direct reciprocity , we hypothesize that recipients might pay the kindness _ forward _ to another community member , a concept known as `` generalized reciprocity '' @xcite . \n feelings of gratitude can elicit this behavior @xcite . \n we hypothesize that the community would be more willing to fulfill the request of someone who is likely to contribute to the community later on . \n while many requests are fairly negative , talking about lost jobs , financial problems , or relationship breakups , some of them are positive , asking for pizza for birthday parties and other celebrations . helping behavior literature predicts that positive mood is associated with a higher likelihood of giving @xcite . \n while these studies refer to the sentiment or emotional state of the benefactor , the most closely related linguistic feature that is available in this setting would be the sentiment of the text . \n thus , the literature would predict that very positive requests are more likely to succeed . \n we additionally expect that very negative requests could be more successful , too , since they most likely describe very unfortunate situations of the requester . \n studies on the success of research grant proposals have shown that the simple factor of request length can be significantly related to funding success even when controlling for a variety of other factors @xcite . \n we hypothesize that longer requests will be interpreted as showing more effort on the side of the requester and giving them the opportunity to provide more evidence for their situation . \n studies on crowdfunding have shown that the size of the social network of the project creator is associated with success @xcite . \n work on user - to - user evaluations in online social networks suggests that the success of a request depends on who you are as a user and particularly that notions of user status and user similarity could be influential in the process @xcite . \n we study both status and similarity in this work . \n the textual part of a request , the narrative , has been shown to significantly influence the outcome in peer - to - peer lending platforms @xcite . in order to understand the nature and power of different narratives without coding them manually @xcite , we explore automatic methods of narrative extraction . \n consider the following two pizza requests :          to identify the different kinds of stories we draw on previous literature suggesting that narratives can be automatically extracted using topic modeling and related techniques @xcite . \n we therefore perform topic modeling through non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite of a tf - idf weighted bag - of - words representation @xcite of the requests in our dataset . \n we additionally enforce sparsity on the topic distribution for each request to shape the topics in a way that captures most of a given request , and restrict ourselves to nouns ( using the stanford part - of - speech tagger ) . \n we choose to use 10 topics and use a svd - based initialization for nmf @xcite . \n the resulting topics are shown in table [ table : topic_modeling ] along with descriptive names , the 15 highest - scoring terms and the success rate ( fraction of requests that successfully obtained pizza ) . \n we observe that many topic clusters follow a specific theme and that their success rates vary dramatically ( the average success rate is 24.6% ) . \n topics money1 and money2 focus on money , and the high success rate of topic money1 ( 32.3% ) suggests that this is a particularly successful narrative . topic job is similarly successful ( 31.9% ) and features job related terms . a large number of requests further seem to come from college students talking about studying for classes and finals , their roommates , and the university ( topic student ) . \n another narrative in the data are requests for and about family ( topics time&family and money2 ) . \n this narrative can be identified by the usage of words indicating family relationships like kid , husband , family , mother , wife , and parents ( not all of them are included in the top 15 terms ) . \n topic friend stands out since it noticeably worse than any other topic ( 17.0% ) . \n it captures requests asking for pizza for a friend that is in town , to cater for parties , or to provide culinary support for a night of movie watching with the girlfriend . \n we hypothesize that stories of this topic display little actual need for pizza ( particularly compared to stories talking about money and job problems ) and simply communicate a pizza craving by the requester . \n we further recognize that many requests employ previously defined factors such as gratitude ( `` thanks in advance '' in topic gratitude ) , providing pictures as additional evidence , and the intention to `` pay it forward '' . \n online platforms have created a new mechanism for people to seek aid from other users . \n many online communities such as question & answer sites and online philanthropy communities are created for the express purpose of facilitating this exchange of help . \n it is of critical importance to these communities that requests get addressed in an effective and efficient manner . \n this presents a clear opportunity to improve these online communities overall as well as improving the chance of success of individual requests . \n however , the factors that lead to requests being fulfilled are still largely unknown . \n we attribute this to the fact that the study of _ how _ \n one should ask for a favor is often complicated by large effects of _ what _ the requester is actually asking for . we have presented a case study of an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution , a pizza , thereby naturally controlling for this effect and allowing us to disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors .    drawing from social psychology literature \n we extract high - level social features from text that operationalize the relation between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success . \n we show that we can detect key narratives automatically that have significant impact on the success of the request . \n we further demonstrate that linguistic indications of gratitude , evidentiality , and reciprocity , as well as the high status of the asker , all increase the likelihood of success , while neither politeness nor positive sentiment seem to be associated with success in our setting . \n we link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior ( see table [ table : helping_behavior_link ] ) . for example , our work extends psychological results on offline communities to show that people behave pro - socially in online communities toward requestors who are of high status , display urgency , and who offer to pay it forward . \n other novel contributions of our work include the finding that linguistic indications of gratitude lead to pro -

{"ContextTokens": 3737, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding when and how massive galaxies form is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology and galaxy formation . \n galaxies are predicted in cold dark matter based models of structure formation to form gradually with time through the merging of smaller systems ( e.g , . \n cole et al . \n 2001 ) . while there is some evidence for this process , in terms of galaxies ( e.g. , patton et al . 2002 ; conselice et al . \n 2003 ; bridge et al . \n 2007 ) , many details are still lacking . alternatively , \n massive galaxies , which are mostly ellipticals in today s universe ( e.g. , conselice 2006a ) , may have formed very rapidly in ` monolithic ' collapses .    a such , massive galaxies are the dominant test - bed for galaxy models , and understanding their evolution observationally is an important goal . \n most massive galaxies at @xmath7 are red and passively evolving , yet star formation and merging activity have been seen in ellipticals from @xmath8 to @xmath1 ( stanford et al . 2004 ; lin et al . 2004 ; teplitz et al . 2006 ; conselice et al . \n 2007a , b ) - thus it is unclear when or how massive galaxies finally assembled . \n we must study this process at high redshift since the ages of stars in nearby galaxies can not reveal their entire formation history , as the assembly of mass is likely decoupled from the formation of stars ( e.g. , conselice 2006b ; trujillo et al . \n 2007 ) . \n observational evidence suggests that passively evolving massive galaxies exist at @xmath1 , and likely at even early times , at @xmath9 ( daddi et al . \n 2004 ; saracco et al . 2005 \n ; bundy et al . 2006 ; conselice et al . \n recent claims also exist for the establishment of the full massive galaxy population by @xmath1 ( e.g. , drory et al . 2005 ; bundy et al . \n however , what is not yet clear is if number densities measured in these surveys are able to rule out evolution at @xmath7 after considering uncertainties in measuring stellar masses , number densities , and cosmic variance .    on the other hand , at @xmath10 \n it appears that there are significantly fewer massive galaxies than at @xmath3 ( e.g. , drory et al . 2005 ) . \n observationally , the most massive galaxies at @xmath10 are undergoing major mergers , which are able to construct the stellar masses of massive galaxies rapidly ( conselice 2006b ; conselice et al . \n the situation at @xmath3 is not as clear , with observations inconclusive on whether there is evolution in the massive galaxy population at @xmath7 ( e.g. , brown et al . 2006 ) . \n we argue here that by using a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies the number and mass densities of massive galaxies are consistent , within their errors , with no evolution at @xmath3 , yet there is observable evolution when examining in detail the physical processes occurring within these galaxies . up to 50% of galaxies with m@xmath0 \n are undergoing star formation at @xmath1 , and roughly one major merger occurs within these systems at @xmath11 . \n we assume throughout a standard cosmology of h@xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath14 . \n the most basic method for calculating the evolution of galaxies is measuring how their number densities and integrated stellar mass densities change as a function of time . \n recent work on measuring densities suggests that within the measurement uncertainties galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath0 , are largely in place at @xmath1 ( bundy et al . \n 2005 , 2006 ) . \n figure  1 shows the most up to date version of how the number and mass densities of galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath15 and @xmath16  @xmath17  m@xmath18 evolve out to @xmath19 , as seen in the 1.5 deg@xmath20 palomar observatory wide - field infrared survey ( powir ; conselice et al . 2007a ; conselice et al . \n 2008b ) covering the deep2 fields \n ( davis et al . 2007 ) from conselice et al . ( 2007b ) using a chabrier imf . \n the number density evolution of these massive galaxies shows that statistically there is very little to no evolution at @xmath7 for the m@xmath0 systems . \n this appears to support the idea that nearly all massive galaxies are present by @xmath1 ( e.g. , bundy et al . \n 2006 ) . \n however , as can be seen within the observational errors of figure  1 , there is potentially evolution in number densities for m@xmath0 selected galaxies between @xmath21 . \n galaxies with m@xmath0 show an increase in number densities between @xmath22 to 0.4 of a factor of 2.7@xmath23 . \n this is however significant only at the @xmath24 level , considering all uncertainties ( conselice et al . \n a similar result is found for the mass densities of galaxies with m@xmath0 , and it is impossible to rule out that massive galaxies with m@xmath0 are all in place at @xmath25 ( conselice et al . \n however , as for the star - formation downsizing described in e.g. , bundy et al . \n ( 2006 ) there is also a stellar mass downsizing , such that lower mass galaxies are formed after higher mass ones . \n the number densities of systems with @xmath16 @xmath17 m@xmath26 increases by a factor of 2.2@xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , a result significant at @xmath30 4  @xmath31 . just as for the most massive systems , this evolution occurs completely at @xmath32 ( conselice et al . \n 2007b ) . taken as a whole \n , we calculate that the scenario whereby the stellar mass and number densities of massive galaxies does not evolve between @xmath33 to @xmath34 can be rejected at @xmath35 @xmath31 confidence . through a careful analysis of number densities \n it does not appear that high mass galaxy formation , with the possible exception of m@xmath0 systems , is complete by @xmath33 . \n there could be a factor of @xmath36 evolution in the mass and number densities for massive galaxies at @xmath7 due to measurement uncertainties . \n we note that the millennium simulation underpredicts the densities of these massive galaxies by a large factor ( figure  1 ) , demonstrating how difficult it is to model these systems . \n one way to understand the star formation history of massive galaxies is to examine their position on color - magnitude diagrams . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that 35@xmath44% of galaxies with m@xmath0 at @xmath1 are blue in color and not on the red sequence , and thus must be undergoing unobscured star formation . \n previous studies have examined the increase in the amount of stellar mass on the red - sequence , finding as much as a factor of two increase since @xmath1 ( faber et al . \n 2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ) \n . however , this increase is due to galaxies appearing on the red - sequence , which were previously blue , and not due to in - situ growth on the red - sequence itself due to e.g. , dry mergers . \n this can be seen through massive galaxies gradually moving onto the red - sequence with time , as the number of blue massive galaxies declines at @xmath7 ( e.g. , bundy et al . \n 2006 ; conselice et al . \n 2007b ) .    quantifying the ongoing rate of star formation in massive galaxy samples can be done in several ways , including rest - frame uv emission , emission line fluxes , and spitzer mips 24@xmath37 m data \n . a surprisingly higher fraction of massive galaxies are detected in the mid - infrared compared with the fraction which are blue . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that @xmath3840% of the m@xmath0 systems at @xmath39 are detected in 24@xmath37 m mips data after removing those systems which are detected by chandra . \n a total of 37@xmath40% of the systems at m@xmath0 are detected at 24 @xmath37 m , with an average star formation rate of 70 yr@xmath13 . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find , similar to previous studies utilising ir star formation indicators , a decline with redshift in star formation occurring within the massive galaxy population . for systems with m@xmath0 the star formation rate declines as @xmath41 , and for systems with @xmath17 m@xmath42 @xmath17 as @xmath43 . \n the overall decline in the entire galaxy population s star formation history can be parameterised as @xmath44 . \n it appears that while the @xmath17 m@xmath42 @xmath17 galaxies have a similar decline as the overall field , the highest mass galaxies decline at a faster rate . \n the number and mass densities of the most massive galaxies are significantly lower at @xmath9 than at lower redshifts . while the star formation rate in these massive galaxies may be low ( e.g. , krick et al . \n 2006 ) , mergers are likely the major method for forming these galaxies . examining the structural cas and other parameters ( conselice et al . \n 2000,2002 ; conselice 2003 ; ravindranath et al . \n 2006 ) for galaxies at @xmath45 reveals that mergers produce the rapid growth in massive galaxies at @xmath46 ( conselice et al . \n 2003 , 2005 ; conselice 2006b ; conselice et al . \n 2008a ) . \n what is not yet clear is the role mergers play in massive galaxy formation at @xmath3 , particularly dry mergers that are not easily identifiable through structure . \n one method of measuring the amount of merging is by examining changes in the number and mass densities of galaxies as a function of time after accounting for growth due to star formation ( figure  2 ; conselice et al . \n conselice et al . \n ( 2007b ) find that 12% of galaxies with  @xmath17  m@xmath47  merge between @xmath48 , and enter the higher mass bin . at @xmath49 \n this merger fraction drops to 8% . \n this is consistent with the cas merger fractions ( e.g. , conselice et al . \n 2003 ) for the same galaxies , and previous published results using smaller galaxy samples ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2003 \n ; lin et al . 2004 ; bridge et al . 2007 ) . \n this corresponds to a merger rate giving n@xmath50 mergers for m@xmath0 systems at @xmath39 , roughly doubling the mass of these galaxies during this time . \n while massive galaxies can be identified up to @xmath51 using deep nir imaging , the evolution of these galaxies is difficult to measure within a factor of 2 - 3 using simply luminosity or mass functions . by examining the change in the mass function , and through structural parameters and mips 24 @xmath37 m and [ oii ] line emission \n we show that massive galaxies are still undergoing some evolution , with at least as much as a factor of two increase in stellar mass at @xmath11 from star formation and merging . \n bridge , c. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 659 , 931 brown , m.j.i . , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 654 , 858 bundy , k. , et al . 2006 , apj , 651 , 120 cole , s. , lacey , c. baugh , c. , frenk , c. 2000 , mnras , 319 , 168 conselice , c.j . , bershady , m.a . , \n jangren , a. 2000 , apj , 529 , 886 conselice , c.j . \n 2003 , apjs , 147 , 1 conselice , c.j . , \n bershady , m.a . , \n dickinson , m. , papovich , c. 2003a , aj , 126 , 1183 conselice , c.j . , \n gallagher , j.s . , \n wyse , r.f.g . \n 2002 , aj , 123 , 2246 conselice , c.j . \n , blackburne , j. , papovich , c. 2005 , apj , 620 , 564 conselice , c.j . \n 2006a , mnras , 373 , 1389 conselice , c.j . \n 2006b , apj , 638 , 686 conselice , c.j . , et al . 2007a , apj , 660 , 55l conselice , c.j . , \n 2007b , mnras , 381 , 962 conselice , c.j . , \n et al . 2008a , mnras , 386 , 909 conselice , c.j . \n . 2008b , mnras , 383 , 1366 davis , m. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 660 , 1l drory , n. , et al . \n 2005 , apj , 619 , l131 faber , s. , et al . \n 2007 , apj , 665 , 265 krick , m. , et al . \n 2006 , apj , 649 , l71 lin , l. , et al . \n 2004 , apj , 617 , 9l patton , d.r . , \n 2002 , apj , 565 , 208 ravindranath , s. , et al . \n 2006 , apj , 652 , 963 stanford , s.a . , et al . \n 2004 , aj , 127 , 131 teplitz , h.i . \n 2006 , aj , 132 , 853 trujillo , i. , et al . \n 2007 , mnras , 382 , 109", "StartTimeOffset": 1051856053006, "RequestID": "1e9e83e59eb6472f9925367e968c7364", "TotalTokens": 3916}

{"ContextTokens": 4093, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "in this study , we present numerical calculations that suggest that , by exploiting key differences in mechanical properties between cancerous and normal cells , _ oncolysis _ , or bursting of cancerous cells , can be induced selectively by means of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation while simultaneously leaving normal cells intact . \n we refer to this procedure as _ \n oncotripsy_. specifically , by studying the vibrational response of cancerous and healthy cells , we find that , by carefully choosing the frequency of the harmonic excitation , lysis of the nucleolus membrane of cancerous cells can be induced selectively and at no risk to the healthy cells . \n numerous studies suggest that aberrations in both cellular morphology and material properties of different cell constituents are indications of various forms of cancerous tissues . \n for instance , a criterion for malignancy is the size difference between normal nuclei , with an average diameter of @xmath0 to @xmath1 microns , and malignant nuclei , which can reach a diameter of over @xmath2 microns @xcite . \n early studies @xcite have shown that the nuclear - nucleolar volume ratios in normal tissues and benign as well as malignant tumors do not differ quantitatively . \n nucleoli volumes of normal tissues , however , are found to be significantly smaller than the volume of nucleoli in cancerous tissues @xcite . \n similarly , the mechanical stiffness of various cell components has been found to vary significantly in healthy and diseased tissues . in @xcite , \n the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells was investigated using atomic force microscopy , showing that cancer cells are more than @xmath3 softer than healthy cells . \n other cancer types , including lung , breast and pancreas cancer , display similar stiffness characteristics . furthermore , using a magnetic tweezer , @xcite found that cancer cells with the lowest invasion and migratory potential are five times stiffer than cancer cells with the highest potential . \n likewise , increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) was reported to promote hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) cell proliferation , thus being a strong predictor for hcc development @xcite . moreover \n , enhanced cell contractility due to increased matrix stiffness results in an enhanced transformation of mammary epithelial cells as shown in @xcite . \n conversely , a decrease in tissue stiffness has been found to impede malignant growth in a murine model of breast cancer @xcite . \n various experimental techniques have been utilized in order to quantitatively assess the material properties of individual cell constituents in both healthy and diseased tissues . \n the inhomogeneity in stiffness of the living cell nucleus in normal human osteoblasts has been investigated by @xcite using a non - invasive sensing system . as shown in that study , \n the stiffness of the nucleolus is relatively higher compared to that of other nuclear domains @xcite . \n similarly , a difference in mass density between nucleolus and nucleoplasm in the xenopus oocyte nucleus was determined by @xcite by recourse to refractive indices . \n the elastic modulus of both isolated chromosomes and entire nuclei in epithelial cells are given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . \n specifically , @xcite showed that mitotic chromosomes behave linear elastically up to 200% extension . \n experiments of @xcite additionally measured the network elastic modulus of the nuclear envelope , independently of the nucleoplasm , by means of micropipette aspiration , suggesting that the nuclear envelope is much stiffer and stronger than the plasma membranes of cells . \n in addition , wrinkling phenomena near the entrance of the micropipette were indicative of the solid - like behavior of the envelope . \n @xcite estimated the elastic moduli of both cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocellular carcinoma cells based on force - displacement curves obtained from atomic force microscopy . \n in addition , @xcite used micropipette aspiration techniques in order to further elucidate the viscoelastic behavior of human hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells . based on their study , @xcite concluded that a change in the viscoelastic properties of cancer cells could affect metastasis and tumor cell invasion . \n the increased compliance of cancerous and pre - cancerous cells was also investigated by @xcite , who used atomic force microscopy to determine the mechanical stiffness of normal , metaplastic and dysplastic cells , showing a decrease in young s modulus from normal to cancerous cells . \n the scope of the present work , and the structure of the present paper , are as follows . \n we begin by defining the geometric model and summarizing the material model and material parameters used in finite - element analyses . \n subsequently , the accuracy of the finite - element model is assessed by means of a comparison between numerical and analytical solutions for the eigenmodes of a spherical free - standing cell . \n we then present eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a free - standing ellipsoidal cell , followed by a bloch wave analysis to model tissue consisting of a periodic arrangement of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix . finally , resonant growth rates are calculated that reveal that cancerous cells can selectively be targeted by ultrasound harmonic excitation . \n the transient response at resonance of healthy and cancerous cells is presented in the fully nonlinear range by way of verification and extension of the findings of the harmonic modal analysis . \n we close with a discussion of results . \n in this section , we investigate the dynamical response of healthy and cancerous cells under harmonic excitation . \n we begin by briefly outlining the underlying geometric and material parameters used in our analysis , followed by a verification of the finite element model used for modal analysis . \n we then calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of both free - standing and periodic distributions of cells . in this latter case , we determine the full dispersion relation by means of a standard bloch wave analysis . finally , we present resonant growth rates and simulate the transient response of both cancerous and healthy cells excited at resonance in a fully - nonlinear setting by means of implicit dynamics calculations . \n the nucleus , the largest cellular organelle , occupies about @xmath4 of the total cell volume in mammalian cells @xcite . \n it contains the nucleolus , which is embedded in the nucleoplasm , a viscous solid similar in composition to the cytosol surrounding the nucleus @xcite . in this study , \n the cytosol is modeled in combination with other organelles contained within the plasma membrane , such as mitochondria and plastids , which together form the cytoplasm . for simplicity , we idealize the plasma mebrane , nuclear envelope , cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as being of spheroidal shape . \n we model the plasma membrane , a lipid bilayer composed of two regular layers of lipid molecules , in combination with the actin cytoskeleton providing mechanical strength as a membrane with a thickness of @xmath5 nm @xcite . \n similarly , we model the nuclear envelope , a double lipid bilayer membrane , in combination with the nuclear lamin meshwork lending it structural support as a @xmath6 nm thick membrane . \n we define the cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as spheres with radii of @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , and @xmath9 m and subsequently scale them by a factor of @xmath10 in two dimensions in order to obtain the desired spheroidal shape . \n we assume an average nuclear diameter of about @xmath11 m , as reported in @xcite . \n diameters for both cytoplasm and nucleolus follow from @xcite and @xcite , who report nucleus - to - cell and nucleus - to - nucleolus volume ratios of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . \n the geometry with all cell constituents as used in subsequent finite element analyses is illustrated in figure  [ fig : geometry ] . in order to further elucidate the effect of an increasing nucleus - to - cell volume ratio , as observed experimentally @xcite \n , we consider a range of geometries with increasing nuclear and nucleolar volumes . \n for all of these geometries , we hold fixed the volume of the cytoplasm . \n we assume a constant nuclear - to - nucleolar volume ratio for both healthy and cancerous cells , as observed by @xcite .        cell - to - cell differences and experimental uncertainties notwithstanding , the preponderance of the observational evidence suggests that the cytoplasm , nucleus and nucleolus are ordered in the sense of increasing stiffness . neglecting viscous effects \n , we model the elasticity of the different cell constituents by means of the mooney -

strain elastic moduli conversions , with a poisson s ratio of @xmath20 to simulate a nearly incompressible material , in order to match experimental values with constitutive parameters . \n we vary the stiffness of both cellular components and extra - cellular matrix ( ecm ) within a pathophysiologically - relevant range in order to investigate the effect of cell softening and ecm stiffening on eigenfrequencies . finally , we assume both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm to have a mass density of @xmath21g/@xmath22 , a value reported by @xcite as an average cell density , and we set the density of the nucleolus to @xmath23g/@xmath22 @xcite . \n .set of constitutive parameters ( bulk modulus @xmath19 and shear moduli @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) used in the eigenfrequency analyses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the spectral gap , or gap in the lowest eigenfrequencies , between healthy and cancerous cells and tissues provides a first hint of sharp differences in the response of healthy and cancerous tissue to harmonic excitation . \n in particular , the preceding analysis shows that the fundamental frequencies of the cancerous tissue may be in close proximity to eigenfrequencies of the healty tissue , which appears to undermine the objective of selective excitation of the cancerous tissue . \n however , a complete picture requires consideration of the relative energy absorption characteristics and growth rates of resonant modes . to this end , we consider the modal decomposition of the displacement field @xmath24 where @xmath25 are eigenvectors obeying the orthogonality and normalization condition ( [ e45dls ] ) and @xmath26 are time - dependent modal amplitudes obeying the modal equations of motion @xmath27 in this equation , @xmath28 is the corresponding eigenfrequency , @xmath29 is the external force vector and @xmath30 is the corresponding modal force . for a harmonic excitation of frequency @xmath31 , eq .  ( [ kc3v7h ] ) \n further specializes to @xmath32 where now @xmath33 is a constant modal force amplitude . at resonance , @xmath34 \n , the amplitude of the transient solution starting from quiescent conditions grows linearly in time and the transient solution follows as @xmath35 we thus conclude that the growth rate of resonant modes is @xmath36    figure  [ fig : fn ] shows the growth properties of @xmath37 for two different cases . in the first case , a cancerous cell is excited at its resonant frequency of @xmath38rad / s , whereas the healthy cell is excited at its closest resonance frequency of @xmath39rad / s . in the second case , \n eigenfrequencies of @xmath40rad / s and @xmath41rad / s are investigated . \n the simulations reveal that the growth rate of the resonant response of the cancerous cells is much faster than that of the healthy cells , which opens a window for selectively targeting the former . \n the preceding analysis has been carried out with a view to understanding the resonant response of cells and tissues under harmonic excitation in the harmonic range . in this section \n , we seek to confirm and extend the conclusions of the harmonic analysis by carrying out fully nonlinear implicit dynamics simulations of the transient response of healthy and cancerous cells under resonant harmonic excitation . in this analysis , a geometry of ratio @xmath42 is considered , figure  [ fig : mesh ] , together with material parameters of table  [ tab : parameters ] . \n we restrict attention to the long wavelength limit , i.  e. to ultrasound radiation of wavelengths larger than the cell size . in keeping with this limit \n , we enforce harmonic displacement boundary conditions directly as shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] in order to mechanically excite the cell . \n the strength of the harmonic excitation used in the calculations is @xmath43@xmath44 m .    in the simulations , we track the transient amplification of the cell response up to failure . \n we assume that failure occurs when the stress in the cytoskeletal polymer network , which constitutes the structural support for cell membranes , reaches a threshold strength value . \n @xcite found that the macroscopic network strength can be traced to the microscopic interaction potential of cross - linking molecules and other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments . here \n , we assume a rupture strength of the order of @xmath45pa based on strength values of a single actin / cross - linking protein bond reported in @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : transient ] shows the fully - nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous cells at the resonant frequency of the latter . \n it can be seen from the figure that stresses in both the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell grow at a much faster rate than in healthy cells . for the harmonic excitation under consideration , the strength of the nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell reaches the rupture strength at time @xmath46s , while , at the same time , the level of stress in the healthy cells is much lower . \n figure  [ fig : kineticpotential ] furthermore illustrates the kinetic and potential energy of the nuclear envelope during excitation at resonance of both healthy and cancerous cells .    from transient response simulations , the energy that needs to be supplied until the point of rupture is reached is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the applied traction on the boundary @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the displacement vector , @xmath51 is the force acting on surface node @xmath52 at time @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the corresponding displacement vector . \n for a cell geometry with a ratio of @xmath55 and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 , calculations give a value of @xmath57pj for the energy per cell required for lysis . \n assuming an average cell size of 20 @xmath58 m , a time to lysis of 70 @xmath58s and a tumor of 1 cm in size , this energy requirement translates into a power density requirement in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 .     and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 . \n shown is the frobenius norm of first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] \n in this study , we have presented numerical calculations that suggest that spectral gaps between hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy cells can be exploited to selectively bring the cancerous cells to lysis through the application of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation , while keeping healthy cells intact . \n we refer to this procedure as _ oncotripsy_. a normal mode analysis in the harmonic range reveals the existence of a healthy - to - cancerous spectral gap in ground frequency of the order of @xmath60 rad / s , or @xmath61 khz . \n further analysis of the growth rates of the transient response of the cells to harmonic excitation reveals that lysis of cancerous cells can be achieved without damage to healthy cells . \n these findings point to oncotripsy as a novel opportunity for cancer treatment via the application of carefully tuned ultrasound pulses in the frequency range of 80 khz , duration in the range of 70 @xmath58s and power density in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 . \n this type of ultrasound actuation can be readily delivered , e.  g. , by means of commercial low - frequency and low - intensity ultrasonic transducers . \n evidently , the present numerical calculations serve only as preliminary evidence of the viability of oncotripsy , and further extensive laboratory studies would be required in order to confirm and refine the present findings and definitively establish the viability of the procedure .", "StartTimeOffset": 1071426921517, "RequestID": "170eef6502314e1c994eb65edbe6c5d9", "TotalTokens": 4307}

radiation field system can be approximated by a system composed of a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to the radiation field through some effective coupling constants . \n thus , a significant number of works have been sparked to the study of cavity qed . \n another motivation to study the radiation field system in cavity comes from the cosmology . \n astronomical observations@xcite-@xcite have provided plenty of supports to the cosmological principle@xcite , which states that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on large scales . \n this principle implies that we can build up a comoving coordinate system , in which the spatial part has a maximal symmetry . in general \n , there are three types of global symmetry for the three - dimensional maximally symmetric space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n usually , they are called the flat , closed and open universe , respectively . in order to understand the evolution of the universe , the whole distribution and activity of matters ( including radiations ) in space have to be taken into account . and we would like to point out that , if properties of matters in space as a whole are to be studied , the difference of global symmetries should not be neglected . in particular , we know that the early epoch of the universe was governed by the radiation fields \n . therefore , a careful study of radiation fields in a compact space is necessary .    in free space , \n it is well - known that the radiation fields can be described by an ideal gas model ( a thermodynamic system consisting of free massless particles ) . \n however , one can not extend this idea to the case of compact space straightforwardly . in order to investigate the quantum statistical properties of radiation fields in a compact space , we begin with constructing of the representation of one - particle states . \n we notice that the space - time @xmath4 is a conformally deformed de sitter space - time . \n this space - time has a translation symmetry in the time direction and six rotation symmetries in the spatial part . \n that is to say , the isometry group of the space -

body radiation system in free space , which is proportional to the square of energy ( @xmath48 ) . \n the photons obey the bose - einstein statistics . \n the mean number of photons on an eigen - state with energy @xmath41 \n is@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the temperature of this system to be zero and hence @xmath51 . ] . \n immediately , we obtain a modified planck distribution for the radiation fields in the compact space @xmath6 , @xmath52 the distribution function represents the amount of radiation energy in the spectral interval @xmath53 and a unit volume . in picture * 1 * , we give a sketch for this modified planck distribution comparing with the ordinary one in free space . \n [ pic ]     ( real line , @xmath54 ) and the ordinary distribution of a black - body radiation system in free space ( dashed line).,width=377,height=264 ]    the total number of photons of the radiation system can be expressed as @xmath55 when the parameter @xmath56 runs to infinity , we recover the familiar result of the black - body radiation system in free space . in the follows \n , we will calculate quantities by expanding them in terms of @xmath57 to see clearly the deviation from those got in free space . \n the thermodynamic quantity of total energy is @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the riemann zeta - function . \n the free energy and thermodynamic potential can also be calculated easily , @xmath61 we know that the volume of the three - dimensional sphere with radius @xmath8 is @xmath62 . \n hence the radiation pressure is @xmath63 furthermore , by making use of the relations among thermodynamic quantities @xmath64 we can obtain the entropy of radiation fields @xmath65    in an adiabatic process experienced by the radiation fields , the entropy does nt change . \n so the product @xmath56 can be viewed as a constant in the process . \n the total number of photons is also kept invariant in the adiabatic process . but the other thermodynamic quantities will vary with the geometrical parameter @xmath8 as follows , @xmath66 to discuss the equation of state of this radiation system , we now calculate the density of thermal energy , @xmath67 the equation of state of the radiation fields in the compact space can be read out from eqs . \n ( [ total - pressure ] ) and ( [ density - energy ] ) , @xmath68 it is obvious that , in the case of a large radius of the compact space , the ordinary equation of state for the radiation fields in free space can be recovered . \n a good understanding of the resonant effect and spontaneous emission rate difference in cavity requires first to know the full space dependence of the cavity - induced damping and level shifts . \n however , we know that it is a really difficult mathematical task . thus , many useful approximation methods have been developed . as a first step on the way of getting an exact solution of the problem , we suggested working on a compact space of finite size instead of a cavity . by making use of the representation theory of the @xmath5 group \n , we studied the kinematics for a free photon propagating in the space - time @xmath69 . \n the explicit geometrical parameter dependence of statistical properties of the radiation fields was presented . \n results showed remarkable differences from that of the black - body radiation in free space . \n the resonant effects associated to the coupling of atoms with strong radiofrequency field as well as the spontaneous emission rate can also be computed in a straightforward way . \n it is expected that the nonlinear character of the coupled atom -

{"ContextTokens": 3259, "GeneratedTokens": 157, "SynthesizedBody": "oscillations in the solar corona have been observed for many years . \n wavelength regimes ranging from hard x - ray right down to radio have been investigated to search for evidence of waves . \n periods have been found ranging from 0.02 to 1000 s. table 1 in @xcite provides an excellent summary of the different periods that have been found , and an explanation for their existence . \n most of these waves have been explained by mhd oscillations in coronal loops . \n @xcite has provided an excellent review of waves and oscillations in the corona . \n many of the observations of waves have been determined from variations in intensity brightness . \n recently , however , a huge step forward has been achieved in solar coronal physics due to the high spatial resolution available with the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) . \n the first spatial displacement oscillations have been observed in coronal loops ( @xcite ) . \n it was suggested that these oscillations were triggered by a disturbance from the core flare site . \n various mhd waves were investigated and it was found that a fast kink mode wave provides the best agreement with the observed period of 280@xmath230s . \n one of the most exciting aspects of observing waves in this fashion is that it potentially provides us with the capability of determining the magnetic field in the corona . \n it is notoriously difficult to measure the magnetic field in the corona . \n techniques using the near - infrared emission lines have been successful , but have poor spatial resolution . \n most frequently , indirect methods are used such as the extrapolations of the coronal magnetic field from the photospheric magnetic field that can be measured using zeeman splitting . \n @xcite made use of the flare - related spatial oscillations sometimes observed when a flare occurs , to determine the magnetic field . \n they assume that the oscillation is due to a global standing kink wave , and hence the magnetic field is related to the period of the oscillation , the density of the loop , and the length of the loop . in the case of @xcite \n they found the magnetic field to be 13@xmath29 g . \n the errors on this are large due to errors on the determination of density , loop length and period . \n @xcite suggest that the oscillations are due to a sudden displacement of the magnetic field at the surface which causes an oscillatory relaxation of the field . \n recent work by @xcite suggests that the oscillations are second standing harmonics of acoustic waves tied to the loop length . \n the model gives a relationship between the oscillation period , the loop length and the average plasma temperature , all of which can be independently observed on the sun . \n waves are observed across the electromagnetic spectrum on the sun . \n however , observations on other stars are rare . \n one reason for this is that on the sun , we have the spatial resolution to zoom in on small regions . \n for example , the transverse trace loops that have been observed are away from the main flare site , and hence have lower emission measure . \n analysing an x - ray light - curve , for example , would be unlikely to provide evidence of waves if the emission was averaged over the whole sun . \n oscillations have been observed for optical stellar flares ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . \n @xcite found a period of 220  s in the decay phase of a white - light flare on the rs cvn binary . using this they determine a magnetic field of 1200  g. @xcite again found oscillations in x - ray active red dwarfs . \n they compared their observations to the possibility that they were observing p - modes . on the sun p - \n modes give rise to 5-minute oscillations on the surface . \n they concluded that p - modes could not produce the amplitudes they observed and that it must be coronal oscillations , which have , until now , not been observed .    in this work \n we observe for the first time an oscillation in the corona of . \n we measure the periodicity , and hence determine the magnetic field . \n this is the first observation of an x - ray oscillation during a stellar flare . \n ( ) is an m - type binary dwarf , with both stars of the same spectral type ( dm4.5e+dm4.5e ) . \n both components of the binary flare frequently . \n the radius of given by @xcite is @xmath3 , using a stellar distance of 8.14  pc ( @xcite ) . correcting for the newer value for the distance from hipparcos ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) , using that the stellar radius is proportional to the stellar distance for a given luminosity and spectral class , \n we obtain a stellar radius of @xmath5 . \n the mass of given by @xcite is @xmath6 . \n for our analysis we used the _ xmm - newton _ observations of on 16 october 2000 during revolution 156 . \n @xcite have analysed this data spectroscopically , obtaining elemental abundances , temperatures , densities and emission measures , while a comparative flare analysis between x - ray and simultaneously observed ultraviolet emissions can be found in @xcite . here , we solely used the 0.212  kev x - ray data from the pn - european photon imaging camera ( epic - pn ) . \n figure [ figure ] shows the light curve . \n the observation started at 00:42:00 and lasted for 25.1  ks ( @xmath7 7  h ) . \n there is one large flare , starting @xmath7 4  h into the observation , increasing the count - rate from flare onset to flare peak by a factor of 1.7 , and lasting for 1  h  25  min . \n it shows a steep rise ( rise time @xmath8 ) and decay ( decay time @xmath9 ) . \n there is an extended peak to this flare , which shows clear oscillatory behaviour . \n the amplitude of the oscillation is around 16% . \n applying multi - temperature fitting , @xcite obtain a mean flare temperature @xmath10 and a quiescent temperature @xmath11 , and from the line ratio a flare and quiescent electron density of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . \n the total flare and quiescent emission measures are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n one of the reasons why we concentrated on this observation is that following the rise phase of the flare there was a period of approximately 40 minutes when the light curve stayed at a high intensity level and showed strong oscillations . \n the oscillatory activity can be clearly seen by eye ( see fig .  [ figure ] ) , and shows behaviour suggestive of damping . \n this character is much different from solar flares where the flare reaches a peak rapidly , followed by a slow decay . \n for example , @xcite shows solar flare light curves and a flat top is not seen . \n an alternative to oscillations for this flare is that repeated and rapid flaring is occurring . \n we do not consider this option in this paper , and assume for our analysis that we are observing a coronal oscillation . \n the purpose of our analysis is to determine through wavelet analysis the period and amplitude of the oscillation . \n we determine the magnetic field and loop length of the coronal loop assuming that the oscillation is due to an acoustic wave . as a validity \n check the value of loop length was compared to the value determined from a radiative cooling model . \n to investigate periodicities during the observation , we applied a continuous wavelet transformation to the 10s - binned - data , using a morlet wavelet ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the wavelet coefficients with the lowest periods are displayed in fig . \n [ figure ] . \n the flare oscillation is picked up with a 5@xmath16 significance level . \n the local maximum with the shortest period and a significance of more than 5@xmath16 is simultaneous with the flare top and identifies the oscillation , which , at the local maximum , has a period of @xmath17 . \n the period interval where the wavelet coefficients have a significance of 5@xmath16 or more , is [ 730,920 ]  s.      interpreting these oscillations as the second spatial harmonics of an acoustic wave within the flare ( @xcite ) , we can then determine the flare loop length from @xmath18 \\approx \\frac{1}{6.7 } \\cdot p\\ [ { \\rm s } ] \\cdot \\sqrt{t\\    [ { \\rm mk}]}. \\label{ll}\\ ] ] inserting the above obtained period @xmath19 and a flare temperature @xmath20 , we obtain a loop length @xmath21 . \n note that the temperature carries a @xmath22 error of @xmath23 , therefore the error of @xmath24 is at least 8% ( @xmath25 ) . \n it is not straightforward to calculate the corresponding @xmath22 error of @xmath26 . with these numbers , \n the inferred speed of sound is @xmath27 . \n the loop length can also ( and independently of any oscillation ) be estimated from rising and cooling times obtained from the temporal shape of the flare , applying a flare heating / cooling model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we follow the approach by @xcite who investigated a flare on ad leo observed in the extreme ultraviolet . \n the shape of this flare is very similar to our flare on , but roughly 10 times larger ( in duration as well as in the increase of the count rate ) . \n it also shows a flat top with a possible oscillation . \n the flare loop energy equation for the spatial average is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 the volumetric flare heating rate , @xmath30 the optically thin cooling rate and @xmath31 the time rate change of the loop pressure . during the rise phase , \n strong evaporative heating is dominant ( @xmath32 ) , while the decay phase is dominated by radiative cooling and strong condensation ( @xmath33 ) . at the loop top \n , there is an equilibrium ( @xmath34 ) . \n the loop length can be derived as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rise time , @xmath37 the flare decay time ( indicated in fig .  [ figure ] with the vertical dotted lines ) , @xmath38 the apex flare temperature and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the peak count rate and @xmath41 the count rate at the end of the flare . inserting these values \n , the loop length becomes @xmath42 , which is about a factor of 2 smaller that the loop length inferred from the oscillation . \n interpreting the oscillations in terms of global standing kink waves , @xcite derive a relation for the magnetic field @xmath43 with @xmath44 the mass density inside , and @xmath45 the mass density outside the loop . \n note that there is a correction factor of 0.64 in the equation as presented by @xcite ( @xcite ) . \n we can simplify eq . \n ( [ mag ] ) by inserting eq . \n ( [ ll ] ) and using @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the proton mass . \n then , the magnetic field is given by @xmath49 inserting the temperature and densities from the spectroscopy results , we obtain a magnetic field of @xmath50 . \n note that the large error is resulting mainly from the density uncertainty . using the loop length from the radiative cooling approach ( sect . \n [ radcool ] ) and eq . \n [ mag ] , the magnetic field is @xmath51 .      to maintain stable flare loops \n , the gas pressure of the evaporated plasma must be smaller than the magnetic pressure @xmath52 knowing the flare density and temperature , we get a lower limit for the magnetic field @xmath53 . \n again , there is a large error because of the large uncertainty for the density . \n @xcite assume pressure balance and give equations for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( their eqs  7a , b ) . \n using these relations , we obtain a magnetic field of @xmath56 and a loop length of @xmath57 . \n we have used three different approaches to determine the loop length of the flare and two different approaches for the magnetic field . the loop length derived in sect . \n [ oscill ] from the flare oscillation is the largest with @xmath58 , while the loop length derived from radiative cooling times ( sect . \n [ radcool ] ) is somewhat smaller by roughly a factor of 2 , @xmath42 . \n the loop length derived from pressure balance ( sect . \n [ pressbal ] ) is similar to the latter one , @xmath57 . \n the loop length derived by assuming that the variations seen are due to oscillations is a factor of 2 different to the loop length determined by more usual methods . considering the assumptions that have to be made , \n this is good agreement , and gives us confidence that we are , for the first time , observing a stellar coronal loop oscillating . \n the magnetic field ranges from 50  g ( radiative cooling ) to 115@xmath256  g ( oscillation ) , with the value from pressure balance in between with 70@xmath240  g. again , these three values are all consistent . \n this was the first time that an oscillation during flare peak was observed in x - rays in a stellar flare and flare loop length and magnetic field derived from it . \n the values are consistent with other flare models . \n we acknowledge financial support from the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) . \n umk would also like to thank the european space agency ( esa ) and the university college london ( ucl ) graduate school for financial assistance to attend the cool stars 13 conference .", "StartTimeOffset": 1084709002480, "RequestID": "e587df9f93b740c4b9492efa17a43ece", "TotalTokens": 3416}

in the current cem model it is used when any residual nucleus or fragment has a mass number less than 13 . \n the mem used by cem and laqgsm @xcite calculates @xmath9 , the emission width ( or probability of emitting particle fragment @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 where the partial transmission probabilities , @xmath12 , are equal to @xmath13 eq . \n ( [ lambdatransmission ] ) describes the emission of neutrons and protons . for complex particles , \n the nuclear level density @xmath14 becomes more complicated and an extra phase - space factor @xmath15 must be introduced : @xmath16    eq .  ( [ gammabeta ] ) for @xmath15 is a only a rough estimation that we improve by parameterizing it over a mesh of residual nuclei energy and mass numbers in our codes @xcite . \n as the mem uses a monte - carlo technique to solve the master equations describing the behavior of the nucleus at the preequilibrium stage ( see details in @xcite ) , it is very easy to extend the number of types of possible lf that can be emitted during this stage . \n we generalize the mem to consider the possiblity of emission up to 66 types of nucleons and lf , up to @xmath7 mg . as a starting point , for the inverse cross sections , coulomb barriers , and binding energies of all lf we use the approximations adopted by gem2 @xcite . \n extending the fermi break - up model to include heavier lf ( up to @xmath17 ) allows us to use it for nuclei with @xmath18 , yielding increased accuracy for reactions with light targets . \n below are examples of calculations by cem ( with the expanded fermi breap - up model ) compared to experimental data @xcite . \n c only . ] \n be target . ] \n results from the extended fermi break - up model achieve good agreement with experimental results for these light targets .            expanding the mem to include heavier lf ( up to @xmath7 mg ) yields increased accuracy for several reactions we investigate . \n figure  [ p200alli ] compares new simulations from our expanded model with data by machner et al . \n @xcite for 200 mev p + @xmath19al . \n we also find that the integral spectra for n , p , d , t , @xmath20he , and @xmath3he ( not shown ) , are not significantly impacted by this lf emission expansion . \n figure  [ p1200ni ] compares our results for 1200 mev p + @xmath21ni with new data by budzanowski et al . \n @xcite . \n similar results for different lf spectra are obtained for several other reactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n our results indicate that expanding the mem to include lf preequilibrium emission significantly increases accuracy of the high - energy spectra compared to experimental data . \n extending the cem model to include emission of light fragments ( lf ) heavier than @xmath3he ( up to @xmath7 mg ) in the preequilibrium stage results in significantly improved accuracy compared to experimental data for several reactions , especially in the high - energy tails of the spectra . \n future work includes finding a global parametrization for @xmath22 , incorporating the expanded event generators into mcnp6 , adding coalescence of heavier fragments , further exploring fermi break - up , and upgrading the evaporation model . \n gudima et al . , nucl . phys . * a401 * , 329 ( 1983 ) . \n mashnik et al . , lanl report la - ur-08 - 2931 , los alamos 2008 , arxiv:0805.0751 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. k. k. gudima et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-01 - 6804 , los alamos , 2001 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. t. goorley et al . \n . technol . * 180 * , 298 ( 2012 ) . \n h. machner et al . \n c * 73 * , 044606 ( 2006 ) . \n y. uozumi et al . , nucl . \n instr . meth . \n a * 571 * , 743 ( 2007 ) . \n m. hagiwara et al . \n , j. nucl . \n technol . * 49 * , 571 ( 2012 ) . \n a. budzanowski et al . , phys . \n c * 82 * , 034605 ( 2010 ) . \n s. furihata , nucl . \n b * 171 * , 252 ( 2000 ) . \n s. mashnik et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-12 - 01364 , los alamos , 2012 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/. l. kerby et al . \n , lanl report la - ur-12 - 24190 , los alamos , 2012 , http://mcnp.lanl.gov/.", "StartTimeOffset": 1097629056525, "RequestID": "d169e45f01904a4f9cb79611e6a32456", "TotalTokens": 2650}
{"ContextTokens": 4033, "GeneratedTokens": 269, "SynthesizedBody": "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary filling the roche lobe . \n the matter transferred from the secondary forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf . \n instabilities in the accretion disk result in various kinds of activities seen in cvs . \n the two most relevant instabilities are thermal and tidal instabilities , which are responsible for dwarf nova - type outbursts and superhumps , respectively ( see @xcite for a review ) . in systems having orbital periods longer than three hours , thermal instability governs the general behavior . \n accretion disks become thermally stable at high mass - transfer rates ( @xmath0 ) , while disks becomes thermally unstable in low @xmath0 . \n the former corresponds to novalike ( nl ) variables , which do not show outbursts , while the latter corresponds to dwarf novae , which show semi - periodic outbursts . \n close to the thermal stability border , there exist systems called as z cam stars , which show both standstills , the state corresponding to a nl variable , and a state exhibiting dwarf nova outbursts . the origin of interchanging states in z cam stars can be naturally understood with an assumption of varying @xmath0 from the secondary : the high @xmath0-state corresponds to standstills , while the low @xmath0-state the dwarf nova phase . \n there exist a small group of nl variables which show temporary reduction or cessation of @xmath0 from the secondary , namely vy scl - type stars @xcite . \n the low states ( reduced @xmath0-states ) of vy scl stars are hard to interpret in the scheme of the standard disk instability theory . \n if the disk follows the same evolution as in z cam stars in response to the temporary reduction of @xmath0 , the system should undergo dwarf nova outbursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n observations usually show the contrary : the system undergoes a smooth decline from the high to low states ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    an important clue to understanding \n the vy scl - type behavior came from the detection of transient supersoft x - rays from a vy scl - type system , v751 cyg @xcite . from the detection of supersoft x - rays during the low state of v751 cyg , @xcite suggested that steady nuclear burning is taking place on the white dwarf of v751 cyg . @xcite \n further suggested the possibility that vy scl - type stars comprise a low - mass analog of supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxs ) . \n this discovery is consistent with the observed high temperature of white dwarfs in vy scl - type systems ( cf . \n @xcite , table 2.8 ) . \n @xcite proposed that , in the presence of the heating from the hot white dwarf , the irradiation on the accretion disk suppresses the thermal instability , which can reproduce the observed light curve of vy scl - type system in their low - high transitions . \n this effect , combined with the suggestion by @xcite , would be a promising candidate for the explanation of the behavior of vy scl - type stars . in this paper , we report on the discovery of large - amplitude oscillations with a period of 2.65 d , in a vy scl - type system v425 cas @xcite , which we regard as a further evidence for the effect of irradiation . \n a fading of v425 cas was detected by one of authors ( t. kinnunen ) in 1997 august . \n the object soon returned to its high state , and remained at around mag 14.5 until early 1998 . \n the object was again caught in faint state at the beginning of the next observing season ( 1998 august ) . \n we observed the system with a ccd in three seasons , 1998  early 1999 , late 1999  early 2000 and early 2000 . \n the ccd observations were done using an unfiltered st-7 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt - cassegrain telescope . \n the exposure time was 30 s. the images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and analyzed using the java@xmath1-based psf photometry package developed by one of the authors ( t. kato ) . \n the magnitudes were determined relative to gsc 3985.1444 ( tycho-2 magnitude : @xmath2 ) , whose constancy was confirmed using gsc 3985.1525 . \n the log of observations are given in the table ( @xmath3 represents the number of frames ) . \n .log of observations ( 1 ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n [ fig : figure1 ] shows the light curve of the 19981999 season , when the object stayed 1.02.0 mag below the high - state level . \n large - amplitude , rapid variations are clearly seen with a time scale of a few days . \n such a large - amplitude , short - term variation was never observed in any hydrogen - rich cvs , including vy scl - type stars . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig1.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure2 ] shows the result of period analysis , using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method @xcite . \n the strongest period is seen at @xmath4 d. no other significant period was found between @xmath5 d and @xmath6 d. since our observations were basically sampled once per night , we can not completely rule out the possibility of a shorter period . \n we have searched signals around the orbital period of v425 cas ( 0.1496 d , @xcite ) and found no significant period representing the overall light variation . \n this strongly indicates that the variation is not related to its orbital motion . the low inclination angle ( 25@xmath7 , @xcite ) \n also makes unlikely orbital modulations as a major cause of variation . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig2.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure3 ] shows the light curve in the 19981999 season folded by this 2.65 d period . \n the averaged light curve clearly shows 0.60.7 mag modulations , having a rapid rise and a slower decline . \n the profile of the light curve resembles those of dwarf nova outbursts with short recurrence times . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig3.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure4 ] shows the light curve in the 19992000 season , in which the object was at a similar brightness level as in the 19981999 season ( the averaged magnitudes of these two seasons agree within 0.05 mag ) . \n nevertheless , the 2.65-d period had completely disappeared . \n period analysis of the data did not yield any significant periodicity . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig4.eps    ( 88mm,60mm)fig5.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure5 ] shows the light curve in the late 2000 season . \n the object had further faded by @xmath81.0 mag at the beginning of this season . \n there is an evidence of a further fade in 2000 november  december . \n it is likely the object was entering a deep low state during this season . \n the large amplitude ( up to 1.5 mag , and 0.60.7 mag in average , which is close to a factor of two flux variation ) of the variations far exceeds those of known ( local ) disk oscillations , such as quasi - periodic oscillations , in cvs . \n the amplitude more suggests that dwarf nova - type disk instability is taking place , which is also consistent with the observed profile of variation . \n the main difference from the ordinary dwarf novae is the extreme shortness of the recurrent time . \n dwarf novae with orbital periods around that of v425 cas have typical recurrence time of ten to a hundred of days , the shortest known one being am cas having a recurrent time as short as 8 d ( cf . \n the recurrence time of dwarf novae is basically governed by the two factors , namely the viscous drift time in low @xmath0 systems and the build - up time in the outer disk torus in high @xmath0 systems ( cf . \n the shortest limit of recurrence time is regulated by the latter factor , which makes the recurrence time approximately inversely proportional to @xmath0 . above the critical @xmath0 , \n the disk becomes thermally stable , and this determines the shortest limit . according to calculations by @xcite , the expected minimum period is slightly below @xmath810 d , which is in good agreement with the am cas case . \n a different mechanism is therefore needed to explain the extremely short recurrent time in v425 cas .    a clue to this problem \n can be found in another example of a striking departure of recurrence time from the disk - instability theory : \n purr \" type outbursts observed during the outburst of an x - ray transient , v518 per = gro j0422 + 32 @xcite , which had a recurrence time of @xmath810 d , which is several times to an order of magnitude shorter than the expected recurrence time from the disk instability model . \n @xcite argued that x - ray irradiation on the accretion disk can effectively increase the disk temperature , and suppress the instability in inner portions of the disk , producing small - scale purr - type outbursts ( for model calculations , see @xcite ) . \n this scheme could apply to accretion disks in cvs , if there is an appropriate source of irradiation . \n @xcite required an x - ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 in producing purr - type outbursts . \n since the observed x - ray luminosity during a low state of the vy scl - type star v751 cyg was estimated to be @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 @xcite , the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems is expected to be enough to produce similar purr - type outbursts in cvs ( cvs generally have smaller accretion disks than in x - ray transients , which would make even a lower @xmath12 to work equally efficiently ) . \n we thus regard the present discovery of dwarf nova - like oscillations in v425 cas as another promising evidence for the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems . \n the disappearance of this kind of oscillations in the 19992000 season may be explained , in the same context , by the reduction of irradiation , due to the exhaustion of the accreted matter after a long - lasting of low - accretion state . \n the termination of accretion or the exhaustion of the accreted matter probably led to a further fade observed within the following eight months . \n yet another intriguing similarity is found in dwarf nova - like oscillations in helium cvs ( am cvn stars ) . \n two examples are known : cr boo ( @xmath1319 hr , @xcite ) and v803 cen ( @xmath142023 hr , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n @xcite proposed that this oscillation in cr boo can be understood as an extension of outbursts in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae , using the known relations ( kukarkin - parenago s relation and bailey s relation ) in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae . \n however , the assessment of the period should require calculations in helium accretion disks . \n @xcite applied the dwarf nova - type thermal and tidal instability model to the helium disk systems , and obtained a recurrence time of @xmath848 d , which is too long to explain the observed oscillations in cr boo and v803 cen . \n this recurrence time was more appropriately demonstrated in  normal outbursts \" of cr boo @xcite between its superoutbursts recurring with a period of 46 d. @xcite suggested that lower - amplitude , short - period oscillations observed by @xcite may result from the reflection of the cooling and heating waves in the outer region of the accretion disk , and not the full - disk outburst . \n the mechanism responsible for this effect was not clear at the time of the suggestion by @xcite , but the relatively strong x - ray flux in both stars inferred from rosat observations , the effect of x - ray irradiation would be a promising explanation . emerging evidences on the observable effect of irradiation in cvs on their outburst behavior , as demonstrated in the present observation , may be also a key to understanding the mystery of outbursts in helium cvs . \n our long - term ccd photometry of v425 cas , during its faint state in 19982000 , revealed the presence of totally unexpected , unprecedented large - amplitude ( 0.51.5 mag ) oscillations with a time scale of a few days . \n the period analysis of oscillations has demonstrated that this oscillation is well represented by a single period of 2.65 d. the amplitude and mean profile of variation strongly suggests that variation is caused by dwarf nova - type disk instability . \n the shortness of the period is more difficult to explain . by taking recent discoveries of supersoft x - rays in a low state vy scl - type star into account , we proposed that the suppression of the thermal instability of the inner accretion disk by irradiation can be responsible for this large - amplitude variation in v425 cas . \n this effect of irradiation may also apply to helium cataclysmic variables , which show similar short - period , large - amplitude oscillations , which were proposed to be dwarf nova - type outbursts . \n greiner , j.  1998 , , 336 , 626 greiner , j. , tovmassian , g. h. , di stefano , r. , prestwich , a. , gonzalez - riestra , r. , szentasko , l. , chavarra , c.  1999 , , 343 , 183 honeycutt , r. k. , cannizzo , j. k. , robertson , j. w.  1994 , , 425 , 835 ichikawa , s. , osaki , y.  1994 , in theory of accretion disks-2 , ed . w. j. duschl et al . \n ( dordrecht , kluwer ) , p169 kato , t. , nogami , d. , baba , h. , hanson , g. , poyner , g.  2000 , , 315 , 140 kato , t. , stubbings , r. , monard , b. , pearce , a. , nelson , p. 2001 , ibvs , no . \n 5091 king , a. r. , cannizzo , j. k.  1998 , , 499 , 348 leach , r. , hessman , f. v. , king , a. r. , stehle , r. , mattei , j. 1999 , , 305 , 225 mineshige , s. , shields , g. a.  1990 , , 351 , 47 mineshige , s.  1994 , , 431 , 99l osaki y.  1996 , , 108 , 39 patterson , j. , kemp , j. , shambrook , a. , thomas , e. , halpern , j. , skillman , d. , harvey , d. , vanmunster , t. , retter , a. , fried , r. , buckley , d. , nogami , d. , kato , t. , baba , h.  1997 , , 109 , 1100 patterson , j. , walker , s. , kemp , j. , odonoghue , d. b. , stubbings , r. 2000 , , 112 , 625 ritter , h. , kolb , u.  1998 , 129 , 83 shafter , a. w.  1983 , ph.d . \n thesis , ucla stellingwerf r.f . \n 1978 , 224 , 953 tsugawa , m. , osaki , y.  1997 , , 49 , 75 warner , b ..  1995 , in cataclysmic variable stars ( cambridge univ . press . \n , cambridge ) wenzel , w.  1987 , ibvs no .", "StartTimeOffset": 1107876144256, "RequestID": "3d2b929c654e4fecb4d02bb5b172b24e", "TotalTokens": 4302}
{"ContextTokens": 3254, "GeneratedTokens": 138, "SynthesizedBody": "the term acoustic casimir force ( acf ) refers to the force between two parallel plates when they are placed in an acoustic random field . \n this is a classical analog of the quantum casimir force that results from quantum vacuum fluctuations @xcite . \n acoustic casimir forces were first proposed by larraza and collaborators @xcite , who measured the effect in audible frequencies for plates separated a few millimeters . \n the plates were placed in a close tank that acted as a reverberation chamber , and the average acoustic field of intensity @xmath0 was generated with pressure drivers in a frequency range @xmath1 $ ] . in the acoustic casimir force , \n only the frequencies in a finite bandwidth spectrum are taken into account , the bandwidth being determined by the physical limits of the acoustic sources used . unlike the unbounded spectrum of the quantum case , the acf has very interesting physical consequences . \n the most significant being that the acoustic casimir force changes from attractive to repulsive depending on the plate separation and the frequency bandwidth . \n the change in sign of the force due to a finite bandwidth has also been observed in the fermionic casimir effect between two metals , where the force is obtained after an integration over all possible energy states up to the fermi level @xcite .    in this paper , an external classical sound source \n is assumed in the calculation of the acf . \n it differs from the phononic casimir effect , that is caused by a random phonic field induced by thermal fluctuations @xcite . \n the magnitude of the phononic casimir pressure is comparable to the quantum casimir effect at separations of the order of @xmath2 m. the phononic pressure has been shown to influence the pull - in dynamics of micro electromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite . \n consider two parallel plates separated a distance @xmath3 and characterized by their acoustic reflectivities @xmath4 . \n the plates are in an acoustic field of random white noise of frequency bandwidth @xmath1 $ ] and spectral intensity @xcite @xmath5 . the acoustic casimir pressure ( acp ) \n is calculated from @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 . \n the wave vector @xmath8 has components @xmath9 parallel to the plates and @xmath10 perpendicular to the plates . \n the speed of sound in the medium between the plates is @xmath11 . \n equation ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) was derived @xcite assuming rigid plates , so that no sound is generated by them . also , diffraction effects are neglected . \n the basic idea behind eq ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) is the subtraction of the pressure outside the plates from the pressure due the modes that can exists between the plates when the boundary conditions are satisfied . \n if the lower frequency of the bandwidth is set to zero , the acp is always attractive @xcite . if we consider and infinite bandwidth @xmath12 and perfect acoustic reflectors @xmath13 , the acp calculated using eq.([lifshitz2 ] ) gives a attractive force for all separations , @xmath14    to scale down the acp from macroscopic systems to submicron systems , we require high frequencies . \n typical commercial transducers can operate up to @xmath15 mhz , and with a high acoustic power output . \n the feasibility of high intensity , high frequency transducers in micro systems can be exemplified by the experiments of degertekin @xcite that actuated atomic force microscopes cantilevers using focused ultrasonic transducers in the frequency range of 100 - 300 @xmath16 . \n also , sub - terahertz have been achieved with superlattice structures @xcite . \n the intensity of ultrasonic transducers is around 50 @xmath17 @xcite . \n however , high intensity focused ultrasonic transducers can have an intensity of several orders of magnitude greater ; several thousands watts per square centimeter @xcite . \n to study the effect of the acoustic casimir force in mems , we consider a one degree of freedom simple lumped model . \n it consists of two parallel plates , one fixed the other attached to a spring of elastic constant @xmath18 . \n the equilibrium separation is @xmath19@xmath20 . when the plates are at a distance @xmath3 , the elastic force is @xmath21 . \n the system in enclosed in an acoustic resonant cavity as shown in figure 1 . \n although this model is the simplest when studying pull - in dynamics , it is helpful in the overall understanding of the pull - in dynamics and in our case , how it changes in the presence of the acoustic casimir force . for these systems , \n the electrostatic force is the most common form of actuation for mems . \n to get an idea of the pressure magnitudes involved in the acoustic casimir effect , we compare the acp for perfect acoustic reflectors and an infinite bandwidth , eq.([lifshitz3 ] ) , with the pressure between two parallel plates of area @xmath22 with a potential difference between them . \n we consider two cases , when the potential difference is of @xmath23@xmath24 and of @xmath25@xmath24 , as shown in figure 2 . in these cases , they are of the same order of magnitude . \n recall , that the acp is proportional to the spectral intensity @xmath5 , that we can vary to get a casimir pressure of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic case . in figure 1 \n we chose @xmath26@xmath27 . \n the important aspect of the acp we want to emphasize is that it may change sign when the plate separation changes . as explained in ref . \n @xcite , the repulsive casimir pressure happens when the separation between the plates equals an integral number of half - wavelengths associated with the lower frequency of the band - width @xmath28 . in this case \n , the wave vector @xmath29 between the plates and the contribution of the stress tensor is mainly that perpendicular to the plates . \n outside the plates this condition is not met and the for the same frequency the wave vector can be at any angle of incidence . in figure 3 , we present the acp as a function of separation for two different frequency band widths @xmath30 $ ] @xmath16 ( solid line ) and @xmath30 $ ] @xmath31 ( dotted line ) . the repulsive acp should occur when @xmath32 , that is , close to any of the following separations : 11.8682 , 23.7365 , 35.6047 , 47.473 , 59.3412 , 71.2094 , 83.0777 , 94.9459 , 106.814 , 118.682 , 130.551 , 142.419 . for the mhz bandwidth these positions are in microns and for the ghz bandwidth in nanometers . \n this shows that the acp is applicable to devices of any size by a suitable choice of the frequency bandwidth . \n the peaks where the repulsive acp occurs get broader as the separation increases . at large separations , the system is less sensitive to variations in frequency . if @xmath33 be the peak width , the change in the frequency within this interval is @xmath34 . \n larger @xmath33 imply a small change in the frequency @xmath35 as well as in wave vector . \n thus , within @xmath33 at large separations @xmath29 within the plates \n .    controlling the lower frequency of the bandwidth allows us to select where the acp changes sign . \n consider the acp for the bandwidth @xmath36$]@xmath37 . \n this , is shown in figure 3 . \n there is a narrow peak centered at @xmath38 @xmath39 or @xmath40 , where a repulsive acp is present , while for other separations we have a constant negative pressure . \n again , changing the bandwidth from mhz to ghz allows us to work with different size systems . \n let us recall that for the simple lumped system actuated by electrostatic forces @xcite there is an upper limit for the value of the potential difference after which the electrostatic force overcomes the elastic force and the top plate jumps to contact . \n the voltage @xmath41 and plate separation @xmath42 where the pull - in occurs are @xmath43 this is why we choose the acp to have a positive peak at this particular separation . \n now , we show that having the acoustic casimir pressure , the dynamics of the plate changes and the pull - in voltage can be increased . \n having another force besides the electrostatic attraction has been considered in the study of pull - in dynamics , for example dispersive forces @xcite .    to find the critical value of the voltage where the pull - in occurs , we begin with the equation of motion of the top plate @xmath44 where @xmath45 the permittivity of vacuum . introducing the dimensionless separation @xmath46 we have @xcite @xmath47 the wavevector components with a tilde are normalized to @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in eq.([dimensionless ] ) we have introduced the parameters @xmath50 which shows the relative importance of the electrostatic force to the elastic force , and @xmath51 that compares the acoustic casimir force with the elastic force . since the voltage appears in @xmath52 \n we find that @xmath53 where we define @xmath54 is the integral term that multiplies @xmath55 in eq . \n ( [ dimensionless ] ) .    if @xmath56 , the solution of eq . ( [ lam1 ] ) corresponds to the pull - in voltage given in eq.(3 ) . for the the value of @xmath19@xmath20 used here yields @xmath57@xmath20 . in fig(3 ) , we choose the frequency bandwidth to have a positive pressure at this separation . as we now show , the additional acp can increase the value of the pull - in voltage .    for different values of @xmath55 , we plot the bifurcation diagram @xmath52 vs @xmath58 in fig . \n the vertical line is a visual aid that indicates the position of the maximum of the curve . \n the points to the left of the maximum are stable equilibrium point while all the points to the right are unstable points and for those values of @xmath52 and @xmath59 the elastic force is overcome and the plates will jump to contact @xcite . for the particular selection of the acp used the position of the maximum does not change for different values of @xmath55 , since @xmath60 , as seen in fig . \n so , for this particular choice of frequency the bandwidth is still @xmath61 . \n however , the pull - in voltage will change . using the definition of @xmath52 in eq . \n ( [ lam1 ] ) and evaluating at @xmath42 we have @xmath62^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the pull - in voltage in the electrostatic case , eq.([pullin ] ) , since @xmath55 is proportional to the acoustic intensity . \n thus , the pull - in voltage can be increased by increasing the acoustic intensity . \n in conclusion , we have presented a theoretical calculation of the acoustic casimir force in frequency ranges suitable for applications in the micrometer range . in particular , we showed that by selecting a particular frequency bandwidth the acp can be repulsive or attractive , or change sign as a function of plate separation . \n the lower frequency of the bandwidth and the acoustic intensity are two parameters that can be tuned to control the dynamics of electrostatic actuated mems extending the value of the pull - in voltage for simple - lumped systems . \n the acp calculations were done for a micrometer size and nanometer size systems . \n however , these therefore , a fine - tuned acp can be used to increase the mechanical stability of mems structures . in future work , by considering oscillating acp , as shown in fig . \n ( 2 ) , we will analyze the possibility of using the acoustic casimir effect as a mechanical actuator for micropumps @xcite . \n another area of interest where the analogy between the quantum case and the acoustic can be exploited is in the use of acoustic metamaterials @xcite , where negative volume densities and reflectivities are possible . \n $ ] mhz ( solid line ) and @xmath30$]ghz ( dotted line ) . the change in sign from attractive ( negative ) to repulsive ( positive ) happens when @xmath64 . \n the acp was calculated using eq . \n ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) and assuming an acoustic reflectivity of @xmath65 . \n the horizontal axis is in microns for the mega hertz bandwidth and nano meters for the giga hertz bandwidth . for this figure @xmath26@xmath27 for the solid line and @xmath66@xmath27 for the dotted line . . \n ]    $ ] mhz(ghz ) for the solid ( dotted ) lines , the separation at which the acp is positive can be fixed . in this case \n a sharp repulsive pressure is obtained at a separation of @xmath38@xmath20(solid line ) or @xmath38@xmath67 ( dotted line ) . the units of the horizontal axis are the same as in figure 3 . ]    , we calculate the force from the acp presented in figure 3 . in this case , the position of the maximum does not change . \n the different curves correspond to different values of the parameter @xmath55 . \n the vertical line is a visual aid and is located at @xmath68 . from top \n to bottom the different curves correspond to the values of @xmath69 . ]", "StartTimeOffset": 1111841706253, "RequestID": "523ffca6bf35400a9efd458cd8285b05", "TotalTokens": 3392}

and then @xmath6 is used for the computation of @xmath2 at the energy distribution algorithm . \n it is also noticeable that the solutions of the energy generation and energy distribution algorithms are computed through communications among neighboring nodes . \n so , after obtaining the solutions @xmath6 and @xmath2 , each node generates physical energy and distributes energy to the neighboring nodes simultaneously . \n in this case , the sum of the desired energies of all nodes is well given as @xmath47 . for the balanced case , we consider the following scenario : +  six nodes : @xmath48 , and @xmath49 +  seven undirected edges : @xmath50 +  initial energies : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 +  desired energies : @xmath53 , and @xmath54 +  lower boundaries of generation capability : @xmath55 for all @xmath10 +  upper boundaries of generation capability : @xmath56 and @xmath57    clearly , since @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , the supply - demand balance is satisfied . now using the discoord algorithms given in the previous section , \n we obtain +  the generated energies : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 +  energy flows : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 + from the above result , we see that the total amount of energy flows is @xmath74 . as shown in fig . \n [ case11 ] , the desired energies have been well achieved after energy distribution . fig . \n [ case12 ] shows the overall variation in energy level of each node , and overall energy flows in the graph .    : \n desired energies(upper figure ) and achieved energies(lower figure ) . ]    : upper figure - initial(blue ) , desired(aqua ) , generated(yellow ) , and initial@xmath75generated(red ) ;

so it seems that the discoord algorithms evenly distribute the remaining energies to the network . as shown in fig . \n [ case22 ] , clearly there is no energy generation from the discoord algorithms . \n thus , we can see that when there are over energy in the network , the algorithms do not generate energy in the whole network . \n : desired energies(upper figure ) and achieved energies(lower figure ) . ]    : upper figure - initial(blue ) , desired(aqua ) , generated(yellow ) , and initial@xmath75generated(red ) ;

but only there are energy flows . \n this paper has presented several cases as applications of discoord algorithms . \n as shown in the previous examples , the discoord algorithms can deal with various cases even though the supply - demand balance is not ensured any more . \n the main capability of the algorithms is to decide all the generation and distribution through local interactions , i.e. , by distributed coordination . \n it is recommended to see ` byeong - yeon kim , `` coordination and control for energy distribution using consensus algorithms in interconnected grid networks '' , ph.d . \n dissertation , school of information and mechatronics , gwangju institute of science and technology , 2013 @xcite ' for applications to various engineering problems of the algorithms developed in this paper . \n the reader can send email to hyosung@gist.ac.kr to get the matlab source code . \n kim , `` coordination and control for energy distribution using consensus algorithms in interconnected grid networks , '' in _ \n ph.d dissertation _ \n , school of information and mechatronics , gwangju institute of science and technology , 2013 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1119613764124, "RequestID": "97edc5de124d4cfd9c88b46008548676", "TotalTokens": 3416}

brightness source was accomplished using ctr from the rf gun beam accelerated to 40 mev . \n the gun , linac , and ctr setup are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . \n the beam emerges from the 1.6 cell @xmath0 mode rf gun and proceeds to the alpha magnet via a beamline containing focusing , steering , a kicker , and an entrance slit . \n the alpha - magnet vacuum chamber contains a scraper that is used to remove the low energy / high emittance tail from the beam . \n after the alpha - magnet , the beam traverses some focussing and correction elements , then proceeds through a 3-m slac s - band accelerating waveguide to the ctr foil . \n the ctr foil is mounted on an actuator along with a yag crystal , which is used to focus the beam to a small beam spot at the foil position . \n the ctr is collected by a lens and sent to a michelson interferometer with a golay detector mounted on one arm . \n the autocorrelation of the ctr is performed by moving one arm of the interferometer while recording the golay detector output . \n the golay detector output can be maximized at the peak of the autocorrelation scan and used to adjust rf gun power and phase , beam current , and alpha - magnet current so as to minimize the bunch length out of the alpha magnet . \n once this is done , the ctr signal is a good relative measure of the bunch length . \n to prepare the rf gun to produce a high - brightness beam one must first scan the alpha - magnet current to find the minimum bunch length . \n typically the rf gun is powered anywhere from 1.5 to 1.7 mw , and the heater current is adjusted to produce 1 to 2 nc in a train of 23 s - band bunches . the gun power and beam current \n are kept constant during the scans . \n prior to the scan , the beam is focused on the yag using quads before and after the alpha magnet , with the alpha magnet `` close '' to the setting required for minimum bunch length . during the scan \n , the rf gun phase must be adjusted linearly to compensate for path length changes in the alpha magnet . to maximize scan resolution , \n the interferometer is set to maximize the golay detector signal . \n figure  [ fig3 ] shows a typical alpha - magnet scan showing a peak at 175 amperes . \n the curve represents the output of the golay detector from a gated integrator amplifier . \n once the minimum bunch length has been found , an alpha - magnet scraper scan is performed . \n simulations show a microbunch profile that has a low - emittance , high - energy core beam and a high - emittance , low - energy tail . the scraper scan is performed to optimize removal of the low - energy tail . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows a typical scraper scan where the ctr signal is plotted vs scraper position . \n the edge of the core beam is at approximately 9.5 cm . \n figure  [ fig5 ] shows a plot of ctr signal vs beam current , as measured by a beam position monitor ( bpm ) adjacent to the ctr foil , taken during the scraper scan . \n included with the data is a quadratic fit , showing the expected quadratic dependence of the coherent radiation on the number of particles . \n once the scraper position is determined , the interferometer is used to measure the autocorrelation of the digitized gated integrator ctr signal . \n figure  [ fig6 ] shows the autocorrelation measured for a beam of 1 nc in 23 s - band micropulses . \n autocorrelation processing begins with taking the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the autocorrelation , which gives the square of the bunch spectrum . \n the method of lai and sievers is then used to reconstruct the phase spectrum from the amplitude spectrum by computing a principal value integral . \n once the phase spectrum is obtained , an inverse fft is performed to derive the microbunch profile . \n additional processing is performed to correct for the reduced response of the golay detector at low frequencies ( long wavelengths ) . \n since any bunch spectrum approaches low frequencies quadratically , a quadratic fit is performed for frequencies from the golay detector 3-db point to a user - selectable higher frequency , typically including 3 to 5 frequency points  @xcite . \n the fit is then used to extrapolate quadratically to dc from the golay detector 3-db point . \n figure  [ fig7 ] shows the amplitude spectrum derived from the measured autocorrelation and the corrected spectrum for low frequencies . \n the main effects of this low - frequency correction is to broaden the derived bunch profile and flatten the dips in the autocorrelation adjacent to the peak . \n these dips are unphysical since the autocorrelation is always positive . \n figure  [ fig8 ] shows the derived bunch profile from the the corrected autocorrelation spectrum . \n the overall profile contains a high - current peak ( @xmath1 100 amperes ) , a lower current shoulder , and is overall about 400 fs wide . \n this beam was used for sase measurements . \n the beam prepared as described above was accelerated to 217 mev . \n the emittance was measured in the transport line using the standard three - screen technique , giving a normalized emittance of approximately 10 @xmath0 mm . \n the energy spread is estimated to be  0.1% . \n the beam was transported to the undulator hall and passed through five aps undulators with diagnostics stations between them . \n figure  [ fig9 ] shows the measured photon intensity ( corrected for spontaneous background ) at each undulator diagnostic station . \n the solid line is an exponential fit to the data showing a gain length of 1.3 m for both undulator radiation and coherent transition radiation data  @xcite , in agreement with a calculation using the previously listed peak current , emittance , and energy spread . \n the rf thermionic gun beam was quite stable once tuning was completed . \n one limitation of the beam is that the microbunch length is on the order of the electron slippage length . the final saturated power is therefore expected to be lower for this beam . \n the authors thank j. lewellen , s. milton , and j. galayda for useful comments and suggestions . \n m. borland , `` an improved thermionic microwave gun and emittance -

( 1 ) suggest that two nonlinear effects are crucial for oscillations in this system . \n they destabilize @xmath14 and @xmath0 rich surfaces , correspondingly .    in fig . \n 2 we show snapshots of the surface at two different time moments . fig . \n 2a corresponds to the time moment when there are no @xmath6 molecules left on the surface . note that in the original zgb model , for the parameters we have chosen , the system goes to the state fully covered by @xmath8  @xcite \n however , the presence of the inert molecules shown in fig . 2a as the brightest spots , prevent such a fully @xmath8 covered state . \n moreover , these inert molecules allow for the presence of enough vacant sites ; these are shown as black areas in fig . \n 2 . in these vacant areas , \n @xmath0 molecules can be absorbed ; their coverage can grow if they are isolated by the inert molecules from @xmath8 covered areas . by taking into account this nonlinear effect , which includes interaction among @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 , the reaction term in eqn . \n ( 2 ) can be modified as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the blocking coefficient . \n 2b shows nucleation of the @xmath8 covered state on the @xmath6 rich surface . \n as an adsorption of @xmath17 requires two free sites , nucleation of the @xmath8 island may seem an unlikely process , if one starts from the fully @xmath6 covered state as an initial condition . \n however , there is an another nonlinear effect which may lead to explosive growth of an @xmath8 island . \n suppose that the desorptions of two @xmath6 molecules have vacated a pair of adjacent sites . on these sites \n , @xmath17 can be absorbed , and if this happens , @xmath6 and @xmath8 will immediately react . \n as the surface is rich with @xmath6 , the reaction will free four sites . on these four sites \n , two @xmath17 molecules can be absorbed . \n this cascade may lead to explosive growth of the @xmath8 island . \n therefore , there is an another nonlinear effect which is particularly noticeable during a nucleation of an @xmath8 island on a @xmath6 rich surface . in the lowest order of nonlinearity , due to the nonlinear increase of available adjacent free sites through the reaction \n , the growth of @xmath8 can be termed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the coefficient for the nonlinear growth of adjacent free sites . \n we verified that @xmath20 can also serve well for this term . \n the two nonlinear effects manifest themselves randomly in monte carlo simulations . for a macrospcopic description , \n we consider them deterministic processes . \n thus , eqn . \n ( 2 ) can be modified into the form :    @xmath21    we want eqn . \n ( 3 ) as simple as possible . \n we include the reaction term @xmath22 in the first equation only because its effect in the second equation is assumed to be small . \n this assumption stems from a microscopic process : a pair of @xmath8 can not be blocked by a single inert molecule . \n the reason why we include @xmath23 in the second equation only is also taken from a microscopic fact : for the adsorption of @xmath0 , the presence of two free adjacent sites is not essential . \n we note that the two effects were also described by jansen and nieminen  @xcite ; however , they did not include them explicitly in the rate equations . \n we also note that eqn . \n ( 3 ) is much simpler than the rate equations in the pair approximation of eqn . \n ( 1 ) , which do not show oscillations in the parameter range of interest  @xcite . eqn . \n ( 3 ) is an approximate model , and it is desireable to derive it systematically . \n because of its nonlinear terms , analytic treatment of eqn . \n ( 3 ) is difficult . \n nevertheless , it can be studied numerically . \n for example , one may use the software `` xppaut '' by b. ermountrout  @xcite . \n we found that for the occurrence of a hopf bifurcation it is not necessary that both @xmath16 and @xmath19 were nonzero in eqn . \n however , we found that parameter space for oscillations are larger if both @xmath16 and @xmath19 are nonzero .      in the present case , it is difficult to find analytic expressions for the steady states of eqn . \n ( 3 ) . in fig . \n 3 we show a numerical integration of eqn . \n ( 4 ) . here , in contrast to its dynamics shown in fig . \n 1 , the inert molecule concentration remains high . \n we suppose that the main reason for this is that @xmath26 is finite in fig . 3 , but @xmath27 in fig . 1 . \n also , a better choice of the rate constants can be made in order to compare dynamics in the rate equations and monte carlo simulations  @xcite . \n a hopf bifurcation in this system is shown in fig . \n 4 . thus , the nonlinear effects we outlined in the previous section may indeed lead to stable oscillations . \n a two parameter bifurcation diagram is shown in fig . 5 . \n we found that with the increase of @xmath26 , the parameter region for a hopf bifurcation widens . \n we found that such an increase is accompanied by the emergence of saddle nodes .      in the present case , \n the steady states are given by , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a solution to @xmath31    once again we were able to analyze stability of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath30 numerically only . \n oscillations for the present case are shown in fig . \n we note that in the present case , except the hopf bifurcation , saddle node bifurcations occur in the system .      as in the previous case , the steady states of eqn . \n ( 3 ) can be expressed through a polynomial . \n again , we were able to solve the polynomial numerically only . \n as a result , a linear stability analysis of these steady states has turned out to be difficult . \n numerically detected oscillations for the present case are shown in fig . \n note the exceptions of @xmath26 s value and @xmath25 ; these are the reaction rates used in ref . \n @xcite for monte carlo simulations . \n we note that for the parameters used in fig . 6 - 7 , \n a parameter domain for the hopf bifurcation was smaller in the present case then it was in the previous case . \n a microscopic study of a reaction system based on monte carlo simulations can reveal the molecular mechanisms of catalytic processes . as an example , in this work , such study has allowed us to outline the essential nonlinear processes in site blocking caused oscillations . \n however , fora more complete study of a reaction system , the role of diffusion should be taken into account  @xcite . in that sense , \n ( 4 ) can be a useful starting point for a reaction diffusion study of site blocking induced oscillations . \n the preliminary results of a reaction diffusion system in one dimension , with a diffusion of @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 , show synchronous oscillations , stable long lived islands and diffusion induced chemical turbulence  @xcite . \n more detailed results on this , and its comparison to the monte carlo simulations , which include diffusion of adsorbents , will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .", "StartTimeOffset": 1134257036085, "RequestID": "d849bf5b2747440bac9ea928b42db1d0", "TotalTokens": 2901}

however , the fastethernet would be a bottleneck on the milc code with kogut - susskind quarks . \n even so , a 32 node system with a minimum performance of 1280 and 1660 mflops , for @xmath1 and @xmath2 sites per node , respectively , could be built for under $ 10,500 . \n this works out to a cost / mf of between $ 6.3 and $ 8.2 .    in sec .  2 \n , we describe the key issues for good performance . \n section 3 gives details of single node performance . \n section  4 points the reader to a web site with extensive benchmarks , gives cost estimates for several designs and compares cost - performance ratios for these clusters and a number of supercomputers . for additional information about emerging technologies for clusters \n see ref .  @xcite . \n a very simple approach to achieving good performance for domain decomposition codes like lattice qcd codes is to optimize single node performance and to try to avoid degrading performance too much when one has to communicate boundary values to neighboring nodes . \n the key to a cost effective design is an appropriate balance . \n floating point performance is more easily adjustable than network performance because processors come in many speeds , but there are only a few choices for the network . \n a simple performance model of the kogut - susskind conjugate gradient algorithm gives this bandwidth requirement to overlap communication and floating point operations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the _ achieved _ bandwidth in megabyte / s , @xmath5 is the _ achieved _ floating point speed in megaflop / s on matrix - vector multiplication and an @xmath6 portion of the grid is on each node . \n we assume there are neighboring nodes in each direction , _ \n i.e. _ , 16 or more nodes \n . the constant factor 0.364 is specific to ks quarks . \n however , the @xmath7 behavior is typical of the domain decomposition approach to parallelism and comes from the surface to volume ratio . \n figure [ fig : performance ] shows a log - log plot of measured bandwidth on a ping - pong test for three types of hardware and the performance model for several processor speeds . \n the messages vary in size from 800 bytes to 30 kb for problem sizes of interest . \n the arrows near the bottom of the graph correspond to different l values . \n the fastethernet and myrinet curves come from measured performance on the roadrunner ( rr ) supercluster at the albuquerque high performance computer center . \n two curves are shown for myrinet . with the newer drivers \n , bandwidth is better and smoother . \n the quadrics curve comes from the teracluster at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) . \n the measurement was done using the netpipe program from the ames scalable computing laboratory @xcite . \n the straight lines come from the performance model presented above and are plotted for matrix times vector speeds of 50 , 100 , 200 and 400 mf . \n we need to run at a large enough value of l so that the measured bandwidth is above the straight line ( for whatever speed our processor achieves for the corresponding value of l ) . because of cache effects \n , the processors will achieve higher speeds when @xmath8 is small , but that requires the highest bandwidth . \n thus , pushing up the communication rate for small messages is important . \n being able to run for a small value of @xmath8 with high efficiency allows running a fixed size problem at high total performance . \n we see that none of the networks achieves more than a small fraction of its peak bandwidth for the message sizes of interest . a system design based on achieving that peak bandwidth \n would almost certainly be communication bound , _ \n i.e. _ , money would have been spent on floating point capacity that could not be used . \n there are large differences in the prices of fastethernet , myrinet and quadrics hardware . \n choice of network can obviously play a critical role in system performance and cost - effectiveness . \n the single node performance is likely to depend upon such issues as the quality of the cpu , the performance and size of cache(s ) , the bandwidth to main memory and the quality of the compiler . for message passing performance , \n key issues are the latency , peak bandwidth , processor overhead and the message passing software . \n it is important to make the right choices when designing your system .    for the cpu \n , one can choose among intel celeron , pentium ii , piii , piv , itanium ; amd athlon , thunderbird , duron ; compaq alpha and other possibilities . \n the celeron may have limited performance because it only has a 66 mhz front side bus ( fsb ) . \n if access to memory is important ( as it is for this application ) the 100 or 133 mhz fsb of the pii and piii will be useful . \n the piv is quite new and currently expensive . \n itanium is soon to be available and some results are provided below . the alpha has great performance , but it is expensive . \n there are currently several memory types available for different processors . \n they include pc100 , pc133 , rambus , double data rate ( ddr ) , which is also known as pc1600 or pc 2100 . \n pc100 and pc133 are fairly mature at this stage , and there is little difference in price ( currently about 0.5$/mb ) . \n rambus was quite expensive at introduction , but has recently decreased quite a bit ( currently slightly more than 1$/mb ) . \n ddr is just now coming to market ( micron ) , but it does not carry too much of a premium ( currently similar to rambus ) . \n motherboards that use ddr memory are just coming to market . \n pick the right amount of memory for your problems : you never want your code to swap , but neither do you want to buy a lot of memory that you never use . \n choice of motherboard is crucial . \n it must be matched to the processor and memory . \n the support chip can have an important impact on performance ( as we explore below ) . \n the motherboard determines the number of processors per node . \n we discuss below whether dual processor systems are more or less cost - effective for a particular application . \n the motherboard will also determine whether you have a faster or wider pci bus than the initial standard 33 mhz-32bit bus . \n this may be important if you have a higher speed network like myrinet . \n the last critical choice is the network hardware and software . \n it properly deserves its own section , but to save space we briefly discuss it here . \n fastethernet is the commodity network . \n other choices such a myrinet , giganet , gigabit ethernet , quadrics qsnet and sci from dolphin / scali have higher performance , but are quite expensive compared to fastethernet . \n ( including the card and switch , you can expect to spend about $ 1,500 per node , except for quadrics which is over $ 3,000 per node . ) because of the big jump in price and performance , it is necessary to make sure the system maintains balance between cpu and network . regarding software choices , under fastethernet , mvia@xcite and gamma@xcite software \n have reduced latency compared with standard tcp / ip . \n i have recently tried vmi under myrinet which is being developed at ncsa and found it to be superior to running under standard gm ( myrinet supplied ) driver .      turning next to single node performance \n , we note that it is easy to waste a lot of money on a poor system design . to illustrate this \n , we consider the various speed amd athlon processors available and their prices on two particular days . \n although we focus on athlon here , the same considerations apply to intel or other processors . \n figure [ fig : price_vs_speed ] shows that processor price is a rapidly increasing function of speed . \n it can also be a rapidly decreasing function of time , especially for the faster processors . \n dividing the price by the speed of the chip , we find that the relative expense rises rapidly for the faster chips @xcite . \n on april 7 , 2000 , there was an apparent sweet spot at 600 mhz . \n the faster chips have a higher price - performance ratio . depending upon the costs of the other components of the system \n , the entire system may have a higher or lower price - performance ratio .    for our qcd codes , \n access to memory is quite important . in our first example \n , we compare a celeron chip with a 66 mhz fsb and a pentium ii chip with a 100 mhz fsb . \n the pentium s clock speed is only 6% faster than the celeron , but its performance is 38% faster for @xmath96 and 23% faster for @xmath108 . \n this is because of its larger cache and 52% faster fsb . \n when we overclock the celeron , it has a slower fsb but a faster cpu speed than the pii , and performance is about equal except for @xmath96 where the smaller cache probably is the source of the difference . \n this work was supported by the u.s . \n doe under grant de - fg02 - 91er 40661 . \n special thanks to the milc collaboration , the albuquerque high performance computer center , indiana university , llnl , national center for supercomputing applications , pittsburgh supercomputer center and san diego supercomputer center .", "StartTimeOffset": 1141914040199, "RequestID": "be9ccf3009bc4c8f9b7138150f6ea888", "TotalTokens": 3310}

carbon bond ( b ) ( see fig . \n 1 ) . for these positions , different orientations of the molecules are examined and the adsorption energy is calculated for all of them . the adsorption energy ( e@xmath11 ) is the energy of the isolated graphene sheet and isolated molecule minus the energy of the fully relaxed graphene sheet with the molecule adsorbed to it . \n the strength of the molecular doping is discussed in light of the density of states and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) of the adsorbate . \n the position of these orbitals , visible as peaks in the dos , is practically independent of the orientation and adsorption site of the molecule , so we only show the total dos for one geometry per molecule . we can now distinguish two charge transfer mechanisms : i ) \n a charge transfer can occur due to the relative position in the dos of the homo and lumo of the adsorbate . \n if the homo is above the fermi level of pure graphene ( the dirac point ) , there is a charge transfer to graphene . \n if the lumo is below the dirac point , charge will transfer to the molecule . \n ii ) the charge transfer between adsorbate and graphene is also partially determined by the mixing of the homo and lumo with the graphene orbitals ( hybridisation ) . this mixing scales with the overlap of the interacting orbitals and the inverse of their energy difference . \n + it is more difficult to discuss the adsorption energy in this way because of the large amount of possible interacting orbitals present in graphene . \n our investigation starts with the non -

it will also measure @xmath16 scuti , roap stars and samples of stars of all types as a secondary objective . \n its eccentric orbit with high apogee ( molniya orbit ) permits access to a large part of the sky \n . it will measure changes in colour ratio . \n oscillations of amplitude of 1 - 10 ppm will be detected ( cf . \n kjeldsen et al . \n furthermore , mons will obtain science data from the star imagers designed for attitude control ; they will permit measurement of about 900 stars , 700 in with the imager si 1 , and 200 with the imager si 2 \n . the accuracy will be about 11 ppm ( si 1 ) and 26 ppm ( si 2 ) at magnitude @xmath17 . \n most ( ` http://www.astro.ubc.ca/most/ ` , microvariability and oscillations of stars ) is a funded project which is the first satellite of the canadian space agency \n . most will observe several ( 3 - 5 ) solar - like stars over 40 days . \n it will also observe roap , wolf - rayet and @xmath16 scuti stars . \n the photometric precision for a @xmath17 star is better than a few ppm for 10 days of integration . \n although the kepler project ( ` http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/ ` ) was not selected due to questions about the ability to perform the photometry in space , the scientific case was rated very highly . \n the kepler team is planning to resubmit the project . \n its goal is to `` explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems '' by performing differential photometry . \n it will monitor 100000 main - sequence stars in the magnitude range from 9th to 14th with an accuracy of 0.002  % including instrument noise , shot noise and stellar variability for a star of @xmath8 . \n the mission would point continuously at a single field in cygnus during 4 years . because only data for preselected stars are saved , all objects to be monitor must be pre - specified . \n the team will probably entertain `` guest observing '' for additional interesting objects like variable stars . \n a subset of a few hundred brighter stars will also be incorporated and observed with a shorter integration time for asteroseismological purposes . \n many of these projects might be selected in a near future for their realisation . \n the projects performing astrometry will provide deep galactic surveys and thus an inventory for galactic variable stars . \n the asteroseismological projects have common goals but they use different ingenious techniques and have different and diverse by - products .    the future spatial projects will open new domains in variable star studies , therefore precise predictions are delicate . since some presented missions are already funded , there is the conviction that after the projects like hipparcos or the microlensing surveys , the domain of variable stars will still be under a strong evolution . \n baglin , a. 1997a , cnes , cor - sp-0 - 83-proj baglin , a. 1997b , in the first results of hipparcos and tycho ( jd 14 of the xxiii general assembly of the iau ) , ed . c. turon , 555 grenon , m. , jordi , c. , figueras , f. , torra , j. 1999 , to be published favata , f. 1998 , in the first mons workshop : science with a small space telescope , eds . h. kjeldsen , t.r . bedding , 89 fukugita , m. , hichikawa , t. , gunn , j.e . , doi , m. , shimasaku , k. , schneider , d.p . \n 1996 , 111 , 1748 kjeldsen , h. , bedding , t.r . , christensen - dalsgaard , j. 1999 , document no . \n mons-99/01 matthews , kurtz , d. , & martinez , p. 1999 , 511 , 422 paczyski b. 1997 , in variables stars and the astrophysical returns of the microlensing surveys ( 12th iap astrophysics colloquium ) , eds . \n r. ferlet , j .- \n maillard & b. raban , editions frontires , 357", "StartTimeOffset": 1158111577293, "RequestID": "b028e892198648d6a97ef1d3e0167d37", "TotalTokens": 3486}

waveguide structures have been used to realize various types of optical devices , such as optical switches @xcite and optical sensors @xcite . to improve the device performance , \n fano resonance with asymmetric and steep spectral line shape has been intensively used , which arises from the interference between discrete resonance states and continuum states  @xcite . by modulating the coupling between phc cavity and waveguide \n , fano resonance can be achieved due to the constructive and destructive interference of discrete cavity resonance states with broadband continuum waveguide states @xcite .    in this paper , we design a coupled phc cavity @xcite and waveguide structure using finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulation @xcite . by placing partially reflecting elements in the phc waveguide , fano type transmission line shape is achieved . \n recently , gain materials such as quantum dots  @xcite , nanocrystals @xcite and rare - earth ions @xcite have been used as light - emitting centers to achieve single - photon sources , display devices and all - optical diodes , respectively . \n additionally , lasers have been demonstrated with coupling these light sources to microcavities @xcite . here , \n such gain materials are introduced into phc cavities to enhance fano resonance . with introducing the gain materials into cavity , \n the transmission line shape of the fano resonance is greatly steepened and a large contrast is achieved by a small frequency shift . in our structure , \n the transmissivity in the waveguide is increased by a factor of six , which is potentially applicable for optical switches and optical sensors . \n we employed a free - software package meep @xcite to design the phc structure . \n hexagonal lattice of air holes was patterned on a planar dielectric slab . \n the slab thickness is 0.6 @xmath1 , where _ a _ is the lattice constant . \n the air hole radius is @xmath2 , and the slab dielectric is 12.96 . with the mit photonic - bands ( mpb ) package @xcite , the phc slab band structure has been calculated , which has te - like photonic bandgap from 0.2455 to 0.3229 ( _ a_/@xmath3 ) , where @xmath3 is wavelength in the vacuum . with one air hole missing in the phc slab , an h1 cavity is formed @xcite . \n the radii of the nearest six air holes around the h1 cavity are reduced to 0.24 _ a _ to increase the quality factors of the cavity modes . \n three lattice constant _ a _ away from the center of h1 cavity , one array of air holes are removed to form a w1 waveguide . \n shows the coupled phc cavity - waveguide structure .    to simulate the spectral response of the coupled cavity - waveguide structure , a gaussian source with frequency center 0.2980 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and frequency width 0.02 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) \n is located at the left end of waveguide and the energy flux has been detected at the right end . shows the normalized transmission spectrum of the light . \n as waveguide mode frequencies are far away from the cavity resonant frequencies , light transmits from one end of the waveguide to another end with almost 100% transmission without any coupling with the cavity . when waveguide modes are resonant or nearly resonant with the cavity modes , light couples into the cavity resulting in dips in the transmission spectrum . \n three dips in the transmission spectrum in fig . \n 1(b ) correspond to three resonant modes of the h1 cavity . \n shows the z components of the magnetic fields of the cavity modes corresponding to the three dips in the transmission spectrum in . \n the mode of shows a hexapole mode corresponding to the dip denoted by _ \n while the modes of and ( c ) are nearly degenerate quadrupole modes for _ b _ and _ c _ in . \n the cavity mode field distributions indicate that the cavity couples with the waveguide via the evanescent field . \n the cavity resonance frequencies of , ( b ) and ( c ) are 0.2961 , 0.2996 and 0.3002 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and the corresponding quality factors are 2890 , 5960 and 2770 , respectively . \n a cavity mode with low quality factor has a large coupling strength with the waveguide , thus a deeper dip appears in the transmission spectrum with a broad linewidth .      to realize fano resonance , partially reflecting elements are introduced into the coupled phc cavity - waveguide structure . \n two air hole barriers have been placed in the center of the waveguide , as shown in . \n the amplitude transmissivity @xmath5 is determined by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the resonant frequency of the cavity mode . \n @xmath8 is the amplitude transmission coefficient of the partially reflecting elements . \n @xmath9 is the intrinsic cavity loss rate . \n @xmath10 is the cavity decay rate due to coupling into one port of the waveguide . when there is no partially reflecting elements existing ( @xmath11 ) , the transmission line shape is lorentzian symmetric . when @xmath12 , the light from the incoming port of waveguide to the outgoing port has two pathways . \n one with light transmitting through the cavity provides discrete modes , and the other with light passing through the partially reflecting elements gives rise to continuum modes . \n the constructive and destructive interferences between these modes induce an asymmetric fano type transmission line shape . \n the amplitude transmission coefficient @xmath8 determines whether the transmission line shape is symmetric lorentzian type or asymmetric fano type . \n the simulated and normalized transmission spectrum is shown in . \n two fano type peaks are observed in the spectrum . \n when the waveguide modes are non - resonant with the cavity modes , the light can not be coupled into the cavity and is reflected mostly by the two air hole barriers . \n the light with the cavity mode frequency can couple into the cavity and transmit to the other port of the waveguide . \n therefore , fano type peaks appear in the transmission spectrum . \n the simulated cavity mode distributions show that , there are three cavity modes in the frequency range of the transmission spectrum in . \n the z components of the magnetic fields of the three modes are shown in , ( b ) and ( c ) . \n the cavity resonance frequencies of the three modes are 0.2956 , 0.2998 and 0.2998 ( _ a_/@xmath4 ) and the corresponding quality factors are 1830 , 2980 and 4570 , respectively . \n the resonant frequencies of cavity modes in and ( c ) are so close that the cavity modes can not be distinguished in the transmission spectrum in \n .      the asymmetric and steep line shape of fano resonance is beneficial for optical switches and optical sensors . \n the steep line shape of fano resonance can significantly reduce the frequency shift required for on / off switching . \n optical sensors with high sensitivity can be constructed based on the spectral shift associated with asymmetric line shapes . \n recently , investigations have been performed to enhance the fano resonance . \n @xcite reported that the fano resonance can be modified by adjusting the partially reflecting elements . in this work , \n we introduce gain material into the phc cavity to enhance the fano resonance .    in the two dimensional phc slab structure , \n it is straightforward to couple quantum dots into a cavity @xcite , with which the optical gain can be obtained by pumping the quantum dot either optically or electrically . as the quantum dot transition and the cavity mode \n are tuned into resonance , the loss of the cavity mode is compensated by the photons emitted by the quantum dot , resulting in increasing of the quality factor of the cavity mode . to simulate the gain supplied by quantum dot , we consider the material structure in maxwell s equations which is determined by the relative permittivity @xmath13 . \n it should be noted that @xmath14 does not depend only on position , but also on frequency ( material dispersion ) , electric field ( nonlinearity ) , and the orientation of the field ( anisotropy ) @xcite . material dispersion is generally associated with absorption loss or gain in the material , which is given by the following expression : @xmath15 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the instantaneous dielectric function , @xmath17 is the electric conductivity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are user - specified constants , and @xmath20 is a user - specified function of position giving the strength of the _ n_-th resonance . \n note that the imaginary part of @xmath14 can be expressed by conductivity @xmath17 as @xmath21 . here , we only consider the absorption loss or gain in a narrow bandwidth , thus the imaginary part of @xmath14 can be set to some known experimental value , and a dispersionless real part of @xmath14 can be set with a value in our bandwidth of interest . in fdtd simulation , the imaginary part im@xmath22 is set by choosing the conductivity @xmath17 at our frequency @xmath23 of interest . \n the absorption loss ( gain ) in the material is associated with positive ( negative ) value of the imaginary part of @xmath14 . \n a series of negative values of im@xmath14 has been used to simulate the gain , which can be achieved by pumping quantum dot in the cavity .    in our coupled phc cavity - waveguide structure ( shown in ) , \n gain material is located at the center of the h1 cavity with a radius of 0.6 @xmath24 and thickness of 0.6 @xmath24 . \n the frequency @xmath23 is set around the resonant frequency of the degenerated quadrupole modes . \n the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the gain material introduced into the h1 cavity is set as -0.001 , -0.01 , -0.0135 and -0.01415 at frequency 0.2998 @xmath25 . \n the normalized transmission spectra are shown in . \n as the gain increases , the normalized transmissivity becomes larger and larger , and the linewidth of the transmission line shape becomes narrower . \n light trapped in the cavity is fed by the gain so that the light energy flux is enlarged . \n then the enlarged light energy flux is coupled into waveguide , resulting in enlarged transmissivity . without gain material in the cavity , \n the normalized transmissivity corresponding to the degenerated quadrupole modes is 0.246 . \n when gain material with im@xmath14=0.01415 is introduced into the cavity , the normalized transmissivity is 1.564 , which is about six times larger than that of the case without gain . \n it can be clearly seen that the line shapes become steeper as the gain increases .    with the coupled cavity - waveguide structure , we further analysed the transmission spectra in the cases with and without gain material in h1 cavity . with the same frequency shift , \n the transmission contrast with gain material is much larger than the case without the gain . \n the large transmission contrast with a small frequency shift is very promising for realizing optical switches @xcite . \n in addition , the resonant mode can be easily perturbed if there are nano - particles adhere to the h1 cavity , which gives a frequency shift in the transmission spectrum . \n the narrow and steep fano asymmetric transmission lineshape could make the coupled structure much more attractive as a nano - particle sensor @xcite . \n we have theoretically proposed that the fano resonance in a coupled phc cavity - wavegudie structure can be greatly enhanced when gain material is introduced into the cavity . \n the fano spectral line shape becomes steeper and steeper as the gain increases . \n with im@xmath26 the transmission is enhanced by six times in our case . the optical gain in the cavity supplies photons with frequency of the cavity mode . \n the supplied photons compensate the losses of cavity mode . as a result , \n the quality factor of the cavity mode is increased , corresponding to a narrower linewidth . the discrete cavity mode with narrower linewidth interferes with the continuum modes , generating a steeper fano asymmetric linedwidth . \n the doubly degenerate modes at 0.2998 @xmath25 are chosen to enhance fano asymmetric lineshape because the field of the degenerate modes distributes in a large volume in the cavity , which can enhance the gain . with the gain enhanced fano resonance , a large contrast can be achieved by only a small frequency shift , which could be useful in ultralow - energy and high - contrast optical switches . \n the steepened transmission line shape can be also sensitive to nano - particle adhering to the designed structures , which enables such coupled phc structure to be used as optical sensors . \n * acknowledgments * + this work was supported by the national basic research program of china under grant no . \n 2013cb328706 and 2014cb921003 ; the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 91436101 , 11174356 and 61275060 ; the strategic priority research program of the chinese academy of sciences under grant no . \n xdb07030200 ; and the hundred talents program of the chinese academy of sciences .    * author contributions * + x.x . and k.j . \n conceived the project . \n y.z . designed the structure and carried out the calculations . \n , k.q . , j.t . \n , y.s . and x.x . \n discussed the results and the experimental implementations . \n y.z . and x.x . \n co -

{"ContextTokens": 1700, "GeneratedTokens": 99, "SynthesizedBody": "the cdf offline involves hundreds of collaborators from 56 different institutions from all over the world . \n while not ever collaborator has directly contributed software , all must use the software and help debug it . \n the current code set consists of tens of millions of mostly c++ code , organized into 294 packages . \n these packages are further organized into major reconstruction , simulation , and physics categories : tracking , calorimetry , muon , time of flight , luminosity counters , top , tau , electroweak , b physics , and infrastructure . at cdf \n the offline includes all of the software and computing need for the real time software trigger ( the level3 trigger ) , the online monitoring of the detector , the primary reconstruction , the detector simulation , physics group analysis software , tools such as the detector event display and software used to measure the performance of the above , such as tracking efficiency and purity . \n in 1996 when work on the run 2 offline started , very few people at cdf knew c++ . \n the advantages of using a language that supported memory management was considered large enough to out way the cost of learning c++ . \n we claimed that we would start by writing all of the infrastructure code in c++ but still make provisions for the physics code to be written in f77 . \n people involved with the run 1 experiment wanted to reuse as much of the run 1 code as possible , so the code was wrapped into c callable routines and fed it s input data via the c++ infrastructure . \n output was in the form of arrays that were also managed by the infrastructure . \n as new people entered the project there was a desire to replace this code with algorithms written in c++ so that it would be maintainable . \n this happened for every subsystem until everything was c++ . \n the next generation of maintainers after this second round has not felt it necessary to rewrite everything . \n we now have people entering the project with prior c++ experience from other experiments . during the development of the code we never had enough people to work on all of the tasks \n we wanted done . \n strong leadership to prioritize during these early times was essential . at any one time we had about 6 to 10 highly productive developers , one per subsystem . \n the release schedule reflects the pace of development and managements decisions about how to best serve our users . \n our users were the detector commissioning physicists , and farm and data handling hardware developers . during the first year that we started making major releases , 1999 , there were 5 releases reflecting the difficulty of these first integrations . in 2000 and 2001 \n there were about 10 each year . \n this was our time of extreme programing . \n many of the major rewrites occurred at this time , including a change from a fortran array based edm ( event data model ) to a root based edm . at the same time \n the experiment was commissioning the detector and these customers required that we keep the code working for their use . \n for this reason many subsystem developers were maintaining two versions of the code for their system . \n one of the advantages of this situation was that both versions could be run to see if they resulted in the same answer . \n many bugs were discovered while investigating differing answers . some were in the c++ but \n some were found in the run1 fortran code as well . in 2002 \n there were about 5 releases . \n this reflected the need for stability in preparation for presenting physics results at the early 2003 winter conferences .      throughout the history of the project cdf was greatly aided by using the work of others outside of cdf . \n babar donated their framework , evtgen and ideas . \n the support of the root team especially phillippe canal was essential . \n many of the zoom / clhep classes we use were developed by those groups at our request . \n many of the classes in existence before cdf started developing c++ software were greatly improved in performance through collaboration with the supporters of clhep . \n unfortunately our compiler vendor , kai was also a collaborator in that we had to report bugs to them . despite this , \n the decision to use kai was not a bad one . \n it allowed us to write c++ standard code much earlier then we would otherwise have been able to . \n this has served us well in transitioning back to g++ now that kai is becoming unsupported . \n the most important step in creating stability and robustness in the software system was the development of rules and procedures . \n there are rules about how releases are put together and what can be integrated at different phases of the cycle . \n there are well defined procedures for validation and regression testing of all new releases . \n these are documented on the web and the manpower for doing these tasks comes from the collaboration as part of an offline shift . \n a shifter is given recipes for running purify , debuggers and software management tools as well as instructions for running the tests . \n monitoring the running of automated systems like the reconstruction farms is also part of the job . \n use of a bug tracking tool has also greatly aided in finding problems and documenting solutions for out users . \n the shifter can try to answer questions that are sent to the list , or forward them to the relevant system expert . \n here is a list of some of the things that were surprising and were learned over the course of the project :    * you never really understand a problem until it is solved once . \n the strategy of studying and recoding run 1 code in c++ for run 2 served us well in many areas of the project . \n * performance has not been a problem , wasteful copying was eliminated early in the development of the code and there are still gains that we can make . choosing efficient algorithms gains more performance the hand optimizing the code . * \n keep the system clean in terms of physical design and organization . \n physics analysis codes will follow the patterns of the reconstruction and be more generally usable if the reconstruction is kept clean . * \n a code browser is important for both the developers and users of the software system . * \n beware of code generation , it can produce code bloat if not done carefully . * \n memory leaks are supposed to be the biggest problem in large c++ systems , however for us uninitialized variables has been a bigger problem . \n memory leaks can be traced with standard tools . \n uninitialized memory reports from these same tools are too numerous to be useful . \n many of these reports are completely harmless and finding the bad ones buried underneath is very hard . \n we have had releases in which the farms operation of the reconstruction was tested to be 1 crash in a million events . \n the same exact code when recompiled with a shorter name for the file system it lived on crashed in less then a thousand events processed . \n this was traced to an error in using uninitialized memory . * start commissioning as early as possible . \n mock data challenges did nt completely prepare us for the turn on of real data . \n count on having to change things once you have really customers with real needs . \n * many people will leave the project one year after the first physics data arrives . \n if faced with the choice of two solutions to a problem always choose the most maintainable one . \n insure that there is sufficient overlap between the original developers of the code and the junior people who will take over the maintenance of it . \n the cdf offline software system was flexible and serviceable . \n it was able to help commission the detector even while it was undergoing large transitions to improved software . \n it helped take the data , reconstruct it , and perform the physics analysis on it in a timely manner .", "StartTimeOffset": 1185236050869, "RequestID": "aaa5fe709de74f7f87de18c192e5784b", "TotalTokens": 1799}

the utility of a proposed experiment . \n bayesian experimental design has been successfully applied to problems in experimental physics , such as in the recent examples of @xcite and @xcite . in classical theories of physics and statistics , the measurement simply reveals the state of the system at that instant . \n by contrast , quantum theory presents with the following physical ( and

, a generally well motivated measure of utility is _ information gain _ @xcite . in information theory , \n information is measured by the entropy @xmath13 thus , we search for the experiment which maximizes the expected information in the final distribution . that is , an optimal experiment @xmath14 is one which satisfies @xmath15 \n as an example of how to apply the bayesian experimental design formalism to problems in quantum information , we consider a simple situation with a single qubit . \n in particular , we suppose that the qubit evolves under an internal hamiltonian @xmath16 here @xmath17 is an unknown parameter whose value we want to estimate . \n an experiment consists of preparing a single known input state @xmath18 , the @xmath19 eigenstate of @xmath20 , evolving under the hamiltonian @xmath21 for a controllable time @xmath22 and performing a measurement in the @xmath20 basis . \n this is the simplest problem where adaptive hamiltonian estimation can be used and is the problem studied in reference @xcite .    in the language of bayesian inference , the data @xmath23 is the outcome of the measurement . \n an experiment @xmath0 consists of a specification of time the @xmath22 that the hamiltonian is on , while the model parameter @xmath3 is simply @xmath17 . \n the likelihood function is given by the born rule @xmath24 experimental design is a decision theoretic problem based on the utility function @xmath25 the optimal design is any value of @xmath22 which maximizes this quantity . \n we proceed by performing the optimal experiment and obtaining data @xmath8 . using bayesian inference we update our prior @xmath26 via bayes rule : @xmath27 \n if we are not satisfied , we can repeat the process where this distribution becomes the prior for the new experimental design step . \n this algorithm is depicted in figure [ fig : overview ] . \n overview of a step in the online adaptive algorithm for finding locally optimal experiments . \n top : method for calculating the utility function @xmath28 , given a simulator and a prior distribution @xmath29 over model parameters @xmath3 . \n bottom : method for updating prior distribution with results @xmath1 from chosen actual experiment . ] \n the preceding problem had a single unknown variable . \n if we desire an estimate @xmath30 of the true value @xmath3 , the most often used figure of merit is the _ squared error loss _ : \n @xmath31    the _ risk _ of an estimator @xmath32 is its expected performance with respect to the loss function : @xmath33 for squared error loss , the risk is also called the _ \n mean squared error_. the average of this quantity with respect to some prior @xmath34 is the _ bayes risk _ of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the estimator which minimizes this quantity is called a _ bayes estimator_. in this case the bayes estimator is the mean of the posterior distribution . let us assume then that the estimators we choose are bayes . \n let us also choose a uniform prior for @xmath3 . \n then , the final figure of merit is the average mean squared error ( amse ) : @xmath37 we would like a strategy which minimizes this quantity . \n non - adaptive fourier and bayesian strategies were investigated and compared to an adaptive strategy in reference @xcite . \n their adaptive strategy fits into the bayesian experimental design framework when the utility is measured by the _ variance _ of the posterior distribution : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean of the posterior . \n recall that the mean is a bayes estimator of amse , so @xmath40 . for a single measurement \n this utility function satisfies @xmath41 . that is \n , maximizing the utility _ locally _ at each step of the algorithm is equivalent to minimizing the amse at each step . \n hence , when using the negative variance as our utility function , the adaptive strategy summarized in figure [ fig : overview ] is an example not only of a local optimization , but also a _ greedy algorithm _ with respect to the amse risk . in the future , we shall refer to this choice of utility function together with the local optimization algorithm as the greedy algorithm for this problem . \n we can write the risk of this strategy recursively as follows . \n suppose at the @xmath42th , and final , measurement we have the updated distribution @xmath43 . \n then , the risk of the local strategy is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath46 the expected risk at any other stage is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is , again , the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath49 then , the bayes risk of the greedy strategy is @xmath50    again , it is clear that the greedy algorithm is globally optimal on the final decision , as there is no further hypothetical data to consider . \n that is , the optimal solution at the @xmath42th measurement is @xmath51 where @xmath45 is the locally optimal design satisfying @xmath46 however , the globally optimal risk at any other stage @xmath52 where now @xmath53 is the globally optimal design satisfying @xmath54 then , the bayes risk of the greedy strategy is @xmath55    in general , @xmath56 . nor is it the case that @xmath57 for an arbitrary prior . \n however , for the special case of the uniform prior , we have found numerically that the bayes risk of the greedy strategy and the bayes risk of the global strategy are similar enough that the greedy strategy is useful .      in reference \n @xcite , it was shown via simulation that the posterior variance of the greedy strategy is best fit by an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath42 , the total number of measurements . \n in contrast , all off - line strategies decrease at best as a linear function of @xmath42 .    in figure \n [ fig : results ] , we show that the local information gain optimizing algorithm also enjoys an exponential improvement in accuracy over naive off - line methods \n . moreover , we show nyquist rate sampling is unnecessary and , indeed , sub - optimal . \n all results stated are obtained using a uniform prior on @xmath58 $ ] and are computed numerically by exploring every branch of the the decision tree , in contrast to simulation . \n in order to be `` fair '' to the off - line methods , we restricted the adaptive methods to explore the same experimental design specifications . \n that is , for this particular problem , the adaptive algorithm was allowed to select measurement times from @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the total number of measurements . in principle , these methods could only do better with a larger design specification . \n performance of the estimation strategies . \n the bayesian sequential and the strategy labeled `` nyquist '' sample at the nyquist rate .

strategy can exponentially improve the accuracy over offline estimation strategies . \n moreover , we have shown that sampling at the nyquist rate is not optimal in the case of strong measurement . \n we have derived a recursive solution to the risks for both the local and global optimal strategies . using this solution \n , we numerically found that the local strategy is nearly optimal in the special case of a uniform prior . that the greedy algorithm is nearly optimal in a case relevant to experiment demonstrates that an adaptive bayesian method may be computationally feasible , in that an implementation need not consider all possible future data when choosing each experiment . \n together , these results demonstrate the usefulness of an adaptive bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation in quantum mechanical systems , especially in comparison with other algorithms in common use . in the presence of noise , \n this improvement becomes still more stark , as demonstrated by the results shown in figure [ fig : results ] . \n why is it the case that the nyquist times are not optimal ? \n first , why should we expect them to be optimal ? \n the nyquist theorem states that a signal which contains no frequencies higher than @xmath65 is completely and unambiguously characterized by a discrete set of samples taken at a rate greater than or equal to @xmath66 . \n however , the classical notion of sampling fails for the strong - measurement case that we consider here . \n what we have is a periodic _ probability _ distribution which can be sampled , not a periodic function whose _ values _ can be ascertained . \n that is there is no _ signal _ , in the classical sense of the word , which can be reconstructed . \n the failure of the nyquist rate sampling is exemplified in figure [ fig : utils ] .     the information gain ( left ) and variance ( right ) utilities for the prior followed by three simulated measurements . \n the vertical grid lines indicate

standard metric , note that it is not practically useful in the context of estimating the parameters of a quantum mechanical system . \n we motivate this claim as follows . \n a typical application of our algorithm is to inform control theory algorithms , which can achieve significantly higher fidelities if given a distribution over hamiltonians rather than a single best estimate . indeed , in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance , the physical ensemble of qubits produces a real distribution of hamiltonians to which control theory algorithm must be robust against @xcite . \n any single estimate of the hamiltonian parameters will thus artificially exclude dynamics which will appear as decoherence in the resultant pulses . \n thus , we must measure the success of our algorithm via a loss function of the true _ distribution _ and estimated posterior . noting that relative entropy is broadly considered the correct loss function for probability estimators , our algorithm , which maximizes expected information gain , becomes the optimal solution . \n we expect that in more complicated systems , the bayesian adaptive method will remain useful , especially in applications such as optimal control theory , where having a distribution over hamiltonians is significantly more useful than a single best estimate . \n u.  von toussaint , t.  schwarz - selinger , m.  mayer , and s.

{"ContextTokens": 2845, "GeneratedTokens": 186, "SynthesizedBody": "the seemingly disjoint topics of strong gravitational lensing and of the host galaxies that surround the luminous qsos at high redshift , enjoy a symbiotic relationship . \n _ hosts constrain lensing :  _ gravitationally lensed radio lobes can provide - through their spatially extended nature - more constraints on the lensing potential than the two or four point source images that are found in optically selected or radio - quiet qsos . as the majority of high - z qsos are radio - quiet , the extended stellar light of the host galaxies that surround qsos , can provide a welcome subsitute for extended radio emission ; the host galaxies form  optical einstein rings  or small arcs when lensed . \n recent examples include pg  1115 + 080 ( impey 1998 ) , mg  1131 + 0456 ( kochanek 1999 ) , q  0957 + 561 ( keeton 1999 , _ in prep . \n _ ) , and b  1938 + 666 ( king 1998 ) . \n because gravitational lensing preserves the surface brightness of the source , different images of the same host position in the source plane should only differ in surface brightness through differential dust extinction along the various image paths . in this way \n , optical images of the lensed hosts could provide a more sensitive probe of the ism in distant galaxies than the point sources alone ( falco 1999 ) . \n _ lensing helps to see host galaxies :  _ gravitational lensing magnifies both the nuclear qso emission and the surrounding host galaxy . for the unresolved nucleus this magnification simply results in a flux increase without observable changes in the source morphology ; in contrast , the extended host emission is `` stretched away '' from the nucleus at a constant surface brightness . if the psf falls off with radius @xmath2 , as for hst , gravitational lensing changes the local contrast in favor of the extended light proportional to the square of the magnification . \n 0.3truein    in the data of the castles ( see _ http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles/_ ) project several factors come together to provide unprecedented sensitivity to detecting qso host galaxies : ( 1 ) hst provides a relatively stable psf with a fwhm of @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) for a qso at @xmath4 , the host galaxy is an order of magnitude more prominent at @xmath5 compared to the agn than at optical wavelengths ; ( 3 ) the low near - ir background from space improves the sensitivity to low - surface brightness features in the outer parts of the host galaxy ; ( 4 ) gravitational lensing further improves the host \n agn contrast as discussed above .    for these reasons \n , we initiated a study of the host galaxies around gravitationally lensed quasars . \n as the lens magnification is physically unrelated to the source structure , our sample of lensed qsos should not be significantly biased compared to other samples , save some possible luminosity bias . in this paper \n , we summarize briefly the state of other host galaxy studies (  2 ) , describe the results from the castles study (  3 ) and compare them to recent theoretical models of central black hole and host galaxy growth at high redshifts (  4 ) . \n explicit empirical demonstrations that qsos are indeed active nuclei surrounded by host galaxies have been pursued for 25 years , but have been hampered , especially for distant sources , by contrast problems with the much brighter nucleus , particularly because @xmath6 . \n nonetheless , for qsos at @xmath7 , host galaxy detections have now become routine both at visible and near - ir wavelengths ( hutchings and neff 1992 ; mcleod and rieke 1995 ; bahcall 1995 ) , and a fairly coherent picture is emerging : radio - quiet qsos ( rqq ) typically live in early - type disk galaxies ( s0-sb ) whose luminosity range is centered around @xmath8 ; radio - loud qsos live in slightly more luminous hosts ( @xmath9 ) . while tidal interactions may be conducive to qso activity they are not necessary . \n mcleod ( 1999 ) showed that in all nearby qsos ( @xmath10 ) there is a maximum nuclear luminosity for any given h - band host luminosity ( figure 1 ) . converting the host luminosity into a stellar mass , @xmath11 , and applying to these qsos the locally inferred relation @xmath12 ( magorrian 1998 ) between @xmath11 and the nuclear black hole ( bh ) \n mass , mcleod ( 1999 ) deduce that these qsos can shine at most with @xmath13 .    at higher redshifts ( @xmath14 ) \n the host galaxy picture becomes observationally less clear . \n the hosts of radio - loud qsos ( rlq ) have been detected in sizeable samples with reasonable completeness ( @xmath15 ) , mostly through near - ir imaging from the ground ( kotilainen 1998 , carballo 1998 ) . \n these have become possible in part because rlqs at these epochs seem to live in extremely luminous galaxies . \n the observed rlq hosts do not seem to have comparably bright present - day counter parts , but it is still not entirely clear whether most of their ( rest ) optical emission really is stellar . in most ground - based searches for rqq hosts beyond @xmath16 the detection completeness has been very low : findings are still published on individual objects ( aretxaga 1998 ) . \n the relatively few existing detections ( hutchings 1985 ) , and by implication the non - detections , suggest that the rqq hosts are of modest luminosity . \n the existing observations leave open a number of important questions about the hosts of distant qsos , which we can address through the lensing studies :    * are all qsos embedded in substantial host galaxies , or are there `` naked '' qsos ? * do the most luminous qsos ( mostly rqqs ) at their heyday ( @xmath4 ) , live in the most luminous galaxies at their epoch ? * \n do the hosts of rqqs and rlqs differ increasingly with growing redshift ? * is there the same maximum nuclear luminosity at a given host luminosity in distant qsos than at @xmath10 ? as qsos were more luminous in the past , and most galaxies were in lower mass fragments , one might expect an evolution of such a relation . \n to study gravitationally lensed qsos systematically , the castles project has obtained deep f160w ( h - band ) images ( typically for one orbit ) of most known lens systems . \n we have begun to derive de - magnified h - band magnitudes for the host galaxies wherever they are detected . in the four image systems we should expect that at least some portion of the host is highly magnified and becomes a detectable arc . \n indeed , in most highly magnified cases there is such a qualitative detection , indicating that `` naked quasars '' are rare , if they exist at all . \n however , the demagnification of such systems ( pg  1115 + 080 , fig . \n 2 ) can be quite complex ; certainly , the de - magnification of two - image lenses ( q0957 + 561 , fig . \n 2 ) is more straightforward .    in figure 3 , we have summarized the magnitudes ( and upper limit ) for an initial set of six objects ( rix 1999 ) . clearly , these host galaxies of rqqs are much fainter than bright radio galaxies ( @xmath17 ) at similar redshifts . \n for comparison , figure 3 also shows the apparent brightness of two galaxies with two different star formation histories ( sfh ) that both result in @xmath18 galaxies at the present epoch . \n if the hosts had formed all their stars at high redshift ( an @xmath18 s worth ) , they would appear much brighter . \n however , if the hosts formed stars continuously similar to the milky way , the predicted magnitudes match the observations . \n this is consistent with qso living in unexceptional host galaxies with typical sfhs that lead to @xmath18 now . \n it is instructive to compare the relation between nuclear and host luminosity for our sources at @xmath0 to the low redshift results of mcleod 1999 . \n the large filled circles in figure 1 represent the initial results from castles and show that at higher redshift the hosts are comparatively much fainter than at later epochs . \n this discrepancy would increase considerably if we compared the minimum stellar mass ( rather than h - band luminosity ) at high and low redshift . indeed , after accounting for about one magnitude of h - band m / l evolution , we would be lead to conclude that these luminous qsos at high redshift have super - eddington luminosities , _ if the same @xmath19 @xmath20 relation were to hold . \n _    instead , it appears more plausible to infer that the central bhs grew faster at early epochs than the surrounding hosts , so that @xmath21 in this case , a less massive and less luminous host galaxy could sustain a more luminous nucleus . \n recently , kauffmann and hhnelt ( 1999 ) have explored the connection between galaxy formation and central bh growth through semi - analytic models , trying to explain evolution of the galaxy population and of the qso luminosity function simultaneously . \n their models predict a quite steep evolution in the @xmath22 vs @xmath23 relation ( see figure 4 ) , but one that exactly matches our findings . \n support for the castles project was provided by nasa through grant numbers go-7495 and go-7887 from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n aretxaga , i. , le mignant , d. , melnick , j. , terlevich , r.j . , & boyle , b.j . \n 1998 , , 296 , 643 bahcall , j.n . , kirhakos , s. , & schneider , d. 1995 , , 450 , 486 carballo , r. , snchez , s.f . \n , gonlez - serrano , j.i . , benn , c.r . , & vigotti , m. 1998 , , 115 , 1234 falco e.e . \n 1999 , astro - ph/9901037 hutchings , j.b . , & \n neff , s.g . \n 1992 , , 104 , 1 hutchings , j.b . \n 1995 , , 110 , 994 impey , c.d . \n 1998 , , 509 , 551 kauffmann , g. , & hhnelt , m. 1999 , astro - ph/9906493 king , l.j . \n 1998 , 295l , 41k kochanek , c.s . \n 1998 , astro - ph/9809371 kotilainen , j.k . , \n falomo , r. , & scarpa , r. 1998 , , 332 , 503 magorrian , j. 1998 , , 115 , 2285 mcleod , b.a . , rieke , g.h . , & storrie - lombardi , l.j . \n 1999 , , 511 , l67 mcleod , k.k . , & rieke , g.h . \n 1995 , , 454 , 77 rix , h .- w . \n , 1999 , _ in prep .", "StartTimeOffset": 1211740097868, "RequestID": "fb8619b88e654d699e9552b20ab2f4b1", "TotalTokens": 3031}

{"ContextTokens": 2592, "GeneratedTokens": 123, "SynthesizedBody": "nuclear force is one of the oldest problem in nuclear physics . \n however , its theoretical description is still an unsettled issue . here , we first explain a traditional , phenomenological approach to the nuclear force , and a fairly new approach based on nuclear effective field theory ( neft)@xcite . after the explanation , \n we formulate a scenario for a relation between nuclear forces based on the two approaches . the main subject in this report \n is to discuss the relation from a viewpoint of the renormalization group ( rg ) .    in the phenomenological nuclear force ( ) , \n the long - range part is described by the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) . \n the short - range part is poorly known , and therefore a phenomenological model is used ; heavy - meson exchanges or purely phenomenological parameterization . \n parameters involved in the model are fixed so as to reproduce low - energy @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy . in this way , \n several high - precision @xmath0 potentials have been constructed , such as the cd - bonn and the nijmegen potentials . \n although these models are phenomenologically very successful , there are some problems as follows . at first , each model describes the short - range part differently , and is largely model - dependent . secondly , there is no systematic way to construct the short - range mechanism . \n thirdly , there is little connection to the underlying theory , qcd . \n in contrast , it is claimed that a nuclear force based on neft ( ) is free from the problems inherent in . \n the claim is based on the derivation procedure of , which is briefly given as follows . \n one starts with an effective chiral lagrangian , taking care of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd . \n the lagrangian consists of effective degrees of freedom for a system in question , and is the most general as long as assumed symmetries are satisfied . \n one identifies a set of irreducible diagrams from the lagrangian with . \n the importance of an irreducible diagram is assigned by a counting rule . \n however , one may find questions about : ( q1 ) in , short - distance physics is described by contact interactions , which is much simpler compared to the short - range mechanism employed in . \n is the contact interaction really appropriate to describe the short - distance physics ? ( q2 ) \n is  still one of many phase - equivalent potentials , as  is ? ( q3 ) is there any relation between model independent  and model dependent ? \n in fact , the answer to ( q3 ) naturally leads us to the answers to ( q1 ) and ( q2 ) . \n thus , we formulate a scenario for the relation between  and . \n it is noted that the model space ( the state space for the nucleon ) of  is considerably smaller than that of . with this point in mind , we can formulate the following scenario for the relation between  and . \n we may construct many  which reproduce @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy . \n they are different in describing the short - distance physics , and therefore model dependent . starting with such , \n we reduce their model space by integrating out the high momentum states of the nucleon . reducing the model space corresponds to viewing the system in a coarse - grained manner . \n as the model space is reduced , information about details of the short - distance physics is gradually lost . \n eventually , we obtain a low - momentum effective interaction ( @xmath1 ) defined in a reduced model space . \n @xmath1 does not have the model dependence which  have . \n a parameterization of @xmath1 constitutes . \n this is the scenario for the relation between  and . \n obtained in this way is , by construction , does not have a dependence on modelling the short - distance physics . \n the short - range part of @xmath1 is expected to be accurately simulated by simple contact interactions because the detailed information has been integrated out . \n therefore , if we show that this scenario is realized , then we can answer all of the questions raised in the previous paragraph . \n the purpose of this report is to confirm the scenario , thereby proposing the relation between  and @xcite . \n furthermore , keeping the relation in mind , we can understand features of neft more deeply , which we will discuss later . \n in order to examine the scenario , stated in the previous section , for the relation between  and , an appropriate model - space reduction method is necessary . in effective \n filed theory , we use an effective lagrangian in which high - energy degrees of freedom have been integrated out using a path integral : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is high-(low- ) energy degrees of freedom , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) consists of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( only @xmath4 ) . an effective ( more fundamental ) lagrangian is @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) . \n the model - space reduction , integrating out high - momentum states of the nucleon , also should be done with the path integral . \n although it is difficult in general , in case the lagrangian is composed by only the nucleon field and two nucleons interact through contact interactions , we can perform the path integral . \n it is noted that we restrict ourselves to two - nucleon system throughout this report . in the center of mass frame , performing the path integral is equivalent to solving the following wilsonian renormalization group ( wrg ) equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath0 potential for a partial wave @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the nucleon mass . in @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the off - shell relative momentum of the two nucleons before ( after ) the interaction , @xmath14 denotes the on - shell momentum , and @xmath15 is the cutoff value specifying the model space . \n this equation controls the evolution of @xmath8 with respect to a change of @xmath15 . \n this equation was firstly derived by birse _ \n _ in a different manner@xcite . \n starting with several phenomenological @xmath0 potentials , we reduce their model spaces using the wrg equation , and examine the evolution . \n then , we simulate the obtained effective model - space interaction ( @xmath1 ) with  by adjusting parameters in it . \n if the simulation is accurate , then the relation between  and  through rg is realized .    in the simulation , for simplicity , we include only the opep in  as a mechanism explicitly including the pion . \n this is not fully consistent with weinberg s counting . \n because we consider contact interactions with zero , two , and four derivatives , we should include more irreducible graphs , such as a two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) . \n however , we employ a rather small model space where the details of the tpep play essentially no role ; the tpep is accurately simulated by contact interactions . \n therefore , our simplification does not deteriorate the accuracy of the simulation .    in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , shown are diagonal components of @xmath16 in the momentum space . \n there is the clear model dependence among , which almost disappears after the model - space reduction down to @xmath15 = 200 mev . \n the obtained @xmath1 is accurately simulated by the opep and a few contact interactions , which we do not show here . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , diagonal components of @xmath17 ( @xmath15=200mev ) obtained from the cd - bonn potential is simulated using the opep and one or two contact interactions . \n we see that the simulation is very accurate . \n obtained in this way also accurately simulates the off - diagonal components of @xmath1 . \n @xmath0-potential @xmath18 . \n the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential . \n the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) . \n the dash - dotted curve is the opep . \n , width=283 ]     @xmath0-potential @xmath18 . \n the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential . \n the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) . \n the dash - dotted curve is the opep . \n , width=283 ] \n we have seen in the previous section that the scenario for the relation between  and  is realized . although we have shown the relation employing a rather small model space , if the tpep and higher order opep are properly included in , then the relation should hold true for a larger model space as well ; probably safe up to @xmath19 400 mev . in a certain large model space where the very details of the tpep is considerable , _ \n i.e. _ , a phenomenological model can not mimic the tpep any more , the relation may not hold true . \n we have been concerned with only the strong nucleon - nucleon interaction . however , this kind of relation probably exists also in other nuclear operators , such as electroweak currents and pion production operators . \n now , based on our result , we discuss in the following some features of neft which the traditional approach does not have ; the discussion is not always restricted to the nuclear force . \n one is that nuclear operators based on neft are constructed perturbatively . \n therefore , one can systematically improve the accuracy , and can discuss theoretical uncertainty . \n we note that , for a convergent perturbation , it is necessary to define an operator in a suitably small model space . \n we also note that the convergence of the neft - based perturbative expansion is not always good for some processes . \n another is that neft - based operators are model independent , which has been often claimed . \n however , the claim is based on the procedure of deriving the nuclear operators , which is not a quantitative argument . in this work \n , we quantitatively showed that  does not have the dependence on modelling the details of short - distance physics . \n this is a consequence of viewing the system roughly , thereby ignoring the detailed structure of the short - distance physics . \n it is noted , therefore , a description of a system based on neft is not always better than those based on phenomenological models . in many cases , they give essentially the same low - energy observables because they are equivalent through the rg . \n neft may have superiority in cases where detailed information about multi - pion exchange mechanism play an important role . \n finally , with neft , one can describe a system more efficiently and simply , compared to the phenomenological models . \n the efficiency is due to the perturbative calculation , and the simplicity is due to the ignorance of the details of the short - distance physics .    to summarize , we considered the nuclear force from the viewpoint of the rg , and showed that there exists the equivalence relation between and . \n we simultaneously showed that  does not have the model dependence due to the details of the short - distance physics , and that the simple contact interactions in  accurately describe the short - distance physics in a certain small model space . \n based on the result , we discussed the new features in neft .", "StartTimeOffset": 1245250341280, "RequestID": "f9e2dee1472b4abdb564280c1d52a886", "TotalTokens": 2715}

01 , one element of the four proposed for brahms . \n this pmt is a 20-stage device having a @xmath20 photocathode , with the segmentation defined by a @xmath21 array of @xmath22 anode elements . at the full operating voltage of 2500 volts \n , it provides a current gain of @xmath23 producing single - photon pulses large enough to be fed directly to an adc or timing electronics . \n this specific module employs a special focussing electrode ( between cathode and first dynode ) which results in a rectangular flat - topped response function @xmath24 , with a very sharp fall off at the edges . \n while the photocathode itself is quite uniform , the gain falls off a bit ( 50% ) near the edges of the array , and even more at the four corners . \n however the signal remains clean , and so the gain can be compensated in software . \n four identical drift chambers , placed in pairs upstream and dowstream of the prototype counter , provided tracking for determining the particle trajectory . \n thus , the expected position of the center of each rich ring on the phototube is determined to a resolution of approximately 500 @xmath25 m in both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions . \n in previous tests @xcite , time limitations did not permit a complete filling of the radiator volume with pure . \n our filling system was based on the difference ( factor of six ) in the molecular weights of the fluorocarbon and argon , with the heavy gas displacing the lighter one as it is brought into the bottom of the detector . in reality \n we found that even though the flow of into the detector was slow , some mixing occurs and 100% concentrations can not be reached in a single cycle . \n the measurements reported in our previous publication were done with @xmath28 and @xmath29 argon . \n this time we simply evacuated the radiator volume completely and then filled with pure . \n measurements were made for several particle momenta , over the range @xmath30 , using the ( negative ) secondary beam from the bnl ags accelerator . \n ( the momentum calibration for the beam - line was established in a separate measurement , employing time - of - flight techniques , to an accuracy of better than 0.5% ) . for each setting , \n the tracking information from four drift chambers was used to project the expected ring centers onto the pmt matrix . given this information , a ring - fitting algorithm was employed to find and fit the ring radius on an event by event basis . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : momentum_scan ] , which plots observed ring - radius versus beam momentum for particles thus identified as electrons , muons , and pions . \n the solid curves are calculated for the indicated particles , with the focal length and index of refraction as free parameters . \n both results can be seen to agree well with the known value,@xmath31 , and the calculated index of refraction ( at @xmath8 c , 1 atm @xmath32 nm ) n = 1.001379 ( this index is calculated using measurements in the liquid phase reported in @xcite ) . \n we have investigated the possibility that for larger rings ( r@xmath334.5  cm ) edge - effects may be of importance , resulting in extracted radii somewhat too small . \n for this purpose , the spherical mirror was further rotated by an additional 1@xmath34 to @xmath17=9@xmath34 . \n the projected ring center was therefore moved by 3.4  cm , such that one arc of the ring image was well inside the pmt s photocathode area . \n the results for this comparison are shown in fig . \n [ fig : momentum_scan ] for the electron data at 3  gev / c . \n as can be seen , the effect produces , at most , a minimal displacement in the direction that might have been expected . \n as remarked previously @xcite , the direct determination of the number of photons detected for a given event is precluded by the exponential shape of the pmt single - photon response function . \n instead , we have measured ( over a large number of events ) the statistical variation in the total charge collected per event . the resultant distribution ( @xmath35gaussian ) \n is then fitted to determine the measured mean ( @xmath25 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath36 ) . \n the number of detected photons ( n ) may then be estimated as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is deduced by unfolding the exponential detector response function . \n we thus estimated ( for 12 gev / c pions ) that @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 . \n the predicted behavior of the rich detector proposed for brahms has been investigated and confirmed by these additional measurements with the prototype detector , which were carried out under carefully controlled conditions . \n the imaging capabilities ( see fig .  3 ) and figure of merit @xmath41 are found to be in good agreement with expectations based on the design and performance of the individual components . \n this work was supported by u.s . \n department of energy contract number de -

{"ContextTokens": 3510, "GeneratedTokens": 250, "SynthesizedBody": "in recent years , advanced production techniques have made it possible to create metals , alloys and ceramics with grain sizes down to 5 nm . for metals , \n this represents a reduction of the grain size by approximately four orders of magnitude compared to most conventionally produced metals . \n as can be expected , such a dramatic change in the microstructure leads to significant changes in the mechanical properties of the metals . \n for example , the hardness of typical nanocrystalline metals is far higher than what is seen in their coarse - grained counterparts ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n nanocrystalline metals are an attractive group of metals to model , as the small grain size provides a `` cut - off '' of the typical length scales , where structures appear during deformation \n . in coarse - grained materials structures appear on vastly different length scales , making it very difficult to model the properties of these materials . \n the models must include processes that occur on length scales from the sub - nanometer scale of the atomic processes in dislocation cores , to the micro- or even millimeter scale of grain and subgrain structures @xcite . \n atomic - scale simulations of systems of these sizes are beyond the reach of even the most powerful of todays supercomputers . \n one is thus forced to split the system into sub - problems at different length - scales , and only treat sub - problems at the atomic scale with atomistic models . \n on coarser length scales other modeling paradigms must be used , such as dislocation dynamics and continuum plasticity calculations . \n dividing the problem into sub - problems at different length scales often results in a better understanding of the problem , as it draws attention to the structures which are relevant at a given length scale ( for example , when studying the formation of dislocation structures it is clearly more relevant to focus on dislocations as the fundamental concept rather than on individual atoms ) . \n on the other hand , one becomes dependent on this understanding , when creating the coarse - grained models , as many assumptions about the relevant phenomena at different length - scales will by necessity be built into the multi - scale model . \n the low grain size of nanocrystalline metals `` compresses '' this range of length scales to a range , where the whole deformation problem can be modeled at the atomic scale , as many grains in the polycrystalline material can be handled in an atomic - scale simulation . \n this makes it possible to perform unbiased simulations of the deformation process , where no _ a priori _ assumptions are made about the deformation mechanisms .    in recent papers \n , we have presented simulations of the plastic deformation of nanocrystalline cu and pd @xcite . \n other authors have presented simulations of the structure and elastic properties of nanocrystalline metals and semiconductors @xcite , and of the plastic deformation of ni under constant stress loading @xcite . in this paper \n we review our simulations of the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline metals , and present simulations of the effects of impurities in the grain boundaries . \n we have attempted to generate three - dimensional systems with a microstructure similar to that observed experimentally in samples generated by inert gas condensation ( igc ) . \n the grains appear to be randomly oriented , approximately equiaxed , and dislocation free . \n the grain size distribution is close to log - normal ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n we try to create systems that match this description . \n the grains are produced using a three - dimensional voronoi tesselation : random grain centers are chosen , and space is divided into regions in such a way that each region consists of the points in space closer to a given grain center than to any other grain center . \n each region is then filled with a randomly oriented fcc lattice . \n an example of a two - dimensional voronoi tessellation is shown in figure [ fig : voronoi ] . \n the generated samples are annealed for 50ps at 300k to relax the grain boundary structure . \n we found that the annealing time and temperature are uncritical , but that the properties of the system are different if _ no _ annealing is done . \n the interactions between the atoms are modeled using the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite . \n emt is a many - body potential providing a realistic description of the metallic bonding , in particular in face - centered cubic ( fcc ) metals and alloys of fcc metals . \n computationally , emt is not much more demanding than pair potentials , but provide a significantly more realistic description of the metallic bonding . \n the systems were deformed using a molecular dynamics ( md ) procedure . \n a conventional md simulation was performed , but at each timestep the atomic coordinates in the pulling direction ( the @xmath0 coordinates ) were rescaled in order to deform the system gradually . at the same time , the box dimensions in the transverse directions are allowed to shrink to keep the transversal components of the stress ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) close to zero @xcite . \n the change in system dimensions is slow at the timescale of the simulation , the relative elongation is @xmath3 each timestep . with a timestep of 5 fs , this nevertheless results in a very high strain rate ( @xmath4 ) . \n the results presented here are not very sensitive to the strain rate , although some dependence is seen ( typical stresses increase by 20% when the strain rate is changed from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) @xcite . \n +    figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the deformation of a typical sample with an average grain size of 5.21 nm . \n the atoms have been color coded according to the local crystal structure @xcite . \n white atoms are in local fcc order , and thus situated inside the grains . \n light grey atoms are in local hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) order , these atoms are at stacking faults . \n atoms in all other local environments are colored dark grey . \n these are typically atoms at grain boundaries and in dislocation cores . \n some dislocation activity is seen in the system , as witnessed by the generation of stacking faults . \n the dislocation activity is not sufficient to account for the observed plastic deformation . \n a detailed analysis of the deformation shows that the main deformation mode is sliding in the grain boundaries @xcite .    as the volume fraction of atoms in the grain boundary increases with decreasing grain size \n , one would expect that increasing the grain size increases the strength of the material as long as the grain boundaries remain the carriers of the deformation . \n this is indeed what we see in the simulations . \n figure [ fig : stress ] shows the stress - strain curves obtained from simulations of systems with various average grain sizes . a `` reverse hall - petch effect '' , i.e. a softening of the material with decreasing grain size , \n is observed . \n the simulations of the deformation of nanocrystalline metals show a reverse hall - petch effect in cu and pd for the grain sizes studied . \n this softening of the material , when the grain size is reduced is caused by plastic deformation in the grain boundaries . \n there appears to be two different deformation mechanisms active at different grain sizes . in metals with the very small grain sizes studied here , the dominating deformation mechanism is sliding in the grain boundaries through a large number of essentially uncorrelated events , where a few atoms move with respect to each other at each event @xcite .    at much coarser grain sizes , \n dislocations are known to be the dominating carriers of deformation . \n in that regime , a hardening of the material is seen , when the grain size is reduced , as the grain boundaries act as barriers to the dislocation motion . \n experimentally , this behavior is seen to continue far down into the nanocrystalline range . \n as the grain size is reduced , dislocation - mediated deformation becomes more and more difficult . on the other hand , the volume fraction of the grain boundaries increases , favoring a deformation mechanism where the grain boundaries carry the deformation . \n furthermore , as the grain size is approaching the grain boundary thickness , it becomes geometrically easier for slip to occur on more than one grain boundary , without large stress concentrations where the grain boundaries meet @xcite . \n the emerging picture is one where two deformation mechanisms compete . \n one is active at very small grain sizes , another at larger grain sizes . \n this leads to a maximum in the yield stress and hardness of nanocrystalline metals at intermediate grain sizes , see figure [ fig : maximum ] . \n there have been many reports in the literature of a `` reverse hall - petch effect '' at sufficiently small grain sizes . however , the hardness measurements are very sensitive to sample defects , and in particular to sample porosity @xcite . in high - quality cu samples , the hall - petch effect is seen to continue at least down to grain sizes around 15 nm @xcite \n .    there does not appear to be any _ unequivocal _ experimental evidence for a reverse hall - petch relationship in porosity free nanocrystalline metals . \n there are , however , indications of a break - down of the ordinary hall - petch relation at grain sizes below 15 nm in high quality copper samples produced by inert gas condensation @xcite . \n the ordinary hall - petch effect appears to cease , although a reverse hall - petch relation is not seen . \n it is still difficult to make direct comparisons between simulations and experiment , as there is little overlap in grain size . \n as the experimental techniques improve , there is hope that more experimental data will be gathered on high - quality samples with grain sizes below 1015 nm . \n it should then become clear if the hall - petch effect does indeed break down at these grain sizes . at the same time , computer simulations of larger systems might lead to observations of the cross - over region between the reverse and the ordinary hall - petch effect . that cross - over region is beyond the reach of the largest simulations presented here . \n the grain boundaries remain the main carriers of the deformation even when the grain size is increased to 13.2 nm , but be _ do _ observe a slight increase in dislocation activity as the grain size is increased . \n as the main deformation mechanism is sliding in the grain boundaries , it could be expected that altering the structure and composition of the grain boundaries might have an effect on the properties of the material . \n one such modification is the addition of impurity atoms in the grain boundaries . \n we have chosen to study the effects of silver impurities . \n a reason for choosing silver was that silver and copper are immiscible , low concentrations of silver impurities in nanocrystalline copper can therefore be expected to segregate to the grain boundaries . we have not studied the segregation process itself , as it is beyond the scope of this study . \n segregation is a slow , diffusional process that can not be studied directly with md simulations due to the timescales involved . \n other approaches ( such as monte carlo or kinetic monte carlo simulations ) may be more appropriate . \n instead of simulating the segregation process , we have generated systems that model nanocrystalline copper after such a segregation has occurred . \n it is done by replacing 25% of the atoms in the grain boundaries with silver atoms , see figure [ fig : initag ] . \n the system is then annealed and deformed in the same way as the pure systems . \n +   +    figure [ fig : compare ] shows how the stress - strain curves have changed , when silver is introduced in the grain boundaries . \n the general trend seems to be a slight softening of the material , although the effect is very weak and not seen in all systems . \n figure [ fig : flowstress ] shows the flow stress levels for the different simulations , i.e.  the stress level at the horizontal part of the stress - strain curve ( for simplicity the flow stress was defined as the average stress for @xmath7 ) . \n we again see the tendency for the silver - containing systems to be softer .    in the simulations of impurities in the grain boundaries , the mechanical behavior is close to what is seen in the pure systems . \n as the major part of the deformation happens in the grain boundaries , one could expect that adding impurities in the grain boundaries could have a relatively large effect on the mechanical properties . \n the simulations presented here show that this is not the case , when silver is used as impurities in copper . \n we see a tendency towards a weakening of the material , but the effect is barely detectable . \n the atomic bonding in copper and silver are of a similar nature , and the size of the atoms are not very different . \n this may account for the absence of a stronger effect of alloying in the grain boundaries . \n atomic - scale simulations have been used to study the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline copper with and without impurities in the grain boundaries . in both cases , we find that the main deformation mode is sliding in the grain boundaries through a large number of apparently uncorrelated events , each involving only a few atoms . \n some dislocation activity is seen in the grains , the dislocations are probably necessary to allow the grains to deform a little , as they glide past each other . \n we observe a _ reverse hall - petch effect _ , \n i.e.  a hardening of the material as the grain size is increased : as the amount of grain boundary atoms is decreased , the deformation becomes harder . at the same time \n the dislocation activity is seen to increase a little with grain size . \n this effect is seen in the entire range of grain sizes that we have studied ( 3 to 13 nm ) , but at some point we expect that dislocation motion will begin to dominate the behavior of the system . \n when that happens , the yield strength should begin to _ decrease _ with increasing grain size . \n adding silver to the grain boundaries has only a weak effect on the properties of the material . \n the strength of the material is seen to decrease marginally , when the silver is introduced . \n we expect that other elements , which chemically behave in a way that is more different from copper will have a larger effect , but such simulations remain to be made . \n this work was financed by the danish technical research council through grant no . \n parallel computer time was financed by the danish research councils through grant no . \n center for atomic -

{"ContextTokens": 3227, "GeneratedTokens": 112, "SynthesizedBody": "in the recent years physicists have shown increasing interest in examining the statistical properties of real market financial data @xcite and they have contributed to the extraction of the most important characteristics which are referred to as `` stylized facts '' @xcite . \n such stylized facts include fat tailed distribution and short time correlations for the logarithmic returns , volatility clustering , gain - loss asymmetry , etc .    to deepen our understanding of financial markets building models is essential . \n one approach is constructing purely mathematical models ( e.g. , arch and garch processes which are well known to and widely used by economists @xcite ) . \n another way which is more appealing for statistical physicists is that of the so - called multi - agent models . \n these are based on interacting agents using different strategies corresponding to real market behavior . \n the simplest of these models are probably the so - called `` minority games '' ( e.g. , the `` el farol bar '' model @xcite ) . \n such rather abstract models are appropriate to capture main mechanisms but a detailed correspondence to economics is hard to find . \n an example for more complicated models based on both economical and physical approaches is that introduced by lux and marchesi @xcite . in this model \n a relatively large number of parameters enables to incorporate several aspects of real financial processes . \n it is well known that prices on financial markets ( particularly on stock markets ) tend to fluctuate in a broad range . \n it has for long been a major goal of economists to understand the cause of these fluctuations , rises , and drops @xcite . \n experts seem to be puzzled by the fact that sometimes price changes can be easily traced back to well defined external effects like news about political events , announcements of dramatic economic data etc . , while in many cases there is no apparent reason for the major fluctuations .    in statistical physics \n we distinguish between statistical fluctuations and changes due to external perturbations . \n if time reversal symmetry ( or detailed balance ) holds for the system like at thermal equilibrium , the famous fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that spontaneous fluctuations and the response to small perturbations decay in the same way . \n of course , the condition of detailed balance does not hold for financial markets . \n even statitionarity can be questioned and the time reversal symmetry is broken , e.g. , agents want to maximize profit and tend to switch to winning strategies . \n the goal of our study is to compare fluctuations and response to external effects on financial markets . in order to have a clear cut situation we investigate the the lux - marchesi model . \n the ability of the model to reproduce important stylized facts together with the relative robustness of this property when changing the parameters induced us to compare the fluctuations and response ( to fundamental price changes ) within this framework . \n we sincerely hope that our major results hold for real market data as well . \n let us start with summarizing the basic features of the lux - marchesi single asset  multi agent model . \n one of the main assumptions is that there exists a fundamental price @xmath0 of stocks ( the value of the company and its prospective future growth ) around which the real price fluctuates . in this model \n the agents are let to choose among the three following strategies : optimists ( who buy whatever happens ) , pessimists ( who sell ) , and fundamentalist ( who sell if the market price is above the fundamental price and vice versa ) . \n optimists and pessimists together are called chartists according to the usual terminology . \n the number of all agents is @xmath1 , of which the number of fundamentalists is @xmath2 , that of optimists @xmath3 , @xmath4 for pessimists , and @xmath5 for chartists . \n the opinion index : @xmath6 measures to what extent optimistic strategy dominates among the chartists . the aggregate excess demand of the agents for the stocks is computed as following :    @xmath7    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.5 cm    tab . \n 2 : values of the parameters in the four different parameter sets @xcite    during our work we found that in the lux - marchesi model the autocorrelation of volatility shows exponential decay instead of a power - law time dependence in contradiction to the general view on real market data @xcite . \n the power - law decay is usually attributed to some kind of scale - invariance ( regarding time ) in financial markets ( fig . \n [ acf ] ) implying that real markets are in a critical state , which we could not find in the lux - marchesi model even though we tried varying the parameters in a broad range . \n nevertheless , the phenomenon of volatility clustering is described by the model resulting in large characteristic times of the autocorrelation function which show that the model captures important aspects of the market . \n some other problems regarding the thermodynamic limit ( tdl ) of the model were pointed out earlier @xcite . \n we think that these are irrelevant from our point of view since real markets ( and our simulations ) are far from the tdl and the time scale of the mentioned effect is bigger then that of studied fluctuations and response . \n the dynamics of the model implies that there are continuous fluctuations around the fundamental price . \n we examined the decay of these fluctuations using the following simple method : when the price rose to @xmath8 we defined this as a fluctuation and observed the average decay for many runs . \n hence we did not try to determine whether the price really sank after reaching @xmath9 assuming that ( at least at bigger fluctuations ) the probability of further rise is much smaller than that of further decline . \n we observed exponential decay for the price fluctuations using all parameter sets in accordance with the well known fast decay of the correlation function . \n detailed simulations were undertaken for parameter set iv ( fig . \n [ flukt1]a ) . \n furthermore , in case of relatively large fluctuations we observed that the opinion index and the fraction of chartists significantly differed from their average values and exponential decay was observed for both quantities . \n the characteristic time of the decay of the price decreased with the size of fluctuation and was in the order of magnitude of 1 time unit ( up to fluctuations of 4 ) ( fig . \n [ flukt1]b ) . \n the opinion index decayed with approximately the same characteristic time . \n on the other hand the fraction of chartists ( which is closely related to volatility ) decayed much slower with characteristic times in the order of magnitude of 100 time units . \n to @xmath10 price units as a function of time , ( b ) average characteristic time of decay as a function of the size of decay ( data points computed as an average of 7625 to 120529 fluctuations ) ]    an interesting question is what causes fluctuations . in our simulations we tried to find an answer by computing the average opinion index and the average fraction of chartists that caused a fluctuation as the function of the size of the fluctuation . \n we found that small fluctuations are caused merely by the lack of balance inside the chartist community ( fig . \n [ flukt2]a ) while larger fluctuations are likely to occur only if the fraction of chartists to all agents rises as well ( fig . \n [ flukt2]b ) resulting in a higher market volatility @xcite ) . in other words \n the fluctuation in the agents behaviors results in high volatility , i.e. in a nervous market which occasionally leads to major deviations from the fundamental price . \n however , in such cases the attractive force of the fundamental price does not show up abruptly , since the re - stabilization of the equilibrium price has to be accompanied by a gradual restoration of the balance between chartists and fundamentalists . \n it is well known that financial markets are exposed to many external effects from the outside world . \n this means that the changes in prices are only partly due to the inherent market mechanisms ( fluctuations around `` equilibrium '' ) , changes can also be caused by news from the outside world ( e.g. financial reports ; bankruptcy ; death of important personalities ; outbreak of war ; terror attacks , etc . ) . \n the analysis of real market data from the point of view of external news is a highly non - trivial task . on the one hand , it is difficult to set an independent level of `` importance '' of news in our age of information explosion ; furthermore , the effects of different news may overlap . on the other hand , \n the reaction of the market to the news is also hard to tell . \n the situation is much simpler in an artificial market like the lux - marchesi model where we can immediately change the fundamental value of a company or asset ( which would be in reality a consequence of the external event ) . \n in our simulation we changed the fundamental price from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and examined the average of many runs as a function of time that has passed since the event . in the computer program we solved the averaging by raising the fundamental price by @xmath13 for 100 time steps and then decreasing it to the original value , after another 100 time units we raised it again etc . \n this means we used a rectangular function ( @xmath14-like function ) to perturb the system and recorded the average response ( fig . \n [ eses2]a ) . \n what we saw in case of @xmath15 is an abrupt drop in market price ( the speed of which was only limited by the minimum time step of the model ) followed by an overshoot . \n economists and traders have long known that a correction exists after a very fast price change(fig . \n [ eses1 ] ) . \n a sad example for this was the reaction of the european stock markets to the terror attack on new york on the 11th september . \n the prices dropped fast that day ( generally losses over 10 % were recorded ) but the next day there was already an upward moving trend ( a correction after the overreaction of the events ) . \n we used two different parameter sets ( ii and iv ) to check whether the occurrence overshoot or its shape depend on the parameters and saw that it is a rather robust effect . \n a detailed survey of the phenomenon was undertaken using parameter set iv . \n we saw that the speed of the drop in price was only limited by the model ( this means a maximum of 0.05 price drop in 0.01 time steps ) . \n another interesting result is that ( in case of a price drop ) the location of the price minimum in time is independent of the price drop @xmath16 for a wide range of @xmath16 ( for parameter set iv the price minimum is located at approximately @xmath17 time units up to price drops of 10% ) . \n this means that on average one can predict when the minimum of the price occurs ( if one knows the parameters of the market ) irrespective of how big the fundamental price change @xmath16 is . \n let us define the magnitude @xmath18 of the overshoot as the difference of the price minimum and the new equilibrium price ( which equals the fundamental price after the event ) . \n @xmath18 shows linear dependence on the fundamental price change @xmath16 in a wide range of @xmath16-s ( up to a 10% abrupt fundamental price change , which is already huge on market scales ) ( fig . [ \n eses2]b ) . \n when examining the cause of overshoots within the model , the explanation is at hand : during the sudden drop of the price the proportion of pessimists rises sharply within the chartists . on the other hand , \n the fraction of chartists among all dealers does not change . \n this means that the overshoot is caused only by the movements inside the chartist `` community '' . \n when the price first reaches the new equilibrium state , the fraction of pessimists is still very high which implies the further drop of price , resulting in the overshoot . \n furthermore the opinion index decays to zero ( after a sharp drop immediately after the event ) exponentially . \n the main result of the presented simulations is that in the lux - marchesi model of financial markets fluctuations and response to external perturbations ( events ) decay in a significantly different manner . \n spontaneous fluctuations decay with a relatively long characteristic time while the response to external events is practically immediate and followed by an overshoot . \n the absence of the validity of the onsager hypothesis for this model ( and for financial markets in general ) is not at all surprising since the continuous competition for profit ( better payoffs ) works so as to undermine the detailed balance and time reversal symmetry . \n the violation of the time reversal symmetry has further consequences as well , like the assymetry of the time dependant cross correlations between different stocks @xcite . \n the investigation of the opinion index and the fraction of chartists in case of fluctuations and responses showed that the decay mechanisms are indeed different : large spontaneous deviations from the equilibrium price occur in highly volatile markets which are accompanied by an increase of the ratio of chartists ( pessimists and optimists ) as compared to fundamentalists . \n the reaction of the market to an external change of the fundamental price is mainly governed by the shift in the ratio of the optimists and pessimists inside the group of chartists . \n the consequence of the latter is a well defined and rather robust overshoot in the price . \n the characteristic time is short and the size of the overshoot is small indicating that the market tries to adjust to the new situation effectively , however , at the same time , the phenomenon itself shows the limitations of this efficiency . \n we have demonstrated that it is worth and possible to investigate the effect of external perturbations and spontaneous fluctuations separately in a model market . \n it would be most interesting to try to identify the origins of deviations from average behavior on real market data . \n clearly , several difficulties have to be faced when trying to distinguish between the two mentioned mechanisms : the motivation of the agents is hidden , changes are not necessarily such abrupt as in the model , insider information may influence the pattern @xcite , effects of different news overlap , large fluctuations cover the overall behavior , etc . nevertheless , we believe that our study gives a hint how to approach this problem . \n thanks are due to thomas lux for correspondence . \n furthermore we kindly thank lszl kullmann for his advice and jnos trk for his help concerning the computer simulations and other computer related problems . \n support of otka t029985 is also acknowledged .", "StartTimeOffset": 1304336901866, "RequestID": "db7d2505b1674642a5e957def507b9e8", "TotalTokens": 3339}

degree modes can be useful in interpreting the conditions in the convection zone . in this context , we investigate the response of these modes to the period of minimum activity and compare the response with the previous one . \n the analysis presented here uses @xmath0-mode frequencies , @xmath1 , obtained from the global oscillation network group ( gong ) in the 3 mhz band . \n it utilizes 21 36-day non -

f ) . \n the other indices ( sunspot number , radio flux and the strength of sunspots ) have major contribution from the strong component . \n the weakest correlation is found for the field strength of sunspots which is only influenced by strong fields . \n these findings are in agreement with an earlier study of local modes where inclusion of the weak component of the magnetic field was found to be necessary to explain the frequency shifts during the minimal - activity phase of the solar cycle @xcite . \n although frequency shifts are known to vary in phase with the solar activity , we find an unusual trend during the current minimum . \n solar activity shows an upward trend in the last quarter of 2008 while the shifts continue to decrease for the period considered in this analysis ( for example figure  1d ) this anti - correlation was not seen in the minimum between cycles 22 and 23 . \n @xcite have interpreted the anti - correlation between low - degree frequency shifts from golf , and 10.7 cm radio flux as a signature of the onset of the new solar cycle . \n however , their analysis suggests the onset of cycle 24 at the end of 2007 which is not supported by our analysis of intermediate - degree modes .    since the magnetic activity related to a new solar cycle emerges first at mid - latitudes , it is possible to follow the changes in oscillation modes as a function of the latitude using different values of @xmath8 . for @xmath8=1 , \n the modes are sensitive to the regions near equator while @xmath8=0 represents modes at higher - latitudes . \n figure  2 shows the mean variation in frequency shifts , @xmath9 , at selected values of @xmath8 representing the changes at mid / active - latitudes . as seen earlier , the frequencies are lower during current minimum and continue to decrease with time . \n the lowest value in the left panels coincides with the minimum between cycles 22 and 23 providing a reasonable estimate of the solar minimum . although we do not see an increase in frequencies yet , the shifts for last two data points in figures  2b and 2d are comparable . \n it might be an indication that the activity minimum has been reached in late 2008 , however , the addition of more data sets is crucial to unveil the clear picture of the onset of solar cycle 24 . \n it is worth mentioning that the minimum seen in intermediate - degree mode frequencies will be much later than the late 2007 as reported by @xcite . \n the oscillation frequencies can be further used to infer characteristics of the solar interior . the migrating zonal flow pattern , known as the torsional oscillation , is obtained by inverting the global mode frequencies @xcite . \n the analysis shows that the flow band associated with the new cycle has been found moving more slowly toward the equator than that observed during the previous minimum and suggests the length of solar cycle 23 to be approximately 12 years .    by using local helioseismology techniques \n , we can also study the meridional circulation in the solar interior . \n this extended solar minimum has given us the unprecedented opportunity to study the evolution of subsurface meridional flows without contamination from surface magnetic activity . \n a preliminary analysis of continuous gong data using the ring - diagram technique suggests the formation of meridional flow  bumps \" under the solar surface at high latitudes before the surface activity appears . \n detailed results will be presented in an upcoming paper @xcite . \n the analysis based on the technique of time - distance shows that the travel time of acoustic waves varies during the solar cycle and it decreases due to the presence of active regions . \n it is seen that there are no significant changes at high latitudes , while travel times at low latitudes are decreased by about 2 seconds during the maximum activity phase . \n the travel times during 2006 -

{"ContextTokens": 3735, "GeneratedTokens": 268, "SynthesizedBody": "standardized assessment tests that allow researchers to compare the performance of students taught according to various curricula are highly desirable . \n such comparisons provide information about the effectiveness of different curricula and , as a result , can improve methods of teaching , learning trajectories and , ultimately , student learning . appropriately designed diagnostics not only reveals common student difficulties but can also help to determine to what extent students understand the content .    as of the present day \n , there are several research - based conceptual tests that serve as instruments to assess and identify students difficulties in lower - division courses ( e.g. , the force concept inventory @xcite , the conceptual survey of e&m @xcite , the basic electricity and magnetism survey @xcite ) . \n data from these tests help to determine , among other things , where students lack a conceptual understanding of the material and help to correlate this with various methods of teaching . \n it also allows teachers and researchers to find out if these difficulties are present more universally .    at the upper -

division electrodynamics test @xcite , the quantum mechanics assessment tool @xcite , the survey of quantum mechanics concepts @xcite ) . \n these upper - division assessments are relatively new and thus they have only been employed at a few institutions .    in the paradigms in physics program at osu , we instituted a radical reform of all the upper - division physics courses that led to extensive reordering of the content . in traditional curricula , courses focus on a particular subfield of physics ( e.g. , classical mechanics , electricity and magnetism , quantum mechanics ) . at osu , courses  called paradigms \n revolve around concepts underlying those fields ( e.g. , energy , symmetry , forces , wave motion ) . \n therefore , the content is arranged differently  in e&m we spend more time on direct integration and curvilinear coordinates , less time on separation of variables , we cover potentials before electric fields and magnetostatics in vacuum before electrostatics in matter . \n the gravitational analogue of electrostatics is covered at the same time as electrostatics rather than in a classical mechanics course . \n moreover , we use a large variety of active engagement strategies , such as individual small whiteboard questions , small group problem - solving , computer visualization and kinesthetic activities @xcite . \n the paradigms courses , taken in the junior year , are then followed by capstone courses , which have a more traditional , lecture - based structure . our students thus represent an important test case to examine the versatility of new assessment tools . in this paper \n , we will focus on the colorado upper - division electrostatics diagnostic @xcite . \n we have found significant value in this new assessment tool . using the cue in our own classes \n has already pointed out several possibilities for the improvement of the curriculum at osu . \n however , this new measure is still in the developmental stage and requires some fine tuning when used outside the university of colorado . \n our goal is to help generalize the cue to be accessible and relevant at a range of institutions . \n c c c || c & senior courses + fall & winter & spring & fall +    ' '' ''    & & & + \n the cue was originally designed as a free -

level e&m over a period of 5 years ( from 2009 to 2013 ) . at the beginning of the fall term of each year , junior - level students enrolled in symmetries and idealizations paradigm ( ph320 ) took the full cue pre - test ( see table  [ tab : course_desc ] for the osu course schedule and figure  [ fig : emscheme ] for a timeline of the cue at osu and cu ) . \n the same group of students was given the mid - test ( a subset of 12 post - test questions we chose to conform to our course goals ) at the end of the static vector fields paradigm ( ph422/522 ) . \n in the following year , those students who successfully finished their junior year were again given two tests within the electromagnetism capstone course ( ph 431 ) . \n there was a second mid - test at the beginning of the term ( with the same set of 12 questions as in the first mid - test ) and the full cue post - test at the end of the term . \n the necessity of introducing the mid - test arose due to the different course structure at osu . since not everything that the cue tests is covered by the end of the fall quarter \n , the results from a full cue post - test would not have been appropriate . \n we also note that , although osu students have had more contact hours in e&m ( 72 hours ) at the time they take the post - test than cu students ( 45 hours ) , most of the additional hours are on the more advanced content from e&m(ii ) at cu . \n the cue post - test was administered three times between the fall term of 2010 and the fall term of 2013 ( with the exclusion of the fall term of 2012 ) . \n the timing of the test was consistent throughout that period  each time it was given in the last week of the term . \n a total number of @xmath1 students took the cue post - test , out of whom two students were excluded from the research ( one student was a member of the per group at osu and participated in meetings where the cue was discussed , the other student took only some of osu s e&m courses and therefore did not take a sequence of at least two tests ) . \n students at osu scored on average @xmath2 ( compared to @xmath3 at cu reported in ref . \n @xcite ) , with the spread of their performance ranging from about @xmath4 to @xmath5 . to provide a measure of student improvement over time we used the ( non-)normalized gain proposed in ref . \n the normalized gain is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain to the maximum possible average gain , @xmath6 where by @xmath7 we denote the average score of a given student from the subset of post - test questions which match the pre - test problems . for the @xmath8 students who took both the pre- and post - tests \n , we found an average normalized gain of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 non - normalized . ] ) , which is similar to gains of @xmath11 ( normalized ) and @xmath12 ( non - normalized ) reported in ref . \n thus , although students at osu on the average scored about @xmath13 lower than students at cu on both the pre- and post - tests at osu ( for @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 at cu ( for @xmath16 ) , see ref . \n , they showed similar learning _ \n gains _ to students from other institutions taught in per - based courses and higher gain than were observed in standard lecture - based courses ( see figure 7 in ref . \n @xcite ) . \n figure  [ fig : post_total ] shows comparison of the average performance on each question between students from osu ( blue dotted plot ) and cu ( purple hatched plot ) . \n one of the most striking features of this plot is the similarity of the overall pattern of students scores  both on the high- and low - scored questions . with the exception of two questions ( q1 and q15 ) \n , the averages agree to within @xmath17 on the first 12 questions and to within @xmath18 thereafter . \n it is also worth noting that , despite the low number of students taking the cue post - test in individual years , this pattern is still preserved when we plot the average scores of each question by year . \n this affirms the reliability of the cue across the two very different curricula . \n moreover , the surprisingly low average scores on some questions from both institutions suggest that the cue is a very challenging test in general , regardless of the curriculum . \n although the overall pattern in figure  [ fig : post_total ] from both institutions is very similar , there are some significant differences that need to be addressed . in particular , osu students scores differ by over @xmath19 on question q1 regarding finding the potential @xmath20 ( or field @xmath21 ) inside an insulating sphere and by almost @xmath22 on question q15 regarding selecting boundary conditions to solve for the potential @xmath23 on a charged spherical surface . for reference \n , the full problems are reproduced in figure  [ fig : q1+q15 ] . \n both of these questions are intended to test whether students can set up the solution to a problem involving partial differential equations ( i.e , recognizing separation of variables as an appropriate problem - solving technique and/or defining appropriate boundary conditions ) @xcite . to address these discrepancies \n we now look more closely at the learning goals for courses at osu .        in a traditional curriculum , \n as defined by the standard e&m text by david griffiths @xcite , students are first exposed to the application of separation of variables in physics in their e&m course , before they take quantum mechanics . at osu , however , students are exposed to the separation of variables mainly in the context of the schrdinger equation  first in the waves in one dimension paradigm and in the central forces paradigm in the winter term of the junior year and then in the mathematical methods capstone in the fall term of the senior year . \n separation of variables is being discussed in multiple courses before students take the capstone in e&m and thus not much time is devoted to this topic in the e&m capstone . to be precise , \n there is only one day ( typically the second day of the first week ) spent on laplace s equation , followed by 2 or 3 homework problems . as a consequence , students have much more experience with separation of variables in the context of quantum mechanics , long before they see it as part of e&m , and even then the structure of the capstone does not provide them with many opportunities to practice it in the e&m context . \n low scores on the two other questions involving separation of variables and boundary conditions ( bcs ) : q11 ( finding bcs in a specific scenario ) and q13 ( recognizing the form of solutions that match given bcs ) supports our suspicion that students are not getting enough exposure to these topics in the context of e&m . \n due to the significantly restructured curriculum at osu , our findings provide valuable data for comparison with reported results from cu s more moderately reformed curriculum and from institutions with a more traditional ( lecture ) format . \n it is intriguing that the across curricula difficulty pattern for most questions is preserved , even though the sample of students is quite different . \n this result confirms the overall robustness of the cue . \n in addition , strong differences in scores on a few specific questions shows that this assessment test is capable of helping to distinguish between different programs of study and uncovering important gaps in a curriculum . \n it is crucial to understand the causes for the big discrepancies between osu and cu scores on q1 and q15 . as we indicated above , one of the reasons \n might be the current organization of courses at osu . \n while restructuring the junior- and senior -

{"ContextTokens": 2790, "GeneratedTokens": 376, "SynthesizedBody": "the idea of using a corrugated structure as a  dechirper \" in a linac - based x - ray fel was first proposed in ref . \n the idea was to use a passive device to remove residual energy chirp in the beam before it enters the undulator for lasing . \n the original report considered a round structure . \n however , to allow for adjustability , it was next proposed to use a corrugated structure in flat geometry . \n but because of an unavoidable quadrupole wake excited in flat geometry , the structure is best built in two halves , with one half rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other , in order to , in principle , have the quad wake forces cancel . \n such structures have been built by radiabeam and tested , first at pohang  @xcite and more recently at the linac coherent light souce ( lcls )  @xcite,@xcite . \n the radiabeam / lcls dechirper is the first one that has been tested at high energies ( multi gev ) and short bunch lengths ( 10 s of microns ) .    for a nominal set of parameters for the lcls , the dominant wavelength of the wakefields @xmath0  mm  ( see _ \n @xcite ) . the full bunch length , however , is normally small , @xmath1  @xmath2 m . \n thus , we can expect that a model of the longitudinal ( steady - state ) wake that assumes that it is constant and equal to its value at the origin can be used to approximate the wake effects of the beam in such machines . \n the real wake will drop from the origin  ( see @xcite ) , and such a model will give a maximum bound of the wake , one that becomes more accurate as the bunch becomes shorter ( assuming it is not so short that the transient component of the wake becomes significant ) . \n for the transverse wake , equal to zero at the origin , we use an approximation of a linear function with the constant slope equal to that at the origin . \n we will see that , compared to numerically calculating the wakes , we gain by obtaining simple analytical functions that show us the structure of the wakes . \n the calculation of wakes of corrugated structures has been performed for round structures , assuming small corrugations and using perturbation methods  @xcite , @xcite . the same has been done for flat geometry  @xcite.time domain simulations have been performed for more accurate results , particularly when the corrugation parameters are not small compared to the dechirper gap  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n more recently , a detailed analysis of the radiabeam / lcls dechirper has been performed using field matching methods  @xcite . finally , in ref . \n @xcite , for the case of flat geometry and assuming the impedance can be characterized by a surface impedance , equations for the _ generalized _ wakefields , valid for arbitrary bunch length , are derived . by \n generalized \" we mean ( point charge ) wake functions for which the transverse positions of driving and test particles are arbitrary , and are not limited to being near the symmetry plane . \n we begin the present report with the results of  @xcite and obtain the values at the origin of the ( generalized ) longitudinal wake and the slope of the transverse wakes . \n that is enough to obtain an approximation to the energy loss and kick experienced by a pencil beam ( one with no transverse extent ) . \n there is some interest in using a dechirper as a fast kicker , by passing a beam close to one jaw ( see _ e.g. _ \n @xcite , @xcite ) , and the case of the beam near the wall is automatically included . \n then , assuming that the transverse beam sizes are small compared to the gap , we derive perturbation solutions of the wakes , valid over a small neighborhood around the beam centroid . \n this allows us to find wake effects like slice energy spread increase and projected emittance growth . \n next , we briefly investigate the accuracy of our model . \n we finally end with conclusions . in the appendix \n , we give a more accurate derivation , than found in @xcite , of the flat geometry wakes for arbitrary bunch lengths . \n representative beam and machine parameters for the lcls , which will be used in example calculations in this report , are given in table  i. note that the entire radiabeam / lcls dechirper assembly comprises two 2-m - long sections , one oriented horizontally , the other vertically . \n the wakes are given here in cgs units ; to convert to mks one merely needs to multiply by @xmath3 , with @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the speed of light . \n wakefield induced energy loss , however , has been converted to mks units , for convenience . \n .selected beam and machine properties ( at the dechirper ) used in example calculations . \n this is a typical combination of parameters found in ref . \n the longitudinal bunch distribution is taken to be uniform . \n in the current lattice , the first ( second ) dechirper is vertically ( horizontally ) orientated , with positive ( negative ) @xmath7 . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2_tab ] \n we began with general expressions for the wakefields in a corrugated structure dechiper with flat geometry , derived in  @xcite . \n we took the limits of short bunch length and obtained simplified , approximate expressions for the longitudinal and transverse wakefields , functions that are reasonably accurate for the type of bunch lengths used in _ \n e.g. _ the lcls . \n we then used these functions to obtain , for a short bunch passing through a dechirper : the energy loss as function of gap , the transverse kick as function of beam offset , the slice energy spread , and the emittance growth of the beam . \n we performed a thick lens calculation of emittance growth for the two - dechirper system applied to representative lcls bunch and machine parameters and found that the cancellation does indeed work ; the final projected emittance growth is modest : @xmath8 ( 1.12 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . \n we briefly investigated the accuracy of our model , and find that it overestimates the wakes by @xmath1130% for the type of parameters considered in this study ( in particular , full bunch length @xmath12  @xmath2 m and dechirper half - gap @xmath13  mm and the bunch on axis ) . for shorter bunches the model becomes more accurate .    in the appendix \n we perform a more accurate derivation of the general wake solution for the dechirper ( the starting point of the main work of this report ) than found in ref . \n we find that the results of @xcite are valid provided that the bunch length over half gap , @xmath14 , is small , which is indeed the parameter regime of interest . \n although in our example calculation the emittance increase was modest , and the cancellation of emittance growth using the two dechirper sections was effective , we would like to point out that large emittance growth is not far away in parameter space , especially if the gap is decreased ( note the @xmath15 dependence in eq . \n [ epsf_eq ] ) . \n for example , if in the example calculation above we reduce the energy from @xmath16  gev to @xmath17  gev , and the half gap @xmath13  mm to 0.5  mm , we find that @xmath18 . for this example we obtain a large emttance growth for the full , two dechirper , thick lens calculation : @xmath19 ( 2.5 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . \n finally , we would like to emphasize that although we started with a surface impedance , the surface impedance itself never is part of the solution . \n this means that the results given here are valid not only for the corrugated pipe dechirper , but rather for _ any _ structure with flat geometry where the impedance can be described by a surface impedance . \n such problems include the resistive wall , the shallow corrugated structure ( often used as a model for surface roughness ) , and a metallic pipe lined with a thin dielectric layer . \n the only condition for their applicability is that the bunch lengths of interest are small compared to the characteristic distance of the problem . \n we thank : the team commissioning the radiabeam / lcls dechirper , led by r. iverson , for showing us how the dechirper affects the beam in practice ;

ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( see e.g. kouveliotou et al . \n @xcite ; mereghetti & stella  @xcite ) \n . the new class of pulsars with the very strong magnetic field ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) are most likely candidates of _ magnetars _ \n ( e.g. thompson & duncan  @xcite ) and may be worth studying further . in the future , we may find a more extreme case , that is , a rapidly rotating relativistic star with a strong magnetic field . \n most stars have spherically symmetric structure . \n they are however deformed due to the rapid rotation and the strong magnetic field . \n it is well known that both effects produce a flattening equilibrium star . \n we will examine them within general relativity . \n these effects are assumed to be small and treated as perturbations to spherically symmetric stars . \n the rotational axis of pulsars does not in general coincide with the axis of the dipole magnetic field . \n the relativistic treatments for the case is a complicated task , because the situation is not stationary . in this paper , however , we assume that the rotational effect decouples from the magnetic effect . \n thus we consider the deformation arising from each perturbation separately and estimate the ellipticity . \n the estimate is important to judge which effect dominates in the rotating magnetized stars , whose rotation rate and the magnetic field are in a wide range . \n our treatment is beyond the classical estimate in the newtonian gravity , and give better comparison of the rotational effect and the magnetic effect on star deformation for various pulsars . when either of them is huge , our estimate breaks down , and sophisticated numerical codes are required ( see e.g. bocquet et al . \n @xcite ; bonazzola & gourgoulhon @xcite ) . \n the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we briefly review deformation of stars due to the rotation ( chandrasekhar @xcite ; chandrasekhar & roberts @xcite ) and the magnetic field ( chandrasekhar & fermi @xcite ; ferraro @xcite ; galtsov et al . \n @xcite ; galtsov & tsvetkov @xcite ) within newtonian gravity . \n the quadrupole deformation can be evaluated by the ellipticity of the equilibrium shape . in sect .  3 \n , we also calculate the ellipticity based on the general relativistic perturbation theory ( see also hartle ( @xcite ) and chandrasekhar & miller ( @xcite ) for the rotational cases and konno et al . \n ( @xcite ) for the magnetic cases ) . \n the ellipticity can be summarized in the same form as the newtonian cases , but with different numerical factors . in sect . \n 4 , using the ellipticity , we compare the rotational effect with the magnetic effect on star deformation numerically . in this comparison \n , we keep the parameter range of known pulsars in mind . finally , we give concluding remarks in sect . \n 5 . throughout the paper \n , we use the units in which @xmath6 . \n quadrupole deformation of an equilibrium body is characterized by the ellipticity @xmath7 , which is defined by @xmath8 for the gravitational equilibrium with uniform rotation , the value is essentially related to the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy . in the slow rotation of a homogeneous star , we have a well - known result ( see e.g. chandrasekhar @xcite ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the radius , mass and angular velocity , respectively . for other stellar model , the numerical factor @xmath13 \n should be replaced by an appropriate one . \n for example , the factor is @xmath14 for the model with the polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath15 with index @xmath16 ( see table 1 in chandrasekhar & roberts @xcite ) . \n we therefore generalize the expression with a dimensionless factor @xmath17 as @xmath18 and will discuss how the factor @xmath17 depends on the stellar models .    in a similar way , \n the effect of the magnetic stress is also expressed by the energy ratio of the magnetic field to the gravitational field . introducing a dimensionless factor @xmath19 \n , we have the ellipticity @xmath20 arising from magnetic field as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic dipole moment . the dimensionless factor @xmath19 , in general , \n depends on both the magnetic field configurations and the eos . \n for example , in the case of an incompressible fluid body with a dipole magnetic field treated by ferraro ( @xcite ) , we derive @xmath23 . \n in this section , we will review quadrupole deformation due to the slow rotation and weak dipole magnetic field . \n the deformation can be expressed by the second - order quantities with respect to the rotation rate or the magnetic field strength . in order to calculate the shape \n , we also have to calculate the space - time metric , which is axisymmetric stationary or static one . \n the line element can be written in the form @xmath24 \n dt^2   \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\ : e^{\\lambda ( r ) } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{2 e^{\\lambda ( r)}}{r }             \\left\\ { m_{0}(r ) + m_{2}(r )             p_{2}\\left ( \\cos \\theta \\right)\\right\\ }             \\right ] dr^2             \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\ : r^2 \\left ( 1 + 2 k_{2}(r )             p_{2}\\left ( \\cos \\theta \\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\qquad \\times \\ ;              \\left [ d \\theta^2              + r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta ( d \\phi -

energy tensor of the perfect fluid body is described by @xmath30 when we consider the magnetic field deformation , we further take into account the stress - energy tensor arising from the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath31 solving the einstein - maxwell equations , we can obtain the second - order metric functions mentioned above .    the ellipticity of the relativistic star can be calculated from the definition ( [ def - e ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the displacement of quadrupole deformation . \n since the displacement of the surface can be determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , the ellipticity of the slowly rotating star is expressed as ( chandrasekhar & miller @xcite ) @xmath34    in order to compare it with the newtonian results , we normalize the ellipticity in the same form as eq . \n ( [ e - newton ] ) . \n there are several possibilities of the normalization factors for @xmath11 and @xmath10 in the relativistic calculation . \n we use natural choices , i.e. , gravitational mass for @xmath11 and circumferential radius for @xmath10 in this paper . \n this normalization is useful to extrapolate from the newtonian results . \n chandrasekhar & miller ( @xcite ) used a different normalization , which causes a prominent peak ( see fig .  5 in their paper ) . \n we note that the peak is due merely to a less convenient choice of the normalization . \n the resultant dimensionless factor @xmath17 is calculated for the polytropic eos with @xmath35 . \n [ fig1 ] displays the variation of the dimensionless quantity @xmath17 with respect to the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n this figure shows that the correct relativistic calculations give smaller values of the ellipticity than those of the newtonian calculations with fixed @xmath37 . \n the factor in the typical relativistic case decreases down to 0.7 of the newtonian case .    as for the weakly magnetized star , \n the lorentz force plays a role on the equilibrium . \n the rotational term @xmath38 is replaced by the magnetic term in the ellipticity . from the hydrostatic condition , we have ( konno et al . \n @xcite ) @xmath39 where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the background quantities , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath42-components of the 4-current and 4-potential respectively . the ellipticity can also be written in the form of eq . \n ( [ e - mag ] ) . \n we also use the gravitational mass @xmath11 and circumferential radius @xmath10 . \n [ fig2 ] displays the variation of the ellipticity with respect to the relativistic factor @xmath36 . in these calculations \n , we have used the current distribution @xmath43 which is a simplest case derived by the integrability condition ( see e.g. ferraro @xcite ) and gives the direct general - relativistic extension of ferraro ( @xcite ) \n . using the normalization , the residual factor @xmath19 is almost independent of the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n in order to compare the rotational effect with the magnetic effect on star deformation , we now consider the ratio of @xmath44 to @xmath45 , @xmath46    first , we investigate the dependence of the ratio of the two dimensionless factors , @xmath47 , on the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n [ fig3 ] displays this ratio . from this figure \n , we can see that the true relativistic calculations with @xmath48 give smaller values of the ratio than those obtained by the newtonian calculations . \n this fact means that the approach using the newtonian gravity overestimates the rotational effect . \n the curves @xmath47 are approximately reproduced within 10% if we use @xmath49    next , we consider the comparison including other parameters @xmath12 and @xmath50 of stars . \n we use the stellar model with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n [ fig4 ] displays a critical line on which @xmath53 and the two regions divided by this line in @xmath54-@xmath12 space , where @xmath54 denotes the typical magnetic field strength on the surface , which is defined by @xmath55 . \n we have plotted only one representative line of @xmath16 . \n we can also derive very close results for other indices . the critical line , in general , \n can be written from eq . \n ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath56   \\approx 5.3 \\times 10^{13 }    \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{g } } \\left ( \\frac{m / 1.4 m_{\\odot } }   { r / 10 { \\rm km } } \\right)^{1/2 } \\omega \\ : [ \\mbox{sec}^{-1 } ] , \\ ] ] where it is useful to use the fitting formula eq . \n ( [ fitting ] ) for @xmath47 . in the region \n , the magnetic effect dominates the rotational effect , i.e. , @xmath57 , whereas in the region vice versa , i.e. , @xmath58 . from this figure \n , we find that objects having magnetic field strength @xmath4@xmath59 g and period @xmath60sec such as sgrs and axps belong to the region . \n thus , the magnetic effect overwhelms the rotational effect for such observed candidates of magnetars .    on the other hand , \n well - known typical pulsars with magnetic field strength @xmath61@xmath62 and the period @xmath63@xmath64 ( see e.g. taylor et al . \n @xcite ) obviously belong to the region . \n millisecond pulsars also belong to the region . \n the magnetic deformation is neglected . \n the new classes of objects , which are candidates of magnetars , have inspired us to investigate the relation between the rotational effect and the magnetic effect on deformation of stars . \n we have briefly reviewed the quadrupole deformation due to the rotation and that due to the magnetic field based on previous studies , and compared the rotational effect with the magnetic effect for various pulsars reported observationally . from our investigation , we have found that the new classes of objects such as sgrs and axps belong to the region in which the magnetic effect dominates the rotational effect , while well - known typical pulsars with magnetic field strength @xmath65@xmath66 g and millisecond pulsars vice versa . \n thus , the critical line on which the ellipticity arising from the rotation equals to that arising from the magnetic field divides the new classes and the well - known pulsars . \n once we obtain the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath54 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of a pulsar , we can see whether the magnetic effect is dominant or the rotational effect is dominant using eqs . \n ( [ fitting ] ) and ( [ c - line ] ) and fig . \n the deformation due to the magnetic field may come into play in the spin - down of the magnetars . \n the spin - down history of the axps is rather irregular . \n recently , melatos ( @xcite ) ascribed the irregularity to the radiative precession produced by the deformation . at present , the fit to the observational data is not so good , but will be improved by detailed models . \n theoretical models for the deformed stars will be required there . \n as discussed by bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( @xcite ) , the non - axisymmetric distortion is also important for the gravitational emission . \n the deformation can be calculated from the magnetic field , which is estimated from the observed pulsar period and the period derivative . \n the inferred amplitudes of the gravitational waves are too small for the present known pulsars . in the future \n , we might find more extreme case such as the early stage of rapidly rotating magnetars .", "StartTimeOffset": 1333497002773, "RequestID": "a3df4005eb364c9dac30593b1b00eb78", "TotalTokens": 3581}

ii measurements . \n the question naturally arises as to why the rcg - based optical depths appear to be lower than those from all stars . \n one possibility is a dependence on the flux limits of the two methods . \n rcgs are bright ; the latter method will include much fainter stars , and so probe sources at greater distances , which will have a higher optical depth ( @xcite ) . \n this potential explanation of the discrepancy is investigated using monte carlo simulations of galactic microlensing , and the optical depth as a function of source apparent magnitude is then predicted . \n the model galaxy is barred , and in light of observations by the _ \n spitzer space telescope _ \n ( _ sst _ ) , that support a bar inclination angle much larger than suggested by previous studies ( see  [ sec : models ] ) , the effect on the expected @xmath0 of changing the bar angle is determined . \n combining these results with the observed optical depths , upper limits are placed on the bar angle . \n [ sec : model ] describes the model . \n the results and discussion are presented in \n [ sec : results ] : the model results are given in  [ sec : results_model ] , and comparisons are made with the latest eros-2 data in  [ sec : results_eros ] . a summary and conclusions follow in  [ sec : conclusions ] . \n the mass models and parameters of the galactic bulge ( bar ) and disc are as described in @xcite . \n they are based on those of @xcite , who empirically normalised the g2 bulge model of ( * ? ? ? \n * table 1 ) with _ hubble space telescope _ star counts , and extended the local disc model of @xcite to the whole disc . \n @xcite tested a series of models against images of the galactic bulge from the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) satellite , and found their g2 model to provide one of the best fits . \n this model bar extends from 313 kpc and is inclined to the galactic centre line of sight ( los ) at an angle of @xmath17 . \n @xcite states that physical models can be found for the _ cobe _ bar with angles in the range @xmath18 , and many studies assume @xmath19 . \n however , more recent data from glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) , using the _ sst _ , support a much larger value of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) , while from eros-2 , @xcite report @xmath21 , which is consistent with original ogle - i results ( @xcite ) . \n hence , predictions are also made here for @xcite s e2 model , which has the largest bar angle of their models : @xmath22 . \n the expected @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be calculated . \n therefore for each los , the apparent magnitude distribution of the model sources must match the observed distribution . \n @xcite fitted the @xmath26-band stellar distributions in 48 ogle - ii galactic bulge fields with the power - law plus gaussian luminosity function @xmath27 , \\label{eq : powgauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters , and @xmath32 is measured as described in his paper . \n the power - law part contains red giants and bright main - sequence stars , which lie throughout the bar . \n the gaussian component consists of rcgs , which in the model here are more concentrated in the central part of the bulge , occupying the region 610 kpc . \n ( this concentration is found to improve the match to the observed magnitude distributions , and is not unreasonable , as rcgs are older , evolved stars , and hence more likely to exist only in more densely populated regions ) . \n @xcite thus provides , for each of these fields , an observed distribution of apparent magnitude . \n the positions of these fields are listed in table 1 of @xcite . \n the fields closest to the ogle , macho ( rcg ) and moa lines of sight are selected , as shown in table [ tab : coords ] . \n the macho ( dia ) los is not considered , as explained below . \n lccc    & @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) & @xmath35 ( @xmath34 ) & angular separation ( @xmath34 ) +    ogle & 1.16 & @xmath36 & + field 34 & 1.35 & @xmath37 & 0.40 +   + macho & 1.50 & @xmath38 & + field 20 & 1.68 & @xmath39 & 0.28 +   + moa & 3.0 & @xmath40 & + field 36 & 3.16 & @xmath41 & 0.6 +    as described in \n [ sec : opdepth ] , the apparent magnitude of each source is calculated by first assigning it an absolute magnitude , and then correcting for its distance . \n hence for each los a separate model distribution of absolute magnitude is required that will , with distance corrections , reproduce the observed distribution of apparent magnitude . \n of course in reality the absolute magnitude distribution should be virtually the same for each direction in table [ tab : coords ] , since over these small angular separations the mass function is expected to vary little . here \n , the artificial absolute magnitude distributions are only used as a means to ensure the model distributions of apparent magnitude match those observed for each direction . \n it is assumed that the forms of the two distributions are the same , i.e. a power - law plus gaussian . \n for each of the three ogle - ii fields listed in table [ tab : coords ] , an appropriate absolute magnitude distribution can easily be generated , by suitably adjusting the ( extinction - corrected ) fitted parameters of the apparent magnitude distribution found by @xcite . \n ( these parameters are not given in @xcite , and are provided by t. sumi , private communication ) . \n * table 5 ) and ( * ? ? ? \n * table 4 ) list the extinction - corrected @xmath26-band apparent magnitudes of all the moa and ogle sources used in their respective measurements of @xmath0 . \n the minimum and maximum magnitudes given in each case are taken to define ranges of detectable apparent magnitudes . \n @xcite , in their table 2 , provide uncorrected @xmath42-band apparent magnitudes . \n since these macho sources are all rcgs , their apparent magnitudes are converted to @xmath26-band using the following relation for rcgs from @xcite : @xmath43 macho source extinction is then accounted for by simply shifting the minimum and maximum macho magnitudes by the mean @xmath44 for the corresponding ogle - ii field , as given in table 3 of @xcite : for field 20 , @xmath44 = 0.951 . \n ( strictly speaking the extinction should instead be calculated for each source individually , but this is neglected as in the region occupied by the model rcgs , @xmath44 varies from the mean value by @xmath45 0.05 mag  a negligible amount ) . \n although @xcite also list the apparent magnitudes of the macho sources used in their dia measurement , these are in @xmath42-band and do not consist of only rcgs \n . therefore an @xmath26-band magnitude range can not be reliably defined for the model . \n the defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes @xmath46 for ogle , macho and moa are given in table [ tab : mag_ranges ] . \n .defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes for ogle , macho and moa . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , there is another , simpler way to look for signs of the predicted @xmath0 oscillation in the survey data . \n if @xmath0 is indeed higher on the faint side of the clump centres , then more of the observed events should also be on the faint side : a plot of event counts , as a function of @xmath47 , should be noticeably skewed towards the faint side . \n [ fig : eros_skew ] shows that this is so . \n the ratio of events with @xmath47 fainter than zero to those brighter than zero ( hereafter the _ skewness ratio _ ) is 1.14 . \n the significance of this skew is tested as follows . \n the plot of event counts is fitted with a gaussian , as shown . \n this is of course an imperfect fit , but gives an approximate measure of the dispersion . \n then 120 points ( for the 120 eros events ) are randomly distributed on the magnitude axis , according to a gaussian with the fitted dispersion , and the skewness ratio is calculated . for one million such monte carlo cases , \n only 21 per cent have a skewness ratio greater than the observed value . \n thus the observed skew is suggestive , but not highly significant . \n it does not appear that the discrepancy in optical depth measurements between the rcg and all - star analyses can be explained by a dependence of the lensing surveys on their flux limits . \n the model reproduces the ogle and macho values based on rcgs , but underpredicts moa s all - star value by @xmath48@xmath49 . \n another potential explanation for the discrepancy is blending . @xcite found @xmath4838 per cent of ogle - ii events with apparent rcg sources were really due to faint stars blended with a bright companion . \n however , they also showed that blending has little effect on estimates of @xmath0 due to partial cancellation of its different effects , a point also made by @xcite and @xcite . \n @xcite also state that the dia method is less sensitive to the systematics of blending in crowded fields . though it is of course possible that moa s value may yet be lowered with more data , it is supported by macho s earlier dia value . \n @xmath0 is expected to be generally constant as a function of source apparent magnitude for @xmath50 , except in the range @xmath2 , where many rcgs are detected . \n these stars dominate the source counts at such magnitudes , and show a strong correlation between distance and apparent magnitude , causing a significant oscillation in @xmath0 . \n the amplitude of this oscillation is found to decrease with increasing bar angle , providing a potential constraint on @xmath3 . \n a further constraint comes from a similar dependance of @xmath0 with @xmath3 : combining the predicted trends with the measured values provides @xmath4 upper limits , which exclude the large bar angles reported by glimpse and eros .    from the eros-2 survey \n , @xmath51 has been found as a function of source apparent magnitude . \n the predicted oscillation is not only consistent with the observed trend , but provides a better @xmath52 fit than a constant optical depth , though the significance of this preference is low due to insufficient data . \n however , a further sign comes from eros event counts , which show a clear skew towards fainter magnitudes . with ongoing surveys detecting increasing numbers of rcg events ( and @xmath48@xmath53 of all kinds ) \n , it should soon be possible to make a more useful and definite comparison . \n i am grateful to jim rich of the eros collaboration for providing their data , and for his helpful comments . \n i also thank szymon kozowski , shude mao and ukasz wyrzykowski for useful discussions , and the anonymous referee for their comments . \n i acknowledge support from a pparc studentship , and travel support from the european community s sixth framework marie curie research training network programme , contract no . \n mrtn -

dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) realized in semiconductor heterostructures , the conduction electrons behave as ordinary electrons with a parabolic dispersion relation . \n in contrast , the dispersion relation obeyed by conduction electrons in graphene monolayer is linear in momentum . \n this occurs due to the unique crystal structure of graphene which is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms . \n quantum - mechanical hopping between the sublattices of graphene leads to the formation of  two energy bands , and their intersection near the edges of the brillioun zone yields the conical energy spectrum . as a consequence , \n the dispersion relation of electrons and holes bands is linear near @xmath0 points of the brillioun zone which is given by @xmath1 hence , the conduction electrons , known as dirac electrons , behave as massless particles with the effective speed of light @xmath2@xcite . in a graphene monolayer , electron transport is essentially governed by dirac s ( relativistic ) equation , rather than the usual schrodinger equation for nonrelativistic quantum particles . \n the relativistic behavior of graphene was first predicted by p. r. wallace@xcite . \n it thus provides a unique opportunity to study relativistic quantum dynamics in condensed -

ray and radio data identified potential pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) ( camilo et al . \n 2001 , roberts , romani , & johnston 2001 ) . \n hence , searches directed at the potential counterparts would have been successful . in a third case , psr j1015@xmath45719 , \n very little is known about any potential x -

down luminosity , large distance , and alternate potential source of @xmath0-rays ( the supernova remnant ) all argue against either of these latter two pulsars being the true counterpart of the coincident @xmath1 source . \n deep pulse searches of potential x -

1310 is less clear of a pwn candidate , due to its large size and the confused radio emission in the region , but other source classes for hard , extended x - ray sources seem less plausible .    between the parkes multibeam survey and directed searches , six new strong @xmath0-ray pulsar candidates \n have been discovered as radio pulsars since the demise of @xmath1 . \n since these are young pulsars , which tend to glitch , extrapolating ephemerides back to the @xmath1 era is uncertain making detection of @xmath0-ray pulsations difficult . \n i list these pulsars in table 1 in boldface . \n the dispersion measure ( dm ) distances , determined using the new cordes and lazio ( 2002 ) ne2001 model , are given . \n the @xmath0-ray efficiencies , @xmath7 , are determined from the 100  mev to 10  gev flux , assuming the dm distance and 1 steradian beaming . \n all of the new pulsars have high dms and have 20  cm fluxes @xmath8 mjy . \n the inferred @xmath0-ray efficiencies are also quite high . for comparison , table 1 \n lists the values for the known @xmath0-ray pulsars , using the ne2001 distances for consistency and adapting the efficiencies from the values given by kaspi et al . \n if the @xmath0-ray sources associated with these new pulsars are nearly 100% pulsed , as are the known sources , then the oft -

{"ContextTokens": 3565, "GeneratedTokens": 447, "SynthesizedBody": "the higgs boson has been found at the lhc by the atlas experiment  @xcite and the cms experiment  @xcite . \n after that , understanding the properties of a higgs boson through the precise measurement is important for particle physics . a branching ratio ( br ) \n is one of the most important properties of a higgs boson . in the standard model , \n the yukawa coupling of matter fermions with a higgs boson is completely proportional to the fermion mass . \n however , the yukawa coupling will deviate from the prediction of the standard model if there are new physics . \n the pattern of deviation depends on the new physics model . \n thus , understanding a higgs boson is very important from the viewpoint of new physics .    besides \n , the size of the deviation is expected to be small if the scale of new physics is high . \n specifically , the allowed deviation can be at the few - percent level even if no additional new particles are to be found at the lhc  @xcite . \n since the branching ratio measurement is used as an input in the extraction of the yukawa coupling , a precise determination of the branching ratio is essential to probe new physics .    in this study , we focus on the branching ratio of the higgs boson decaying into tau lepton pairs . \n the mass of the tau lepton is known to a very good precision unlike quarks , which typically suffer from the theoretical uncertainties arising from qcd . \n also , the deviation in the lepton yukawa coupling could well differ from the quark yukawa coupling , such as in the lepton - specific two - higgs doublet model . \n thus , the tau yukawa coupling is an ideal probe for new physics .    in this study \n , we estimate the measurement accuracy @xmath5 of the @xmath7 branching ratio at the center -

carlo samples of the processes of @xmath17 with @xmath7 where @xmath18 denotes a fermion , because the spin correlation of @xmath7 was not treated properly in tdr samples . \n therefore , we do not use the events which contain @xmath7 processes in tdr samples to avoid double counting . \n the beam energy spectrum includes the effects due to beamstrahlung and the initial state radiation . the beam -

induced @xmath22 interactions are included . \n but at the @xmath11 gev , the numbers of hadrons are estimated to be small  @xcite . \n therefore , we do not apply any special treatment to eliminate these hadrons . \n the event reconstruction is consisted of three steps ; ( 1 ) tau reconstruction , ( 2 ) collinear approximation , and ( 3 ) @xmath9 boson reconstruction .    first , we apply tau finder . \n our tau finder searches for charged track which have highest energy among the remaining particles , and combines the neighboring particles which satisfy @xmath23 , with the combined mass less than 2 gev , where @xmath24 is the cone angle with respect to the highest energy charged track . \n the combined object is regarded as a tau candidate . \n then , we apply the selection cuts to tau candidates as following ; discard the candidates which categorized into 3-prong with neutral particles , @xmath25 gev where @xmath26 is the energy of tau candidate , and satisfy @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cone energy of a tau candidate with the cone angle of @xmath30 , and @xmath30 is the cone angle with respect to a tau candidate , respectively . \n these selections are tuned to minimize the misidentification of fragments of quark jets as tau decays . \n after the selection , we apply the charge recovery process to obtain better efficiency . \n the charged particles in a tau candidate which have the energy less than 2 gev are detached one by one , the one with the smallest energy first , until satisfying the following conditions ; the charge of a tau candidate is exactly equal to @xmath31 , and the number of track(s ) in a tau candidate is exactly equal to 1 or 3 . \n the tau candidate after the detaching is rejected if it does not satisfy the above conditions , and remaining candidate is regarded as a tau jet . \n we repeat the above processes until there are no charged particles which have the energy greater than 2 gev .    after finishing the tau reconstruction , \n we apply the collinear approximation  @xcite to reconstruct the invariant mass of tau pair system . in this approximation \n , we assume that the visible decay products of the tau lepton and the neutrino(s ) from the tau decay is collinear , and the contribution of the missing transverse momentum comes only from the neutrino(s ) from tau decay . \n after the approximation , we apply the durham jet clustering  @xcite with two jets for the remaining objects to reconstruct @xmath9 boson . \n before optimizing the cuts , we apply preselection cuts as following ;    * the number of reconstructed @xmath32 and @xmath33 are exactly equal to one , * the number of reconstructed jet is exactly equal to two , * the number of track in an event is greater or equal to nine , * @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the invariant mass ( energy ) of tau pair with collinear approximation in the unit of gev . \n in addition , we apply the following cuts to suppress the trivial backgrounds ;    * @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the visible energy ( mass ) in the unit of gev , * @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sum of the magnitude of the transverse momentum of each particle in the unit of gev , * the thrust in an event should be less than @xmath42 , * @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two jets in the unit of gev , * @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angle between two jets , * @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the energy ( invariant mass ) of reconstructed two taus without collinear approximation in the unit of gev , * @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angle between two taus , * @xmath53 and @xmath54 , * @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the recoil mass against @xmath9 boson . \n we only use the events passed the preselection and cuts above for the optimization of event selection . \n we perform the cut -

{"ContextTokens": 2947, "GeneratedTokens": 77, "SynthesizedBody": "research on ultrathin films has been growing considerably over the last two decades due to their technical importance and the increasing ability to grow high - quality film samples . \n when dealing with systems of reduced dimensionality it is important to take into account the influence of magnetic anisotropies . formally being a prerequisite for finite temperature magnetism @xcite they also play a crucial role in reorientation transitions as functions of film thickness , temperature , or an external magnetic field @xcite .    in this work we present a microscopic quantum mechanical model to describe the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropies of ultrathin ni and co films . as the dominant anisotropy terms in these transition metals we take into account a second order lattice anisotropy and dipolar coupling . \n we are able to fit experimental data obtained by the ferromagnetic resonance technique ( fmr ) @xcite with our model , which is based on a heisenberg exchange between localized magnetic moments \n . the main result will be that the @xmath0-dependence of the anisotropy is solely due to magnon excitations rather than to other mechanisms as , e.g. , thermal expansion or phononic interactions . \n the isolation of the magnon effect is of course not possible when describing the films with the classical ( t=0- ) landau - lifshitz equations in which the ( effective ) anisotropy parameters have to be fitted at each given temperature @xcite . \n temperature is taken into account explicitly by the so - called stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite . \n however we will introduce in the following an alternative approach based on a quantum mechanical description of the film system and an explicite consideration of magnon excitations using a heisenberg model containing atomistic anisotropy terms . \n the hamiltonian of our microscopic model reads @xmath1 the first term describes heisenberg coupling @xmath2 between magnetic spin moments @xmath3 at the sites of a monolayer . \n it represents the largest energy scale in the problem and is responsible for the magnetism in the system . a film thickness beyond monolayer \n is effectively absorbed into the nearest neighbor exchange parameter @xmath4 to which we restrict ourselves . \n @xmath4 is chosen such that the monolayer magnetic moment equals that of the multilayer film at room temperature ( @xmath5 k , @xmath6 k ) . \n the second term contains an external magnetic field @xmath7 in arbitrary direction with the land@xmath8 factor @xmath9 and the bohr magneton @xmath10 . \n the third and fourth term constitute lattice anisotropy and dipolar interaction , respectively , the latter leading to shape anisotropy . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are microscopic anisotropy parameters , @xmath13 is the @xmath14-component of @xmath3 perpendicular to the film plane , and @xmath15 is the vector between lattice sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n the shape anisotropy favors in - plane orientation and the lattice anisotropy can favor in - plane ( @xmath18 ) or out - of - plane ( @xmath19 ) orientation of the magnetization . \n the main idea of the method that we used in order to solve ( [ hamilt ] ) is discussed in ref . \n the exchange terms are decoupled using the standard tyablikov ( rpa ) approximation . \n the crucial point is to find a reasonable decoupling of the lattice anisotropy terms in the equation of motion for the spin green function @xmath20 given an _ \n arbitrarily _ oriented external magnetic field . \n this problem is solved by performing a coordinate transformation @xmath21 . more precisely one self - consistently rotates the initial coordinate system defined by a @xmath14-axis parallel to the film normal such that the @xmath22-axis of the new reference frame has the direction of the magnetization . \n then an anderson - callen decoupling to the @xmath11-terms is applied @xcite . \n the results for the magnetization components obtained by this approach compare very well with corresponding qmc calculations @xcite . \n we have improved the theoretical treatment in the meantime by taking into account additional green functions , namely all combinations of @xmath23 , as was proposed in ref . \n this improved theory ensures correct softening properties of the uniform spin wave mode and also agrees nicely with the qmc results . \n furthermore the dipole term in ( [ hamilt ] ) is treated in the rpa approximation and only the uniform ( @xmath24 ) contribution is considered as the non - uniform terms are negligible compared to contributions from the much larger heisenberg exchange .    ) and perpendicular ( @xmath25 ) to the film plane ( monolayer ) . \n the resonance fields can be detected by an fmr experiment . \n parameters : @xmath26 kg , @xmath27 . ] \n k and at @xmath28k as a function of the orientation of the external magnetic field . \n circles : experimental data from ni@xmath29/cu(001 ) . \n lines connect theoretical fit points . \n @xmath30=1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33mev . ]    a more detailed and general account of our method ( e.g. the explicit extension to the multilayer case ) will be presented elsewhere . \n we summarize only the essential output here : solving for the spin green functions yields weights @xmath34 and excitation energies @xmath35 which in turn give the average magnon occupation number @xmath36 the two terms of the sum over @xmath37 describe the single - magnon excitations of the system for a given wave vector @xmath38 , namely magnon creation and magnon annihilation . \n the magnetization ( in the rotated frame ) can then be computed from @xmath39 our theory therefore allows for a self - consistent determination of the magnetization , i.e. temperature - dependent calculations . \n in addition the self - consistent determination of the rotation angle is achieved by requiring that @xmath40 be a constant of the motion , @xmath41 , within the decoupling approximations we use in our theory . \n we point out that by properly rescaling the parameters our equations at @xmath42 can actually be shown to reduce to the landau - lifshitz equations . \n a discussion of the important differences that appear for finite temperatures will be given elsewhere . \n in our theory the anisotropies @xmath11 and @xmath12 influence the system solely via the _ effective anisotropy _ given by the temperature - dependent term @xmath43 here the @xmath0-independent quantity @xmath44 is some number depending on the lattice geometry . \n note that our effective anisotropy @xmath45 is identical to the quantity @xmath46 commonly used within a landau - lifshitz description of fmr experiments @xcite . \n furthermore we exploit @xmath47 . \n the temperature dependence of @xmath45 thus goes beyond a mere proportionality to @xmath48 due to the occurence of the higher order @xmath0-dependent correlation function @xmath49 .    /co@xmath50/cu(001 ) ) . \n parameters : @xmath30=2.5 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53mev . ]    ) . \n circles are experimental data , lines are from theory with the same parameters as in fig . 2 and fig . \n the experimental data have been obtained using fmr measurements @xcite . \n this technique probes the uniform spin wave mode @xmath54 of a magnetic sample . \n an external field is tuned for a given probe frequency @xmath55 until resonance occurs at @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the filmplane . \n this is illustrated in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . \n using the temperature dependent effective anisotropy ( [ keff ] ) we can now fit the experimental data . \n we can thus check if the temperature dependence of the effective anisotropy is due to spin wave excitations which are considered explicitly in our model ( [ hamilt ] ) or due to other ( non - magnonic ) effects which would manifest themselves in a temperature dependence of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \n in the following we take @xmath58 for ni and @xmath59 for co due to different magnetic moments of the two metals @xcite . the land@xmath8 factor is taken as @xmath60 for both ni and co. the fmr microwave frequency was set to @xmath61ghz . \n [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the comparison between the @xmath62-curves from theory and experimental data for a ( subscript denotes the number of monolayers ) cu@xmath63/co@xmath50/cu(001 ) and a ni@xmath29/cu(001 ) film system , respectively , at two different temperatures . in both cases \n the effective anisotropy favors the magnetization to lie within the film plane . \n there is quite good agreement at both temperatures over the whole range of angles @xmath57 for both films . at a given angle \n the resonance field increases with temperature . \n it is important to note that the choice of the microscopic parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 at a given temperature can not be unambiguous as one easily sees from ( [ keff ] ) . \n however we took additionally into account the temperature dependence of the resonance field for a fixed angle @xmath64 as it is shown in fig . \n [ fig4 ] . due to the temperature dependent term which goes with @xmath11 in ( [ keff ] ) , namely @xmath49 , \n the ambiguity is removed . \n indeed it is still possible to accurately fit the experimental results with one set of ( @xmath0-independent ) parameters ( @xmath65 ) for ni and co , respectively , over the whole temperature range . \n furthermore in both cases the values of @xmath66 lie slightly above the result of an explicit evaluation of this quantity assuming point - like dipoles on the lattice sites for the given geometry @xcite ( @xmath67 kg ) . \n the conclusion we can draw is that the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy is solely due to spin wave excitations which manifest themselves in the @xmath0-dependence of ( [ keff ] ) rather than due to thermal expansion or phononic interactions . in other words \n , there is no additional @xmath0-dependence of the parameters @xmath65 to be considered in order to describe the non - magnonic effects . \n in conclusion we presented a quantum theory for thin metallic films based on a local - moment model with lattice and shape anisotropy . by comparison with fmr experiments we found that the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy of thin ni and co films is exclusively due to magnon excitations rather than caused by other structural or phononic effects . \n 00 n.  d.  mermin and h.  wagner , phys . \n * 17 * , 1133 ( 1966 ) s.  schwieger ,  j.  kienert , and w.  nolting , phys . \n b * 71 * , 024428 ( 2005 ) , and references therein j. lindner and k. baberschke , j. phys . : condens . \n matter * 15 * , r193 ( 2003 ) j. lindner , _ ferromagnetische resonanz an ultradnnen magnetischen einfach- und mehrfachlagen der 3d -

[ effprop ] this propagator agrees with the bare one if the bare mass , @xmath25 , is replaced by the effective mass @xmath26 . \n the dispersion relation of the scalar field in the medium follows from the poles of the effective propagator : @xmath27 . \n an alternative method to the itf is the rtf , where the thermal propagator in momentum space is given by i ( k ) = + 2 n_b(|k_0| ) ( k^2-m^2 ) . [ rtf ] in order to avoid unphysical singularities from products of @xmath28-functions , which can appear in diagrams with two propagators , the propagator has been extended to a @xmath29-matrix @xcite . \n an important advantage of the rtf compared with the itf is the possible generalization to non - equilibrium by replacing the equilibrium distribution in ( [ rtf ] ) by a non - equilibrium . \n now we will turn to gauge theories ( qed , qcd , electroweak theory ) at finite temperature and density , which are relevant for astrophysical situations . as an important example we consider the one - loop qed polarization tensor in an electron - positron plasma shown in figure  [ fig : polarization ] . \n in contrast to the tadpole diagram the polarization tensor is energy and momentum dependent . \n it can be calculated exactly only in the high - temperature limit which is equivalent to the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) limit , in which the loop momentum is assumed to be much larger than the external momentum . \n the high - temperature limit corresponds to an ultrarelativistic electron - positron plasma as it exists in supernovae . due to the breaking of lorentz invariance by choosing the frame of the heat bath , \n the polarization tensor has two independent components , for which we take the longitudinal and the transverse . in the htl limit they read _ \n l(p_0,p)&=&-3 m_^2(1- ) , + _ t(p_0,p)&= & m_^2 , [ htlpolar ] where @xmath30 can be regarded as a thermal photon `` mass '' . however , it should be noted that this mass does not break gauge invariance .    by resumming the polarization tensor using the dyson - schwinger equation \n we construct an effective photon propagator which describes the propagation of collective photon modes ( plasmons ) in a qed plasma . \n the corresponding dispersion relations for the longitudinal and the transverse plasma waves are shown in figure  [ fig : dispersion ] . \n finally , let me mention that in the case of two - loop self energies , from which e.g. damping rates follow , infrared singularities and gauge dependent results ( `` plasmon puzzle '' ) are encountered . \n braaten and pisarski @xcite developed a method , the htl resummation technique , for avoiding these problems , which allows a consistent treatment of gauge theories at finite temperature . \n neutrinos are copiously emitted from the core of a supernova . \n they interact with the surrounding plasma , providing an effective mechanism for energy deposition , which pushes the shock wave outwards and finally triggers the explosion @xcite . \n important neutrino interaction processes in the plasma are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    the differential rate for instance for @xmath34-annihilation is given by = m^ \\{_(q_1+q_2 ) } , [ diffrate ] where m^=8(q_2^q_1^+ q_1^q_2 ^ - ( q_1 q_2 ) g^ + i q_1 \n q_2 ^ ) [ leptonic ] is the leptonic tensor of the neutrino current and @xmath35 the polarization tensor . \n to lowest order in the fermi theory the latter is given by figure  [ fig : fermi ] . \n the total rate follows from the differential rate by convolution with the neutrino distributions : r_|= & & [ f_(q_1)f_|(q_2 ) + & & - ( 1-f_(q_1))(1-f_|(q_2 ) ) ] e^-e / t_e ] . \n [ totrate ] similar expressions for the differential and total rate can be derived for @xmath36-scattering . \n alternatively the rates can be calculated from the scattering amplitude , & & = [ 1-n_e^+(e_1 ) ] + & & [ 1-n_e^-(e_2 ) ] ( 2)^4 ^ 4(q_1+q_2-p_1-p_2 ) _ \n i |m|^2 , [ amplitude ] where @xmath37 $ ] is the fermi distribution of the electrons and positrons in the plasma . \n in addition to medium effects at finite temperature and density we consider a strong magnetic field , which plays an important role in supernovae and neutron stars . \n recently magnetic field strengths above @xmath38 g have been observed in so - called magnetars @xcite . in a magnetic field \n the electrons and positrons are in landau levels , which leads to a modified electron propagator in the polarization tensor . \n the magnetic field can absorb momentum , allowing for new processes such as the gyromagnetic absorption @xmath39 . \n the advantage of starting from the polarization tensor instead of the scattering amplitude is the automatic inclusion of all possible processes ( annihilation , scattering , gyromagnetic absorption ) . \n using the approach described above , we found a strong modification of the rates of the various processes in fields at @xmath40 g. in particular there are pronounced peaks in the rates coming from the landau levels , new processes like the gyromagnetic absorption become important , and the processes show a strong anisotropy , which could play a role in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in the figures  [ fig : bdepend ] to [ fig : aniso ] these features are illustrated . \n quark matter consisting of up , down and strange quarks may exist in the interior of neutron stars or even in form of strangelets , if quark matter is stable , i.e. , if it has a higher binding energy than iron @xcite . \n strangelets have also been discussed as a possible dark matter candidate @xcite . \n so far calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) of strange matter are based on an ideal fermi gas , where sometimes also one - gluon exchange effects are included @xcite .    here \n we want to consider medium effects at finite density and vanishing temperature , which lead to effective quark masses . using the one - loop quark self energy in the high - density limit \n , an effectice in - medium quark propagator is constructed . \n the dispersion relation at zero momentum following from this propagator defines the effective , density dependent quark mass @xcite ( p=0)=m_q^*=+ ( + ) ^1/2 , [ qmass ] where @xmath41 is the quark chemical potential of the order of 300 mev . \n the coupling constant @xmath42 , typically of the order 2 - 4 , can be regarded as a parameter describing the medium effect of the effective quark mass , which arises naturally due to the interactions as known from mean - field theories in many - particle physics . \n consequently we replace the ideal fermi gas by a quasiparticle gas , where e.g. the particle density is now given by ( ) = [ ^2-m_q^*^2()]^3/2 , [ density ] where @xmath43 is the degree of freedom , e.g. @xmath44 for strange quarks . \n similar expressions for the energy density and the pressure determining the eos can be found . \n the introduction of an effective quark mass , typically of the order of 100 mev , reduces the binding energy of strange quark matter and renders the existence of stable strangelets as a dark matter candidate unlikely @xcite . \n furthermore we studied the influence of the quark medium effects on strange stars and hybrid stars , i.e. neutron stars containing a quark matter core , by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation using the eos for quark matter derived above . \n as shown in figure  [ fig : mass_radius ] the effective quark mass has a negligible effect on the mass - radius relation of strange stars . on the other hand , \n the presence of a quark matter core , reduces the radius of a neutron star by typically 20 - 30 % , which might have observable consequences @xcite . \n this reduction is caused by a softening of the eos due to the presence of a mixed phase . \n it also reduces the maximum mass of the star to about 1.5 @xmath45 . \n recently it has been speculated that quark matter at high density should be in a color superconducting phase @xcite . \n while this could have some consequences for the cooling behavior of neutron stars @xcite , it probably does not affect bulk properties , such as the mass - radius relation , since the pairing takes place only close to the fermi surface . \n although the cross section for photon - photon interaction is very small , light propagating through the universe interacts continuously with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : thermal ] photons may acquire an effective mass in a thermal medium . on the other hand , \n there are very small upper limits for the photon mass deduced from laboratory experiments ( @xmath46 ev ) and from the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath47 ev ) @xcite . \n therefore it is of interest to consider medium effects of light in the cmb . \n the photon - photon interaction of low energy photons ( @xmath48 ) can be described by an effective lagrangian @xcite _ i=- ( f _ f^)^2 + f _ f^ f _ f^ , [ euler ] where @xmath49 is the electron mass , @xmath50 the fine structure constant , and @xmath51 the field strength tensor . \n the lowest order photon self energy following from this lagrangian is shown in figure  [ fig : photon ] . \n a gauge invariant definition of the debye mass of the photon relates it to the photon self energy in the following way @xcite : @xmath53 . using ( [ photself ] ) \n one finds that the debye mass vanishes , @xmath54 . \n also the effective photon `` mass '' or plasma frequency , defined as the zero momentum limit of the dispersion relation , @xmath55 , vanishes , @xmath56 . \n hence there is no conflict with the measured upper limits of the photon mass . \n the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are also related to the photon self energy : & = & 1-=1 + , + & = & 1+=1- . \n [ perm ] from these quantities the phase velocity @xmath57 and the index of refraction @xmath58 follow as v_p===1- . [ phase_velocity ] since the temperature of the universe drops with time , the phase velocity increases continuously to its vacuum value . \n whereas it was given by @xmath59 , when radiation and matter decoupled at about @xmath60 k , it increased today at @xmath61 k to @xmath62 . \n although this is probably not a measurable effect , it is amusing to note that the speed of light is not a constant in our universe .", "StartTimeOffset": 1417876558895, "RequestID": "30033b7efc144554b8629eaea36fa6d5", "TotalTokens": 3882}
{"ContextTokens": 3740, "GeneratedTokens": 139, "SynthesizedBody": "brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to investigate dynamic magnetic phenomena . \n its power is significantly increased by numerous extensions which were added to the basic spectroscopic setup over time .    by introducing time - resolution \n , it was possible to investigate the evolution of a parametrically excited magnon gas in a ferrite film and observe the formation of a bose - einstein condensate of magnons at room temperature @xcite . \n the inclusion of space - resolution led to the discovery of important nonlinear wave phenomena such as soliton and bullet formation @xcite , the observation of spin - wave tunneling @xcite as well as spin - wave quantisation in nanoscaled structures @xcite . \n other discussed extensions comprise phase- @xcite and wave - vector resolution @xcite . \n the latter is particularly interesting since the frequency does usually not uniquely identify a wave eigenmode . due to an often complex dispersion relation the additional knowledge of the wave vector is essential .    for the investigation of spin waves in ferrite films by bls , \n wave - vector resolution was already introduced in the late 70 s @xcite . \n subsequently , many studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have copied the originally presented principle : to the bls setup in forward scattering geometry a diaphragm is added in the beam path after the sample stage ( see fig .  [ \n fig : aufbau ] ) . depending on the shape and position of the hole in the diaphragm , \n some components of the scattered laser beam which correspond to certain in - plane wave vectors are blocked while others can pass and are detected . \n the latest success of this technique was the time- and wave - vector resolved observation of a parametrically pumped magnon gas after pumping was switched off @xcite . \n it is of crucial importance for an accurate measurement of the in - plane wave - vector to calibrate the position of the diaphragm hole . \n the zero position when the elastically scattered beam passes through the diaphragm can be adjusted by sight , however this procedure is inevitably inaccurate . \n a second possibility is to calibrate the position based on the measured data : stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum lead to two distinct signals with opposing wave vectors . \n their symmetric position with respect to the center can in special cases be used for calibration . \n however , the intensities of stokes and anti - stokes peaks can differ greatly which makes this procedure difficult . \n moreover , it is unnecessarily time - consuming since the weaker of the two signal peaks determines the accuracy of the calibration and , therefore , the required measurement time though in many cases it does not yield any additional physical information about the system under investigation . \n the approach presented here uses an intrinsic calibration which is achieved by placing an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) in the optical path behind the laser light source . the small amount of modulated , frequency - shifted light plays the role of a reference beam for the wave - vector resolution . since it follows the same path as the unshifted laser light scattered inelastically from the sample but does ( in first approximation ) not undergo any inelastic scattering in the sample itself , it indicates the position where the in - plane wave vector vanishes for the measurement . \n the proposed calibration procedure has two major advantages . \n first of all , it is applicable even when one of the two signals form stokes and anti - stokes scattering is not large enough to be observed . \n this is in particular the case for surface magnetostatic spin waves . \n secondly , it potentially decreases the measurement time since the wave vector scanning does not have to be performed over the whole range of wave vectors but can ( if a symmetry is already known ) be restricted to one of the symmetric parts .    to test the validity of the presented method the in - plane wave vectors of propagating , dipole - dominated spin waves were resolved . \n the obtained results are in good quantitative agreement with theory . \n it should be remarked that electro - optical modulators have already been used to realize phase resolution @xcite and enhance the frequency resolution @xcite . \n this work adds to their increasing role for the improvement of the brillouin light scattering setup . \n the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : aufbau ] . \n the sample under investigation consisted of a @xmath0 thick yttrium - iron - garnet ( yig ) film which was tangentially magnetized by a magnetic field @xmath1 ( indicated by two pole pieces in fig . \n [ fig : aufbau ] ) . to a microstrip transducer on the surface of the yig stripe \n a @xmath2 long microwave pulse with @xmath3 carrier frequency was supplied with a @xmath4 repetition rate . \n the configuration was chosen in such a way that the microwave pulse excites a packet of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves ( bvmsw ) which propagates in the film in the direction of the bias magnetic field @xcite . \n thus , the in - plane wave vector of the excited spin waves has a well defined , unique non - zero component . \n the measurements discussed below focus on determining the wave number of this wave .    to detect the spin - wave packet light from a single mode , \n frequency - stabilized @xmath5 laser was focused on the sample close to the antenna . \n the transmitted light was sent to a ( 3 + 3)-pass tandem fabry - prot interferometer where the frequency of the light inelastically scattered from the spin waves was resolved . \n a good description of the underlying bls setup is found in @xcite . \n the existing bls setup already includes time- and space resolution in the following way : in order to probe different points of the sample , the sample is mounted on a stage which can be moved by a stepper motor . \n time resolution is achieved by measuring the time between the launch of the microwave signal pulse which excites the spin - wave packet and the detection of the scattered photons by the detector . in the current setup \n the time resolution is limited to @xmath6 due to the finesse of the fabry - prot etalons . \n a detailed account is given in @xcite . \n wave - vector resolution was added to the existing setup by placing a diaphragm with a central hole of @xmath7 diameter in the focal plane behind the collection lens . \n the diaphragm was mounted on a stage which was horizontally movable by a pc - controlled stepper motor . \n the stage was moved in steps of size @xmath8 . since the investigated spin waves possessed only one non - vanishing in - plane component of the wave - vector the chosen one - dimensional approach is sufficient for demonstration . to measure both in - plane wave - vector components an additional stage for the vertical displacement of the diaphragm \n will be added . \n the measurement principle remains , however , unchanged .    to calibrate the diaphragm position , \n an eom was placed in the beam path in front of the sample ( see fig . \n [ fig : aufbau ] ) . \n it was driven by a @xmath2 long pulse from the same microwave source that generated the spin - wave pulse . however , the eom - pulse was delayed compared to the spin - wave pulse in order to make eom and spin - wave signal clearly distinguishable in the time - resolved measurements . \n since the same microwave frequency is applied to the eom and the microstrip transducer which excites the spin waves , the resulting signal peaks in the bls spectrum coincide . \n this has two practical advantages . \n first of all , the frequency interval which is effectively scanned by the interferometer can be small . \n this reduces the overall measurement time which is particularly important for wave - vector resolved measurements . \n secondly , the eom - signal can be used as a frequency reference @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : measurement ] shows the intensity of the detected bls signal relative to the elapsed time and the displacement of the diaphragm from its initial ( arbitrary ) position . \n three signals are clearly distinguishable :    in the time interval marked in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] as @xmath9 the signal from the eom - pulse is seen . \n the time interval @xmath10 contains two signals which both stem from the propagating spin - wave packet . \n they correspond to the stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum . \n this was checked by restricting the bls measurement once to the stokes and once to the anti - stokes peak ( see inset in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] ) . \n in particular , the position of the signals corresponding to stokes and anti - stokes bls peaks exchanged their positions when the laser beam was focused on the other side of the exciting microstrip antenna where the spin - wave packet travels in the opposite direction and the spin - wave wave vector , therefore , changes sign .    to increase the signal to noise ratio \n the received counts were integrated over the time intervals @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . \n the resulting intensity distribution , which depends only on the diaphragm displacement , is shown in fig . \n [ fig : shapes ] . \n it is relatively wide because of the comparatively large pin hole in the diaphragm . \n however , this trade - off was accepted to decrease the measurement time . by fitting the experimental data with a single gaussian distribution for the eom - signal and two independent gaussian distributions with the same variance for the spin - wave signal \n , the accuracy of the measurement was enhanced . as can be seen from fig . \n [ fig : shapes ] , the fits agree well with the experimental data . \n the center of the gaussian profile which fits the eom - signal was used to calibrate the diaphragm displacement and obtain the @xmath11position for the diaphragm . \n relative to this position the deflection @xmath12 of the beam which was inelastically scattered on the spin - wave packet was determined . \n measurements were performed for different magnetic fields with the same spin - wave carrier frequency @xmath3 . \n the results are presented in fig . \n [ fig : field ] . figure  [ fig : field](a ) shows extracts corresponding to the interval @xmath10 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] which contains the information on the spin - wave wave vector . in accordance with theory an almost linear field dependence \n is seen @xcite .    in order to unambiguously resolve the signals corresponding to the stokes and anti - stokes peaks in the bls spectrum , \n separate measurements were conducted by limiting the spectral scanning to one of the two spectral positions ( panel ( b ) ) .    from the data , \n the spin - wave wave number @xmath13 is obtained using the bragg - condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave number of the incoming laser light and @xmath16 is the angle between the elastically and inelastically scattered light which is determined by the focal length @xmath17 of the collection length and the measured deflection @xmath12 of the spin - wave signal . \n the experimentally found spin - wave numbers @xmath13 are combined in fig . \n [ fig : field](c ) with theoretical calculations based on the damon - eshbach formula for the lowest order bvmsw mode @xcite . \n the solid line has been calculated based on the measured field value , a film thickness of @xmath0 and a saturation magnetisation @xmath18 . in comparison , \n the dashed line is the result of a fit , where the film thickness and the magnetic field were taken as fit parameters . \n the optimal value found for the thickness was @xmath19 , the magnetic field was adjusted by a shift @xmath20 relative to the experimentally measured field @xmath1 . \n both deviations are within reasonable range . \n the film thickness is not known with sufficient accuracy and is in general assumed as a fit parameter . \n the experimentally measured magnetic field does not take into account any contributions from the crystalline anisotropy . \n overall , the theoretical curves agree well with experiment . \n the measurements indicate that the film thickness at the point of the laser focus was less than the nominal @xmath0 . \n the presented results confirm the validity of the eom - assisted wave - vector resolution measurement procedure . \n the eom allows an easy , intrinsic calibration with the same resolution as the actual measurement . \n the calibration does not rely on any symmetry in the observed peaks and can be performed even when the scanning is restricted to one side of the bls spectrum . \n the widely adjustable intensity of the eom beam guarantees a minimal expenditure of time to obtain a large enough signal for the analysis .    in principle \n , the eom beam can be used to calibrate the diaphragm prior to the experiment . \n instead , in the presented work the eom reference was applied parallel to the actual measurement . \n this is a natural solution whenever the pulse regime is required because of other experimental restrictions . \n the reference eom beam is applied during the dead time of the cycle so that the overall duration of the experiment is not increased and measurement as well as calibration are completed in a single run . \n the experiments confirmed the applicability of the diaphragm - based approach to wave - vector resolution for the measurement of small wave numbers . \n the method is not the only way to go in this regime . \n it is also possible to measure the spin - wave wavelength by using phase resolution @xcite . \n however , this method relies on the scanning of the sample which does , in terms of measurement time not yield any advantages . \n moreover , it is only applicable in the case of a single spin wave propagating under homogeneous external conditions - fast temporal or spatial variations of the wave number can not be resolved . \n the same draw - backs apply to other interference - based methods using , for instance , inductive probes .    for the diaphragm - approach these limitations do not apply : since the method relies on the measurement at a single point on the sample , inhomogeneities in the sample do not play any role . \n as has been seen above , it is even possible to distinguish waves with the same wave - number modulus but travelling in opposite directions .    in combination with the time - resolution it is possible to resolve the wave - number evolution . \n this is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fourier ] where the measured wave vector distribution for different time intervals is presented when the front of the spin - wave packet passed the laser spot .    the integrated signal from the interval marked as @xmath21 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] is presented in panel  ( i ) . \n the observed peak with an experimentally measured wave number of @xmath22 corresponds to the thermally excited uniform mode in the sample . \n panels  ( ii)-(iv ) contain the measured wave - vector distributions for three consecutive , @xmath23 long time intervals at the moment when the front of the pulse passed the laser spot and was detected . \n these time slices are taken from the interval denoted by @xmath24 in fig . \n [ fig : measurement ] . \n panel  ( v ) finally shows the wave - vector distribution for interval @xmath10 when the measured signal intensity and the wave - vector distribution have reached a stable regime . by comparing the panels , the different wave - number contributions at the front of the pulse due to the dispersion of the spin - wave packet can be distinguished . \n it is in qualitative agreement with the phase profile of a linear spin - wave packet , which exhibits characteristic distortions at the front and end of the pulse @xcite . \n in conclusion , we have improved the existing wave - vector resolution used in brillouin light scattering experiments by including an electro - optical modulator as a reference to calibrate the position of the diaphragm hole . \n the eom beam makes it possible to determine the position where the in - plane wave vector vanishes with an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the actual wave - vector measurement itself . for experiments conducted in the pulse regime , the proposed method does not increase the measurement time but even cuts it in half under optimum conditions . \n the applicability of the eom - based calibration was tested by measuring the wave vectors of a propagating packet of dipole - dominated spin - waves for different bias magnetic fields with time resolution . \n comparison with the established theory showed a good agreement . \n this work has been financially supported by the matcor graduate school of excellence , the graduiertenkolleg 792 , and the dfg within the sfb / trr 49 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1427107161074, "RequestID": "ecc8357baeab4113a2d199064e67c796", "TotalTokens": 3879}
{"ContextTokens": 2116, "GeneratedTokens": 91, "SynthesizedBody": "there are two main advantages of studying asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the galaxies of the local group ( lg ) . \n first that we are able using the current instrumentation to resolve their stellar content and second that these stars can be considered to be approximately all at the same distance . \n recent studies of agb stars in the magellanic clouds allowed us to gain insight into the near  infrared ( near  ir ) stellar content of the galaxies , their surface distribution and the ratio between carbon  rich ( c  rich ) and oxygen  rich ( o  rich , m  type ) \n agb stars easily statistically distinguished in the colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) . \n more recent near  ir observations of other galaxies in the local group have been analyzed to tell us similar informations . \n among the latest near  ir instruments denis and 2mass have released a large amount of data on agb stars in the magellanic clouds . in particular in the denis catalogue towards the magellanic clouds ( dcmc  cioni et al . \n 2000a ) there are @xmath2 agb stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and @xmath3 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , of which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are c  rich . \n blanco et al . ( 1983 ) estimated about @xmath6 and @xmath7 c  rich stars in the lmc and smc , respectively . accounting for about @xmath8 misclassification among the m01 stars below the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) which are missed by our selection criteria based on the near  ir colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , we detect most of the agb stars in both galaxies . \n infact we detect about the same c stars found by kontizas et al . \n ( 2001 ) in the lmc ( @xmath9 ) and those @xmath10 found by rebeirot et al . \n ( 1983 ) in the smc . \n agb stars are easily distinguished in the cmd ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) as the plume of objects above the trgb redder of a given line that discriminates between the younger and older populations ( cioni et al . \n these agb stars distribute smoothly over the surface of the clouds in contrast with the bar  like and patchy distribution of the younger stars . in the cmd ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) c  rich agb stars occupy a red branch compared to the location of o  rich stars . \n the distribution of the ratio between c  rich and o  rich ( c / m ratio ) agb stars outlines in the lmc a ring  like structure of increasing values ( cioni & habing 2003 ) . because the c / m ratio is a strong indicator of metallicity the first global evidence that there is a radial metallicity gradient in the lmc \n was found . \n the ratio is patchy and irregularly distributed in the smc . by fitting the distribution of points ( log(@xmath13 ) versus [ fe / h ] ) in other galaxies of the lg a metallicity spread of about @xmath14 dex within each cloud \n was derived . \n the larger uncertainty remains in the calibration and scatter of this relation . \n based on the results obtained in the magellanic clouds i started in collaboration with habing a near  infrared campaign from the la palma observatory to mosaic other galaxies of the lg in @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 . \n the goal is to find , study and compare the agb stellar population . \n fig.1 shows : the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) diagram for all the sources detected within an area of @xmath16 centered on ngc6822 ( a ) , the histogram of the @xmath0 colour at about @xmath17 mag above the trgb where the dashed line discriminates between o  rich and c  rich agb stars ( b ) , and the histograms of @xmath15 ( c ) and @xmath1 ( d ) where the dashed line indicates the approximate location of the trgb . in ngc6822 we detect about @xmath18 c stars , approximately @xmath19 more than letarte et al . \n ( 2002 ) , and @xmath20 m stars . \n the distribution of the whole agb population is shown in fig.2 while fig.3 shows the distribution of the c / m ratio . using the same relation discussed in sect.2 \n we derive that the gray scale and the contours span a range of 1.65 dex in [ fe / h ] . \n contrary to nowotny et al . \n ( 2003 ) we do detect regions with a different c / m ratio . \n note that in the @xmath1 band the differential reddening is negligible and that foreground stars have been removed . \n the striking difference between the two figures indicates the potential of the c / m ratio to study the chemical history of galaxies . \n similar figures , though with less statistics have been obtained for ngc147 and ngc185 . \n observations of draco have just been reduced and unfortunately the observations of leoa , leoi and leoii took place during variable sky conditions which considerably affect the quality of the resulting cmds .    in the southern hemisphere the central region of a few galaxies has been observed using sofi at the ntt in the near  ir wave bands by tolstoy back in 1998 . \n the cmds of ddo210 , fornax , sagdig and pegasus show clear red giant branches reaching in fornax the red clump . \n these galaxies are not rich in agb stars especially of c type except pegasus that shows a plum of objects with quite red @xmath0 colours . \n these relatively deep data are probably suitable to derive the metallicity and the age of the observed region ( about @xmath21 ) from the slope and colour of the rgb as in davidge ( 2003 ) \n . new observations of these and other galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere took place at the end of july 2003 in collaboration also with reijkuba . \n the wealth of near  ir data on galaxies in the local group either than the magellanic clouds will definitely benefit from the latest theoretical results by marigo et al . \n the authors were able to successfully model the red tail of c stars producing a synthetic ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) diagram in very good agreement with the observational data . \n the key ingredient is to assume an opacity that in cool stars varies with the chemical composition in addition to the assumption of a given pulsation mode ( the first overtone for c stars ) . \n large scale informations on agb stars in the magellanic clouds , ngc6822 , ngc147 and ngc185 have been discussed : their location in the near  ir cmd , their spatial distribution and that of the c / m ratio . \n the latter is an important abundance indicator , especially for those systems too far away to measure abundances with other tracers . in the near future \n we will complete the reduction of complementary i  band measurements , try to complete the observations of some targets not yet fully mosaiced and to continue a monitoring program ( in the i  band ) that will provide us with an indication about the variability of the target stars . \n ultimately we count on publishing homogeneous catalogues of agb variables that will be useful to the whole community to perform stellar population studies in these relatively nearby galaxies . \n blanco v.m . \n , mccarthy m.f . , 1983 , aj 88 , 1442 cioni m .- r.l . , habing h.j . , 2003 , \n a&a 402 , 133 cioni m .- r.l . \n ,

'' \n such non - radiating accretion flows are capable of ejecting gas away from the black hole @xcite . \n accretion in these disks is inefficient with significant fractions of the gas supplied at large radii being ejected from the system . \n an important feature of collapsar disks , is the realization at sufficiently high accretion rates ( @xmath4 ) of temperatures ( @xmath5 k ) and densities ( @xmath6 gm @xmath2 ) at which the loss of thermal energy to neutrino emission and photodisintegration of heavy nuclei allows for accretion with a range of efficiency . \n macfadyen & woosley @xcite showed that collapsar disks eject comparable amounts of material in a wind as is accreted by the central black hole . \n the fraction of accreted gas depends on the efficiency of neutrino cooling at removing entropy from the accreting gas . \n the remainder is ejected from the black hole as an outflowing wind . \n recent semi - analytic work @xcite has mapped the parameter space of inefficient neutrino - cooled accretion in agreement with detailed calculations of @xcite for limited parameters .    of particular interest in the case of collapsars is the chemical composition of the wind . \n collapsar disks are hot enough to completely photodisintegrate heavy nuclei to free nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) . \n recent simulations @xcite and @xcite show expulsion of free nucleon gas in the wind . \n this is important for two reasons : 1 ) energetics : free nucleons combining to iron group nuclei ( e.g. nickel-56 ) release 8 mev / nucleon or @xmath7 erg per solar mass of recombined material . \n 2 ) observability : this ejected material provides a long term energy supply to the explosion ( through radioactive decay of @xmath0ni ) enabling the gas to shine on time scales of months . \n models of the light curve of the energetic and peculiar type ibc supernova sn1998bw require large quantities of @xmath0ni ( m(@xmath0ni ) @xmath8 ) @xcite@xcite . \n conventional models require large explosion energies to produce sufficient nickel and fit the light curve . \n in addition abnormally high expansion velocities were inferred from the unusual spectrum indicating a large explosion energy ( @xmath9 erg ) . \n several groups have also interpreted deviations from power law decay of grb optical transients as supernovae light curve components and have matched them with appropriately shifted 1998bw light curves @xcite . \n since supernovae are invoked to interpret these observations it is important to note that a stellar explosion ( e.g. , jets piercing a star ) is not necessarily a supernova . \n supernovae , as an observable phenomenon , require a persistent source of energy input to power a light curve for long times ( weeks to months ) . \n it is necessary to make @xmath0ni in the explosion so that radioactive decay ( to cobalt to iron ) injects energy into the gas so that it can shine . lacking a persistent source of energy input , \n a stellar explosion would be unobservable via electromagnetic radiation . \n explosion energy released in the optically thick star would simply be converted to expansion kinetic energy with little or no light emitted .    in conventional core collapse supernovae \n some nickel is thought to be produced via explosive nuclear burning behind the explosion shock . \n however , current models for these `` delayed '' supernova explosions have trouble producing the @xmath10 erg for a normal supernova ( in fact , some current models fail to get any explosion at all ! ) and are unlikely to be capable of producing the higher energies required for 1998bw . \n as we have seen , neutrino cooling and photodisintegration of heavy nuclei are crucial for allowing gas to accrete efficiently . \n the neutrino cooling depends sensitively on temperature ( e.g. , @xmath11 for neutrino losses due to pair capture on free nucleons ) and therefore on the radius where the disk forms . \n this radius is , in turn , dependent on the angular momentum of the accreting gas with the disk first forming at the kepler radius @xmath12 cm , where @xmath13 is the specific angular momentum of the accreting gas in units of @xmath14 @xmath15 s@xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mass of the central black hole in units of three solar masses . the virial temperature for gas falling to its kepler radius @xmath18 k , where @xmath19 is the proton mass and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant . in terms of gravitational radii , @xmath21 \n , this temperature is @xmath22 k ( assuming a newtonian potential ) , where @xmath23 . \n we see that gas with @xmath24 is heated to above @xmath25 k so that it is fully photodisintegrated to free neutrons and protons from it s original composition of silicon , oxygen and helium . \n this means that capture of electron - positron pairs onto the free neutrons and protons serves as an efficient neutrino emission process which cools the gas and helps it to accrete efficiently . \n gas with @xmath26 , however , heats to less then @xmath27 k. at these lower temperatures the heavy nuclei fail to photodisintegrate and pair capture neutrino cooling is suppressed . \n this gas is therefor poorly cooled and subject to being driven from the disk . \n it is worth noting that gas with @xmath28 is partially photodisintegrated . \n photodisintegration acts as a loss for thermal energy for the gas and thus is effectively a cooling process , robbing about @xmath29 erg of thermal energy from every gram of photodisintegrated nuclei . \n this process helps the gas to accrete and provides free nucleons which enhance the neutrino cooling . \n the above discussion assumed @xmath30 though the scaling with @xmath17 is apparent . \n s@xmath16 . a wind ( the striped region in the upper right ) \n is blown from the collapsar disk at speeds of up to @xmath31 km s@xmath16 . \n the wind is composed of free neutrons and protons which can recombine to iron group elements injecting @xmath32 erg per @xmath33 m@xmath34 of reassembled nucleons . @xmath0ni in the wind can power a long term `` supernova '' light curve via radioactive decay of nickel and cobalt . \n the black solid arrows indicate the velocity of the gas flow while the thick dashed lines represent neutrino emission . the wind is shown only in the upper right quadrant for clarity but is in reality present in all four quadrants . ] \n interestingly , energy lost to photodisintegration becomes available again if the gas is ejected from the disk and begins to reassemble . \n effectively , gravitational energy is temporarily stored in the freeing of nucleons from the heavy nuclei . \n these nucleons are volatile in the sense that the have a huge nuclear energy source if they manage to escape the energetic photons trapped in the ( optically thick ) accretion disk \n . accretion physics may provide the nucleons with opportunity to escape the disk s nuclei - disintegrating photon bath . \n once free they can quickly recover nuclear binding energy by reassembling into iron group elements . \n this process can be explosive since the nuclei may recombine in seconds compared to millions of years it took them to assemble ( burn ) the first time around during the slower pre - explosion nuclear burning stages . \n in fact the reassembly , plus the kinetic luminosity of the disk wind , may power extremely energetic explosions . \n sn1998bw may be an example . \n the collapsar model relies on rapid accretion into the central black hole to power relativistic jets which pierce the star and make a grb and afterglow via internal and external shocks . \n it is notable that for an interesting range of angular momentum the accretion of the star simultaneously feeds the black hole rapidly and powers a wind @xcite . \n there are several interesting regimes determined by the angular momentum present in the collapsing star :    the following values of angular momentum correspond to important transition radii in the accretion flow :    @xmath35 angular momentum of the innermost stable circular orbit . \n this is the minimum angular momentum needed to form a disk around a black hole . \n @xmath36 angular momentum of gas that falls deep enough in the gravitational potential to photodisintegrate the heavy nuclei to free nucleons activating pair capture neutrino emission as an efficient coolant . \n @xmath37 angular momentum of gas that falls deep enough to cool partially . \n some gas accretes and some is expelled in a wind . \n the relative amount depends on the exact value of @xmath38    \\1 . \n @xmath39 - efficient neutrino cooling allows rapid accretion into black hole with plenty of power potentially going into jets with little or no outflows expected . \n this kind of star would not be expected to produce a bright supernova since little or no @xmath0ni is expected to be present in the exploding star . \n a possible caveat is that there is some nickel production via explosion burning in the lateral jet shock but the temperature is low in this region and not much mass is involved . \n @xmath40 - some gas accretes and some is ejected in a wind rates can be comparable depending on j. this can make both a grb and a `` supernova ''    \\3 . @xmath41 \n gas does nt cool efficiently so does nt feed the hole rapidly . not good for making an accretion powered grb . \n outflows may results with some recombination nickel possible if some gas is heated above @xmath27 k by a combination of virialization and viscous dissipation . of interest here \n is explosive burning of centrifugally supported oxygen . \n a less interesting regime is @xmath42 for which the gas falls directly to the innermost stable circular orbit without forming an accretion disk . \n note that electromagnetic extraction of black hole spin energy is a possible source of jet energy even for `` slowly '' accreting black holes . \n convective motions may even be favorable for building up large magnetic fields needed to extract the hole spin energy . \n as stellar gas collapses onto the collapsar accretion disk , adiabatic compression and shocks can raise the temperature sufficiently to photodisintegrate the gas to alpha particles and free nucleons . \n the destruction of the heavy nuclei is an energy sink for the gas which is helpful in allowing accretion to occur . \n photodisintegration of heavy nuclei ( e.g. , silicon , oxygen in the collapsing core ) costs @xmath43 per unit mass where @xmath44 ( or 8 mev / nucleon ) for complete disintegration to free nucleons . \n gas falling in a gravitational potential can dissipate its accretion energy by swapping nuclear binding energy for gravitational binding energy . \n a measure of where this occurs is where the gravitational binding energy equals the nuclear binding energy @xmath45 . \n if gas near the equator falls to it s keplerian radius the other half goes into the kinetic energy of keplerian rotation so @xmath46 .    measuring radius in gravitational radii @xmath47 where @xmath48 we can define a photodisintegration radius @xmath49 . we thus expect photodisintegration to `` cool '' accreting gas when falls to a radius of @xmath50 . \n the above scenario assumes significant viscosity in the disk gas corresponding to a shakura - sunyaev alpha viscosity parameter @xmath51 . \n the temperature and density of the disk wind and hence the nucleosynthesis depend on the disk viscosity . \n observations of the supernova powered by a collapsar wind may therefor help to constrain the viscosity of the collapsar accretion disk . \n recent calculations of the neutron abundance in one - dimensional accretion disk models relevant to grbs @xcite indicate that the inner parts of collapsar accretion disks may be too neutron rich to produce significant quantities of nickel-56 @xcite@xcite . \n outflows from these inner regions may instead be of interest for rare nucleosynthesis like the r - process . however , much of the mass loss from grb accretion disks ( collapsars and otherwise ) may come from the outer regions of the disks where electron capture has not significantly neutronized the material composing the outflow . \n collapsar disks may have more than one active wind blowing region : 1 . the outer disk where low densities imply non - degenerate electrons and little neutron excess ( @xmath52 ) . radioactive nickel-56 may result from nucleosynthesis taking place in as this wind expands . \n 2 . the innermost disk where the disk becomes optically thick to neutrino emission and is again poorly cooled . \n this innermost disk wind is significantly neutronized and will not produce nickel-56 . however , it is an interesting site for the r - process because of the large neutron fraction and large entropies attained from viscous dissipation .    in between these two disk regions , \n the disk is ( partially ) neutrino - cooled and most ( but not necessarily all ) of the gas can accrete . \n this region of the disks transports the fraction of gas received from the outer , i.e. the gas not ejected in the wind , plus gas falling onto the neutrino - cooled region of the disk . \n fruchter , a.  2002 , american physical society , april meeting , jointly sponsored with the high energy astrophysics division ( head ) of the american astronomical society april 20 -

{"ContextTokens": 4031, "GeneratedTokens": 350, "SynthesizedBody": "in standard cosmology it is assumed that the space - time is homogeneous and isotropic . \n after the discovery of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and accelerating expansion of the universe , a standard cosmological model describing universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) is formulated , known as @xmath0cdm model or cosmic concordance model . \n fluctuations in the temperature of cmb radiation are statistically isotropic in this model @xcite . \n a central assumption in our standard model of cosmology ( and in most cosmological models ) is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic upto small perturbations , and thus described by a perturbed freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric . \n obersevations show that the temperature of the cmb is isotropic to a remarkable degree indicating that our universe is close to an friedmann - lemaitre ( fl ) model . \n according to ehlers , geren and sachs ( egs ) theorem @xcite , if the cmb temperature were exactly isotropic about every point in spacetime , then the universe would have to be exactly an fl model . \n this result is not directly applicable to cmb , because , cmb radiation is not exactly isotropic . \n the presence of temperature anisotropies in the cmb from the observations made by cobe / wmap satellites are inconsistent with an exact homogeneous and isotropic frw model @xcite . \n the current cmb data supports an inflationary big bang model of cosmic origin for our universe . \n however at large angular scales , there are some anomalies observed in cmb data , such as , a low value for quadrupole power , alignment of quadrupole and octopole modes roughly in the direction of virgo cluster , ecliptic north - south power asymmetry , parity asymmetry between even and odd multipoles , almost zero correlations on large angular scales of cmb and an anomalous cold spot ( @xmath1 diameter ) in the southern galactic hemisphere of cmb sky @xcite . several solutions to the low multipole cmb anomalies \n have been put forth such as foregrounds / systematics , anisotropic space - times and exotic topologies @xcite . \n some of these supposed deviations seen in cmb data were addressed by the wmap and planck science teams also @xcite . \n these deviations may be an evidence that we live in a globally anisotropic universe .    generally , in a global anisotropic universe , during inflation , shear decreases and eventually it goes over to an isotropic phase with negligible shear @xcite . in order to produce any substantial amount of shear in recent times \n one needs to induce anisotropy in the spacetime . \n one way to induce anisotropy is to have anisotropic matter present at the last scattering surface . \n it was shown earlier that the power suppression in cmb quadrupole , without affecting higher multipoles , can be explained by assuming anisotropic matter ( magnetic fields ) @xcite . \n earlier works on anisotropic cosmological models with anisotropic stresses can be found , for example , in ref . \n anisotropic dark energy as a possible solution to the cosmic acceleration as well as the large scale cmb anomalies is studied , for example , in ref . \n the anisotropic sources can be a uniform magnetic field , cosmic strings or domain walls \n . a nanogauss scale magnetic field could be present today which would have been produced during inflation due to a lorentz - violating term to the photon sector @xcite . \n we call this as `` lorentz violation generated magnetic field ( lvmf ) '' . other possibilities such as a maxwell type vector field coupled to a scalar field \n is studied , for example , in ref . \n @xcite .    in this paper \n our approach is not to deal with metric approach directly , but rather to adhere to an approach similar to orthonormal frame formalism @xcite . \n this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : bianchii ] , we write down the einstein s equations in cosmic time . \n geodesic equations in cosmic time are studied in section [ sec : geodesic ] . in section [ sec : \n fixedpoint ] , we do a fixed point analysis of all the evolution equations in terms of a dimensionless time variable ( @xmath2 ) , to study the asymptotic evolution of the state observables . \n then , in section [ sec : cmbpattern ] , we show the temperature patterns for cmb due to various anisotropic sources considered in our study . \n a more realistic model including the ordinary dark matter and dark energy components in addition to the anisotropic sources already considered , is studied in section [ sec : realscenario ] . in section [ sec : snconstr ] , we obtain the constrains on the fractional energy densites due to various components in the realistic model of the previous section , the level of shear , and also determine a preferred axis if present . \n finally , we conclude our work in section [ sec : conclusion ] . \n the way we study dynamical systems is that we first write evolution equations in terms of few dimensionless state observables . \n it is a very invaluable tool to obtain qualitative information about the solutions of the state space of bianchi universes ( see ref . \n @xcite and references therein ) . here \n we concentrate only on bianchi  i model . \n first we derive the einstein equations in metric approach . \n then we write in terms of the state observables analogous to the orthonormal frame formalism @xcite . in this approach \n one writes the field equations as first order differential equations . \n an advantage of this orthonormal frame approach is that the derivation of geodesic equation is easy compared to the metric approach . \n we start with a bianchi  i line element with a residual planar symmetry in the @xmath3 plane as @xmath4 we choose the diagonal energy momentum tensor of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n the four kinds of anisotropic matter we study here are given in table  [ tabl : matter ] . \n the magnetic field configuration considered here as anisotropic source is well known @xcite . \n we , then consider a particular configuration of infinite domain walls ( spanning the @xmath3 plane ) stacked along the @xmath8axis . in this case , average energy momentum tensor will take the form we just described . \n similarly , the average energy momentum tensor due to a distribution of long , thin , straight cosmic strings along @xmath8axis which takes an anisotropic form , also serves as anisotropic matter source @xcite . \n finally , a magnetic field generated due to a lorentz - violating term in the photon sector , which we call lvmf in short , is also studied as an anisotropic source @xcite . \n .matter content for different anisotropic sources considered in this paper . [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ] \n here we studied the evolution of bianchi - i universe in the presence of different types of anisotropic matter sources . \n first we analyzed the evolution of the state space variables @xmath9 in cosmic time . \n depending on the initial conditions we found that there can be a sign change in the shear . \n this may have some interesting implications in early universe cosmology . \n then we examined the evolution of dimensionless variables viz . \n , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in dimensionless time @xmath2 . in the @xmath13frame \n , we determined the fixed points of the full set of evolution equations including the geodesic equations . \n we also checked the stability of the fixed points numerically . in terms of @xmath2 variable , we get an analytic expression for the temperature anisotropies of the cmbr . \n then we generated the temperature patterns of the cmb for the four different types of anisotropic matter considered here . \n we found that the contribution to the cmb temperature signal is mainly through the quadrupole . \n we also pointed out the difference between the cmb tempearture maps due to all cases of anoisotropic matter considered in this work . \n we then investigated a more realistic scenario where we included ordinary isotropic dark matter and cosmological constant as dark energy . \n we found that the universe asymptotically evolves to a desitter universe . \n we also constrained the parameters of this model using supernovae union  2 data . \n we also found a preferred axis from the data for all the four cases of anisotropic matter . \n this anisotropy axis is found to be same independent of the anisotropic source we used . \n it turns out that this axis is very close to the mirror symmetry axis found in cmb data @xcite \n .    it will be interesting to generalise our results to other bianchi classes - a and b. in case of other bianchi models the state space would be larger and we need to find different subspace of the state space and their stable fixed points . \n it will also be interesting to study the cmb polarisation anisotropy in these models . \n +   + * acknowledgements * : s.t . would like to acknowledge department of science and technology , india for financial support . \n hinshaw g. et al . , 2003 , \n apjs , 148 , 135 ;

out temperature from the slope of transverse momentum distributions by assuming some radial flow profile . \n naturally , it is therefore motivating to see how this scenario can be adopted by more realistic models , where a full three - dimensional hydrodynamical evolution is taken into account . in this work , \n we present results of hydrodynamical model calculations , inspired by this picture . \n the hydrodynamical model we employed is based on smoothed particle hydrodynamic(sph ) algorithm@xcite , in this model , the matter flow is parametrized in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates , of the so - called sph particles . as a result \n , the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations . \n the code which implements the entropy representation of the sph model for relativistic high energy collisions , and which has been developed within the so paulo - rio de janeiro collaboration , is called spherio . \n as it has been shown , the model is an efficient and robust method to tackle the problems concerning relativistic high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , which are characterized by highly asymmetrical configurations . \n it has been successfully used to investigate the effects of the initial - condition fluctuations and adopting the continuous emission scenario for the description of decoupling process @xcite .    in the present calculation , \n the model has been further improved in order to consider strangeness conservation and to adopt the scenario of cfo . the strangeness conservation is implemented by explicitly incorporating strangeness chemical potential into the code , and correspondingly a different set of equation of state(eos ) has been built and utilized . as a good approximation , we assume local strangeness neutrality throughout the hydro evolution .    to adopt the picture of cfo , as a first step , we take a simple postulate that for strange hadrons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the cfo takes place immediately after they are completely hadronized . \n these particles cease to have inelastic collisions and therefore their abundances are fixed and determined only by partonic eos . instead of introducing a specific temperature , \n cfo is incorporated in a simple and parameter - free approach . \n this is inspired by the earlier estimation from statistical model@xcite that cfo takes place close to the phase transition region . \n it is also because at this point , we would like first to check whether the picture of cfo would qualitatively improve the result of hydrodynamic model without going into the details of parameters . \n with the system being cooled and rarefied further , the thermal freeze - out occurs at a lower temperature @xmath4 which serves as an adjustable parameter in our calculation . \n as in the previous calculations , we use nexus event generator to produce event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions . we make use of a rescaling factor@xcite to fix the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in the present calculation , we introduce another parameter @xmath5 which provides initial transverse velocity in addition to the one provided by nexus . \n the reason for the introduction of @xmath5 is because nexus almost does not provide any initial transverse velocity . \n thus the initial transverse expansion reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial distance from orgin .      as a preliminary application \n , we have calculated the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in fig.1 , we present the pseudo - rapidity distribution for the most central au+au collisions at 200a gev . \n the experimental data are from phobos collab , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev . \n we show in fig.2 , the experimental transverse momentum distribution data for all charged particles , which can be well reproduced with a choice of @xmath8@xmath9 and freeze - out temperature @xmath10 mev . \n the experimental data are from star collab@xcite , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev , with @xmath11 .        with the parameters chosen , in the following , we calculate the spectra for various hadrons . in fig.3 \n we show the transverse mass spectra of pions , protons and kaons for most central collisions at mid rapidity , as well as experimental data from brahms collab@xcite . \n the same spectra for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are depicted in fig.4 , together with data from star collab@xcite . \n we use dotted lines to represent the results obtained without incorporating cfo , and solid lines for those with cfo switched on . \n it is observed that the present hydrodynamic model gives good description of the experimental transverse momentum spectra for pions , kaons and protons even without turning on cfo for these particles . \n although it gives the correct slopes for the spectra of strange hyperons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the disagreement comes from the multiplicities of the spectra . by introducing cfo , \n those results are improved significantly . while the spectra for pions , kaons and protons almost remain the same , ( this is not shown in the figures . ) \n it provides a good fit of strange hyperons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the cfo amplifies the multiplicities of strange hadrons with respect to the ones in the original model owing to higher cfo temperature , as compared with the thermal freeze out one . \n meanwhile the slopes of the spectra remain unchanged . \n it was indicated experimentally in ref.@xcite , as one goes to large rapidity region where the baryon density differs sizably from zero , the outcome of cfo would be much more significant . \n further work on this topic is under progress . \n it is worth noting that the effect of cfo has been discussed by several authors . in ref@xcite , the early cfo \n is studied in term of hybrid model where the hydodynamic evolution is complemented with a hadronic cascade model . \n the pure hydrodynamic evolution calculation has been carried out either only in the transverse plane assuming bjorken s scaling@xcite or with the baryon chemical potential taken to be zero@xcite . \n j. cleymans and h. satz , z. phys . \n * c57 * ( 1993 ) 135 p. braun -

1999 ) of data in the 94 galactic bulge fields . \n the data that are currently available for the analysis consist of 5 seasons ( 1993 - 1997 ) in 77 fields , and contain the photometry of about 30 million stars , including 2.1 million clump giants . \n the events with clump giants as sources have been selected from the sample of all events which contains about @xmath5 candidates . \n the determination of which of these sources are clump giants , is investigated through the analysis of the global properties of the color - magnitude diagram in the galactic bulge . \n using the accurately measured extinction towards baade s window allows one to locate _ \n clump giants on the reddening - free color - magnitude diagram . \n this defines the parallelogram - shaped box in the upper left corner of the left panel of figure 1 . with the assumption that the clump populations in the whole bulge have the same properties as the ones in the baade s window \n , the parallelogram described above can be shifted by the reddening vector to mark the expected locations of clump giants in different fields . \n the solid lines are the boundaries of the region where one could find the clump giants in fields with different extinctions . using this approach \n , we identified 52 clump events . \n there is a high concentration of long - duration events in macho field 104 at @xmath0 as 5 out of 10 clump events longer than 50 days are in 104 . \n the analysis of event durations _ uncorrected _ for efficiencies provides a lower limit on the difference between field 104 and all the other fields . \n we use the wilcoxon s test on two samples : events in field 104 and all the remaining ones , and find that the events in 104 differ ( are longer ) at the level of @xmath6 . \n in addition , field 104 also has the highest optical depth ( see figure 1 ) . \n both of these features can be explained by the concentration of mass along this particular line of sight . \n first , we report the average optical depth of : @xmath7 which is 1.5 - 2 times lower than the previously obtained values . \n we caution that this result is only preliminary , because possible systematic errors may be a fair fraction of the statistical error . \n we also note that about 40% of the optical depth is in the events longer than 50 days . \n this is at odds with standard models of the galactic structure and kinematics . \n second , we plot in the right panel of figure 1 the spatial distribution of the optical depth . \n the variation of the optical depth is dominated by the poisson noise . \n the gradient of the optical depth is stronger in @xmath8 than in @xmath9 direction . \n again , we note the anomalous character of field 104 . it is marked with a black square and has an optical depth of @xmath10 . \n we presented first results from the analysis of five years of microlensing data toward the galactic bulge collected by the macho collaboration . \n it is possible to select an unbiased sample of clump events based only on an event s position on the color - magnitude diagram . \n ten out of 52 clump events have durations @xmath11 days , which implies that @xmath12% of the optical depth is in the long events . \n this is surprising , because long events are the most likely a result of the disk - disk lensing ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 ) , while clump giants trace the bar rather than the inner disk ( stanek et al . \n field 104 centered on @xmath13 is anomalous : it has longer events and substantially higher optical depth . both effects can be explained simultaneously by a concentration of mass along this line of sight . \n the optical depth averaged over the clump giants in 77 fields is @xmath14 at @xmath15 . \n when anomalous field 104 is removed , the optical depth drops to @xmath2 , which is fully consistent with infrared -

to - one transformation from one graph to another : each pair of nodes linked ( not linked ) in one graph is linked ( not linked ) in another graph . \n such a quantity is a topological invariant . \n however , actually we can be never sure if the quantity proposed as the invariant has indeed the above discriminating property . \n while its different values certainly mean different graph structures , the same value does not allow to claim that the graphs are indeed topologically identical . \n in many cases , the proposed quantity appears to be degenerate , i.e. its value is the same for different graphs . \n all that remains true for unlabeled trees , which are graphs without cyclic paths and without loops .    in a series of papers , schultz et al . proposed and evaluated some scalar quantities as candidates to be topological invariants for trees @xcite . \n this work was motivated by a chemical application of the constructed quantities , which were found to increase monotonically with the melting temperature of alkanes . \n however , almost all proposed invariants were found to be degenerate . on the other hand , \n the last proposed invariant is a real number and not integer , and the comparison of its value must rely on the numerical accuracy . \n here we propose a new candidate as a topological invariant for unlabeled trees . \n unlike the quantities discussed previously , this is a set of matrices and not a single number . \n the advantage is that the matrices are ordered in a simple way , and the ordering algorithm works in polynomial time . on the other hand , to state that two trees are topologically identical we compare all the matrix elements . \n this modification is expected to enhance the discriminative force of the proposed invariant . \n we use the obtained criterion to calculate the number of topologically non -

to - leading order ( nlo ) results are quite close . \n the only difference between the two predictions is the ( expected ) reduced scale dependence at nlo . \n the method to extract @xmath0 is now quite simple : we minimize the @xmath8 to fit the theory to the data in fig \n . 1 between 30 gev @xmath9 200 gev by varying both @xmath0 and @xmath3 . the results and , more importantly , the interpretation are discussed in the next section . \n note that we do not consider the systematic uncertainties at this point . \n they can be easily included in the @xmath8-fit by building up the correlation matrix out of the systematic uncertainties @xcite . \n their inclusion is better left to the experimenters . \n here we want to concentrate on the methodology . \n [ fig2 ]    in fig . \n 2a we show the results of the minimalization procedure to fit to the data . both the minimum and the 1-@xmath10 uncertainty ellipse is shown . \n the figure contains all the information we can extract from the data . while the central value is quite trivial to determine , the interpretation of the uncertainty is not . \n the perfect answer ( that is no renormalization scale uncertainty ) would be a vertical strip . \n the uncertainty would then simply be the width of the strip independent of the choice of @xmath3 . \n however , in fixed order perturbative qcd we have a residual scale sensitivity due to the truncation of the series . \n this is reflected in the slope of the ellipse - axis . \n in fact one could argue that the slope is the correct measure of the theoretical uncertainty . when comparing results from different experiments this slope could be used to weight different experiments on their theoretical uncertainty . \n this all implies that the parameter @xmath3 can not be considered a fitting parameter as @xmath0 is , nor is it in a direct manner related to the theoretical uncertainty . \n note that when the data accuracy increases ( e.g. the cdf / d0 run 1b data ) the fit of the theory to the data will become more strained and the variation of @xmath3 will become more constrained . \n this does not indicate that the theoretical uncertainty is decreasing . on the contrary , this means that the nlo prediction is becoming more and more inadequate to describe the data and even higher order calculations are needed .    for the moment we use a naive procedure to quote the theoretical uncertainty . \n the experimental uncertainty is taken to be the width of the ellipse at the minimum , while the theoretical uncertainty is taken as the variation within 1-@xmath10 for scales between @xmath11 . \n the results are @xmath12 alternatively , one could argue that the difference between the lo and nlo value of @xmath0 should be larger than the difference between the nlo and nnlo value of @xmath0 , giving an alternative , but equal , estimate on the theoretical uncertainty of @xmath13 . \n we have used the normalized one jet inclusive transverse energy distribution to extract @xmath14 . \n the fact that we used the normalized distribution reduces the experimental and theoretical uncertainty significantly . to improve the results we need to fit the parton density functions ( specifically the gluon ) together with the value of @xmath0 \n this should remedy the obvious discrepancies between the data and theory for @xmath15 gev ( see ref . \n @xcite ) . such a measurement would not only give us @xmath0 , but simultaneously a _ true _ nlo determination of the gluon parton density function . in fig . \n 2b we finally show , as a cross check , the comparison between the @xmath0 extracted in this talk and the @xmath0-values determined in each @xmath4-bin , obtained using the methods of ref . \n @xcite ( incorporating parton density functions with varying @xmath0 ) . \n as can be seen the agreement between the two methods is quite good . \n the new run 1b data from the cdf and d0 collaboration will severely test the nlo description of the data and higher order calculations might be needed to describe these results and extract the gluon parton density function and @xmath0 . \n 9 f.  abe et al . , _ phys . \n lett . _ * 77 * 438 ( 1996 ) . \n w.  t.  giele et al . , _ nucl . \n phys . _ * b403 * 633 ( 1993 ) . \n a.  d.  martin et al . , _ phys . \n lett . _ * b387 * 41 ( 1996 ) . \n see e.g. s.  alekhin , _ \n hep -

these are largely accessible to transport and tunneling experiments . for example , the conductivity of a 1d channel as a function of the temperature is expected to vary logarithmically in the presence of weak disorder for the fermi liquid , and as a power law for the tl liquid.@xcite analogous relations hold for the differential conductivity and the optical conductivity . \n also associated with the lack of quasiparticles in the tl liquid is spin - charge separation , whereby spin and charge excitations propagate at different characteristic velocities.@xcite    one - dimensional models are easy to envisage , but experimental observation of 1d behavior is potentially problematic . \n low - dimensional systems are never entirely independent of their 3d environment , leading to effects which have the potential to obscure the 1d behavior . \n furthermore , the presence of impurities has been shown to alter drastically the behavior of a tl liquid.@xcite however , even in manifestly 3d systems , behavior unambiguously characteristic of electrons in 1d arises surprisingly frequently . \n features associated with the luttinger model have been observed in organic conductors ( e.g. , tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane and the bechgaard salts),@xcite transition metal oxides,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite edge states in quantum hall liquids,@xcite semiconductor heterostructures,@xcite confined atomic gases,@xcite and atomic nanowires.@xcite theoretical work on electrons in 1d thus has a large region of potential applicability . \n the exactly - solvable luttinger model describes electrons moving in one dimension with short - range interactions and linear dispersion . \n studies with long - range interactions have found that the exponents and excitation velocities are nontrivially altered.@xcite one thus expects to be able to describe the 1d heg within the luttinger model framework , but the exact behavior of the parameters of the model is largely unclear . \n the interactions that we study here are long - ranged , possessing a @xmath1 coulombic tail . \n this is most applicable to systems where screening is a small effect , such as isolated metallic carbon nanotubes and semiconductor structures where there is negligible coupling to the substrate . \n the 1d heg has been studied with a variety of theoretical and computational approaches . \n the principal distinction between various studies is the choice of electron - electron interaction . \n the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath1 , which describes an infinitely - thin wire , is perhaps conceptually the simplest choice , although it is largely avoided in the literature@xcite in its original form due to the divergence at @xmath2 . instead \n , many previous authors have removed the singularity while retaining the long - range behavior by investigating interaction potentials of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a parameter related to the width of the wire . \n this interaction has been studied analytically@xcite and numerically.@xcite    otherwise , one can derive an effective 1d interaction by factorizing the wave function into longitudinal and transverse parts and assuming that the transverse component is the ( 2d ) single - particle ground state of the confining potential . \n the 1d interaction is then the matrix element of the 3d coulomb interaction with respect to the transverse eigenfunctions.@xcite an example of this is the harmonic wire , in which the transverse confinement is provided by a parabolic potential , leading to a gaussian density profile in the transverse plane . \n the harmonic wire has been studied with quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite variants of the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander approach,@xcite and the fermi hypernetted - chain approximation.@xcite    we have studied both the infinitely - thin wire and the harmonic wire using qmc . in this article \n we report qmc calculations of the momentum density ( md ) , energy , pair - correlation function ( pcf ) , and static structure factor ( ssf ) of the infinitely - thin wire at a variety of densities and system sizes . \n the md results in particular show the non - fermi - liquid character of the system and allow us to recover one of the tl parameters . \n the total energy data that we provide are exact and may be regarded as a benchmark for future work . \n we also present calculations of the md for the harmonic wire , again extracting one of the tl parameters . \n the rest of this paper is structured as follows : the models for which we perform our calculations are described in sec . \n [ sec : models ] . in sec.[qmc_details ] we outline qmc methods and provide the details of our approach . \n we report the ground state energies of both models in sec.[sec : energies ] and describe the pcfs in sec .  [ \n sec : pcf ] . in sec.[sec : ssf ] we give the ssfs that we find for the infinitely - thin wire and in sec . \n [ sec : md ] we give the mds for both models . \n we describe the procedure for estimating a parameter of the tl model in sec.[sec : ll_params ] . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec.[sec : conclusions ] . \n we use hartree atomic units ( @xmath5 ) throughout this article . \n the hamiltonians for both of the models we have studied may be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the madelung energy ( the interaction of a particle with its own background and periodic images ) , @xmath8 is the distance between electron @xmath9 and electron @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the ewald interaction ; this is the interaction of an electron at @xmath12 with another electron at @xmath13 , all of electron @xmath10 s periodic images , and @xmath14-th of the uniform positive background . \n the two models that we have studied differ in the @xmath11 and @xmath7 terms . \n the ewald interaction for the infinitely - thin wire may be written @xmath15 which is calculated in practice using an accurate approximation based on the euler - maclaurin summation formula ; see eq . \n ( 4.8 ) of ref . for details . \n the interaction of eq .  ( [ eq : inf_thin_int ] ) diverges as @xmath16 when @xmath17 . in higher dimensions , \n the divergence in the interaction energy is canceled by an equal and opposite divergence in the kinetic energy , so that nodes do not necessarily occur where two antiparallel spins occupy the same position.@xcite in the infinitely - thin 1d system , the curvature of the wave function is unable to compensate for the divergence in the interaction potential , so the trial wave function has nodes at all of the coalescence points for both parallel and antiparallel spin pairs . \n the result is that the ground state energy is independent of the spin - polarization and depends only on the density . in other words \n , the lieb - mattis theorem@xcite does not apply and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states are degenerate for the interaction of eq.([eq : inf_thin_int ] ) . \n we have examined only the fully spin - polarized case for the infinitely - thin wire . \n the second model we have studied describes electrons in a 2d confinement potential given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the width parameter and @xmath20 is the magnitude of the projection of the electron position onto the plane perpendicular to the axis of the wire . \n the ewald - like interaction for this model may be written as@xcite @xmath21\\cos(gnx_{ij } ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : ewald_like_sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 . \n equation ( [ eq : ewald_like_sum ] ) possesses a long - range coulomb tail and is finite at @xmath23 . a derivation of eq . \n ( [ eq : ewald_like_sum ] ) is given in appendix [ app : ewald ] . \n for the harmonic wire we have probed different polarizations , @xmath24 . \n we computed expectation values using the variational and diffusion monte carlo ( vmc and dmc , respectively ) methods as implemented in the casino program.@xcite for the infinitely - thin wire , we combined vmc and dmc results to form extrapolated estimates@xcite where applicable , whereas for the harmonic wire we used vmc alone .    in the vmc method the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to a trial wave function is calculated using a stochastic integration technique.@xcite trial wave functions usually contain a number of free parameters ; we optimized the free parameters in our wave function by unreweighted variance minimization@xcite and linear - least - squares energy minimization.@xcite dmc is a stochastic projector technique for solving the many - body schrdinger equation and generates configurations distributed according to the product of the trial wave function and its ground state component.@xcite dmc calculations of expectation values of operators that commute with the hamiltonian are in principle exact for systems in which the wave function nodes are known ; this is the case for both the infinitely - thin and harmonic wires . \n we used a slater - jastrow wave function for both systems , where the jastrow factor comprised two - body terms consisting of smoothly truncated polynomials and a sum of cosines with periodicity commensurate with that of the simulation cell.@xcite the orbitals in the slater determinant were plane waves with wave vectors up to @xmath25 for the paramagnetic systems and @xmath26 for the ferromagnetic systems . \n the orbitals were evaluated at quasiparticle coordinates related to the actual coordinates by a backflow transformation.@xcite backflow provides an efficient way of describing three - body correlations in the 1d heg , but leaves the exact nodal surface unchanged . \n one method for assessing the wave function quality is to examine the fraction of the correlation energy retrieved , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hartree - fock energy , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the dmc and vmc energies , respectively . \n we tested several types of wave function for the infinitely - thin wire with @xmath31 a.u . \n , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ; our vmc calculations retrieved @xmath34 of the correlation energy when we used a two - body jastrow factor and backflow transformations [ the error bars were @xmath35 a.u . ] , which is the type of wave function we use throughout this paper . while it is indeed the case that dmc is formally exact for the 1d heg , the quality of the trial wave function is important for the statistical efficiency of the dmc method and the accuracy with which expectation values of operators that do not commute with the hamiltonian may be computed \n .      the dmc energy did not change beyond statistical error upon varying the number of walkers between 640 and 2000 , so we used @xmath37 walkers in our calculations and assumed that population control bias is negligible . \n the dependence of the energy upon the dmc timestep @xmath38 was also investigated ; fig . \n [ fig : dtdmc ] shows that for small @xmath38 the energy is constant . \n we performed our calculations at a single timestep given by @xmath39 . \n this fairly conservative choice was made to ensure that time step bias is entirely negligible . \n the rms distance diffused by each electron in a single step was thus slightly less than @xmath40 . \n for the infinitely - thin wire , we used simulation cells containing 37 , 55 , 73 , and 99 particles subject to periodic boundary conditions for our calculations of the energy , pcf , and ssf . \n our md calculations for the infinitely - thin wire also used a much larger cell with @xmath41 . for the harmonic wire , we used cells with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and occasionally @xmath44 for the @xmath33 systems and cells with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath47 systems . \n previous work encountered difficulties in sampling different spin configurations of the harmonic wire for @xmath48 due to the presence of `` pseudonodes '' at the antiparallel coalescence points,@xcite although these problems were largely overcome by the use of lattice - regularized diffusion monte carlo ( lrdmc ) in ref .. the problem occurred because for strong , repulsive interactions the wave function can become small when two antiparallel spins approach one another . combined with a small time step this can lead to simulations where opposite spins exchange positions infrequently and the space of spin configurations is explored very inefficiently . \n use of a small time step is a necessary part of the algorithm of projector methods like dmc . \n we have avoided ergodicity problems by using vmc to study the harmonic wire ; in the vmc method there is no restriction other than ergodicity on the transition probability density and one may propose moves however one wishes provided that the acceptance probability is modified accordingly . \n we use electron - by - electron sampling with the transition probability density given by a gaussian centered on the initial electron position . \n the vmc `` time step '' in fact bears no relation to real time and is simply the variance of the transition probability density . in practice , \n the unmodified time steps ( chosen to achieve a @xmath49 acceptance ratio ) used in vmc are usually large enough to eliminate ergodicity problems , although we found some cases where it was necessary to enforce a lower limit on the width of the transition probability density . \n table [ table : spinexchange ] shows the frequency with which electrons changed positions in our simulations for both high and low density systems with strong and weak confinement . \n .frequency with which electrons paths cross in our vmc simulations of the harmonic wire . \n the quantity @xmath50 is the proportion of proposed single - electron moves that result in a change in the ordering of the particles . \n a typical calculation comprises between @xmath51 and @xmath52 proposed single - electron moves . \n the data shown are for @xmath45 . \n [ table : spinexchange ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]                                        z.  yao , c.  dekker , and p.  avouris , _ electrical transport through single - wall carbon nanotubes _ \n , in m. s.  dresselhaus , g.  dresselhaus , and p.  avouris , eds . , _ \n carbon nanotubes :  synthesis , structure , properties and applications _ \n ( springer , 2001 ) . \n nanotubes at low temperatures h.  ishii , h.  kataura , h.  shiozawa , h.  yoshioka , h. otsubo , y.  takayama , t.  miyahara , s.  suzuki , y.  achiba , m.  nakatake , t.  narimura , m.  higashiguchi , k.  shimada , h.  namatame , and m. taniguchi , nature * 426 * , 540 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1503540995658, "RequestID": "0d55d4a97eaa4ab49766ddc7e5938e38", "TotalTokens": 3994}
{"ContextTokens": 4010, "GeneratedTokens": 238, "SynthesizedBody": "elliptic partial differential equations ( pdes ) with discontinuous coefficients and singular source terms , commonly referred to as elliptic interface problems , occur in many applications , including fluid dynamics @xcite , material science @xcite , electromagnetics @xcite , biological systems , @xcite and heat or mass transfer @xcite . since the pioneer work of peskin in 1977 @xcite , \n lots of attention has been paid to this field in the past few decades @xcite . \n an elliptic interface problem is formulated as elliptic pdes defined on piecewise - smooth subdomains , which are coupled together via interface conditions , such as given jumps in solution and flux across the domain interface . without the interface , a large variety of convergent numerical schemes are available for solving the elliptic pdes , such as , finite difference method ( fdm ) , finite element method ( fem ) , finite volume method ( fvm ) , wavelet , radial basis functions , meshless and spectral methods . however , for elliptic interface problems , the direct application of the aforementioned schemes can not yield a convergent solution . \n peskin proposed the immersed boundary method ( ibm ) @xcite in order to simulate flow pattern of blood in the heart , in which he approximated the singular sources on the interface . since his work , many numerical methods have been proposed and studied . in 1984 , mayo introduced a second order integral equation approach for poisson s equation and biharmonic equation on irregular domains @xcite , in which the solution is extended to a rectangular region by using fredholm integral equations . a fast poisson solver is utilized to solve the resulting fredholm integral equations on a rectangular region . \n continuous derivatives have been assumed to evaluate the discrete laplacian . \n this method can deal with jump conditions of @xmath2 \\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath3=0 $ ] when the green s function is available . in 1994 , a level set method in combination with the immersed boundary method @xcite is proposed by osher and his coworkers in order to compute solutions to incompressible two - phase flow . \n this level set method is easy to implement , although it is of low convergent rate . in the same year , \n immersed interface method ( iim ) was proposed by levique and li @xcite , in which the interface conditions are incorporated into the finite difference scheme near the interface to achieve second order accuracy based on a taylor expansion in a local coordinate system . \n it is a second order interface scheme that does not smear the interface jumps and is used to solve elliptic and parabolic interface problems alike . \n the resulting linear system is sparse , but not symmetric or positive definite . \n also , second order derivatives of the interface jumps are needed . \n the iim is widely used in practice and its extensions can be seen in refs . \n @xcite . for instance , in 2001 , li and ito @xcite constructed an iim scheme with resulting linear matrix being diagonally dominate and its symmetric part being negative definite . \n in addition to the iim , a large class of finite difference based numerical methods have also been proposed for solving elliptic interface problem . \n the crucial idea of these methods is to incorporate jump conditions into the difference stencils near the interface to maintain high order local truncation error using taylor expansion . \n numerical schemes based on finite element or finite volume are also developed @xcite . \n finite element schemes are usually constructed by modifying the finite element basis near the interface . a few methods on unfitted mesh have been introduced based on the discontinuous galerkin method using interior penalty technique to handle jump and flux conditions @xcite . the weak galerkin finite element method has also been developed for elliptic interface problem @xcite . \n other interesting methods developed in recent decades include the ghost fluid method ( gfm ) by fedkiw , osher and coworkers @xcite . \n the second order convergence of finite difference formalism of interface methods is proved in 2006 by beale and layton for smooth interface @xcite , whereas convergence analysis of most elliptic interface schemes is yet to be done .    in the past decade , we have dedicated ourselves to designing accurate and robust numerical schemes for solving elliptic interface problems . in 2006 , the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method @xcite was proposed , motivated by many practical needs , such as optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite , vibration analysis of plates @xcite , wave propagation @xcite , geodynamics @xcite and electrostatic potential in proteins @xcite . \n one important feature of the mib method is its extension of computational domains by using the so called fictitious values , an strategy developed in our earlier methods for handling boundaries @xcite and interfaces @xcite . \n as such , standard central finite difference schemes can be employed to discretize differential operators as if there were no interface . \n another unique feature of the mib method is to repeatedly enforce only the lowest order jump conditions to achieve higher order convergence , which is of critical importance for the robustness of the method to deal with arbitrarily complex interface geometries . \n higher - order jump conditions must involve higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives . \n therefore , to approximate higher order derivatives and/or cross derivatives , one must utilize larger stencils , which is unstable for constructing high - order interface schemes and cumbersome for complex interface geometries . \n the other distinct feature of the mib method is its dimensional splitting . to enforce a 2d or 3d interface jump condition \n , we divide the problem into multi 1d ones and resolve a 1d problem at a time , if possible . \n this approach enables us to come up with a systematic procedure to resolve high dimensional interface problems . \n finally , based on high order lagrange polynomials , the mib method is of arbitrarily high order in principle . \n for example , mib schemes up to 16th order accurate have been constructed for simple interface geometries 1d and 2d domains @xcite , and sixth - order accurate mib schemes have been developed for complex interfaces in 2d @xcite and 3d domains @xcite . \n recently we have constructed an adaptively deformed mesh based mib @xcite and a galerkin formulation of mib @xcite to improve mib s capability of solving realistic problems . \n a comparison of the gfm , iim and mib methods can be found in in refs . \n @xcite . \n the mib method has been used in our earlier works for solving many scientific and engineering problems , such as poisson - boltzmann equation ( pbe ) @xcite for describing the electrostatic potential in proteins . to our best knowledge \n , the mib method is the only method that has demonstrated the second order accuracy for solving poisson or pb equation with realistic protein surfaces with geometric singularities @xcite and for solving poisson equation with multiple material interfaces @xcite . \n it can also be used to solve the helmholtz equation for wave scattering and propagation in inhomogeneous media . \n a fourth order mib scheme for the helmholtz equation with arbitrarily curved interfaces has been proposed by zhao @xcite . \n another example is the geodynamics where the navier - stokes equations with discontinuous viscosity and density is to be solved . \n et al _ have developed a second order accurate mib method to solve this problem on non - staggered cartesian grids @xcite . \n furthermore , the elastic interface problem in both 2d and 3d domains with arbitrarily complex interface geometry was also addressed by the mib method @xcite . in the past few years \n , the mib method has also been applied to the optical molecular imaging @xcite , nano - electronic devices , @xcite and vibration analysis of plates @xcite . \n due to the importance and complexity of interface problems , it is still urgent to develop methods that are more accurate , robust and require less computational cost \n . finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for its ability to better conserve mass and flux in conservation law problems . \n this property is fundamental for the simulation of many physical models , e.g. , oil recovery simulation and computational fluid dynamics in general . \n additionally , compared with finite difference method which takes a collocation formulation , fvm is able to deal with solutions with relatively lower regularity . in the present work , \n we propose the finite volume formulation of the mib method ( mib - fvm ) . \n the motivation for the proposed mib - fvm is to inherit the merits of both methods , namely , the capability of the mib method in handling complex interface geometries and the advantage of fvm for conservation laws and low solution regularity .    the rest of this paper is organized as the follows . in section [ theory_and_alg ] , the general theory of the mib based finite volume formulation is briefly discussed . \n the theoretical formulation and the computational algorithms are given as well . in section [ mib ] \n , we present the strategy for treating complex interface geometries . in section [ numericalstudies ] , \n the proposed mib - fvm is validated by benchmark tests , such as 6-petal flower and jigsaw puzzle - like shape in two dimensional ( 2d ) space , and sphere , ellipsoid , cylinder , flower - based cylinder and torus in three dimensional ( 3d ) space . \n solutions of less regularity ( @xmath4 continuous ) are also tested for the spherical and ellipsoidal interface in 3d . \n this paper ends with a conclusion . \n let us consider an open bounded domain @xmath5 with a given interface @xmath6 , which separates the domain into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as illustrated in figure [ interface ] . \n is divided by interface @xmath6 into two subdomains , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the mesh is represented by solid lines . \n the grid points are represented by blue dots.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the boundary @xmath9 and interfaces @xmath6 may be non - smooth . \n the interface can be characterized by a piecewise smooth level - set function @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 . as such \n , two subdomains can be given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n the elliptic interface problem can be formulated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a piecewise continuous function , @xmath16 is the boundary value , and @xmath17 is a variable coefficient that is discontinuous across the interface @xmath6 . as a result \n , two jump conditions are required to make the problem well posed @xmath18         & =   u^+ - u^-      = \\phi,~      \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19     & =    \\beta^+ u_n^+ - \\beta^- u_n^-    =   \\psi,~   \\forall { \\bf x } ~{\\rm on } ~\\gamma,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote their limiting value from the @xmath7 side of the interface @xmath6 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote their limiting value from the @xmath8 side of the interface @xmath6 . \n the derivatives @xmath24 and @xmath25 are evaluated along the outer normal direction on the interface . here \n @xmath26 and @xmath27 is at least @xmath28 continuous . \n equations ( [ theoryeq1])-([jumpcondition2 ] ) define the elliptic interface problem to be solved in the present work .      to avoid the time - consuming mesh generation procedure , like the original mib method \n , we employ the cartesian mesh . \n we also employ the vertex - centered finite volume method , which means that we associates control volumes and unknowns to vertices . \n the control volumes are cubes whose centers are located at the grid points and whose sides intercept at the midpoints between grid points , which is illustrated by the left chart of figure [ cv ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in both cases , the second order derivatives of @xmath29 blow up at the origin , making the solution only @xmath4 continuous in @xmath8 . since the differential form , eq . \n ( [ theoryeq1 ] ) , is of second order for the diffusion term , mathematically , eq . \n ( [ theoryeq1 ] ) is invalid even though the underlying conservation law is still valid . \n however , it is noticed that the equivalent term in the integral form , eq . \n ( [ integralform1 ] ) , involves only the first order derivative . \n this reduction of the derivative order is important in dealing with solution which changes so rapidly in space that the spatial derivative does not exist . for these reasons , \n the finite volume method is preferred over the finite difference method in solving problems whose solution has less regularity and exhibits local discontinuities .    in case 8(a ) , we choose constant diffusive coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath23 , whereas in case 8(b ) , @xmath21 and @xmath23 are both position dependent . the numerical solutions and the @xmath0 errors of case 8(a ) and case 8(b ) are depicted in figure [ h2sphere_pic ] and figure [ h2ellipsoid_pic ] , respectively . from the numerical results collected in table [ h2sphere_tab ] and table [ h2ellipsoid_tab ] \n , it is seen that the second order accuracy in both cases are essentially obtained . \n in this work , we introduce the finite volume formulation of matched interface and boundary method ( mib - fvm ) for solving elliptic interface problems arising from modeling material interface in practice . much effort has been taken to develop advanced numerical schemes for such problems in the past few decades . \n however , challenges still remain in this field . \n one of the challenge concerns the development of methods with higher order accuracy . \n another challenge is to develop methods for dealing with complex interface geometries . \n the matched interface and boundary ( mib ) method has been proved to be able to deal with these challenges . however , since the mib method is based on the collocation formulation , it does not work well for solutions with low regularity . \n based on the integral form rather than the differential form , the finite volume method ( fvm ) is known for being able to deal with problems with low regularity solutions and better conserve mass and flux . \n second order finite volume methods have also been formulated in literature for elliptic interface problems \n . motivated by these successes , we propose the present mib - fvm to take the advantages of mib and fvm . \n to reduce the computational cost of mesh generation , we utilize the cartesian mesh , although the proposed mib - fvm can be realized on irregular meshes as well . \n we also employ the vertex - centered fvm , for which the cubic control volumes are associated with the grid point at the center . \n the control volumes are categorized into regular and irregular types , where special treatments of the mib formulation are needed for the irregular ones in order to maintain the designed accuracy . \n we study the proposed mib - fvm by a number of classical test cases , including both 2d cases such as 6-petal flower and jigsaw - puzzle like shape , and 3d cases such as sphere , ellipsoid , standard cylinder , flower - based cylinder and torus . \n the numerical results all demonstrate the second order accuracy of the proposed method . \n the ability of handling interface with complex geometries and solutions with low regularity ( @xmath4 continuous ) indicates that the proposed mib - fvm combines the advantage of both mib and fvm in meeting numerical challenges . \n future work will be done to improve the presnt method in dealing with even more complex interface geometries , for example , interface with geometric singularities which are commonly seen in practical applications such as electrostatic analysis of proteins . \n this work was supported in part by nsf grants iis-1302285 and dms-1160352 , nih grant r01gm-090208 , and msu center for mathematical molecular biosciences initiative . \n g.  guyomarch , c.  o. lee , and k.  jeon . a discontinuous galerkin method for elliptic interface problems with application to electroporation . in _ commun . \n numer . meth . \n engng _ , volume  25 , pages 9911008 , 2009 \n .                        j.  d. kandilarov . \n immersed interface method for a reaction -

{"ContextTokens": 2053, "GeneratedTokens": 139, "SynthesizedBody": "presently , few testable theoretical predictions or observational diagnostics exist to robustly constrain whether grb outflows are initially dominated by particles or poynting flux , and what fraction of the particles are baryons vs. pair plasma @xcite . \n whatever the case close to the engine , at large distances observations imply that particles are accelerated to highly relativistic velocities and dominate the energy budget . \n magnetic reconnection is a plausible mechanism of particle acceleration in grb jet plasma if the free energy is carried by magnetic fields . \n reconnection has mainly been studied in the lab , the solar corona , and particularly the earth magnetosphere , which produced the ` geospace environmental modeling ( gem ) reconnection challenge ' : here a simplified reconnection problem was studied and compared using several mhd , hybrid and pic codes @xcite . \n much less attention has been paid either analytical or numerical to the fundamental reconnection mechanisms in either the relativistic regime or for a pair plasma . \n reconnection in a ( relativistic ) pair plasma is very different from an electron - ion plasma . for the latter , the difference in skin depth between the electrons and ions and the corresponding scale lengths of the current sheet and reconnection region play an important role ; \n reconnection is facilitated by whistler modes , which can be related to the hall current in the non - ideal generalized ohm s law . in a pair plasma , however , the contributions from the electron and positron equations of motion to the hall current cancel and whistler waves do nt exist @xcite . \n the non - ideal term in ohm s law that allows field lines to reconnect is an effective enhanced resistivity related to the electron and positron pressure tensors and the tearing mode is the dominant instability .    to improve our understanding of magnetic reconnection for conditions applicable to grb outflows we are performing simulations with a fully explicit and highly parallelized relativistic pic code , _ osiris _ @xcite . by tuning the plasma parameters from non to highly relativistic values and comparing results for a pure pair plasma and a plasma with an increasing proton fraction , \n we can obtain different particle acceleration spectra to be used to construct observational diagnostics of the jet s nature . \n this complements the existing pic simulation work in the grb outflow context which has focused on shock acceleration via the weibel instability in ion - electron plasmas @xcite , or magnetic pulse acceleration without magnetic reconnection @xcite . \n spectra from each of these classes of simulation should ultimately be compared . \n a simple geometry for studying reconnection is the harris current sheet , where two regions of nearly uniform magnetic field of opposite sign are driven into a thin current sheet by their own magnetic pressure . \n if the plasma can deviate from ideal mhd , the field lines can slip and reconnect at one or more @xmath0-points , after which the reconnected field lines are strongly bent . \n when those field lines straigten to minimise their tension , particles in the outflow region are accelerated . \n free magnetic energy is thus converted to particle energy in the process . using the harris configuration \n , we can compare to the results in the gem reconnection challenge @xcite and its extension to pair plasma@xcite . \n the simulations presented here are for a pair plasma and have two current sheets to facilitate use of periodic boundary conditions on all walls . in each half - plane \n we have an initial magnetic field normalized as : @xmath1 \\tanh(x_{2}/a)\\hat{x}_{1}$ ] , where @xmath2 is the thickness of the current sheet and @xmath3 is the skin depth in terms of the plasma frequency @xmath4 and we choose a non - relativistic ) alfvn velocity @xmath5 . in a steady state \n ( @xmath6 ) we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 with thermal velocity spread @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 . a small uniform particle density @xmath11 is added to replenish the accelerated particles leaving the reconnection region and the total number of particles is @xmath12 \n . the spatial and time resolutions are @xmath13 and @xmath14 with typical runs exceeding @xmath15 . \n most simulations use a @xmath16 grid of dimension @xmath17 , but for some we double the length along the current - sheet to reduce the effect of periodic boundaries . to quickly force the system into the non - linear regime , sometimes we impose an initial perturbation , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . \n figure  [ f1 ] ( left ) shows the magnetic field at @xmath20 when the reconnection has reached a quasi steady state , and the reconnection electric field is well developed . \n this simulation was started from a perturbed equilibrium magnetic field . \n the electric field at the @xmath0-points is @xmath21 , which is slightly lower than in @xcite and @xcite . \n when we start from numerical noise , the secondary tearing mode quickly develops , and the magnetic field fragments into a series of small @xmath0- and @xmath22-points that move under the magnetic pressure and finally merge into one dominant @xmath0-point on each current - sheet . the right panel shows the in- and outflow velocities ( @xmath23-@xmath24 ) around the @xmath0-points . \n one can see the particles flowing in with inflow velocity from @xmath25 and being accelerated along the @xmath26 axis . in this figure \n the effect of the periodic boundary conditions is already becoming visible with accelerated particles re - entering the box , but they re not yet influencing the reconnection region . \n in all simulations of non - relativistic reconnection we ve seen in the literature , the fluctuating electric field is either neglected by not evolving the displacement current ( common in mhd codes ) , or artificially eliminated at each time - step @xcite . \n _ osiris _ does neither and evolves the full fields , including all electromagnetic wave modes . \n doing so reveals weak plane - wave like fluctuations in @xmath27 ( due partly to numerical noise , and partly to particles being allowed to cross the current sheet that do nt cancel out exactly ) . \n when this oscillating component has the ` wrong ' sign , the flow of plasma into the current sheet is impeded , and initially this component is strong enough to reverse the bulk plasma motion away from the current sheet . only during the wave - phase where @xmath27 has the proper sign do the particles flow into the current sheet . \n eventually , the @xmath0-points and a mean steady reconnection electric field develop and fast non - linear reconnection is achieved . \n the final in- and outflow velocities reached in our simulations are somewhat slower than in previous work , and the evolution to a steady - state takes a bit longer . \n currently , we are analysing larger runs on the nersc clusters using more particles , higher resolution , and larger aspect ratio along the sheet . furthermore , the implemented distribution functions in _ osiris _ are only valid in the mildly relativistic regime , so we re implementing the proper relativistic jttner - synge distribution \n . then we can proceed to vary the alfvn velocity arbitrarily , adding a small fraction of baryons , and 3d generalizations where possible . \n finally , we will calculate the radiation spectra . if the synchrotron cooling time is long compared to the reconnection rate , this can be done post - procees . \n if the cooling time is fast , but the plasma is optically thin to the produced radiation , we must calculate the radiation self - consistently at each time - step . \n differences in the spectra produced by reconnection in a magnetically dominated wind ( ac model @xcite ) , a magnetic pulse model , or shock - acceleration in a matter dominated model , will provide a useful observational diagnostic to distinguish between the three .    999 g.  drenkhahn and h.c . \n spruit , a&a , * 391 * ( 2002 ) 1141 e.  liang , ap&ss * 298 * ( 2005 ) 211 m.v \n .   medvedev , ap&ss * 307 * ( 2007 ) 245 h.b.j . \n koers and d. giannios , a&a accepted ( 2007 ) j.  birn et al . , _ j. geophys . \n _ * 106 * ( 2001 ) 3715 e.g.  blackman and g.b . \n field , _ phys . \n _ * 71 * ( 1993 ) 3481 r.  fonseca et al . \n notes in comp . \n springer , heidelberg , * 2331 * ( 2002 ) 342 n.  bessho and a.  bhattacharjee , _ phys . \n * 95 * ( 2005 ) 245001", "StartTimeOffset": 1536088037318, "RequestID": "c59920d4192a422a91a52226dfbdf353", "TotalTokens": 2192}
{"ContextTokens": 3888, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the major puzzles in particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is to understand the origin of neutrino masses  @xcite . \n a simple paradigm is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which introduces three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with arbitrary majorana masses additionally to the sm with the resulting seesaw formula for the light neutrino mass matrix given by : @xmath3 the input values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are then required to find the neutrino masses . \n in the simple seesaw framework , the rh neutrino spectrum can therefore not be determined from neutrino observations . \n clearly , the knowledge of the right handed neutrino spectrum would be of great phenomenological interest for testing the model . \n if seesaw is embedded into grand unified theories it is sometimes possible to predict @xmath4 , so that one could get some idea about the right handed neutrino masses . in this paper \n , we present a bottom - up one loop scheme where we obtain the following seesaw - like formula from a left - right symmetric model even though the dirac mass matrix vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix : @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a higgs self coupling . as a result , \n the flavor structure of the rh neutrino mass matrix is completely determined . \n we find a stronger hierarchy in the rh neutrino sector compared to the charged leptons . \n thus the radiative corrections transmit the charged lepton mass hierarchy into the rh neutrino sector ( _ radiative transmission of hierarchies _ ) . \n furthermore the hierarchy in the rh sector is such that it is easily obtainable from a simple @xmath0 family assignment . \n this is the main result of the paper . as an application , \n we predict @xmath10 in this model . \n we also discuss how the quark sector can be made realistic since the @xmath1 symmetry leads to vanishing down quark masses at tree level . \n two ways to generate realistic down quark masses and ckm angles are : ( i ) introduction of color triplet iso - spin singlet fields that give radiative masses to down quarks or ( ii ) the addition of three iso - spin singlet vector - like down quarks which generate a tree level mass for the down quarks . \n we only present the second scenario here , which also has the property that it leads to an inert doublet type scalar dark matter . \n our model is based on the left - right ( lr ) symmetric group  @xcite @xmath11 supplemented by a discrete symmetry group @xmath1 . \n the quarks and leptons are assigned as in the minimal lr model to left - right symmetric doublets . \n the symmetry breaking is implemented also as in the minimal lr model by the higgs fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in the leptonic sector of the model \n , the @xmath14 breaking by the right handed triplet with @xmath15 gives large majorana masses to the rh neutrinos  @xcite . \n unlike in the usual implementation of the seesaw formula however , in our model , the dirac mass for neutrinos vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory due to the @xmath1 symmetry , whose effect on the various fields is given in the table below :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as noted , at tree level , both neutrino dirac masses and the down quark masses vanish . \n we will address the question of down quark masses in the next section . \n as far as neutrinos are concerned , at one loop level they pick up mass from the left diagram in fig . \n [ fig : numass_lfv ] with the neutrino mass matrix given by the one loop formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by @xmath18.\\ ] ] the higgs masses are given by @xmath19 note that these couplings @xmath20 are the effective couplings which we get at low energies when the left - right symmetry is broken . \n we assume that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath23 in the ma - model  @xcite . \n then , the light neutrino mass matrix can then be written as @xmath24 note that we can absorb @xmath25 into @xmath26 without loss of generality . \n since we have a rough idea about the form of the neutrino mass matrix in the limit of zero cp phase and small reactor angle @xmath27 , we can use it to get an idea about the elements of the rh neutrino mass matrix . \n it is interesting that all elements of this mass matrix can be determined . \n the neutrino mixing observables  @xcite we use are : @xmath28 the charged lepton masses we take from ref . \n @xcite : @xmath29    to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath30 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath31 gev . \n note that , in order to avoid the @xmath32 detection in the @xmath33-boson decay width , @xmath9 has to be larger than @xmath34 . \n the neutrino masses are given by @xmath35      to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath36 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath37 gev , where @xmath9 now has to be larger than @xmath38 . \n the neutrino masses are @xmath39    note that in both cases , there is a strong hierarchy in the rh neutrino sector in a way similar to the charged lepton sector . \n this is what we label as the _ radiative transmission of hierarchy _ from charged leptons to the rh neutrinos . \n note that this mechanism , given a certain form of @xmath40 ( with small mixings ) , naturally allows for large mixing angles in the sm lepton sector , that are not necessarily maximal . \n this is different from many other models , where in most cases only zero or maximal mixing is predicted . \n note however , that there are also exceptions to this : e.g. , the size of the mixing angle could be determined by underlying discrete symmetries  @xcite , or it could arise from an anarchical pattern of the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .    to see analytically why this happens , \n let us try to reconstruct @xmath40 from the tri - bimaximal form for the pmns - matrix  @xcite , @xmath41 using this and eq .  , we can write down @xmath40 as function of @xmath9 and of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath42 . \n it is given by @xmath43 times @xmath44 if we assume normal ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , with small @xmath48 ) or inverted hierarchy ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) , the corresponding matrices will roughly look like @xmath52 and @xmath53 note that the reconstruction of all matrices ( eqs .  , and  ) has led us to heavy neutrino mass matrices which are hierarchical and stiff . in all cases , having a light neutrino mass close to zero ( @xmath54 in eqs .   and  ) \n can only increase this hierarchy , but not destroy it . especially in eq . \n the 11-entry is fixed , which means that we will generically have one fixed rh neutrino mass that is not too heavy . \n a similar situation happens for the quasi - degenerate case . \n these mass matrices for rh neutrinos have a structure that is easily obtainable from the froggat - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism  @xcite with a @xmath0 family symmetry with @xmath55 charges @xmath56 for the third , second , and the first generation right handed lepton doublets . \n the left - right and @xmath0 invariant yukawa couplings in this case can be written as : @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an appropriate choice of @xmath58 ( roughly @xmath59 in the normal hierarchy case ) , we get the desired hierarchy in both the charged lepton masses as well as in the rh neutrino sector . \n this hierarchy then translates into a structure of the light neutrino mass matrix that naturally yields large mixing angles , although no values are excluded a priori .    we can also give a prediction for @xmath60  @xcite , which is transmitted by the heavy neutrinos ( cf . \n right diagram of fig . \n [ fig : numass_lfv ] ) : the yukawa coupling in the basis where the heavy neutrino mass matrix is diagonal is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath40 . for a charged higgs mass of 100  gev and @xmath63 , \n the prediction for @xmath64 is @xmath65 for normal and @xmath66 for inverted ordering , where we have used eqs .   and  . \n if we go to smaller values for @xmath9 , the branching ratio increases ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 and normal ordering ) , which might be very interesting in light of the upcoming meg experiment  @xcite . \n it is clear from eq . \n ( 4 ) that at the tree level in our model , only the up quarks are massive . \n we present two ways to make the quark sector realistic by giving mass to the down quarks , ( i ) one where the @xmath69 symmetry , that keeps dirac mass of the neutrino to be zero , is softly broken and ( ii ) another one by adding three vector - like down quarks , where we can keep the @xmath69 symmetry exact . \n we only discuss the second option here .    for ( ii ) , we extend the model by adding three @xmath70 singlet , color triplet , @xmath71 quarks ( denoted by @xmath72 ) and two higgs doublets under the @xmath70 groups with @xmath73 ( denoted by @xmath74 ) . under the @xmath1 symmetry , \n the @xmath74 and @xmath75 are invariant , whereas @xmath76 . \n it is easy to write down a potential for @xmath74 with asymmetric mass terms for them so that they have nonzero vevs . \n since the discrete symmetry does not allow the term @xmath77 term in the potential , the additional fields do not destabilize the @xmath78 vev pattern assumed in the bulk of the paper . \n the new yukawa interaction that is invariant under @xmath1 and gauge symmetry is given by @xmath79 after spontaneous symmetry breaking the down quarks now have masses where they pair with the new down quarks ( rather than the usual ones of the sm ) . \n as a result , the @xmath80 partner of the up quark is a heavy down quark unlike in the minimal left - right model  @xcite . \n in fact , after symmetry breaking , one could write the left and right doublets as follows : @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath75 and @xmath83 swap roles ) , where the mass of @xmath84 is in the 10 to 100 tev range . \n we emphasize that there is no direct mass term between @xmath85 and @xmath75 . \n to fit the down quark masses and the ckm matrix , the yukawa coupling need to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vev of @xmath88 . \n this appears to be a completely viable way to generate down quark masses . \n an interesting feature of this model is that the surviving @xmath69 remains an exact symmetry , and as result the neutral member of the second doublet in @xmath78 can act as dark matter  @xcite , since it couples to quarks as @xmath89 , and as long as @xmath90 , the @xmath91 is stable with stability guaranteed by the @xmath69 symmetry  @xcite . \n in summary , we have shown that a radiative one loop model for neutrino masses proposed in  @xcite arises as a low energy limit of a left - right model which then provides a natural explanation of the two elements of the  @xcite proposal : ( a ) the reason for the extra doublet with its particular discrete symmetry property and ( b ) the origin of the right handed neutrino mass . furthermore , the radiative transmission of hierarchies makes large but non - maximal mixing angles in the leptonic sector plausible . \n left - right embedding also reduces the number of parameters in the model , making it predictive in the hadronic and leptonic flavor sectors . \n the work of r.  n.  m. is supported by the us national science foundation under grant no . \n phy-0652363 and alexander von humboldt award ( 2005 senior humboldt award ) . \n one of the authors ( r.  n.  m. ) is grateful to manfred lindner for hospitality at the max -

infrared dips ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and direct scattered light @xcite and sub - millimetre observations of protoplanetary disks @xcite . \n recent models have indicated that alma will be able to detect planetary gaps at sub -

plane and migrate radially ( bf05 ) . as well as the gas - to - dust ratio varying throughout the disk , we expect that the effects of planetary gaps will be stronger in the dust phase than in the gas phase , which will further affect observations . \n in this paper we study the formation of a gap triggered by an embedded planet in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk . \n we will study the effects of planet mass and grain size on gap formation and evolution in 3d dusty - gas protoplanetary disks . \n we use our 3d , two - phase ( gas@xmath0dust ) , locally isothermal , non - self - gravitating code based on the smoothed particles hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm . \n the dusty gas is approximated by two inter -

mmsn - standard ] . \n the left panel shows the top - down ( @xmath32 ) and side - on ( @xmath33 ) view of the gas and dust disk morphologies . \n while the planet opens a gap in the gas , the gap in the dust layer is much more striking . \n the right panel of fig . \n [ fig - mmsn - standard ] compares the evolution of the azimuthally averaged surface density profile of the gas and dust after 8.4 and 104 planetary orbits . \n recent observations have suggested that massive planets at large distances from the star may exist , such as a 5  @xmath22 planet 30  au from lkca 15 @xcite and a 12.5  @xmath22 planet 135  au from gg  tau @xcite . \n our standard ctts model has a 5  @xmath22 planet at 40  au and the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig - ctts - standard ] . \n for the nebular parameters used , such a massive planet almost completely empties the inner disk of both gas and dust ( though this is likely due to the large inner disk radius - see * ? ? ? * ) . \n since the gap criterion is partially governed by the disk scale height , and the dust scale height varies with grain size , we ran a series of simulations to determine the effect of grain size on the gap . \n three grain sizes are tested in both disk models : 1  cm , 10  cm and 1  m for the mmsn disk and 100  @xmath29 m , 1  mm and 1  cm for the ctts disk . \n [ fig - grains3d ] shows how the gap morphology of both the mmsn and ctts disks vary with dust grains size . \n we find that both the width and depth of the gap increases with increasing grain size . \n finally we investigate the effect of the planetary mass on the evolution of the gap . for our mmsn disk with 1  m grains \n , @xmath34 varies from 0.05  @xmath22 to 1  @xmath22 , and for our ctts disk containing 1  mm grains , @xmath34 varies from 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 to 5  @xmath22 . \n [ fig - planet-2ddens ] shows the comparison of the surface density profiles for both models . for the mmsn disk , \n the gap is more striking in the dust than the gas , while in the ctts disk the inner disk appears depleted of both gas and dust , while the dust pile - up at the outer gap edge is clearly seen . for the ctts disk , \n no change is seen in the surface density for a 0.1 @xmath22  planet in either the gas or dust phase . \n these results are in general agreement with the minimum planet mass required to produce a gap in the disk models of @xcite . \n structures created by planets in dusty disks are more diverse than those created in the gaseous disks . with only aerodynamic drag , we find that it is possible to create disks with a large central hole or a ring . \n @xcite also found that the presence of a planet can produce disks with a central hole for certain grain sizes . \n our results have implications for observational predictions of protoplanetary disks hosting planets . @xcite and @xcite use results of 2d hydrodynamic simulations to produce synthetic images of protoplanetary disks , but these simulations assume that the gas and dust are well mixed , which our results clearly demonstrate is not the case .    because our general findings show than the gap is generally more striking in the dust disk \n , we suggest that predictions of observations of protoplanetary disks are too pessimistic . \n our results show that the density contrast around the gap can be very strong ( and the volume density can actually be greater than the gas volume density ) and this would be detectable with alma . \n our simulations support the results of @xcite , as we clearly see density enhancements in the outer gap edge of the ctts simulations , even for the smaller grains sizes which would be responsible for the majority of the sub - mm and mm emission . \n our results also support the predictions of @xcite that gaps created by @xmath35 planets in mmsn disks should be visible with alma . for a more detailed analysis \n , we refer the reader to fouchet et al . \n ( 2007 ) . \n while we see a clear density increase in the vicinity of the external 3@xmath362 resonance of our standard mmsn disk , we do not believe that particles are trapped in the resonance . plotting the dust eccentricity against semi - major axis \n when drag was neglected clearly shows resonances as thin vertical lines and a v - shaped pattern at the edges of the gap . \n however when drag is included , we find that the drag efficiently damps high eccentricities and the resonant signatures disappear . furthermore , while the dust pile up appears to coincide with the 3@xmath362 external resonance for the mmsn disk ( when gas drag is included ) , this is not true for the standard ctts disk  see fig . \n [ fig - ctts - standard ] . \n thus the accumulation of dust that we and other authors @xcite notice close to the outer gap edge is not due to resonant trapping . \n the accumulation of grains at the external edge of the gap may , however , favour the growth of planetesimals in this high density region . \n we have conducted a series of 3d numerical simulations of two - phase ( dust@xmath0gas ) protoplanetary disks to study the behaviour of the dust in the presence of a planet . \n we ran a series of experiments with a minimum mass solar nebula disk as well as a larger , more massive classical t  tauri star disk , varying the grain size and the planet mass . \n we find that gap formation is more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gas layer . \n varying the grain size alone results in a variety of different structures , and for the ctts disk these differences will be detectable with alma . for low mass planets in our mmsn disk , \n a gap was found to open in the dust layer while not in the gas layer . \n simulations like these can be used to help interpret observations to constraint the planet mass and grain sizes in protoplanetary disks .", "StartTimeOffset": 1585292201385, "RequestID": "92377159ef58494dbc0a13e204d0b5ef", "TotalTokens": 3351}

slices give comparable contributions to the calculation of the residue in the preconditioned case . \n our preconditioning is inspired to what is usually done in deriving the eichten and hill  @xcite lattice hqet action but of course does not introduce any approximation . indeed , the choice above is suited for heavy quark propagators , while for light quark masses we will introduce a generalisation of the factorised function . \n we work with the @xmath15-improved wilson lattice dirac operator but the numerical problems that we address arise also with alternative discretisations of the continuum action and the proposed solution can as well be easily implemented in those cases . \n we have tested our preconditioning scheme both for heavy and for light quark masses and in the free and in the interacting case . \n we start with the results for the heavy quarks . \n we first want to pick up a case where the problem arises . as an example \n , we have calculated the correlation function @xmath16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by solving eq . \n ( [ eq : linsysunprec ] ) for a heavy quark propagator of mass @xmath17 in the free theory for different choices of the residue . \n more precisely the red points in fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect1 ] have been obtained with a residue @xmath18 while the black points with a residue @xmath19 and the two black lines correspond to the squares of these two values of @xmath9 . as is clearly visible from fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect1 ] , and from fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect2 ] where we show the effective masses of the correlations shown in fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect1 ] , the black points start to deviate from the red ones for @xmath20 , i.e. when the correlator , which in this case is just the square module of the propagator , becomes smaller than the square of the `` loose '' residue @xmath19 . \n if the time extent of the lattice is not too large the problem can be solved by brute force by lowering the residue and the results obtained in the preset case with @xmath18 can be considered as exact . if instead the time extent of the lattice is rather large the brute force approach can not be considered because the required residues would be smaller than what is allowed on double - precision architectures , even in the case of moderately heavy quarks . in the case under consideration , by choosing a loose precision , i.e. a residue @xmath19 , we make the numerical problem evident and we show that also such an `` extreme '' situation can be recovered by using our proposal . \n moreover , we notice that a residue @xmath19 is the smallest allowed on single - precision architectures that presently are considerably much faster than double - precision ones . \n we now come to the proposed solution . \n we redefine the quark fields and the propagators as follows @xmath21 once the previous expressions are inserted in eq . \n ( [ eq : linsysunprec ] ) we get the preconditioned system @xmath22+m)_{x , y}\\ s^\\prime(y ) = \\eta^\\prime(x ) \\label{eq : linsysprec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that we solve numerically in place of eq . \n ( [ eq : linsysunprec ] ) . in order to write the preconditioned dirac operator it is sufficient to modify the forward and backward lattice covariant derivatives in the time direction accoring to @xmath23 particular care has to be used at the boundaries of the lattice in order to respect the boundary conditions originally satisfied by the quark fields . if as in the case of fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect1 ] @xmath5 satisfies anti -

pseudoscalar correlator , as in the free theory case , of two degenerate heavy quarks with hopping parameters @xmath33 corresponding to a pcac quark mass of about @xmath34 . \n the unpreconditioned correlators decay approximately as fast as in the free theory case and from the difference of the black ( unpreconditioned , @xmath19 ) and red ( unpreconditioned , @xmath18 ) sets of data we see the same distortion of fig . \n [ fig : treeuncorrect2 ] . \n the blue points have been obtained by solving eq . \n ( [ eq : linsysprec ] ) after having factorized @xmath13 with @xmath27 and by restoring the results according to eq . \n ( [ eq : backcorrection ] ) . \n also in the interacting theory the blue points are identical to red points though they have been obtained with the same loose residue @xmath19 used to obtain the black points . \n we close this section by observing that our preconditioning technique may be particularly useful when working with the schrdinger functional  @xcite formulation of the theory . in this case , \n countrary to the case of periodic boundary conditions along the time direction , the correlators decay exponantially over the whole time extent of the lattice and one has to choose very small residues also in computing relatively light quark propagators . \n we have performed several succesful experiments with our preconditioning technique also in the schrdinger functional case by using @xmath35 . \n ccccccc @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & iterations +   + @xmath42 & 5.3 & @xmath43 & 0.13625 & @xmath44 & 0.0 & 175 + @xmath42 & 5.3 & @xmath43 & 0.13625 & @xmath44 & 0.4 & 141 + @xmath45 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13605 & @xmath47 & 0.0 & 99 + @xmath45 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13605 & @xmath47 & 0.2 & 78 + @xmath45 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13605 & @xmath47 & 0.4 & 69 + @xmath48 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13610 & @xmath47 & 0.0 & 115 + @xmath48 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13610 & @xmath47 & 0.2 & 91 + @xmath48 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13610 & @xmath47 & 0.4 & 81 + @xmath29 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13625 & @xmath47 & 0.0 & 194 + @xmath29 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13625 & @xmath47 & 0.2 & 153 + @xmath29 & 5.3 & @xmath46 & 0.13625 & @xmath47 & 0.4 & 141 +    in this section we shall briefly discuss how the ideas developed and discussed in the previous section can be used to accelerate the numerical calculation of light quark propagators . \n we start our discussion by generalizing eq . \n ( [ eq : redeft ] ) as follows @xmath49 in the following we shall consider the particular choice @xmath50 } } \\label{eq : betaa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the preconditioned lattice dirac operator can be obtained as easily as before by changing all the covariant derivatives according to @xmath51 and by changing accordingly the boundary conditions in all directions as done in eqs . \n ( [ eq : redeftbc ] ) for the time direction \n .    an important difference of the present case with respect to the one discussed in the previous section is that the restoration of the true propagator must be performed before making the contractions needed to build correlation functions by using the first of eqs . \n ( [ eq : redefa ] ) . \n here the preconditioning is not to gain precision , but to accelerate the convergence of the inversion . \n therefore , by applying eqs . \n ( [ eq : redefa ] ) , ( [ eq : betaa ] ) and ( [ eq : redefcovs ] ) to the calculation of a light quark propagator one aims to make the propagator to decay faster than the original unpreconditioned operator . by judiciously chosing the parameter @xmath41 it is possible to change the condition number of the preconditioned system without compromising the numerical accuracy of the solution , an operation that should be performed on double - precision computer architectures .    in table \n [ tab : iterations ] we quantify the gain in computational time that can be achieved by showing the number of iterations of the sap+gcr solver required to solve the lattice dirac equation for light quarks with and without our preconditioning . \n the sap+gcr solver has been introduced and explained in details by the author in ref . \n the gauge ensambles used to perform this test have been generated within the cls agreement  @xcite with the parameters given in the table . in the case of the @xmath52-lattices \n the sap+gcr solver has been ran on @xmath53 processors of a cluster of pc s by dividing the global lattices into blocks of @xmath54 points . in the case of the @xmath55-lattice \n the sap+gcr solver has been ran on @xmath56 processors of a cluster of pc s by dividing the global lattices into blocks of @xmath57 points . \n the table shows that by increasing the value of the parameter @xmath41 the number of iterations goes down with a time gain that can easily reach the @xmath58 . in the case under discussion \n , we checked that higher values of @xmath41 would induce a `` heavy quark '' like behavior and produce distorted results for the reasons discussed at lenghty in the previous section . \n 9 m.  luscher , arxiv:1002.4232 [ hep -

{"ContextTokens": 4009, "GeneratedTokens": 257, "SynthesizedBody": "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are very luminous objects whose emission is thought to be powered by the release of gravitational potential energy from matter falling into supermassive black holes . \n most agn physics beyond that simple statement are a matter of dispute at some level , as are many of the physical differences underlying the observed differences in the spectra of agn . \n one reason for at least part of our lack of understanding may be selection effects . \n most high - luminosity agn  quasars , with @xmath9  have been selected using rest - frame ultraviolet - optical colors . \n thus dust extinction has probably masked some portion of the dominant radio - quiet quasar ( rqq ) population from detection ( webster et al . \n important steps toward eliminating this bias are beginning to appear from near - ir selected samples ( e.g. from 2mass ; see cutri et al . \n , this volume ) and from x - ray selected samples ( kim & elvis 1999 ) . \n radio selection may not sample as distinct a population of agn as once thought , given the lack of bimodality in @xmath10 between rqqs and rlqs seen in the first bright quasar survey ( white et al . \n 2000 ) , but much deeper radio surveys would be needed to select the majority of radio - quiet agn at redshifts @xmath11 . \n another important selection effect is that any single flux - limited sample of agn ( even a near - ir or x - ray selected one ) will exclude high - redshift , low - luminosity objects . \n this leads to a degeneracy between the redshift and luminosity dependences of any agn property . \n thus , bright quasar surveys need to be accompanied by faint quasar surveys to fill in the @xmath12@xmath13@xmath4 plane and remove the redshift  luminosity degeneracy , and to define the full quasar luminosity function .    at the moment \n optical color selection of agn is the method being used to assemble the largest samples of agn , namely 2.5@xmath1410@xmath15 objects from the 2df quasar survey ( 2qz ; boyle et al . \n , this volume ) and 10@xmath16 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al . \n moderately deep wide - field optical imaging can provide the data needed for complementary faint color - selected quasar surveys . \n several surveys are underway which , despite their small size , will form useful comparisons to the 2df and sdss surveys ( agn will also turn up in faint galaxy surveys such as discussed by le fevre et al . , this volume ) . \n the eventual goal for optical quasar studies is to reach @xmath17 at all redshifts @xmath18 . \n the big throughput camera on the ctio 4-m ( wittman et al . 1998 ) offered the first opportunity to image the wide fields required for faint quasar surveys at @xmath20 . \n a group of quasar enthusiasts  julia kennefick ( caltech ) , pat osmer & eric monier ( ohio state ) , malcolm smith ( ctio ) , richard green ( noao ) and myself  have used the btc for two separate but complementary surveys .    in 19971999 \n , we obtained 7 deg@xmath21 of @xmath22 imaging data for a big faint quasar survey . \n we expect to find @xmath23120 quasars at @xmath24 and @xmath2340 at @xmath25 via followup spectroscopy to @xmath26=23.5 . at these redshifts quasars have redder @xmath27 and bluer @xmath28 colors than the stellar locus . \n this survey will define the shape of the quasar luminosity function from @xmath29 at @xmath30 , and its evolution at @xmath31 , with accuracy equal to current knowledge for @xmath32 ( fan et al . \n a data paper is nearing submission ( hall et al . \n , in preparation ) , and we hope to begin spectroscopy in earnest in 2001 .    a second survey was also begun in 1997 to look for @xmath4@xmath335 quasars using @xmath34 imaging , dubbed btc40 for its coverage of 40 deg@xmath21 ( kennefick et al . \n , in preparation ) . \n a selection criterion of @xmath35 is sensitive to @xmath36 quasars and only the latest m dwarfs . \n however , the surface density of these very late m dwarfs is sufficiently high that they dominate candidates selected this way . \n thus we added @xmath37 band imaging to the survey to have two colors with which to distinguish @xmath36 quasars from stars . \n we expected anywhere from 1 to 25 @xmath36 quasars to @xmath38=22 in the survey . \n to date we have spectroscopically confirmed two @xmath39 quasars , but none at @xmath36 . \n part of this is the difficulty of following up @xmath40 candidates on 4-m class telescopes . \n our @xmath41 quasar surface density agrees with that found in the sdss ( fan et al . \n 2000 ) , but we hope to extend our spectroscopy to lower luminosities using 8-m class telescopes in the near future . \n the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) obtained spectra for about 6200 galaxies to a nominal limit of @xmath26=21.5 . as a side benefit it yielded a sample of at least 47 agn with @xmath42 and average @xmath43 ( hall et al . \n 2000 ) , spectroscopically selected by broad emission lines , nev emission , or feii absorption . \n at least 80% of the cnoc2 agn can be recovered by color selection , in agreement with previous , mostly smaller samples for which multiple selection methods were employed . \n this does not address the ability of optical flux - limited samples to recover agn which experience significant dust extinction , just the fraction of agn to a given optical flux limit which have colors sufficiently distinct from stars to be identified . \n note that @xmath2320% of these agn are classified as resolved or probably resolved ( in cfht seeing ) , a potential selection effect which must be considered in faint quasar surveys which target only unresolved objects . \n the cnoc2 agn include several unusual objects : one with a very strong double - peaked mgii emission line , one with the first recognized oiii@xmath53133 broad absorption line , and one with as yet unidentified emission and absorption lines . \n the broad emission line subsample of predominantly low - luminosity agn , although small , has some intriguing properties . \n it may have a higher incidence of associated mgii and civ absorption , possibly because such absorption is anti - correlated with optical luminosity or is becoming less frequent with cosmic time , or possibly because the sample is not biased against objects reddened by dust associated with the absorbing gas or with resolved spatial structure such as companions , tidal tails or large host galaxies , environments which may be more likely to have extensive gas envelopes which show up as associated absorption . \n the quite similar spectra of broad - line agn over a range of @xmath2310@xmath44 in luminosity implies that the parameters determining the emergent spectra scale nearly uniformly with luminosity . for a given line , an anticorrelation of emission line equivalent width with continuum luminosity  a baldwin effect ( beff ) \n means that the scaling is not exactly homologous for that line . the broad emission line cnoc2 agn subsample has average equivalent widths ( @xmath45 ) for mgii@xmath52798 and ciii]@xmath51909 which agree with the predictions of previous studies of the beff , but as seen in figure 1 , the average @xmath45 for civ@xmath51549 and ly@xmath6 are smaller than predicted by previous studies of the beff at lower redshift \n this may imply that the slopes of the civ and ly@xmath6 baldwin effects evolve with redshift , steepening with cosmic time . \n other faint agn samples are consistent with these results , namely agn from the cfrs and hdf ( see figure 1 ) , spectroscopically selected agn from the cnoc1 cluster galaxy redshift survey , and low s / n spectra of agn from the deep multicolor survey ( osmer et al . \n a similar result was also reported by zitelli et al . \n ( 1992 ) for civ , and by boyle et al . \n ( this conference ) for more luminous 2qz quasars . \n a current favored model explains the beff as a result of the luminosity dependence of agn continuum spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , wherein more luminous agn have softer ionizing continua ( osmer & shields 1999 ) . \n evolution in the beff might indicate evolution with cosmic time of agn seds at a given luminosity , which might arise from evolution in the relation between agn luminosity and black hole mass ( wandel 1999 ) . \n however , an earlier model for the civ beff postulated a smaller ionization parameter @xmath46 ( the ratio of ionizing photon to gas densities ) in more luminous agn and predicted no ly@xmath6 beff ( shields & ferland 1993 ) . \n a @xmath46-@xmath12 anticorrelation has also been recently suggested on entirely independent grounds , namely to explain reverberation mapping results on a subsample of palomar - green agn ( kaspi et al . \n 2000 ) . given the theoretical implications , further data on high-@xmath4 low - luminosity agn from well - understood samples is needed to confirm our possible evidence for redshift evolution of the slope of the baldwin effect in ly@xmath6 and civ . \n the @xmath22 and @xmath48 color selection techniques used to identify @xmath49 and @xmath50 quasars , respectively , can be extended to @xmath51 quasars using @xmath52 imaging . \n we are conducting such a survey using data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2000 and gladders , this conference ) , a 100 deg@xmath21 @xmath53 survey for @xmath54 galaxy clusters . as a side benefit , \n this survey should yield a sample of several hundred t , l and m7m9 dwarfs . \n candidate @xmath51 quasars and brown dwarfs are identified to @xmath55 by requiring @xmath56 ; the only plausible contaminant at such colors is extremely luminous @xmath36 galaxies . \n @xmath57-band followup then separates the three populations : t dwarfs have red @xmath58 , l dwarfs have moderate @xmath58 , and @xmath47 quasars have blue @xmath58 ( figure 2 and zheng et al . \n 2000 ) . in pilot \n @xmath57 imaging of 28 targets sparsely sampled from @xmath59 deg@xmath21 , we are 28 for 28 in confirming that our @xmath60 candidates are real and fall within the expected @xmath58 color ranges : 23 have colors of m7l8 dwarfs and 5 of l8 to t dwarfs ( figure 2 ) . \n the rcs can reach 22.5 magnitudes fainter than sdss or 2mass in its selection of candidate @xmath47 quasars and l and t dwarfs . \n this means fainter quasars ( and more of them ) and cooler brown dwarfs ( on average ) . \n the full 100 deg@xmath21 survey could yield anywhere from 0 to @xmath23100 @xmath47 quasars , as well as more than 50 t dwarfs and 450 l dwarfs ( dantona et al . \n large surveys of bright quasars need complementary surveys of faint quasars if redshift and luminosity dependences of various quasar properties are to be disentangled . \n together these surveys will enable study of the properties and evolution of quasars over the entire optically accessible @xmath18 range . \n the bfqs and btc40 surveys are first steps toward large faint quasar surveys , for which 4-m class telescopes can provide imaging and some spectroscopy , but for which 8-m class telescopes are needed for fainter candidates and detailed spectral studies . \n the rcs is an excellent database in which to look for low - luminosity @xmath61 quasars , using snapshot near - ir imaging to separate them from very late m , l and t dwarfs with similarly red @xmath62 colors . \n comparison of low - luminosity quasars from the cnoc2 survey to high - luminosity quasars at the same redshifts suggests an unexpected variation with redshift of the baldwin effect for civ and ly@xmath6 , illustrating the potential for surprises in the new era of wide -

{"ContextTokens": 3378, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "the mechanisms that produce gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have long been among the mysteries of modern astrophysics . \n there have been a wide variety of models ( see mszros 2002 for a review of the theories of grbs ) . \n the discovery of optical afterglows opened a new window on the field ( see , e.g. , van paradijs , kouveliotou , & wijers 2000 ) . \n early identification of the optical afterglows led to the measurement of redshifts for several grbs ( e.g. ,  grb  970508 : metzger et  al . \n 1997 ) , providing definitive evidence for their cosmological origin . \n observations at other wavelengths , especially radio , have revealed many more details about the bursts ( e.g. , berger et al . \n 2000 ;

matheson et  al . \n 2003 ; hjorth et  al . 2003 ; kawabata et  al . 2003 ; kosugi et  al . \n subsequently , two other cases have been identified : grb  021211 ( della valle et  al . \n 2003 ) and grb  031203 ( malesani et  al . \n 2004 ) . in this paper \n , i will review the evidence for the grb - sn association and describe the nature of the sne that are associated with grbs . \n there were many indirect pieces of evidence that showed an association between grbs and sne . \n most of these actually related grbs to massive stars , but , since massive stars do undergo core collapse to become sne , the connection was implicit . on the large scale , \n the host galaxies of grbs showed strong star formation , indicating that massive stars were present ( e.g. , hogg & fruchter 1999 ) . \n more detailed studies found that the locations of grbs within their host galaxies were associated with the regions that contained massive stars ( e.g. ,  bloom , kulkarni , & djorgovski 2002 ) . \n other circumstantial arguments derived from evidence related to the interaction of the grb with its local environment . \n massive stars in general have stellar winds , and the observations of the afterglows are consistent with models of interaction with these winds ( e.g. , chevalier & li 2000 ) . \n a few grb afterglows have shown strong absorption features at relatively high velocities ( a few thousand km s@xmath0 ) , the best case being grb  021004 . \n for that grb , these features were interpreted as mass - loss shells from a wolf - rayet progenitor , again implying a massive star ( mirabal et  al . \n 2003 ; schaefer et  al . \n another claim of evidence for association with sne came from reported detections of line features in the x - ray afterglows of some grbs ( e.g. , piro et  al . 1999 ; reeves et  al . \n 2002 ) that would result from material synthesized in the collapse , followed by a grb after a period of time . \n recent reanalysis of all observations of x - ray afterglows , however , indicates that these earlier claims are not statistically significant ( sako , harrison , & rutledge 2004 ) . \n perhaps the strongest element in the circumstantial case for the grb - sn association was the presence of bumps in the afterglows of many grbs . \n the traditional optical afterglow of a grb decays as a power - law . \n late - time deviations from this power law were consistent in their timing and brightness with an sn having exploded at the same time as the grb ( e.g. , bloom et  al . \n rebrightening , though , is not necessarily direct evidence of a supernova . \n that would require a spectroscopic detection . \n the first evidence for an sn associated with a grb came when sn  1998bw was found in the error box of grb  980425 ( galama et  al . \n the sn was of type ic ( see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn types ) , but it was peculiar , with evidence for unusually high velocities ( patat et al . \n this event was odd in many ways . \n the grb itself was relatively weak ( woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ) and the radio emission from the sn was extraordinary , both in luminosity and the rapidity of its appearance ( kulkarni et al . \n this was clearly an object of great interest , but it was not conclusive proof that sne and grbs are related . \n it is , though , the framework upon which all further claims of grb - sn connections are built . \n a weaker case is grb  011121 ( garnavich et  al . \n 2003a ; bloom et al . \n a late - time bump in the light curve was observed from the ground and with _ hst_. at @xmath1 , the supernova component would have been relatively bright . \n a spectrum of the grb taken during the rebrightening does not show any obvious features of an sn , but the color evolution derived from broad - band photometry is consistent with a supernova ( designated sn  2001ke ; garnavich et  al . \n while sn  1998bw was a strong hint of the grb - sn association , no traditional optical afterglow was seen . without that direct association , \n the link between grbs and sne was still in question . \n the ` monster burst ' of 2003 , grb  030329 was to provide that link . \n the burst was unusually bright in gamma - rays , implying that it was relatively close . \n spectroscopy of the afterglow soon confirmed a low redshift of 0.1685 ( greiner et  al . \n 2003 ) . as the afterglow faded , subtle features appeared in the normally flat power - law spectra of the afterglow . \n by subtracting a continuum based upon the early shape of the spectrum , this structure was revealed as the spectrum of an unusual type ic sn similar to sn  1998bw , designated sn  2003dh ( garnavich et  al . \n 2003b ) . within a few days , \n the sn became the dominant component in the spectrum ( stanek et  al . \n 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 \n ; kawabata et  al . \n 2003 ) .    using the early power - law continuum spectrum as a model \n , one could decompose the observed spectra at later times into two separate components : grb afterglow and sn spectrum . using a least - squares technique , the best match for the sn among the low - redshift sample \n was sn  1998bw ( matheson et  al . \n in fact , taking into account cosmological time dilation , the spectroscopic evolution of sn  2003dh almost exactly matched sn  1998bw ( figure 1 ) . \n models of these spectra are presented by mazzali et al . \n ( 2003 ; see also mazzali s contribution in this volume ) . \n an important point about the appearance of the sn was that the light curve did not show the bump that is supposed to be the characteristic of a rebrightening caused by the sn ( see matheson et  al . \n 2003 and lipkin et  al . \n 2004 for a discussion of the light curve ) . without the spectroscopic confirmation , \n the sn in grb  030329 would still be a matter of contention . \n nebular - phase spectra of sn  2003dh show a spectrum similar to a typical type ic sn . \n kosugi et  al . \n ( 2004 ) present a spectrum at an age of @xmath23 months . \n a spectrum obtained with the keck telescope by filippenko , chornock , & foley ( 2004 ) in december of 2003 is much like a normal type ic sn ( bersier et  al . \n , in preparation ) . \n following the discovery of sn  2003dh , reexamination of spectra of an earlier burst yielded some evidence for a sn component . \n della valle et  al . ( 2003 ) found that a spectrum of the afterglow of grb  021211 had structure similar to an sn . in this case , though , the sn did not match sn  1998bw or any other peculiar type ic sn . rather , it was most similar to sn  1994i , a relatively normal type ic . \n a more clear example came with grb  031203 . despite high foreground reddening , spectroscopy with \n the vlt revealed an sn component , designated sn  2003lw ( malesani et  al . \n 2004 ) . for this sn , sn \n 1998bw was again a good match . \n of the four sne with clear grb associations , three show remarkably similar spectra . \n the classification scheme for sne ( see filippenko 1997 ) is based upon spectroscopic features . \n the type ii sne show hydrogen , while those of type i do not . \n type ia sne have a distinctive silicon feature and show an elemental pattern consistent with the theory that they arise from thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf . \n the other type i sne ( i.e. , without the strong silicon absorption ) are distinguished either by the presence ( ib ) or absence ( ic ) of helium . \n a strong circumstantial case has tied types ii , ib , and ic to the same underlying mechanism of core collapse . a transition between type ii and something like a ib \n was observed for sn  1993j ( e.g. , filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ) , strengthening this connection and providing an explanation for the subclasses . \n models of the progenitor of sn  1993j postulated that a massive star in a binary had lost most of its hydrogen layer , leaving a small amount that produced the early spectrum of a type ii , and then revealing the helium layer below ( see matheson et  al . \n 2000 for a summary and an extensive list of references ) . \n study of a large number of type ib / c sne indicated that the sne ic had less massive envelopes than the sne ib ( matheson et  al . \n this implied that the ib sne have lost their hydrogen , leaving the helium layer , while the sne ic have lost hydrogen and helium , leaving a carbon / oxygen core . the spectrum itself , though derived from the same underlying mechanism , can be very different depending on the amount of the envelope stripped from the star at the time of the explosion . \n if the grb mechanism does entail a jet ( e.g. , macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 ) , then a smaller progenitor with a less massive envelope would make it easier for the jet to punch through the stellar atmosphere and still have the energy to produce the observed burst and afterglow . \n in addition to sn  1998bw , there are several low - redshift peculiar type ic sne . these are objects that show high expansion velocities and sometimes , but not always , large luminosity ( they are occasionally referred to as `` hypernovae '' ) . \n two well - studied such examples are sn  1997ef and sn  2002ap ( iwamoto et al . \n 1998 , 2000 ; foley et  al . 2003 ) . \n none of these other high - velocity sne has been directly associated with a grb . \n there is a wide diversity in their spectroscopic and photometric development , but only the ones like sn  1998bw have been related to grbs . \n it is not yet clear if this is significant .    even though the overall energy budget may be different for grbs and these other peculiar type ic sne , they are clearly unusual objects . \n the high velocities set them apart from a typical sn , with the only similar objects being the sne associated with grbs . \n to study the sn component of a grb requires it to be at low redshift , a condition that also makes them rare . \n the peculiar ic sne , though , are relatively more common , and are bright enough to enable detailed studies with even modest telescopes . study of these objects could be the first step to understanding the grb mechanism . \n while circumstantial arguments had linked sne with grbs , spectroscopic data was needed for irrefutable proof . this crucial piece of evidence arrived in the form of grb  030329 , wherein a direct transformation from grb afterglow to peculiar type ic sne was thoroughly observed . \n later that same year , grb  031203 provided a further link . \n these two , along with sn  1998bw , showed similar spectra . that they were type ic implied that the progenitor was a stripped - envelope star , lending credence to jet - based models for grbs . \n although these grb - sne are rare , low - redshift examples of peculiar type ic sne are not , providing a laboratory to understand stellar explosions in extreme circumstances .", "StartTimeOffset": 1609890934800, "RequestID": "1fdd79722961411383d38ba57f05569d", "TotalTokens": 3499}

{"ContextTokens": 3432, "GeneratedTokens": 147, "SynthesizedBody": "the well - determined fermi - lat spectra ( or upper limits , ul ) in the mev - gev band for several tev blazars are often used to derive stronger constraints on the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , or to constrain the distance for bl lacs of uncertain redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n the underlying assumption of these studies is that the extrapolation of the fermi - lat spectrum to the vhe band is either a good estimate or an upper limit for the intrinsic vhe spectrum of the source , since they belong to the same hump in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . \n the extrapolation is done either as a simple extension of the power - law ( or best fit ) model for the fermi - lat data , or using a one - zone synchrotron self - compton model ( ssc ) on the overall sed . \n however , the observational evidence shows that this assumption is not well justified anymore . \n blazars display a wide range in sed peak energies , as well as in emission components ( both in time and space along the jet ) . \n the vhe band samples typically the highest energies of the emitting particle distribution , and is therefore more sensitive to even small changes in the acceleration and cooling processes . \n observationally , irrespective of ebl absorption ( i.e. adopting the same ebl model for all sources ) , the band between he and vhe is the energy range where the spectrum of blazars typically changes the most , either because of the closeness of the sed peak or of the end of the emitting particles distribution . \n therefore , the extrapolation to vhe of the he slope is in general never a good assumption . \n this is particularly true for the high - energy - peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) which are bright in fermi and have been easily detected in the first years of operation @xcite . \n these are characterized by the high - energy sed peak being very close to the lat band ( e.g. mkn421 , mkn501 , pks2155 - 304 , pks2005 - 489 , 1es1553 + 113 etc ) . for them , \n the he and vhe bands sample the two sides of the gamma - ray hump in the sed , and thus the intrinsic vhe spectra are much softer than the he spectra indeed this is the most common case among fermi - detected hbl @xcite . \n the main question however is : can the vhe spectrum be harder than the he spectrum ? can thus the fermi - lat index be used as reasonable upper limit for the hardness of the vhe spectrum , or for its luminosity ? \n concave he - vhe spectra have not been observed ( yet ) directly . \n however , the observational ( as well as theoretical ) evidence is now showing this to be possible . \n let us consider three facts .    1 \n .   bl lacs do show multiple spectral components in their synchrotron emission , which traces directly the shape of the electron distribution(s ) . \n in several cases we have already seen the superposition of two different emission components at high electron energies , with a new component emerging over a previous / steadier sed . \n classical examples are given by mkn 501 in 1997 @xcite , 1es1959 + 650 in 2002 @xcite and pks2155 - 304 in 2006 @xcite ( see e.g. fig . \n the same can thus happen in the inverse compton emission . \n the superposition of multiple spectral components is seen also outside specific flaring episodes , on long ( months to years ) timescales . \n one of the most evident cases was given by pks2005 - 489 in the synchrotron emission ( fig . \n [ f2 ] ) , during multi - wavelength campaigns in 2004 - 2005 . \n the x - ray band in 2005 became more and more dominated by a new harder emission component emerging in the sed , which probably reached its maximum in june 2009 @xcite . \n +   ( 5.08 or 3.93 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) . \n even with the lowest galactic column density , in 2005 the x - ray spectrum can not be joined to the uv data from the optical monitor with a single smooth spectral component @xcite . \n , width=283 ] 3 .   at vhe , \n intrinsic spectra as hard as @xmath4 are already observed , with a low ebl density ( even harder in case of higher ebl densities ) . \n classic examples are given by 1es1101 - 232 @xcite , 1es0347 - 121 @xcite and especially 1es0229 + 200 ( fig . \n [ f3 ] ) , which is characterized by such hard vhe spectrum up to @xmath510 tev @xcite . \n this demonstrates that there exist physical conditions in blazars which can yield tev spectra as hard as @xmath6 , and with higher luminosity than in the synchrotron emission . \n such conditions can in principle form also in specific zones of the jet , and/or in specific epochs . \n the overall sed of such components can easily remain hidden below a more `` standard '' sed and emerge or become dominant only at vhe . \n considering these three facts together , it becomes clear that spectra at vhe can very well be harder than at he . \n this is true especially for those hbl where the fermi - lat index is closer to 2 than 1.5 ( or even steeper than 2 , as in ibl and lbl ) . \n over such a wide range of energies ( 5 orders of magnitude ) , it seems not only possible but even likely that a combination of different spectral components either in time or from different particle populations or different emission mechanisms for the same particles can result in _ concave _ overall spectra . \n it seems only a matter of time ( and statistics ) before up - turns somewhere in the overall 100 mev  10 tev band are directly and significantly detected in the simultaneous gamma - ray spectrum of some blazars .    it should not be surprising , because the observational ingredients are all there . \n in fact , a possible example is already given by the fermi - lat spectrum of mkn501 @xcite , where a flaring episode has already produced a time - average he spectrum apparently hardening towards higher energies ( see fig . \n [ f4 ] ) . \n therefore , in general , fermi - lat spectra can not be reliably used as ul to a ) derive constraints on redshift , or b ) put stronger limits on the intensity of the ebl . \n the results would be as weak / unreliable as their assumptions , and lead to gross over / under - estimates . \n for ebl and resdhift studies , the @xmath6 limit for the intrinsic photon index is still a more robust benchmark than any fermi - lat extrapolation . although it is not a  hard \" limit ( theoretically there are many mechanisms to obtain harder spectra , see e.g. @xcite ) , at present it still represents the borderline between reality and speculation ( for a full discussion , see e.g. @xcite ) . \n observationally , intrinsic spectra with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) have never been observed so far in blazars at high electron energies ( e.g. @xmath9 ) , neither in the synchrotron emission nor in the inverse compton spectrum of low - redshift sources . \n photon indexes of 1.2 - 1 are observed at x - ray energies in high - redshift , low - energy - peaked blazars ( typically fsrq ) , but these appear to be explained as low - energy cutoffs in the electron distribution , if not by internal absorption @xcite . \n in fact , this is a spectral feature that could in principle appear in the fermi - lat band for some tev - peaked sources ( i.e. those where the lat band is deep in the valley between the two sed humps ) . \n however , it would not automatically imply a similarly hard spectrum at vhe , because in such case the vhe band would correspond to the particle distribution well above the low -

energy emission at a level of accuracy which seems not ( yet ) at hand @xcite . \n the uncertainty is systematical , on which model and physical conditions are actually working in blazars . for a given he spectrum and overall sed , \n the range of possible vhe spectra is still large ( @xmath11 ) , even in a ssc scenario , depending on the choice of parameters , zones and adopted particle distributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . and observations are demonstrating that we are still missing some fundamental aspects of the blazar physics . \n one - zone ssc models can work _ a - posteriori _ , but can not be used reliably _ a - priori _ since blazars have multiple emission components , whose behaviour and interplay is still unknown \n . a reliable prediction of the vhe spectrum from the he one is therefore not yet possible , at least in individual sources .    for a real progress in this field \n , it seems now more useful and fruitful to fix the ebl to the most consistent and likely values ( e.g. @xcite ) , and to focus on improving our understanding of the blazar emission properties . \n 99 a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 707 * , 1310 ( 2009 ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 708 * , 1310 ( 2010 ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 710 * , 1271 ( 2010b ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 715 * , 429 ( 2010c ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 723 * , 1082 ( 2010d ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 727 * , 129 ( 2011 ) a. abramowski et al . \n ( hess coll . \n , lat coll . ) , a&a , * 533 * , 110 ( 2011 ) v.a . \n acciari et al . \n ( veritas coll . \n , lat coll . ) , apjl , * 708 * , 100 ( 2010 ) f. acero et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 511 * , 52 ( 2010 ) m. ackermann et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 743 * , 171 ( 2011 ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hegra coll . ) \n a&a , * 349 * , 11 ( 1999 ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , nature , * 440 * , 1018 ( 2006a ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 473 * , l25 ( 2007a ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 470 * , 475 ( 2007b ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 475 * , l9 ( 2007c ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 502 * , 749 ( 2009 ) l. costamante et al . \n , a&a , * 371 * , 512 ( 2001 ) l. costamante et al . , proceedings esa workshop frascati , arxiv:0206482 ( 2002 ) l. costamante , proceedings of iau symposium no . \n 284 ( arxiv:1204.6426 ) a. dominguez et al . , \n mnras , * 410 * , 2556 ( 2011 ) a. franceschini et al . , a&a , * 487 * , 837 ( 2008 ) g. ghisellini et al . , \n a&a , * 386 * , 833 ( 2002 ) g. ghisellini et al . , \n mnras , * 399 * , 2041 ( 2009 ) r.c . \n gilmore et al . , mnras , * 422 * , 3189 ( 2012 ) h. krawczynski et al . , \n apj , * 601 * , 151 ( 2004 ) e. lefa et al . , \n apj , * 740 * , 64 ( 2011 ) n. mankuzhiyil et al . , apj , * 715l * , 16 ( 2010 ) p. nolan et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apjs , * 199 * , 31 ( 2012 ) m.r . \n orr et al . , \n apj , * 733 * , 77 ( 2011 ) e. pian et al . , apjl , * 492 * , 17 ( 1998 ) e. prandini et al . , mnras , * 405l * , 76 ( 2010 ) f. tavecchio et al . , apj , * 665 * , 980 ( 2007 ) m.a . \n worsley et al . , \n mnras , * 350l * , 67 ( 2004 )", "StartTimeOffset": 1631397465466, "RequestID": "d8661e0921334c4b9fd25782bb1e23fd", "TotalTokens": 3579}

neighbor spacing distributions for an @xmath20 lattice at @xmath21 ( confined phase ) and at @xmath22 ( coulomb phase ) , averaged over 20 independent configurations , are depicted in fig . \n both are well described by the chue of rmt . \n no signs for a transition to poisson regularity are found . \n the deconfinement phase transition does not seem to coincide with a transition in the spacing distribution . \n for very large values of @xmath6 far into the deconfinement region , the eigenvalues start to approach the degenerate eigenvalues of the free theory , given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lattice constant , @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites in the @xmath26-direction , and @xmath27 . in this case \n , the spacing distribution is neither wigner nor poisson . \n it is possible to lift the degeneracies of the free eigenvalues using an asymmetric lattice where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc . \n are relative primes and , for large lattices , the distribution is then poisson , @xmath2 , see fig . \n we have continued our investigations with a study of the distribution of the small eigenvalues in the whole phase diagram . \n the banks - casher formula @xcite relates the dirac eigenvalue density @xmath30 at @xmath31 to the chiral condensate , @xmath32 . the microscopic spectral density , @xmath33 should be given by the appropriate prediction of rmt  @xcite , which also generates the leutwyler -

casher relation  @xcite . \n the right plot in fig . \n [ fig5 ] exhibits the distribution @xmath47 of the smallest eigenvalue , being in the chirally broken phase in accordance with the prediction of the ( quenched ) chue of rmt for topological charge @xmath43 , @xmath48 . \n the quasi - zero modes which are responsible for the chiral condensate @xmath49 build up when we cross from the deconfinement into the confined phase \n . figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] demonstrate that both @xmath30 and @xmath50 plotted with varying @xmath6 on identical scales , respectively , can serve as an indicator for the phase transition .    in fig . \n [ fig6 ] we turn to a discussion of the spectrum in the quark - gluon plasma and coulomb phase . from rmt a functional form of @xmath51 \n is expected at the onset of the eigenvalue density  @xcite . \n a fit to the data in the regime up to @xmath52 yields @xmath53 for the non - abelian and @xmath54 for the abelian theory , in agreement with recent studies  @xcite . \n this suggests that both theories correspond to universality class @xmath55 . for this class \n a microscopic level density involving the airy function can be deduced from rmt  @xcite . \n a rescaling of our data from the @xmath34 lattice to this functional form is not satisfactory for both theories  @xcite \n . the reason might be ( i ) that the lowest eigenvalue is still influenced by quasi - zero modes from the confinement and ( ii ) that already the first eigenvalues lie above an analogue of the thouless energy . with increasing lattice size these effects should decrease . \n further , we checked that the high - end of the spectrum behaves similar to the low - end and thus deviates from the results of the ordinary ue of rmt  @xcite . \n again the question arises whether larger lattices possess spectral edges closer to the microscopic semi - circle universality . \n the aim of this contribution was to work out two different types of universalities inherent in quantum field theories with a covariant derivative and their interpretation in terms of rmt . \n the first type concerns the bulk of the spectrum of the dirac operator . the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath0 agrees with the rmt result in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase of pure gauge theory and of full qcd , except for extremely large values of @xmath6 where the eigenvalues are known analytically . \n the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of 4d u(1 ) quenched lattice gauge theory is described by the chue of rmt in both the confinement and the coulomb phase . even in the deconfinement phase , \n gauge fields retain a considerable degree of randomness , which apparently gives rise to quantum chaos in these theories .    the second type of universality concerns the low - lying spectra of the dirac operators of both qcd and qed . in all cases considered \n , one finds that in the phase in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken the distribution @xmath47 and the microscopic spectral density @xmath39 are described by chiral rmt . \n when chiral symmetry is restored one has to rely on ordinary rmt with the related space - time symmetries , but one finds for our lattice size only universal behavior of the macroscopic density @xmath30 . \n 99 t. banks and a. casher , nucl . \n b 169 ( 1980 ) 103 . m.a . \n halasz and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , phys . \n lett .  74 ( 1995 ) 3920 ; m.a . \n halasz , t.  kalkreuter , and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , nucl . \n .  suppl . ) \n 53 ( 1997 ) 266 . \n o. bohigas , m .- j . \n giannoni , and c. schmit , phys . \n 52 ( 1984 ) 1 . \n bir , n. hrmann , h. markum , and r. pullirsch , nucl . \n b ( proc .  suppl . ) 86 ( 2000 ) 403 . \n verbaarschot , phys . \n lett .  72 ( 1994 ) 2531 . \n d. fox and p.b . \n kahn , phys . \n 134 ( 1964 ) b1151 ; t. nagao and m. wadati , j. phys . \n ( 1991 ) 3298 ; 61 ( 1992 ) 78 ; 61 ( 1992 ) 1910 . \n r. pullirsch , k. rabitsch , t. wettig , and h. markum , phys . \n b 427 ( 1998 ) 119 . m.l . \n mehta , _ random matrices _ \n ( academic press , san diego , 1991 ) . b.a . berg and c. panagiotakopoulos , \n 52 ( 1984 ) 94 . \n berg , h. markum , and r. pullirsch , phys . \n d 59 ( 1999 ) 097504 . e.v . \n shuryak and j.j.m . \n verbaarschot , nucl . phys . a 560 ( 1992 ) 306 ; j.j.m . verbaarschot and i. \n zahed , phys . \n 70 ( 1993 ) 3852 . \n h. leutwyler and a.v . \n smilga , phys . \n d 46 ( 1992 ) 5607 . m. gckeler , h. hehl , p.e.l . \n rakow , a. schfer , and t. wettig , phys . \n d 59 ( 1999 ) 094503 . b.a . \n berg , h. markum , r. pullirsch , and t. wettig , hep -

{"ContextTokens": 3681, "GeneratedTokens": 205, "SynthesizedBody": "the emission of radio frequency ( rf ) radiation from the extended air showers ( eas ) produced by ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr , i.e. , particles with energy @xmath0ev ) impinging on the earth atmosphere has been investigated since the 60s , after askaryan @xcite proposed a coherent mechanism for the production of cherenkov radiation at mhz frequencies ( the so called askaryan effect ) . the first detection of rf radiation from eas was proved in 1965 by jelley et al . @xcite . \n the idea of askaryan relies on the excess of negative charges in the shower , since positrons tend to disappear through their annihilation into photons , and further electrons are created via compton scattering by photons . \n if the number of electrons and positrons is the same , emission would not occur because the electric field generated by opposite charges is equal ( in module ) and opposite ( in sign ) . upon certain conditions \n , the cherenkov yield is not proportional to the number @xmath1 of charged particles in the shower , but to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fractional excess of charge . \n the quadratic dependence on @xmath1 ( and therefore on @xmath4 ) makes the askaryan effect attractive as mechanism for the detection of uhecrs .    in the following years \n , other mechanisms were proposed , which predict a coherent emission of rf radiation , and invoke the interaction of the shower electrons and positrons with the earth magnetic field . \n negative and positive charges are separated by the magnetic field , creating an electric dipole . during the motion of the dipole , \n rf radiation is emitted in coherent way ( geomagnetic effect ) . \n alternatively , charged particles are bent because of the lorentz force and emit synchrotron radiation ( geosynchrotron effect ) . \n the bunch of particles in the eas arriving to the detector can be schematically depicted as a dish , with thickness @xmath5 of a few meters and diameter depending of the energy of the primary . \n as will see in the followings , the requirement that the wavelength @xmath6 is comparable with the dish thickness puts a frequency cutoff above which coherence is lost ( and , consequently , the emission strongly hampered ) : @xmath7  mhz , where @xmath8 is the speed of light . \n the coherence condition explains why the experimental investigation is mostly concentrated in the frequency range @xmath9  mhz . \n this picture is not complete . \n only very recently , it has been shown , with monte carlo simulations @xcite , that geosynchrotron radiation can be coherent above @xmath10100  mhz under certain conditions : since the emission occurs in air , which has a ( altitude dependent ) refractive index @xmath11 , a time compression of rf wavefront is produced , which causes the coherence to extend to higher frequency , even beyond the ghz . \n the compression takes place only inside a cone with aperture @xmath12 equal to the cherenkov angle , and angular spread @xmath13 . outside this small angular region , \n coherence is lost and the rf output power falls dramatically . \n in this coherence regime , sometimes named \n geomagnetic cherenkov radiation \" , the emitted electric field amplitude @xmath14 depends on the frequency and can be modelled , as shown by refs . \n , as @xmath15 with @xmath16 300  mhz and @xmath17 500  mhz . here we will not deal with such particular mechanism . \n the first experimental proof of the coherent cherenkov emission in laboratory controlled conditions was performed in 2001 by directing picosecond pulses of gev photons against a silica sand target @xcite . successively other tests were conducted using rock salt @xcite or ice @xcite as targets . because of the higher density of those materials , the shower dimensions are different than in air , and askaryan effect can extend beyond ghz frequencies . \n the coherent rf emission by charged particles in the presence of a magnetic field has been measured in controlled conditions and successfully checked versus electrodynamics simulations in ref . . \n beside coherent emission , a rf incoherent emission mechanism exists , that is , bremsstralhung radiation , the emission of photons during the deflection of electrons and positrons under the coulomb field of the nuclei . \n the emission is always present but is weak since it scales linearly with @xmath4 and the cross section is low .    in this paper we do not discuss the various mechanisms of production of rf radiation and their relative importance . \n our purpose is to explicitly show how and when coherent mechanisms appear , and to derive a general formula which involves the coherent and the incoherent regimes . \n we suppose that the eas is composed by @xmath1 charged particles divided into @xmath18 electrons and @xmath19 positrons ( @xmath20 ) , and indicate with @xmath3 the charge excess : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . \n depending of the rf radiation mechanism , the phase of the electromagnetic wave from a single emitter ( electron or positron ) can change randomly with time or can not . for bremsstrahlung , for example , \n the phase changes randomly and therefore the superposition of @xmath1 sources is incoherent and the emitted energy is proportional to @xmath1 . for synchrotron , geomagnetic , and cherenkov emission the phase of a single emitter does not change randomly with time . \n the superposition of @xmath1 emitters can be coherent or incoherent depending on the random relative position of the individual sources .    to simplify the calculations \n , we suppose that the electric field amplitude is unity and the fields are polarized in the same direction .    for the case of cherenkov radiation , the electron and positron electric fields have opposite sign . \n therefore the total electric field @xmath14 ( at the detector ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the phases of the rf wave emitted by the @xmath26-th electron and positron , respectively . for any @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath24 \n are independent random variables with the same distribution @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 \n . therefore their mean values , for any @xmath26 , are @xmath29 . \n the energy @xmath30 is @xmath31 we are interested to the mean value @xmath32 : @xmath33 since @xmath24 is independent of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 = @xmath37 = @xmath38 = @xmath39 . \n it is reasonable to assume that the probability density @xmath40 is an even function between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so @xmath43 . in conclusion \n , @xmath44 analogously @xmath45 @xmath46 the energy @xmath47 is therefore @xmath48\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ]    the factor which determines the presence of the coherence is precisely @xmath49 . \n it can be easily seen in the case where the phases @xmath50 are uniformly distributed between @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath51 two extreme regimes can be identified :    1 . \n @xmath52 : @xmath53 , which is the condition for complete incoherence . \n the total energy is @xmath54 . \n this is the case , for example , of the optical and uv cherenkov light emission . \n @xmath55 : total coherence . \n @xmath56 , depends on the excess @xmath3 of negative charges in the shower . \n the cherenkov angle . ]    . \n [ fg : systemref ]    we treat now the generic case for the cherenkov radiation where the phase @xmath50 is not uniformely distributed . \n the results can be easily adapted to the geosynchronous and the geomagnetic radiation . with reference to fig.[fg : systemref ] , we introduce a reference system with versors @xmath57 , where the eas axis coincides the @xmath58 axis . \n @xmath59 is a single emitter with cylindrical coordinates @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the cherenkov cone aperture , @xmath62 the angular coordinate along the emission cone . \n the detector d is placed on the axis @xmath58 at the distance @xmath63 : @xmath64 . \n p is the projection of s on the x - y plane . \n then : @xmath65 , @xmath66 . \n the wave vector @xmath67 is @xmath68 and the phase @xmath50 of the electric field in the point d is @xmath69\\ ] ] the phase @xmath50 depends also on @xmath63 ( fixed value ) , but since in the calculation of the energy only the phase differences enter , the term with @xmath63 always eliminates , so we can put @xmath70 to simplify the computation : @xmath71\\ ] ] we schematize the shower as a flat cylinder , with thickness @xmath5 and charge distribution @xmath72 along the shower axis ( @xmath73 ) , and radial charge distribution @xmath74 such as @xmath75 = 1 . \n the angular variables @xmath76 and @xmath62 are distributed uniformily between 0 and @xmath77 \n . then @xmath78\\big]\\ ] ] the computation is straightforward in the case @xmath79 ( uniform distribution ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the bessel function of the first kind . \n calling : @xmath82 and @xmath83 then @xmath84    the same procedure can be applied to the geosynchrotron emission . \n the electric field of the synchrotron radiation is @xcite : @xmath85}{r~(1-\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\hat{n})^3 } \\bigg]_{retarded}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the versor of the direction of observation , @xmath87 is the particle acceleration , and the electron electric charge @xmath88 must be considered with the sign . since positrons and electrons have opposite acceleration under magnetic field , the product @xmath89 is the same for the two particles , so the electric fields sum up . \n therefore , for geosynchrotron radiation , the eq.([eq : efield ] ) becomes @xmath90 and the final result is : @xmath91\\mean{\\cos\\phi}^2\\ ] ] in case of total coherence , @xmath92 . \n ( [ eq : wmedio ] ) and ( [ eq : wmedio2 ] ) can be summarized stating that the total power emitted by @xmath1 sources is obtained multiplying the power from a single source by a factor @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the spatial coherence factor , function of the radiation frequency @xmath96 and of the shower shape and dimension , and the sign @xmath97 depends on the emission mechanism (  for cherenkov , + for synchrotron and geomagnetic ) . \n the factor @xmath98 in eq.([eq : m ] ) determines the coherent or incoherent regime . if @xmath99 , the incoherence is total , and @xmath100 , i.e. the total emitted power is the some of the @xmath1 single powers . on the opposite \n , complete coherence occurs as @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for cherenkov emission , @xmath103 for geosynchrotron and geomagnetic emission , i.e. , the power is proportional to the squared number of emitters . \n the factorization ( @xmath104 ) has the physical meaning that the longitudinal and radial developments of the showers are independent of each other , which is a reasonable approximation that can be extended to the general case . \n @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , takes into account the radial emitter distribution @xmath74 , in the plane perpendicular to the shower axis , while @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) takes into account the distribution along the longitudinal axis .    as a check , \n note that when @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( total spatial incoherence ) and when @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( total spatial coherence ) . \n as an example of the above calculations , we apply them to the case of eas produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .    it is well known that a relativistic particle with velocity @xmath115 such that @xmath116 ,

{"ContextTokens": 2004, "GeneratedTokens": 80, "SynthesizedBody": "let me first start with what this talk will not be :    * an introduction to supersymmetry . \n first of all you are all experts in the field , and second we just attended an excellent introductory presentation@xcite ; * a discussion of the cosmological aspects , mostly due to my inability ; * a comprehensive review because of the limited amount of time available . \n this discussion will rather focus on :    * the lep legacy , with minimal experimental details , because the lep results often remain the most constraining at this point ; * recent results from the run ii of the tevatron , which is curently the most powerful collider in operation . at the tevatron , \n proton - antiproton collisions take place at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev , and the instantaneous luminosity recently reached the @xmath0@xmath1s@xmath2 level . \n the frameworks in which these results will be presented are :    * most of the time `` standard susy '' . \n this means the mssm , often with some generic unification constraints ( essentially for slepton or gaugino susy - breaking masses ) at the scale of grand unification ( gut ) , and with the assumption that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino @xmath3 . \n occasionnally , the model considered will be even more constrained in the form of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) ; * in a few instances gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , which offers clean and simple signatures , in its minimal version ; * with r - parity conservation . \n again , this is mostly due to lack of time in view of the large number of equally acceptable scenarios , and also partly because of a personal prejudice having to do with the absence of dark matter in r - parity violating models . \n ( here i have to seek forgiveness from my hera colleagues . )    at lep , all supersymmetric particles , except for the gluinos , are produced in a rather democratic fashion via electroweak interactions , up to mass effects . since \n pair production of the lsp is not directly detectable , the search is naturally directed towards the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsp s ) . \n the results can often be presented in a model independent , or at least moderately dependent , way . \n results from various channels can furthermore be combined within some specific theoretical framework to derive additional constraints , of which the most celebrated one is the lsp - mass lower limit .    at the tevatron , \n colored particles ( i.e. , squarks and gluinos ) are expected to be produced with large cross sections via strong interactions . \n the resulting final states consisting mostly of jets and missing transverse energy however suffer from large backgrounds from standard multijet production . \n the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos has a much lower cross section , but clean final states such as trileptons and missing transverse energy are considerably easier to discriminate from standard model backgrounds . \n finally , in contrast to the situation at lep , a model independent presentation of the results is usually unavailable because it is highly unpractical to provide one which would be both transparent and meaningful . \n all limits ( unfortunately ... ) quoted in the following are given at 95% confidence level . \n because this is probably the simplest channel , both theoretically and experimentally , among those which have been analysed at lep , let us begin with the search for smuon pair production , which proceeds only through @xmath4 exchange in the @xmath5-channel . \n it is assumed that it is the supersymmetric partner @xmath6 of the right - handed muon which is the lighter of the two smuons , an assumption which is valid in models involving the unification of susy - breaking masses and which is conservative in terms of production cross section . \n the only parameter which is needed to calculate this cross section is the smuon mass . if the smuon is furthermore assumed to be the nlsp , the only decay channel available is @xmath7 , and the only additional parameter involved is the lsp mass @xmath8 . \n the final state consists in a pair of acoplanar muons , and the main background , from @xmath9 , is well under control . \n the search result obtained by the four lep experiments combined is shown in fig .  [ \n smuonstop](left )  @xcite ; the gap along the diagonal is due to the softness of the muons when the @xmath10 \n @xmath3 mass difference is very small . with the additional condition of gaugino mass unification \n , the assumption that the smuon is the nlsp can be relaxed , and the effect of cascade decays such as @xmath11 with @xmath12 can be incorporated . \n these cascade decays occur only at small values of @xmath8 , for which the smuon mass limit of almost 100  gev is slightly degraded .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the question can be raised of the relevance of the tevatron searches for squarks and gluinos . \n indeed , if gaugino mass unification is assumed , as it is the case in msugra , the lep limits on charginos translate into gluino mass limits well beyond those within the tevatron reach . \n similarly , if slepton and squark mass unification is assumed , the lep limits on selectrons are more restrictive than those on squark masses from the tevatron . \n the cdf and dcollaborations should therefore be encouraged to present their results within frameworks other than msugra . \n for instance , in susy - gut models where susy breaking is induced by an f - term which is a * 75 * of su(5 ) , rather than by a singlet , the @xmath13 ratio is of order unity , in which case lep results do not constrain gluino masses above 105  gev or so . \n string inspired models can also lead to similar gaugino mass hierarchies . \n before concluding , i want to quote a result which is a bit off the main track , but still relevant for supersymmetry . \n the cdf and d  collaborations have searched for the rare decay @xmath14 which is expected to be at the 3.5  10@xmath15 level in the standard model , but may be enhanced by a factor of @xmath16 , i.e. , by as much as three orders of magnitude , in supersymmetry . at the time this talk was given , the cdf collaboration had quoted a limit of 7.5  10@xmath17  @xcite , improving substantially over the previous best limit and probing relevant new territory , while the d  collaboration had not yet `` opened the box . '' \n has been set  @xcite ]    as of today , the main constraints on supersymmetry obtained at accelerators remain those established by lep . if fine tuned parameter configurations are discarded , limits of the order of 100  gev are set on slepton and chargino masses , and the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle has to exceed 47  gev in the mssm with slepton , squark and gaugino mass unification . \n the tevatron is however already providing relevant results . in the framework of gauge \n mediated supersymmetry , a lower limit of 108 gev has been set on the mass of a neutralino nlsp . \n trilepton searches should lead to new constraints on minimal supergravity in the near future . \n squark and gluino searches are well underway , although an adequate interpretation of the results is still lacking . with the continuously improving performance of the tevatron \n , the coming years can be expected to provide an exciting harvest of new results . \n 9 sabine kraml , these proceedings . \n the lep - susy working group : + http://lepsusy.web.cern.ch/lepsusy/ aleph collaboration , phys . \n b488 * ( 2000 ) 234 . \n aleph collaboration , phys . \n * b440 * ( 1998 ) 419 , + and eur . \n j. , * c17 * ( 2000 ) 223 . \n the cdf exotics group : + http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/exotic/exotic.html d  new phenomena results : + http://www-d0.fnal.gov/run2physics/www/results/np/np.htm d  b physics results : + http://www-d0.fnal.gov/run2physics/www/results/b/b.htm", "StartTimeOffset": 1646616231276, "RequestID": "e146dc72d3654ebab564448d7b5e5bc6", "TotalTokens": 2084}

{"ContextTokens": 3085, "GeneratedTokens": 71, "SynthesizedBody": "the search for new physics beyond the standard model in the future will follow two main paths : higher energy and high \n intensity  @xcite . \n neutrino facilities will play an important role in this program : neutrino masses take us beyond the standard model , and a full determination of the pattern of @xmath1 masses and mixing will require dedicated high  intensity neutrino beams  @xcite . \n however , a high  intensity @xmath1 beam can be used not only to study neutrino properties , but also as a sensitive probe of the electroweak interaction . \n indeed , it has been shown that a wide spectrum of otherwise very difficult or impossible measurements of strong and electroweak processes would become possible at a high  energy neutrino factory  @xcite . \n here we start addressing the issue whether equally interesting measurements might also be possible with a _ low energy _ but sufficiently intense @xmath1 beam . \n indeed , the main role so far of low  energy tests of the standard model  @xcite has been in the study of rare processes . here \n we will investigate whether with sufficiently high  intensity they may lead to competitive measurements of standard model parameters , specifically the electroweak mixing angle . \n the development of future neutrino facilities is driven by the study of neutrino masses and mixings , and will happen in three stages . in \n the first phase various facilities will produce conventional @xmath1 beams from the decay of a secondary meson beam ( producing typically @xmath2 @xmath1/year ) . \n examples of such facilities ( now under construction or just commissioned ) are minos and no@xmath1a , the cern / gran sasso beam , and t2k . in the second stage , \n planned for the beginning of the next decade , `` superbeams '' , i.e. conventional beams but with intensities about hundred times higher , should be constructed , exploiting very high  intensity , and relatively low energy primary proton beams . \n examples of such facilities are the second phase of t2k , exploiting a 50 gev and 7 mw proton synchrotron at jparc , and a possible high  energy superbeam at cern exploiting a 3.5  gev , 45  mw superconducting proton linac ( spl ) . in the third phase , starting perhaps towards the end of the next decade , neutrinos from decays of a _ primary _ beam are planned . \n two possible kinds of primary beams are envisaged : either a neutrino factory , i.e. relatively high  energy ( tens of gev ) muon beam , or a @xmath0beam , i.e. relatively low  energy ( few gev ) radioactive nuclei . \n the advantage of using a primary beam are higher intensity and a better control on the neutrino energy spectrum . \n the @xmath0 beam has the further advantage of giving a pure beam of electronic @xmath1 or @xmath3 , with essentially no contamination from @xmath4 or wrong  sign neutrinos . \n the neutrino factory gives a beam which is exactly 50% @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n because neutrinos only couple to weak interactions , they are an ideal probe of electroweak parameters , specifically of the electroweak mixing angle ( weinberg angle ) which controls the relative strength of neutral ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) couplings . \n electron elastic scattering offers an ideally clean setting for this measurement , which is competitive at a high energy neutrino factory  @xcite , but ( because the cross section grows linearly with the energy ) at a low  energy facility very high intensities are required  @xcite \n . a measurement of the weinberg angle can be obtained from the cc / nc deep - inelastic scattering ratio : this measurement at present is almost competitive , but marred by the uncertainty related to parton distributions  @xcite . \n it would certainly be competitive at a neutrino factory  @xcite . \n as the energy is lowered , the relative ( quasi)elastic contribution to the total cross section grows , and at an energy @xmath7 the elastic and inelastic contribution are of comparable size ( see fig . \n [ xsect ] ) . at this energy , \n at which perturbative treatment of inelastic contribution breaks down anyway , the relative elastic contribution is sizable , while total cross section is still reasonably large . \n this energy is relevant for future facilities , such as jparc , a low \n energy @xmath0 beam or the spl superbeam , and it is natural to ask whether elastic or quasielastic scattering can be used for competitive measurements of weinberg angle .    nucleon cross sections vs. energy . ] \n [ xsect ]    the answer is not obvious , because ( quasi)elastic cross sections depend on eight independent form factors  @xcite : two pairs of electric and magnetic form factors for proton and neutron targets , a pair of strange electric and magnetic form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons ) and a pair of axial isotriplet and strange form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons , up to signs ) . \n the question is then whether the uncertainty in the form factors knowledge spoils the extraction of @xmath8 from these cross sections . \n the simplest answer to the above question is obtained by a counting of the relevant physical observables . with proton and neutron ( from deuterium or other nuclei ) targets and @xmath1 and @xmath9 beams \n , one can measure four independent nc and two independent cc cross sections . \n they depend on eight form factors and the weinberg angle . \n hence , at least three form factors have to be input to the analysis . \n it is convenient to input the electric form factors , whose forward value is fixed by charge .    assuming a flux @xmath10 with energy @xmath11  gev one gets @xmath12 elastic cc events and @xmath13 nc events with either beam or target after one year of running with each beam . \n this flux and energy are typical e.g. of a low \n energy @xmath0beam , with a detector located at a distance of @xmath14  km . \n assuming that the five independent form factors and the weinberg angle are determined in each angular bin this leads to a statistical error @xmath15  @xcite . \n the further theoretical error due to the electric form factor is negligible . \n it is important to observe that these form factors must be input if one wishes to extract all the other form factors and @xmath16 . \n however , the cross section can actually be measured in a large number of angular ( or @xmath17 ) bins ( e.g. several dozens ) . \n one may thus choose to parametrize the form factors and fit these parameters as well as @xmath16 . clearly , with , say , 20 bins and several cross sections even with a very general parametrization all form factors can be determined together with the weinberg angle . \n this suggests that a more detailed analysis is worthwhile . \n the main experimental constraint is the possibility to detect cc and nc events with a neutrino beam energy between one and a few gev . \n this rules out water cherenkov detectors , because the cherenkov threshold @xmath18 for the recoiling proton implies that only protons with recoil momentum @xmath19  gev can be detected , which removes most of the cross section . \n a more promising alternative is a liquid ar tpc  @xcite . in this case \n , the only constraint is that the recoiling proton leaves a sufficiently long track so that it is not confused with nucleon motion due to nuclear effects . \n this gives a constraint on the proton energy @xmath20  mev i.e. @xmath21  mev . with a beam energy of the order of 1 gev , \n about 75% of the scattering events survives this kinematic cut . \n however , recoiling neutrons can not be detected . \n this implies that neutron neutral current ( nc ) events are essentially lost and one is left with only four independent cross sections .    in order to maximize the flux \n , one may envisage the option of having a near detector , located at a few hundreds of meters from the source , thereby obtaining fluxes by many orders of magnitude larger than those at the far detector used for oscillations studies . \n however , in a realistic analysis one should keep into account that an argon tpc might have difficulties in handling interaction rates much larger than a few events per spill . \n this would put a bound on the maximum flux .      in order to get a more quantitative estimate of the accuracy \n one can reach in the weinberg angle determination , we have generated scattering events assuming an incoming flux @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with fixed energy @xmath24  gev . \n these parameters are typical e.g. of t2k ( first phase ) with a near detector at about 300  m from the source . in the present analysis we have considered the case of a liquid argon detector with a mass of 10  ktons . \n an increase in the detector mass would correspond to a reduction in the fit uncertainty that can be easily obtained by standard statistical analysis . \n we have assumed @xmath25 and all the nucleon form factors as given in ref . \n @xcite and in ref . \n @xcite for the axial and strange form factors ; in particular for the strange magnetic form factor we used @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the neutrino momentum transfer , @xmath28 , @xmath29 nucleon mass , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    we have then performed a fit to the events thus generated , leaving as free parameters @xmath16 and the forward value of the strange magnetic form factor @xmath32 . \n we have then repeated this fit by varying the value of the forward strange axial form factor @xmath33 , considering one @xmath34 variation around its central value ( @xmath35 ) . \n these are the only forward form factors which are affected by a significant uncertainty . \n other form factor parameters have a more moderate impact . \n we get @xmath36 , where the systematic error is due to the variation of the strange axial form factor within the range indicated . \n clearly , a more detailed analysis  @xcite would require either fitting of all form factors , or varying some of their parameters within errors . \n in such an analysis we will also introduce a study of the systematical uncertainty related to the choice of the form factor parametrization . \n however , on the basis of this first estimates , we conclude that a determination of @xmath16 with an uncertainty of a few percent is not unreasonable . \n one of us , v.a . , is deeply grateful to the now 2006 organizers for providing a stimulating human and scientific atmosphere . \n he also would like to thank in

{"ContextTokens": 2466, "GeneratedTokens": 234, "SynthesizedBody": "adass is the major annual conference for those interested in astronomy software and systems , from architects and developers to users and managers . \n its 24 year history indicates its usefulness to individuals and institutions , as a place to showcase our latest work , to learn new techniques and discover which have been successfully used in our specialist field ; to discuss emerging technologies with colleagues with similar interests and generally to work towards continually improving the overall shape of the field of astronomical software . \n success is no reason for complacency , however . over the last two decades we have seen the needs of our community change , and \n indeed our demographic has itself changed . on the broader astronomical stage \n we re seeing our travel budgets shrinking , and many find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether their single overseas conference for the year will focus on their science or on the technology aspects of their work if it is to continue being a useful and worthwhile conference , adass must adapt , keeping up with the needs of the adass community and the astronomical community as a whole , while keeping in mind our changing demographics .    to this end \n the adass program organising committee ( poc ) ran a survey in early 2014 to ascertain the needs of the community and the direction and shape which future adass meetings should take . \n 140 people participated ( as a comparison , a typical adass has around 270 attendees ) , 84% of whom had attended 2 or more adass conferences , 12% had attended 1 and 14% had never been to an adass . \n identity : :    we advertise the adass conference as _ `` a forum for * _ scientists _ * ,    * _ developers _ * and * _ programmers _ * working in areas related to    algorithms , software and systems for the acquisition , reduction ,    analysis , and dissemination of astronomical data''_. the 140 survey    participants identified themselves as astronomers ( 69% ) , software    engineers ( 38% ) , programmers ( 30% ) , software architects ( 29% ) ,    managers ( 28% ) and computer scientists ( 22% ) , with a small number of    instrument scientists , and database , archive and data    specialists . the fact that 31% of people did not self - identify as    astronomers shows that we have moved from a community of `` astronomers    who code '' , to a more diverse one which includes people whose primary    expertise is in engineering . \n this reflects the trend we see in our    institutes and telescope facilities , and it is important that the    focus and program of the adass conference also evolves over time to    keep up with the changing needs of our community . \n the very small    numbers of postdocs ( 6 ) and students ( 4 ) who participated in the    survey is compatible with the small number from these two groups who    attend the conference . \n this was discussed in the bof and it was agreed    that mechanisms should be put in place to encourage more students and    early career postdocs to come to adass . \n themes : :    each year s conference is based around a handful of key themes . these    are chosen by the poc and are intended to reflect the current work ,    trends and needs of our community , including suggestions made by the    conference attendees . \n the bof participants    agreed that final responsibility for theme selection should rest with    the poc , and also that the community should be actively encouraged to    nominate key themes . \n the appgree mobile    application , which was tested during    this conference , was put forward as a possible way of facilitating    participation and of canvassing community preferences on the submitted    topics . for adass \n xxv the poc plans to use appgree to receive theme    suggestions and hopes to see wide participation from the community .    additionally , 88 people submitted key topic suggestions through the    survey , and these will also inform the selection of key themes for the    next several conferences . \n conference content : :    both the survey and the bof discussion agreed that there is a need for    greater focus on algorithms , statistics , analysis methods , data    science , etc . \n , in invited and contributed talks , and less emphasis on    update reports . \n adass talks should be more about the algorithms and    techniques than about the projects themselves . \n there was considerable    support from the bof session for invited review talks looking at the    state of play in various aspects of software . \n +    there were several practical suggestions made during the bof which had    the support of the room : authors should be able to classify their    paper under more than one key theme when submitting an abstract . \n this    would help the loc when setting up the conference sessions and ensure    that each talk was presented in the most relevant session from the    author s point of view . \n there was also a request to allow authors to    supply , when submitting an abstract , an optional link containing more    information about the proposed paper . \n +    discussion on student attendance saw strong agreement on ensuring that    the conference fee has a student rate , and allowing authors to    indicate whether they are a student both on registration and abstract    submission . \n there was also a general feeling that there should be a    way to reserve contributed talk slots for early career attendees    ( particularly those who have not previously presented a talk ) , but the    details of how this might be achieved were not discussed . \n +    another subject raised was whether some plenary discussion time could    be scheduled during the oral sessions , at the end of each major topic ,    at the end of each day , or at the end of the conference . \n there was    some support for this and also some concern , from participants who    thought it would cut into the time available and result in fewer    talks . \n +    a few people showed interested in a hack day , and there was no    opposition to the idea . \n this could be scheduled as a half -

numbered and another for odd - numbered posters ) when    people were expected to be in attendance at their posters , to    facilitate discussion . \n birds of a feather : :    bof sessions at adass are an opportunity for informal , free - flowing    discussions among people with a common interest . \n bofs are scheduled    based on proposals submitted by attendees wishing to organise and    chair a session on a given subject . \n an average of 5 bofs are held each    year although the number proposed and held in any one year varies    widely . \n some subjects ( e.g.  fits and other data formats ) have a bof    most years whilst other topics come up once or twice when they are of    interest to the community and then fade away as their relevance and    urgency decreases . \n +    at the xxiii - rd meeting in 2013 informal `` pop - up '' bofs were    suggested and tried , where the subjects for discussion were proposed    and scheduled during the conference , in the style of an    `` unconference '' . \n this was repeated at this year s meeting , and    although the take - up of pop - up bofs has been small the opinion at the    bof was that we should continue to offer them . \n +    a suggestion was made to dedicate a session to people s specific    technical problems - `` i ve got a problem , does anyone know the    answer ? '' , harnessing the concentrated expertise of the conference    attendees . \n it was agreed that pop - up bofs may be useful here , or a    hack - day , depending on the nature of the problem . \n governance : :    the adass program organising committee ( poc ) consists of around 15    people , these being representatives of the adass sponsoring    institutions and members of the community with an interest in adass . \n members are nominated to the poc and ratified by the sitting    committee . \n the 2014 poc consists of 16 people , and includes an    executive committee comprised of the poc chair , vice - chair , secretary    and treasurer . \n +    the survey indicated that the majority of the adass community are    satisfied with the conference organisation and governance ( 67% ) with    smaller fractions preferring the poc to be directly elected from and    by the community ( 18% ) , or wanting to change the length of the term of    poc membership ( 17% ) . \n +    it was noted at the bof session that the poc is gender - unbalanced at    present , and has been so for all of adass s history . additionally the    wish was expressed for the composition of the poc to be more    geographically diverse . \n costs and sponsorship : :    there was agreement at the bof that we should seek industry support    for the conference . \n this was mainly seen as a way to reduce costs , and    particularly to make it easier for students to attend . \n the    practicalities are open to debate , but nobody saw it as bad , as long    as our independence is preserved . \n +    once specific idea which saw considerable support was to secure    sponsorship from a printer company in the form of a printer loan for a    few days at the start of the meeting . \n the posters could then be    printed at the conference location , avoiding the too - common event of    posters getting lost or damaged in transit . \n +    the conference fee was discussed , but there was no obvious consensus    on whether lowering the fees would make a difference to people s    ability to attend the meeting , as this is often a fraction of the    travel and accommodation cost . \n the comment was made that it is hard    for young people to obtain travel funding to come to adass , although    it was agreed that it is important that they do . \n student conference    rates help slightly as does the financial aid scheme . \n +    finally , the demonstration fees were deemed to be too high by some    survey respondents , who argued that demo booths are no longer the    technological burden on the loc that they once were , and that several    of the institutes who wish to have a booth at adass are the same ones    who sponsor the conference . \n after discussion the poc agreed to reduce    the fee for demonstrations from research institutions , but maintain    the current fee for commercial bodies . \n the discussion must continue . please make your ideas and suggestions known . \n speak with a member of the poc , or send your thoughts by email ( poc@adass.org ) . \n alternatively tweet your suggestions to ( @astroadass ) or use appgree to participate in adass polls .", "StartTimeOffset": 1675655977800, "RequestID": "5ff50d32f11448f4b121ad63c426ed1e", "TotalTokens": 2700}
{"ContextTokens": 3851, "GeneratedTokens": 199, "SynthesizedBody": "the study of accretion dynamics of charged particles in the vicinity of a compact gravitational source is of observational as well as theoretical interest ; particularly for the information it reveals about the nature and influence of the background spacetime on the various physical processes occurring in the star s vicinity . whereas a compact star is formed largely of a degenerate plasma@xmath0 , matter surrounding the star exists in a highly ionized , though  a less dense , state@xmath1 . in this region \n the charged particles are more free to move while not accreted to relativistic velocities , and the dynamics of these charged particles is governed not only by the gravitational but also by the electromagnetic field of the star . \n however the electromagnetic field is itself  effected by the geometry of the background spacetime . \n therefore it is of importance and of astrophysical relevance that the two - fold effects ; namely , the coupling of the gravitational and the electromagnetic field of the star , as well as the direct effects of the background spacetime on the motion of a charged particle , must be addressed together@xmath2 .    here \n we present an investigation of these effects on the dynamics of an accreted  charged particle lying in the star s plasma atmosphere . to pose the problem quantitatively \n we consider a slowly rotating isolated compact star as the source of gravitational field which defines the geometry of the background spacetime . an axially symmetric , highly conducting plasma with a stationary , axially symmetric electromagnetic field is assumed to constitute the star s atmosphere . \n we regard the electromagnetic field as perturbed by the background spacetime , however the back - reaction of the electromagnetic field on the spacetime curvature is neglected and the standard kerr metric ( in its linearized form ) is used for the fixed background spacetime . for the plasma surrounding the star the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation \n is assumed , as such the plasma is considered as an ideal highly conducting mhd fluid@xmath3 . \n the formulation of the electromagnetic field equations is based on a generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid in a curved spacetime@xmath4 . \n the direct effects of the spacetime dragging on the particle dynamics are discussed in the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the geodesic equation@xmath5 . \n the gem approximation , which assumes the charged particle motion to be slow , is generally valid in the case of stable compact stars ( i.e. non - collapsing objects ) . \n also for the case of a magnetized compact star with a dipole field the gem approximation is applicable except at or very close to the poles where particle velocities can be relativistic due to intense magnetic field . \n generally the accretion occurs well below the relativistic limit and so the gem approximation can be used . throughout \n we take the velocity four vector as defined by a comoving observer zamo ( zero angular momentum observer ) . \n the zamo is a useful class of observers , relevant to astrophysics , circling the gravitational source with a given angular velocity at a fixed radial distance and polar angle@xmath6 . \n the paper is organized as follows . in the first part of our analysis , \n comprising section ii , we obtain exact solutions of the general relativistic maxwell equations using the generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal , highly conducting mhd fluid in linearized kerr spacetime . \n the solution obtained shows that in the slow rotation approximation the effects of rotation on the electromagnetic field are absent . \n then , in section iii , assuming the star to be a sphere of homogeneous mass density , we study numerically the dynamics of the charged particle using the gem approximation . in this approximation \n the direct effects of rotation ( i.e. via frame - dragging ) on particle trajectories are found to oppose that of the electromagnetic field , hence the particle motion is a result of balancing and counter - balancing of these effects . \n lastly , in section iv , we give a discussion and a summary of the main conclusions of the paper . \n the exterior spacetime to a slowly rotating compact gravitational source of mass @xmath7 is described by the linearized kerr metric . in the boyer - lindquist \n coordinates the metric can be written as the general line element :    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    and @xmath10 is the angular velocity of a free falling frame brought into rotation by the frame dragging of the spacetime . here and in what follows the greek indices run as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . \n also throughout we assume the gravitational units in which @xmath13 . \n the general relativistic form of the maxwell equations is @xmath14@xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 represents the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 given by the einstein field equations . here \n @xmath19 is the generalized electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid given by a unique tensorial expression :    @xmath20    and @xmath21 is current four vector . in general the current four vector \n is the sum of two terms corresponding to a convection and to a conduction current :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the proper charge density , @xmath24 is the conductivity of the fluid , and @xmath25 is the unit velocity @xmath26-vector . \n the volume element 4-form @xmath27 and its dual @xmath28 are defined by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the levi -civita symbol , which is @xmath31 or @xmath32 for an even , odd , or non - permutation of @xmath33 respectively . \n also the four vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , denote the electric and magnetic field components in the four dimensional spacetime . for a zamo @xmath36 and \n @xmath37 vanish , and using @xmath38 , the components of the four velocity vector are :    @xmath39    here we employ the often made assumption of a perfectly conducting plasma surrounding the star ( cf e.g. [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] for a discussion of this assumption with respect to the generalized ohm s law ) . \n since for plasma the condition of neutrality also holds thus @xmath21 must vanish identically . \n the maxwell equations ( 4 ) give :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    whereas from expression ( 5 ) we obtain :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47      the electromagnetic field outside the plasma surrounding the compact star is now determined by equation ( 10 ) to ( 17 ) . to solve this system of equations \n let us assume the following separation ansatz for the magnetic field components @xmath48 and @xmath49 :    @xmath50    and similarly for the electric field components @xmath51 and @xmath52 :    @xmath53    substituting from equation ( 18 ) into equation ( 10 ) and simplifying we obtain    @xmath54    for separation we require that @xmath55 and obtain    @xmath56    and    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the separation constant . solving for @xmath59 the equation ( 21 ) \n we obtain @xmath60 . notice that because of the exponential function the field at coincident points @xmath61 and @xmath62 is not identical . \n we therefore require single valued solution @xmath63 . the solutions to equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) \n are now given by :    @xmath64    and    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants . \n therefore we have    @xmath68    where @xmath69 . \n and similarly from equation ( 13 ) and ( 18 ) we obtain    @xmath70    and hence    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    now to determine the functions @xmath74 we substitute from ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) into equation ( 13 ) . after some simplification \n we obtain in a separated form :    @xmath75    as before we have    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is a constant \n . since ( 30 ) holds for every value of @xmath79 , on comparing coefficients of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and unity we obtain @xmath82 and @xmath83 . \n here are now two possibilities for non - trivial solutions depending on either @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath86 ) \n .    for @xmath84 equation ( 29 ) gives    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is a constant . from equations ( 25 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 17 ) we obtain in a similar manner    @xmath89    hence    @xmath90    and    @xmath91    also from equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) we obtain    @xmath92    @xmath93    for @xmath86 ( and similarly for @xmath94 ) , there is no poloidal component to the magnetic ( electric ) field  and the only non - vanishing components to the electromagnetic field are given by equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) . \n clearly in both cases the electromagnetic field is independent of @xmath95 .    in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) \n we give plots for the magnetic ( electric ) field components @xmath49 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 \n according to the general theory of relativity the trajectory of a particle in the field of a massive object is determined by the geodesic equation :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the christoffel symbol . to linearize the geodesic equation we assume that the metric tensor can be expressed as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath107 is a small perturbation to the spacetime metric such that @xmath108 . \n we can take time @xmath109 for the affine parameter @xmath110 . further requiring @xmath111 for a ` slow ' moving particle we obtain@xmath112 @xmath113 where    @xmath114    and    @xmath115    @xmath116 being the mass density and @xmath117 is the volume of the gravitational source . \n this approximation , due to its formal analogy to the classical electromagnetic theory , is referred to as the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the general theory of relativity ( see reference [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] for different interpretations ) . thus in expression \n ( 40 ) @xmath118 is called the gravitoelectric ( ge ) force per unit mass whereas the term @xmath119 is called the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force for a unit mass . in particular the gm force , being independent of the choice of a particular coordinate system used , is general relativistically significant .    in the slow rotation approximation the deformation to the star due to the effects of rotation \n are small compared to the  radially attractive ge force ; hence we take the star to be a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density . then using gem analogy , \n we obtain :    @xmath120    and @xmath121 where @xmath7 is the mass , @xmath122 is the radius and @xmath123 is the angular velocity of the star . \n thus in the field of a slowly rotating compact star , the net force acting on a particle of mass @xmath124 and charge @xmath125 is the sum of the gravitational and the electromagnetic forces :    @xmath126    to specify the physical situation we study the motion of the charged particle in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath127 and take @xmath128 to be along the positive @xmath129-axis . \n furthermore , since now the effective component of the gm force lies in the @xmath130-plane , we assume that the @xmath130-plane is the equatorial plane of the star and the particle s motion is confined to this plane only . \n then for the case of non - vanishing poloidal magnetic field we transform expressions ( 33)-(36 ) and ( 42)-(43 ) into the cartesian coordinates , and obtain the equations of motion in the equatorial plane ( i. e. for @xmath61 ) :    @xmath131    @xmath132    where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . notice that here the case of vanishing poloidal magnetic field is obtained for @xmath136 whereas requiring @xmath94 does not alter the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) . \n we numerically solve the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) for the initial conditions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and plot ( in figure ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) ) the solutions for various values of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . \n we have considered the dynamics of a charged particle in a highly , conducting plasma surrounding a slowly rotating compact gravitational source . \n the effects of background spacetime have been discussed , both directly on the particle s motion and indirectly via an axially symmetric electromagnetic field around the star . \n we found ( equations ( 33 ) to ( 36 ) ) that when slow rotation is assumed for the compact source the spacetime dragging does not modify or reduce the electromagnetic field of the star . \n hence the field remains , in this approximation , the same as for the schwarzchild spacetime . \n however the motion of the particle is directly influenced via gravitational field of the star . \n our numerical analysis of the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic field shows ( fig . \n ( 3 )  to ( 6 ) ) that whereas the electromagnetic effects dominate the overall dynamics of the charged particle at sufficiently large distances , the gravitational field also becomes important closer to the surface of the star especially if the star is rotating fast enough . \n firstly we observe that the effects of the electric field is to lift a charge particle from close to the surface of the star ( fig . \n ( 3 ) ) and make them move along the magnetic field lines . here \n are now two possibilities : one , if the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger than the magnitude of the electric field the particle following a helical trajectory falls into the star ( case ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig . ( 4 ) ) ; two , if the magnetic field strength is weaker or is even comparable to the electric field strength , then the electrical effects become dominant and the particle escapes from falling into the star ( case ( d ) , and ( e ) in fig.(4 ) ) .    on the other hand \n the effects of gravitational field can be regarded as opposing that of the electromagnetic field . in figure ( 5 ) we notice thatthe ge force attracts the particle towards the star s surface against the electric field . furthermore it is clear from figure ( 6 ) that the gyroradius of the helical trajectory of the particle is increased due to the gm force ; hence the gm force weakens the effects of the magnetic field .    summing up these observations \n we note that the accretion of a charged particle in vicinity of a compact star is mainly due to the ge and magnetic effects . \n these effects are especially dominant at a sufficiently large distances from the star . however _ close _ to the star the particle trajectory is also effected by the gm force as well as electric field which cause accerted charged particles to follow open lines of force . for a sufficiently fast rotating star and an electric field comparable to the magnetic field the above mechanism ( gm + electric ) may contribute to opposing the in - fall of the plasma surrounding the compact star .", "StartTimeOffset": 1680652968679, "RequestID": "3dee06f683d048558c98ed49f3f44ce4", "TotalTokens": 4050}

[ layer ] . \n the depth of the first minimum in the spectra scales linearly with the magnetic moment of the top layer while the energy of this minimum reflects the @xmath0-band width . as can be seen from fig . \n [ lattice ] , the nonlinear spectra reveal the structural changes induced by different substrates or temperatures . in fig . \n [ semi ] we compare the _ ab initio _ nonlinear kerr spectrum for the fe(001 ) monolayer with tight - binding calculations . from the results of fig . \n [ semi ] it becomes obvious that it is necessary to use _ ab initio _ \n calculations for the films if only bulk tight - binding parameters are available \n . however , tight - binding calculations may be adequate if one uses as input parameters those determined from _ ab initio _ calculations for thin films . \n we expect generally also interesting results for @xmath14 at heterogeneous interfaces like fe / cu(001 ) . \n for example , it is of interest to find out how the substrate interferes with the electronic structure of the thin film . \n for this reason we performed calculations of the fe / cu bilayer . \n results are shown in fig . \n [ bilayer ] . \n the additional peak structure reveals the electronic influence even of the nonmagnetic cu on the nonlinear magneto - optic response of thin films . \n this might be of general significance also with respect to the analysis of quantum well states ( tuning of interface properties , @xmath3 in substrate , m in films ) . \n that shg is very symmetry sensitive is furthermore particular demonstrated by its polarization dependence and by the remarkable enhancement of the kerr rotation@xcite . \n the latter important result was first theoretically derived by pustogowa _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite and later observed in experiments by bhmer _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite and koopmans _ et al . _ \n @xcite . \n first , we note that due to the symmetry sensitivity already shg exhibits a corresponding polarization dependence , which interestingly is very different for transition and noble metals  @xcite . \n the latter results , since @xmath19 and @xmath0 electrons feel the breakdown of inversion symmetry at the interface differently . \n this symmetry dependence mainly results from the matrix elements in @xmath14 , see eq . \n ( [ gl1 ] ) . \n the different possible optical excitations contributing to @xmath14 for noble and transition metals are illustrated in fig . \n obviously , shg yields interesting information on the electronic structure even for @xmath2=0 and when no kerr effect is present . \n this area needs further analysis and might offer interesting new results  @xcite .    extending the symmetry analysis to the magnetic case we determine the kerr rotations for different configurations and polarizations . \n the general analysis can be performed by using for @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarization ( see  @xcite ) @xmath21 where in the longitudinal configuration the susceptibility tensor is given by @xmath22 and in the polar configuration by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the angles of polarization of the reflected frequency doubled and of the incident light , @xmath26 are the amplitudes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fresnel coefficients , and @xmath29 are the linear transmission coefficients for the fundamental light . then , from @xmath30 we determine the kerr rotation for the polar and longitudinal configuration and for @xmath19 and @xmath20 polarized incident light . \n the following results are obtained : + for the longitudinal configuration ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) polarized incident light one gets @xmath32 \n @xmath33 for the polar configuration ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) polarized incident light one gets @xmath35 @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 contain explicitly the whole information about the kerr geometry ( directions of light incidence and polarization , crystal magnetization ) and about the linear transmission and reflection ( see  @xcite ) .    summarizing the results , we find that generally @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is in agreement with the experiment by koopmans _ \n et al . _ \n numerical results of our theory using as input parameters the phase ratio of the various different tensor elements from ni and linear complex indices of refraction are presented in fig . \n [ angle ] . \n these results demonstrate clearly that the nonlinear kerr angle depends sensitively on the direction of the magnetization and the incident beam , as well as on the light polarization . depending on the experimental conditions the nonlinear kerr angle might become even as large as 90@xmath40 . \n moreover , also the ellipticity will yield correspondingly large magnetic effects . from these results \n we conclude that the enhanced nonlinear kerr rotation allows for the determination of easy axis and canted - spin configurations due to large magnetic contrast of different interfaces . \n this selective discussion demonstrates the usefulness of nonlinear magneto - optics as a promising spectroscopy . \n our results show that shg is a new sensitive tool for determining magnetic interface properties such as the interplay of structure and magnetism , magnetic anisotropy , and magnetic reorientation . \n in contrast to linear optics , which probes characteristic film - averaged features , the nonlinear kerr effect originates essentially from the surface and interfaces and thus allows the analysis of buried interfaces .    for future studies on the nonlinear magneto -

{"ContextTokens": 3001, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka )  @xcite is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment . in t2k \n , an intense muon neutrino beam is produced with a proton synchrotron in j - parc facility and sent to the massive super - kamiokande detector 295  km away . \n the main goals of t2k are a sensitive search for the @xmath0 appearance from @xmath1 , which is related to the yet - unmeasured neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 , and precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to achieve the aimed precision , good understanding of the neutrino beam properties and neutrino - nucleus interaction \n are indispensable . \n the near detector ( nd280 ) complex is placed at about 280  m from the proton target to provide this information . \n the t2k - nd280  @xcite consists of several sub - detectors with specific and complimentary functions . \n as the basic elements for the particle detection , most of detectors use the plastic scintillator read out via wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers . \n this is a widely used technique , especially in recent accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite . in those experiments , multi - anode pmts ( mapmts ) \n have been used as the photosensor . for t2k , \n mapmt is not suitable because some of the detectors have to operate under a magnetic field of 0.2  t provided by a dipole magnet originally built for ua1 experiment at cern , and also because the available space is very limited . \n we selected the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) as the photosensor for nd280 and started the development in cooperation with hamamatsu photonics and kek detector technology project  @xcite . \n for nd280 , 64,000 mppcs are used in total . \n after three years of study , we developed an mppc that satisfied our requirements and started the mass production in february 2008 . because it was the first time that the mppcs are used on such a large scale , it was necessary to develop a method to characterize each device for quality assurance purpose . in order to characterize a large number of mppcs \n , we have developed a system that simultaneously measures 64 mppcs at kyoto university . using this test system , \n we have measured 17,686 mppcs used for two sub - detectors of nd280 , called ingrid  @xcite and fgd  @xcite .    in this paper , \n the design of the test system , testing procedure and summary of measured performances of t2k - mppc are presented . \n the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is a new photodetector manufactured by hamamatsu photonics , japan  @xcite . \n an mppc consists of many ( 100 to @xmath51000 ) small avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) , each with an area of either 25@xmath625 , 50@xmath650 or 100@xmath6100  @xmath7m@xmath8 , in an area of 19  mm@xmath8 . \n each apd micropixel independently works in limited geiger mode with an applied voltage a few volts above the breakdown voltage ( @xmath9 ) . \n when a photoelectron is produced , it induces a geiger avalanche . \n the avalanche is passively quenched by a resistor untegrated to each pixel . \n the output charge @xmath10 from a single pixel is independent of the number of produced photoelectrons within the pixel , and can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the applied voltage and @xmath13 is the capacitance of the pixel . \n the overvoltage , @xmath14 is the parameter that controls the performance of mppc as we will see later . \n it is known that @xmath15 is dependent on the temperature with a coefficient of @xmath16  mv / k  @xcite . combining the output from all the pixels , the total charge from an mppc \n is quantized to multiples of @xmath10 and proportional to the number of pixels that underwent geiger discharge ( `` _ _ fired _ _ '' ) . \n the number of fired pixels is proportional to the number of injected photons if the number of photons is small compared to the total number of pixels . \n thus , the mppc has an excellent photon counting capability as long as the number of photo - electron does not approach the total number of pixels in the device .    for an mppc , the operating voltage \n @xmath12 is a few volts above the breakdown voltage and well below 100  v. the pixel capacitance @xmath13 is on the order of 10100  ff , giving a gain of 10@xmath1710@xmath18 . \n these features enable us to read out the signal from the mppc with simple electronics . \n in addition , because the thickness of the amplification region is a few @xmath7 m , an mppc is insensitive to the magnetic field and has a fast response . \n the photon detection efficiency ( pde ) of an mppc is expressed as a product of three effects : @xmath19 the geometrical efficiency @xmath20 represents the fraction of active area in a micropixel . \n based on a measurement  @xcite , @xmath20 is about 0.6 for an mppc with 50@xmath650  @xmath7 m pixel size . \n the quantum efficiency of the apd , qe , depends on the wavelength of photon and is typically 0.70.8 for the wavelength of 400500  nm , the range of current interest . \n the probability of inducing a geiger discharge when a photoelectron is generated , @xmath21 , depends on @xmath22 . \n the last factor introduces the @xmath22 dependence of pde . \n the dark noise of mppc at the room temperature is dominated by the geiger discharge induced by thermally generated electron - hole pairs . \n because it is amplified with the identical process , a dark noise pulse can not be distinguished from the signal induced by the external photon irradiation , although the dark noise is mainly at the single photoelectron level in absence of the cross - talk effect described below . \n the dark noise rate of mppc is proportional to the area . for 50  @xmath7 m pixel type mppc , \n the dark noise rate per active area is about 300500  khz / mm@xmath8 at 25  with a gain of 7.5@xmath23 . \n there are two known processes which give an additional charge to the original signal ; the cross - talk between neighboring micropixels and afterpulse . \n the origin of the cross - talk is presumed to be optical photons emitted during avalanche  @xcite which enter neighboring micropixels and trigger another geiger discharge . \n it gives an additional charge output at the same time as the original geiger discharge . \n the afterpulse of mppc is considered to be due to delayed release of carriers trapped at lattice defects , giving a time - correlated but delayed charge output to the original signal  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the mppc performance , \n it is important to measure key parameters such as @xmath15 , pde , dark noise rate , cross - talk and afterpulse probabilities together with their dependence on the temperature and applied voltage .      a picture of the mppc for the t2k - nd280 ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) is shown in fig . \n [ fig : mppc ] and the major specifications is summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] . \n we use the 1.0  mm diameter kuraray y11(200)ms wls fiber for the nd280 detector . \n the sensitive area of the mppc is enlarged from 1@xmath61  mm@xmath8 of those on catalogue ( s10362 - 11 - 050c ) to 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 , so that we can minimize the light loss at the optical contact with a simple coupler . \n the size of apd pixel is 50@xmath650  @xmath7m@xmath8 and the number of apd pixels  . \n the large pde of mppc results in a light yield sufficiently large to safely reject the dark noise , which is mainly at a single photoelectron level . \n in addition , thanks to the pulsed neutrino beam timing , the random dark noise has only little effect for the neutrino event reconstruction . \n .specifications of t2k - mppc(s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n for the t2k near neutrino detectors , we have developed the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) with 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 active area and with 667 50  @xmath7 m pitch pixels ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . in total , \n about 64,500 mppcs were produced for t2k from february 2008 to february 2009 .    at kyoto university , we have successfully developed the system and technique to characterize a large number of mppcs , and tested 17,686 mppcs . \n the performance of mppcs has been confirmed to satisfy our requirements . \n the failure rate is found to be about 0.5% . \n the authors are grateful to the solid state division of hamamatsu photonics for providing us test samples during the development . \n we appreciate useful suggestions from the members of t2k nd280 photosensor group . \n we thank f.  retiere for careful reading and helpful comments on this manuscript . \n this work was supported by mext and jsps with the grant - in - aid for scientific research a 19204026 , young scientists s 20674004 , scientific research on priority areas `` new developments of flavor physics '' , and the global coe program `` the next generation of physics , spun from universality and emergence '' . \n the development of mppc and the test system is also supported by the kek detector technology project . \n y.  kudenko [ t2k collaboration ] , nucl . \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 598 * , 289 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0805.0411 [ physics.ins-det ] ] . \n a.  pla - dalmau , frascati phys . \n * 21 * , 513 ( 2001 ) ; k.  nitta et al . , \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 535 * , 147 ( 2004 ) ; d.  drakoulakos et al . \n , fermilab - proposal-0938 , arxiv : hep - ex/0405002 ; a.  a.  aguilar - arevalo et al . , fermilab - proposal-0954 , arxiv : hep - ex/0601022 ; t.  adam et al . \n instr .  and meth . \n a * 577 * , 523 ( 2007 ) . \n m.  yokoyama et al . \n , arxiv : physics/0605241 ; s.  gomi et al . \n , pos * pd07 * , 015 ( 2007 ) . \n h.  oide , t.  murase , h.  otono and s.  yamashita , nucl .  instrum \n .  meth . \n a * 613 * , 23 ( 2010 ) . \n f.  moreau , j .- c . \n vanel , o.  drapier , m.  gonin , a.  bonnemaison , a.  cauchois , y.  geerebaert , s.  couturier - le quellec , nucl . \n instrum . \n a * 613 * , 46 ( 2010 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1692439947395, "RequestID": "eed16bb5d6d144e6b494d85ef24aa7a7", "TotalTokens": 3172}

{"ContextTokens": 3803, "GeneratedTokens": 157, "SynthesizedBody": "it is known that the neutrino physics plays an unique role in astrophysics and cosmology . in particular , these light weakly interacting particles are special for astrophysical phenomena like a supernova explosion when a large number of neutrinos is produced in a collapsing stellar core ( raffelt 1996 ) . \n the compact core with the typical radius @xmath1 km , the supranuclear density @xmath2 and the high temperature @xmath3 mev , is opaque for neutrinos . while a rather rarified remnant envelope with the typical density @xmath4 and temperature of the order of few mev , becomes partially transparent for the neutrino flux . \n notice that in investigations of neutrino processes in medium not only dense substance , but also a magnetic field should be taken into account . \n we stress that a magnetic field can play the role of additional component of an active medium , and influence substantially on particle properties . \n this influence becomes especially important in the case when the magnetic field strength reaches the critical , schwinger value @xmath5 g.  , @xmath6 is the elementary charge . ] \n according to modern astrophysical models , very strong magnetic fields up to @xmath7 g could be generated , for example , in a rapidly rotating supernova remnant ( duncan and thompson 1992 ; bisnovatyi - kogan 1993 ; mathews et.al . \n 1997 ) . \n previously , in the studies of neutrino interactions with a dense stellar medium the main attention was given to the neutrino \n nucleon processes . \n this is due to the fact that the urca - processes and the neutrino - nucleon scattering defined the major contribution into the energy balance of the collapsing core , and were considered as a main source of neutrino opacity . \n the neutrino - electron processes were less investigated . however , as it was pointed in studies mezzacappa and bruenn ( 1993 ) , taking account of the neutrino - electron scattering in a detail analysis of the supernova dynamics is physically justified indeed . in particular , the neutrino - electron processes can contribute significantly into the asymmetry and provide a competition with the neutrino - nucleon processes . \n for example , in the paper kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) the total set of neutrino - electron processes ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) was investigated in a strong magnetic field limit , when electrons and positrons occupied the lowest landau level . \n it was shown that the neutrino force action on plasma along the magnetic field turns out to be of the same order and , what is essential , of the same sign as the one caused by the @xmath11-processes ( gvozdev and ognev 1999 ) .    by this means , the investigations of the neutrino - electron processes under extreme conditions of a high density and/or temperature of matter and also of a strong magnetic field are the subject of a great interest .    in this study \n we investigate the neutrino \n electron processes in a dense magnetized plasma . \n in contrast to ( kuznetsov and mikheev 2000 ) we consider the physical situation when the magnetic field is not so strong , whereas the density of plasma is large . \n thus the chemical potential of electrons , @xmath12 , is the dominating factor : ^2 > 2eb t^2 , e^2 m_e^2 , [ eq : cond1 ] where @xmath13 is the plasma temperature , @xmath14 is the typical neutrino energy . under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) \n plasma electrons occupy the excited landau levels . at the same time \n it is assumed that the magnetic field strength being relatively weak , ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , is simultaneously strong enough , so that the following condition is satisfied : eb e. [ eq : cond2 ] in the present astrophysical view , the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) could be realized , as an example , in a supernova envelope , where the electron chemical potential is assumed to be @xmath15 mev , plasma temperature @xmath16 mev . \n the magnetic field could be as high as @xmath17 g. under the conditions considered the approximation of ultrarelativistic plasma is a good one , so we will neglect the electron mass wherever this causes no complications .    as it was shown in paper mikheev and narynskaya ( 2000 ) \n , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the total set of neutrino - electron processes reduces to the process of neutrino scattering on plasma electrons . \n moreover , both initial and final electrons occupy the same landau level . \n the neutrino  electron scattering in dense magnetized plasma was investigated by bezchastnov and haensel ( 1996 ) . \n numerical calculations of the differential cross  section of this process in the limit of a weak magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) were performed . \n the purpose of our work is to calculate analytically not only the probability of this process , but also the volume density of the neutrino energy and momentum losses under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1]),([eq : cond2 ] ) . \n we start from the effective local lagrangian of the neutrino  electron interaction in the framework of the standard model : l_eff= [ e _ ( c_v - c_a_5)e ] j^ , [ eq : lag ] where @xmath19 $ ] is the current of massless left neutrinos , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . here \n upper signs correspond to the electron neutrino @xmath22 when both z and w boson exchange takes part in a process . \n the lower signs correspond to @xmath12 and @xmath23 neutrino @xmath24 , when the z boson exchange is only presented in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) .    in order to impart a physical meaning to the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering per unit time , \n it is necessary to integrate not only over the final but also over the initial electron states as well : @xmath25 here @xmath26 corresponds to the maximal possible landau level number , which is defined as the integer part of the ratio @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the total interaction time , @xmath29 is the s -

electron process in the presence of a magnetic field . in the limit of a rare neutrino gas \n when @xmath60 , the result has a more simple form : w _ ( ) i(u ) , [ eq : prob3 ] i(u ) = _ 0 ^ 1 ( u^4 ( 3 z^2 + 2z + 1 ) - 12 u^2 z + z^2 + 2z + 3 ) . for comparison we present here the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering without field in the same limitof the rare neutrino gas : w_vac=. \n [ eq : probvac ]     is the probability in a non - magnetized plasma . ] \n the numerical estimation of the ratio of the probabilities ( [ eq : prob3 ] ) and ( [ eq : probvac ] ) is presented in fig.[fig : graf1 ] . \n it is seen that the probability in a magnetized plasma excesses the vacuum probability in the vicinity of a point @xmath61 only . \n in this section we will calculate the volume density of neutrino energy and momentum losses per unit time in a medium , which could be defined by the following way : ( , ) = dw , [ eq : defloss ] where @xmath62 is the difference between the momenta of the initial and final neutrinos , @xmath63 . \n the zeroth component , @xmath64 , determines the neutrino energy loss in unit volume per unit time . in general , a neutrino propagating through plasma can both lose and capture energy . \n so , we will mean the  loss  of energy in the algebraic sense . \n the vector @xmath65 in eq.([eq : defloss ] ) is associated with the volume density of the neutrino momentum loss in unit time , and therefore it defines the neutrino force acting on plasma . because of the isotropy of plasma without a magnetic field , in the presence of a magnetic field one would expect to obtain the neutrino force action along the magnetic field only . \n however , as it was shown above , the probability of the neutrino - electron scattering ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) is the symmetric functions with respect to the substitution @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) . \n this means that the neutrino scattering on excited electrons does not give a contribution into the neutrino force acting on plasma along the magnetic field . \n thus , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) there is no neutrino force action on plasma at all . \n therefore , this force is caused by a contribution of neutrino interactions with ground landau level electrons only , and the result obtained by kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) has a more general applicability in fact . \n it may be used even in the limit of dense plasma when chemical potential is considerably greater than the magnetic field strength ( @xmath68 ) .    for the neutrino energy loss in unit volume per unit time in the limit of a very dense plasma we obtain the following result : _ b = ^2 t^4 n _ j_b ( ) , [ eq : lossb ] @xmath69\\nonumber   \\\\   & \\qquad &    \\hspace{30 mm }   \\times \\,\\ , \\frac{1 - e^{y(1 - \\tau)}}{1 - e^{-y\\tau } } \\,\\ , e^{-y ( 1+z)/ 2z } ,   \\label{eq : jb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the concentration of initial neutrinos , the parameter @xmath23 has a meaning of a relative neutrino spectral temperature , @xmath71 . \n it is interesting to compare this result with the one in a non - magnetized plasma which can be presented in a similar form : _ \n b=0 = ^2 t^4 n _ j_b=0 ( ) , [ eq : loss0 ] j_b=0 ( ) = 4 ^4 _ 0^ d^2 . \n [ eq : j0 ] the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 define the dependence of the neutrino energy losses on the relative neutrino spectral temperature in a magnetized plasma and in a plasma without field correspondingly . in the limit of a sufficiently large neutrino spectral temperature ( @xmath74 ) they reduce to the power functions : @xmath75     ( solid line ) and @xmath73 ( dashed line ) versus the relative spectral neutrino temperature . ]    the graphs of the functions ( [ eq : jb ] ) and ( [ eq : j0 ] ) are presented in fig.[fig : graf2 ] . \n as one would expect , at neutrino spectral temperature smaller than the plasma one ( @xmath76 ) the values of the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are negative . \n it implies that neutrino propagating via medium captures energy from the plasma . at the @xmath77 \n more then @xmath13 ( @xmath78 ) , neutrino gives up energy to the plasma . at the point \n @xmath79 there is a thermal equilibrium when there is no energy exchange between neutrino and electron - positron plasma . \n it can be seen that the neutrino energy loss in a magnetized plasma is less than the one in non - magnetized plasma . by this means , under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the magnetized plasma becomes more transparent for neutrinos than plasma without field . \n in this paper we have investigated the neutrino - electron scattering in a dense magnetized plasma . \n we have considered the physical situation when the plasma component is the dominating one of the two components of the active medium . at the same time , a magnetic field was assumed to be not too small ( @xmath80 ) . the probability and the volume density of the neutrino energy - momentum losses have been calculated . \n it is found , that the neutrino scattering on excited electrons does not give a contribution into the neutrino force acting on plasma . \n this force is caused by the neutrino - electron processes when plasma electrons occupy the lowest landau level only . \n thus the result for this force , obtained in paper kuznetsov and mikheev ( 2000 ) , has a more wide area of application . \n it may be used under a condition @xmath81 as well . \n it is shown that under the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) the combine effect of plasma and strong magnetic field leads to a decrease of the neutrino energy loss in comparison to the one in a pure plasma . \n therefore , the complex medium , plasma + strong magnetic field , is more transparent for neutrinos than non - magnetized plasma . \n one would believe that the result obtained will be useful for the detail analysis of astrophysical cataclysms like supernova explosions . \n this work was supported in part by the russian foundation for basic research under the grant no . \n 01 -

{"ContextTokens": 3228, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "the intention of this talk is to summarize the application of linearized gravity , in the specific form of the theory of black hole perturbations , to the study of the collision of black holes . \n most of the results are already present in the literature , and the rest of the work is still in progress so i present here only a brief survey . \n the motivation for studying black hole collisions is quite clear . in the next few decades \n gravitational wave detectors will come online that will require `` templates '' of possible waveforms from different sources . \n the collision of black holes is one of the main candidates for observable sources of gravitational radiation . \n although the initial and advanced ligo detectors will not quite have the frequency range to detect the waves produced in the final moments of the most common collisions , it is expected that future detectors will , and knowing the waveform for the final moments can also lead to insights into the waveforms emitted earlier on . \n the presence of this strong motivation from the experimental side has led to the formation of an alliance of numerical relativity groups ( the `` binary black hole grand challenge collaboration '' ) with the goal of numerically simulating the collision of two black holes using supercomputers . \n the degree of difficulty of this project is reflected in the fact that several established numerical relativity groups have decided to team efforts in order to tackle it .    here \n we will like to offer a much more modest approach , which is based on a simple idea : when a collision of two black holes starts with the holes so close to each other that they are surrounded by a common horizon , the problem looks from the point of view of an external observer as a single distorted black hole . \n it can therefore be treated with perturbation theory . \n although one expects this approach to only yield results in a small range of initial separation , it provides at least for that range a benchmark against which one can calibrate numerical codes of the fully numerical approach . in reference \n @xcite an explicit calculation was carried out using this idea . \n we took the initial data for the head - on collision of two black holes given by the misner @xcite solution and re - wrote it in such a way that in the case that the two black holes are close to each other it explicitly looks like  schwarzschild plus something small \" . \n we took the  something small \" and evolved it using the equations of linearized gravity ( the zerilli equation ) and computed the radiated energy . \n the results are shown in figure 1 , where we plot the energy radiated in the collision as a function of the initial separation and compare with the results of the ncsa group @xcite using a numerical integration of the full einstein equations . \n we see that the close approximation works very well until the holes are no longer surrounded by a common apparent horizon ( @xmath0 ) and works within the correct order of magnitude up to when the holes are no longer surrounded by an event horizon ( @xmath1 ) . \n also shown is a `` far approximation '' based on a particle - membrane paradigm @xcite . \n comparisons of waveforms have also been performed @xcite and they also show very good agreement between the linearized theory and the full numerical simulations . \n all this shows that the use of linearized gravity in the close limit can be a valuable aid to full numerical evolutions of the two black hole problem . \n it is therefore quite tempting to apply the linearized treatment to more interesting situations , specifically the in - spiraling collision of two black holes with angular momentum . \n there are two main obstacles to doing this computation and we will detail them in the next two sections . \n assuming initial data for a black hole collision is given , we can rather easily evolve and compute energies in linearized theory . \n why therefore not do it for the in - spiraling collision ? \n the main reason is that for that case there are no numerical results with which to compare and the linearized formalism does not have a measure of error in it : it therefore has little predictive power . \n there is no consistent way to say when the close approximation breaks down . \n in fact , this example teaches us a valuable lesson about perturbation theory : when is linearized perturbation valid ? \n the obvious answer `` when perturbations are small '' is clearly naive . to begin with , `` \n small '' should be characterized in a coordinate invariant way . moreover , as this example shows , perturbations can be `` large '' and perturbation theory can still be valid : it just needs to happen that the perturbations be large in regions of spacetime that do not contribute in a significant way to the physics of interest . in the two black hole example , such a region is the interior of the horizon and regions close to it , in which perturbations mostly fall into the black hole .    how is one to characterize when to trust the approximation ? the answer is simple : work out the second order perturbations , compute the physical quantities of interest and use how much the first and second order calculation differ as a measure of the accuracy of the first order results . \n the advantage of this answer is that it is phrased in terms of what one is exactly interested in : the physical quantities . in the case of the collision of two black holes \n these are the radiated waveforms and energies . \n the formalism for second order perturbations of black holes has not been worked out in the past . \n it can be studied in detail as we do in reference @xcite . here \n i just sketch some of the outstanding points . \n it turns out that all the information can be coded into a single variable , exactly as in the first order perturbation case and that that variable satisfies a `` zerilli equation '' , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the zerilli function @xmath4 is a coordinate invariant combination of the perturbed metric coefficients . \n this equation is exactly the same as the one satisfied by the first order perturbations ( including the `` potential '' v(r ) , which can be seen in reference @xcite ) . \n however , there is an important difference : the right - hand side is not zero but a `` source '' term s , which is listed explicitly in reference @xcite and which is a complicated function quadratic in the first order perturbations and their derivatives . \n the way in which we derived this equation is to compute a particular combination of the einstein equations , writing the perturbed metric in a particular coordinate system , the so called `` regge - wheeler '' gauge . \n this , in turn is a way of deriving the original zerilli equation . \n the expression we get for @xmath4 is therefore a representation in that gauge of a gauge invariant quantity . \n the explicitly gauge invariant form of @xmath4 can also be computed . \n we therefore are in a position to evolve to second order the problem of black hole collisions and therefore to endow the first order predictions with `` error bars '' \n . this will be crucial for the inspiralling case , where numerical results are not expected for some time . \n in the head - on collision case we were lucky to have an exact solution to the initial value problem that we could evolve . \n for the more realistic cases there are no exact solutions available at present and it is unlikely that they will be easily found in the future . there is an immediate alternative at hand . there exist already well tested numerical codes @xcite for solving the initial value problem in general relativity in the context of black hole collisions . \n one could simply take these initial data evaluated for the case in which the black holes are close and `` read off '' from them the departures from schwarzschild to be evolved using the linearized theory . \n this is certainly possible and has already been illustrated for brill - lindquist - type initial data by abrahams and price @xcite . \n apart from the possibility of using numerical initial data for realistic collisions it is interesting to notice that one can , up to a certain extent , solve the initial value problem analytically if one is only interested in initial data for the close approximation . \n the idea is simple : in the close approximation the initial data for a black hole collision departs a small amount from the initial data for a schwarzschild spacetime for a single black hole with mass equal to the sum of the masses of the colliding holes . therefore one can develop an approximation technique for the initial data starting from the initial data of schwarzschild and adding small corrections proportional to the separation of the holes . \n we illustrate here only the zeroth order results , details will be given in a forthcoming paper in collaboration with john baker . \n the initial value problem of general relativity can be conveniently cast in the conformal formalism @xcite . \n one is interested in solving the momentum and hamiltonian constraints @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spatial metric , @xmath7 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath8 is the scalar curvature of the three metric . \n one proposes a three metric that is conformally flat @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the conformal factor and a decomposition of the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 . \n the constraints become , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a derivative with respect to the flat spacetime . since the momentum constraint is linear \n , one can propose as a solution for it for the case of two black holes the sum of the solutions for the case of individual holes with momentum @xmath14 , @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a unit normal in the direction of @xmath17 and all vector fields are defined in the flat background spacetime . \n one now can put this solution in the hamiltonian constraint and one is left with an elliptic , highly non - linear equation for @xmath18 . \n this is the equation that is usually solved numerically . \n there exist situations , however , where one can make some progress analytically . \n consider the case in which the momenta of the holes is small @xcite . in that case \n one can neglect the right - hand side of the hamiltonian constraint and one only needs to solve a vacuum laplace equation for @xmath18 . \n the solution can therefore be very simply found , the difficulty depending on the boundary conditions one chooses for the problem ( typically a `` symmetrized '' boundary condition is imposed , which complicates calculation quite a bit in certain cases , see @xcite for details ) . \n another situation in which one can obtain an approximate solution is in the `` close approximation '' . in that case one \n has two black holes of momenta equal and opposite @xmath19 , and since the black holes are close , the unit normals appearing in the form for the extrinsic curvature for each hole are approximately equal . \n that implies that the extrinsic curvature for the problem is approximately zero ( as it should , since in the close limit the problem looks like a schwarzschild black hole at rest . ) \n therefore one can again neglect the right - hand side of the hamiltonian constraint and one is again left with a laplace equation . \n let us compare this approximation with the full numerical results . \n in order to do this we will compare the adm energy of initial data for a collision of two holes of momentum @xmath20 . \n the adm energy in the conformal formalism is given by    @xmath21    and we notice that it does not depend explicitly on the extrinsic curvature ( it does implicitly via the constraints ) . \n therefore at the approximation we are working , in which the constraints do not couple the conformal factor and the extrinsic curvature , the energy is independent of the extrinsic curvature and therefore independent of the momenta of the holes . \n we compare this prediction with the full numerical results of cook in figure [ cook ] . \n an interesting aspect is that one can advance this approximation one step further . \n one can input the extrinsic curvature and the conformal factor found as a fixed `` source '' in the equation determining the conformal factor and one can obtain a correction through the integration of a poisson equation . \n comparison of this approximation with the numerical data is currently in progress . \n details are complicated by the particular boundary conditions that are usually chosen in the numerical computations . \n it is evident that the `` close approximation '' can work in many other cases , apart from the head -

shell @xmath24 production . assuming that electron and positron beam polarizations of 80 and 60% respectively are achieved at a 500 gev linear collider , and that the cross section can be measured with 1% precision \n , we find that , for example , the case @xmath17 can be distinguished from @xmath25 for values of @xmath26 up to 4.6 tev . \n ( if the uncertainty is purely statistical , 1% error on the cross section measurement corresponds to integrated luminosity of about 270 fb@xmath27 . ) \n note , however , that the photon energy distributions for the cases of gravitino emission and @xmath18 add model are extremely close . \n it is not likely that the ambiguity between these two cases can be resolved by this measurement . \n we have also studied whether performing a more restrictive angular cut could help in distinguishing between the cases of gravitino and @xmath18 graviton emission . from fig . \n [ p311diffcs2 ] it appears that the two signals have discernible differences at small values of @xmath15 . \n we have found , however , that with the assumed 1% precision on the cross section measurement , this analysis will not be able to conclusively separate these two cases . \n another way to distinguish between models is by varying the collider center of mass energy @xmath28 . \n the tesla study  @xcite has shown that measuring cross sections at two design center of mass energies , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , allows to determine the number of extra dimensions in the add models for a wide range of parameters . \n for example , if there are two extra dimensions , the @xmath25 case can be excluded at 99% cl for values of @xmath26 up to 6.1 tev . \n the beam polarizations assumed in  @xcite coincide with the values chosen for our analyses here . \n while upgrading the linear collider energy from 500 gev to 800 gev , for example , will take much time , effort and money , the beam energy can be changed by as much as 5% without significantly disrupting the operation of the collider . therefore , it is interesting to study if different models can be distinguished by performing measurements at two center of mass energies separated by 5% . \n we have performed such a study using pandora . \n we have chosen the scales of each model so that their cross sections ( with the same cuts and polarizations as before ) are identical at @xmath31 gev , and evaluated their differences at @xmath32 gev . taking the standard model background into account and assuming that the cross sections at each energy can be measured with 1% precision , we find that the @xmath17 and @xmath25 cases can be distinguished at the 3@xmath33 level for @xmath34 tev . \n the sensitivity of this method is thus somewhat lower than for studying photon energy distributions . \n surprisingly , the scaling of the gravitino pair production cross section with @xmath28 is again identical to the @xmath18 add model . \n changing collider energy does not help in separating these two cases . \n we conclude that while the add models with @xmath35 can be distinguished from the supersymmetric models with light gravitino by carefully studying the photon + missing energy signal alone , this can not be done for the case of 6 extra dimensions . \n ( let us note in passing that the missing energy signal in the @xmath18 add model is also identical to the one due to the emission of scalar states associated with the brane coordinates  @xcite . ) in this case , distinctions between the models will only occur with additional phenomena . \n the next - best observables in the extra - dimensional graviton model include the dimension - eight contact interactions  @xcite induced by e^+e^-g^(n ) , f|f , etc . , or from string regge states  @xcite . \n the superlight gravitino models are supersymmetric models , and the superpartner spectrum must satisfy the same naturnalness criteria as other supersymmetry ideas . \n the expectation is that some superpartner states , most notably charginos and neutralinos , should be accessible and well - studied at a 500 gev linear collider  @xcite . \n the kinematic reach for superpartners then approaches @xmath36 in @xmath37 collisions . \n an increase of the reach of selectrons is possible in @xmath38 collisions , since selectron masses approaching @xmath39 are kinematically accessible  @xcite . \n the full complement of observables will be needed to distinguish the precise underlying theory being discovered at the colliders . \n we would like to thank the organizers of the snowmass 2001 workshop where this work was initiated . \n we are grateful to many of the workshop s participants and especially to the members of the p3 and e3 working groups for interesting discussions . \n we are indebted to michael peskin for his invaluable help with the pandora event generator . \n n.  arkani -

{"ContextTokens": 3932, "GeneratedTokens": 264, "SynthesizedBody": "a one - dimensional lattice model of hydrophobic attraction has recently been studied  @xcite . \n the model incorporates what is believed to be the basic mechanism of the hydrophobic effect ; viz . \n , that the accommodation of the solute in the solvent is energetically favorable but sufficiently unfavorable entropically as to result in an increase in free energy . \n this increase is smaller when the hydrophobes are close together than when they are widely separated , resulting in a net solvent - mediated attraction between them . \n the unfavorable entropy of accommodating the solute is achieved in the model by allowing each solvent molecule to have a large number @xmath2 of possible orientations but requiring two neighboring solvent molecules to be both in a special one of those @xmath2 states if they are to accommodate a hydrophobic solute in the interstitial site between them . \n that circumstance in which two neighboring solvent molecules are both in that special orientation is taken to be energetically favorable by an amount previously called  @xcite @xmath3 . \n the condition of hydrophobicity at temperature @xmath4 was that @xmath5 , with @xmath6 boltzmann s constant . to model the hydrophobic effect realistically , \n @xmath7 was taken to be @xmath8k and @xmath2 was taken to be 110,000 . \n it was then a property of the model that forcing the solvent to accommodate a hydrophobic solute greatly restricted ( to one state out of @xmath2 ) the possible orientations of the solvent molecules neighboring the accommodated solute . \n such restriction of solvent orientation by the solute is consistent with experimental measurements of nmr relaxation times , which show that the reorientation times of water molecules that neighbor a solute with alkyl groups are about twice as long as in pure water , and that there is an increased activation energy for the reorientation in the presence of the solute over that in pure water.@xcite    it was a striking feature of the one - dimensional model that the range and strength of the solvent - mediated attraction between solutes were inversely related to each other ; at low temperatures the attraction was weak but long - ranged and at high temperatures it was strong but short - ranged . \n one of the motivations of the present work was to see if that inverse relation , which is of potential importance in the interpretation of experiment , persists in higher dimensions , and it is indeed found to be so .    it was also found earlier in the one - dimensional model that the solubility of the hydrophobe decreases with increasing temperature , which is consistent with the increasing hydrophobicity that manifests itself in the increasing strength of the hydrophobic attraction . \n this temperature dependence of the solubility , too , is found here to persist in the two- and three - dimensional models . \n it is also found , as in the one - dimensional model , that if the energy of interaction of the hydrophobic solute with its solvent neighbors ( earlier called @xmath9 ) is greater than the magnitude @xmath10 of the favorable energy of solvent alignment , then the solubility , after first decreasing with increasing temperature , reaches a minimum and then increases . \n the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model are defined in the following section . \n also in section [ sec : models ] are the basic formulas that relate the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force and the solubility to the quantities that are measured in the simulations . \n the details of the simulations are in section [ sec : simulation ] , where the results are also displayed . \n these are discussed and summarized in the concluding section [ sec : summary ] . \n the two - dimensional model is pictured in fig . \n 1 . at each site of a square lattice \n there is a solvent molecule that may be in any of a large number , @xmath2 , of different states ( orientations ) . \n solute molecules may only be accommodated at the interstitial sites between neighboring pairs of solvent molecules , but only if that site is not already occupied and then only if the two solvent molecules in question are both in a special one of the @xmath2 states , called state 1 in what follows . \n the figure shows three solute molecules so accommodated . \n the three - dimensional model is defined similarly , and also on a lattice of coordination number 4 , as in two dimensions . \n this three - dimensional lattice is pictured in fig . \n it is obtained by systematically removing two bonds from each vertex of a simple cubic lattice , in such a way that from each site @xmath11 there remains a bond to the neighboring sites at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as well as to those at @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 is even but to those at @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead if @xmath16 is odd . \n the lattice is topologically ( not metrically ) equivalent to the tetrahedral diamond lattice , which is also the lattice of oxygen atoms in the metastable phase of ice called ice i@xmath19 .    in \n both the two- and three - dimensional versions of the model only neighboring solvent molecules interact with each other , which they do with energy @xmath20 if both are in the special state 1 and with energy @xmath21 otherwise . \n the only solvent molecules with which a solute molecule interacts are its immediate neighbors ; the sum of its energies of interaction with them is @xmath9 .    solute molecules may interact with each other but that is irrelevant here ; the solute - solute interaction does not enter the expression for the _ solvent - mediated part _ of the potential of mean force between pairs of solutes in the infinitely dilute solution  @xcite , nor is it relevant for the solubility of the solute , which is so slight that solute - solute interactions are negligible . \n the solute - solvent interaction parameter @xmath9 is also absent from the expression for the potential of mean force in the infinitely dilute solution but it is a significant parameter in the solubility.@xcite    because the coordination number of the lattices considered here is 4 , rather than 2 as in one dimension , the values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 required to model the hydrophobic effect conveniently but still realistically over the temperature range 275 - 375k are both much smaller than in one dimension . here , in both the two- and three - dimensional models , \n they are taken to be @xmath22k instead of 3000k and @xmath23 instead of 110,000 . \n it is still the case , as in the one - dimensional model , that @xmath5 over the relevant temperature range , and that the extent to which @xmath24 exceeds @xmath3 increases with increasing temperature  which are the respective conditions required for the hydrophobic effect to manifest itself and to do so with increasing strength as the temperature increases . \n let @xmath25 be the probability that in the pure solvent both molecules of a given neighboring pair will be found in the special state 1 ; and let @xmath26 be the probability that the molecules at two such pairs of sites will all be found to be in the special state 1 when the corresponding two interstitial sites , one associated with each pair , are separated by the metrical distance @xmath27 ( measured in units of the lattice spacing ) . in the two - dimensional lattice of fig . \n 1 the values of @xmath27 that occur are @xmath28 ;

2 ) each solvent molecule that is in a different state enters its special state with a rate of @xmath38 per time unit , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites that are occupied with a solvent molecule in its special state . \n an efficient implementation of these dynamics is obtained with a bkl - scheme , after bortz , kalos and lebowitz  @xcite . \n the simulations are performed on a @xmath41 lattice for the two - dimensional model , and a @xmath42 lattice for the three - dimensional model , both with periodic boundary conditions in order to reduce finite - size effects . in the initial configuration , \n no molecule is in its special state . \n this configuration is then thermalized for 0.1 time units . \n after thermalization , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are measured every @xmath43 time unit , up to a total time of @xmath44 time units , and averaged . in a simulation of this length and for these system sizes , \n the two - dimensional and three - dimensional model undergo roughly @xmath45 and @xmath46 local changes , respectively . \n this procedure is repeated 10 times for each of the temperatures @xmath4=275 , 300 , 325 , 350 , and 375k , and for the three - dimensional model also at a temperature of 250k at which the system is probably metastable , the stable regime being one where almost all atoms are in their special state . \n the values for the quantity @xmath25 are presented in table [ tab : p11 ] , for the two- and three - dimensional models . \n this quantity is decreasing with increasing temperature . \n the quantity @xmath25 is one of the two factors determining the solubility as defined in equation ( [ eq : solubility ] ) , the other being @xmath47 . \n while this latter factor is monotonically increasing with increasing temperature for @xmath48 , our data show that @xmath25 is monotonically decreasing with increasing temperature . \n for some choices of @xmath9 , the combination of these two factors leads to a solubility that is initially decreasing with increasing temperature ( a signature of the hydrophobic effect ) , but later increasing . \n the solvent - mediated part of the potential of mean force @xmath30 is plotted as a function of the distance @xmath27 in fig . 3 for the two - dimensional model , and in fig . 4 for the three - dimensional model \n . in the latter figure , \n the curve obtained at a temperature of 250k is dashed , to indicate its likely metastability . in agreement with the one - dimensional model , the strength of the hydrophobic interaction increases with increasing temperature , while its range decreases at the same time : an inverse relation is observed between the strength and range of the hydrophobic interaction , althoug less prominently in three dimensions than in one or two . unlike the one - dimensional model , the two- and three - dimensional models show oscillations in the mean force , reflecting the greater geometrical complexity of the lattice in higher dimensions . in that sense , the curves resemble more closely what is seen in models in which the solvent is modeled more realistically @xcite . \n in addition to the strong attraction at short distances , there is now also a local minimum in the potential of depth about @xmath0 at a distance of three lattice spacings in two dimensions and one of depth about @xmath1 at a distance of two lattice spacings in three dimensions . \n .the function @xmath25 as a function of temperature @xmath4 , for the two - dimensional ( second column ) and three - dimensional model ( third column ) . \n the numbers between brackets are the statistical uncertainties in the last reported digit , obtained from the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of independent simulations .

sn image . \n we adopted 2mass ( with positional uncertainty @xmath2 ) as the basis for the grid for both the ground - based and _ hst _ images . \n once the sn site was located , photometry of the appropriate wfpc2 chip was performed using the routine hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , b ) with a 3@xmath3 detection threshold . \n we had possibly identified the progenitors of the sne ii 1999br , 1999ev , and 2001du as supergiant stars with @xmath4 mag , and the progenitors of the sne ib 2001b and 2001is as very luminous supergiants with @xmath5 to @xmath6 mag , as well as the progenitor of the sn ic 1999bu as a supergiant with @xmath7 mag . for all other sne in our sample \n we could only place limits on the progenitor absolute magnitude and color . \n six of the sne ( 1999an , 1999br , 1999ev , 2000ds , 2000ew , 2001b ) had been imaged in multiple bands with acs at late times by smartt and collaborators . \n these data became available in the _ hst _ archive . \n we had already recovered sn 2000ew , and , along with sne 1999an and 2000ds , we did not detect a sn progenitor in each pre - sn image . \n we also found we had not correctly identified the progenitor for sn 2001b ( the progenitor , in fact , is not detected in the pre - sn image ) . in figures 1 and 2 \n we show that the limits which we are able to place on the progenitors of the sn ic 2000ew and the sn ib 2001b are not very restrictive . \n possibly the sn ib / c progenitors instead are massive interacting he star binaries ( e.g. , avila - reese 1993 ) , and the theoretical single - star evolutionary tracks shown are not relevant . \n for sn 2001du we isolated three possible candidate progenitor stars within the uncertainty of the measured sn position : one reddish star with a detection in both the f555w and f814w bands , and two stars with only f555w detections , implying bluer colors for these latter two stars ( van dyk et al . \n late - time multi - band wfpc2 sn images were obtained by smartt and collaborators . \n we had assumed that , since sn 2001du is of type ii - p , the most plausible candidate is the redder star . \n we used the late - time sn images , specifically the @xmath8 image , and found the sn position on the pre - sn images to be 0.70@xmath90.15 wf pixel ( @xmath10 ) northeast of one of the _ blue _ stars ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003b ) . \n thus , we concluded that the progenitor is not detected in the pre - sn images . \n we used the f555w and f814w pre - sn image detection limits to constrain the nature of the progenitor : adopting @xmath11 mag and distance modulus @xmath12 mag for sn 2001du , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mag for the progenitor star . \n these limits were converted to the likely supergiant progenitor luminosity , assuming the full range of possible stellar surface temperatures ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) . \n stars with luminosities brighter than these limits should have been detected in the pre - sn images . \n we compared the limits to model stellar evolutionary tracks for a metallicity appropriate for the sn environment and for a range of masses , and estimated that the sn progenitor mass is @xmath15 , which is consistent with the mass limits on other previous sne ii - p . \n see smartt et al . \n ( 2003 ) for a similar result for sn 2001du . also see the estimate for the sn 2004dj progenitor by maiz - apellaniz et al . \n using a precise sn position from ground - based images , we isolated the sn position on pre - sn archival wfpc2 images to @xmath16 ( @xmath96 wf pixels ) . \n two stars , a and b , were detected near or within the error circle . \n color information for both progenitor candidates were obtained from a high - quality , ground - based @xmath17-band image , on which two faint objects are seen near the positions of both a and b. both stars are red supergiants , and from model evolutionary tracks for above - solar metallicity , assuming @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag for sn 2003gd , star b had initial mass @xmath20 ( formally below the theoretical lower limit for core - collapse sne ) , and star a had @xmath219 @xmath1 . \n although star a is farther from the sn position we measured than is star b , and just outside the edge of the error circle , star a was considered the most plausible progenitor candidate , based on its initial mass and the fact that it was the brightest @xmath17-band object within the sn s larger , @xmath221 radius , environment ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003c ) . \n this identification was confirmed via late - time _ hst _ imaging of the sn by smartt et al . \n ( 2004 ) , who arrive at the same conclusion for the progenitor s initial mass . \n ( see the contributions by hendry and maund to these proceedings . ) \n nomoto et al .  ( 2004 ) argued that the faint sne ii - p 1997d and 1999br ( e.g. , zampieri et al . \n 2003 ) are highly massive ( @xmath2330 @xmath1 ) , `` failed '' sne ( presumably a massive envelope smothers the core - collapse energy release ) . to the contrary , \n when the luminosity of the possible progenitor of sn 1999br progenitor seen in _ \n hst _ images ( van dyk et al . \n 2003a ) is placed in context with stellar evolution models ( figure 3 ) , and the progenitor is assumed to be a red supergiant , the upper mass limit is @xmath241215 @xmath1 . \n ( a similar result is found even if the candidate star we identified was _ not _ the progenitor , and we can only place an upper limit on the progenitor luminosity . ) \n as mentioned above , a growing number of sne have been shown to likely not be sne at all , but are more likely analogs of @xmath25 car . \n these so - called `` sn impostors '' include sne 1961v and 1997bs , but also sn 2002 kg , among others . \n we ( van dyk et al .  1999 ; see our figure 7a ) discovered the sn 1997bs progenitor in archival f606w images of ngc 3627 from 1994 dec , at @xmath26 mag . for the distance modulus to the host and a revised estimate of extinction , we ( van dyk et al . \n 2000 ) found an absolute magnitude @xmath27 , which is consistent with it having been an extremely luminous supergiant star . \n unfortunately , no color information exists for this star . \n we can constrain its initial mass by comparing this luminosity and a range of possible supergiant surface temperatures ( drilling & landolt 2000 ) to stellar evolutionary tracks ; see figure 4 . \n the minimum mass allowed by the luminosity , for @xmath28 k , is @xmath29 . \n if the precursor was a blue supergiant , however , the mass can range up to 120 @xmath30 or more . \n the precursor of sn 2002 kg has been identified in high quality , multi - band ground - based , pre - outburst images of the host galaxy . \n the star had been previously identified by tammann & sandage ( 1968 ) as the `` irregular blue variable '' v37 , which had an erratic @xmath31 light curve over several decades . \n the star had @xmath32 mag and unreddened colors consistent with a very luminous ob supergiant ( the spectra at outburst resemble those of known b - type lbvs ) . placing the star on a h - r diagram \n we conclude that @xmath33 for the star ( unfortunately , the photometric uncertainties do not allow this mass to be more tightly constrained ) . \n this is the first time that an @xmath25 car analog has had its initial mass accurately estimated . \n we are continuing our search for core - collapse sn progenitors in high - quality ( mainly , _ hst _ ) images . the possible detections and constraints on the sn ii progenitors are broadly consistent with red supergiants as progenitor stars , with their colors implying spectral types typically m or somewhat earlier . \n in fact , sne ii - p progenitors appear to have @xmath34 . \n the sn ii - p 2003gd progenitor is only the sixth ever directly identified , with @xmath35@xmath36 . \n the data so far for the progenitors of sne ib / c are inadequate ; we are unable to place rigorous constraints on either the wolf - rayet star or massive interacting binary models for the progenitors of these sne ib / c , the most extreme examples of which have been associated with some grbs ( see matheson , these proceedings ) \n . direct identification of the progenitors of sne ib / c is of the utmost importance , given this connection . \n the sne iin are a very heterogeneous group , a topic that deserves considerably more discussion elsewhere . \n some sne iin are `` sn impostors , '' which are more likely superoutbursts of very massive evolved stars , similar to @xmath25 car . \n this is borne out by the identification of the sn 2002 kg progenitor , or precursor , with @xmath33 . \n if sn 2002 kg is instead a real sn ( which we doubt ) , then its progenitor is only the seventh , out of 1000 s , to be directly identified . \n aldering , g. , humphreys , r. m. , & richmond , m. w. 1994 , , 107 , 662 avila - reese , v. 1993 , rmxaa , 26 , 99 cohen , j. g. , darling , j. , & porter , a. 1995 , , 110 , 308 dolphin , a. e. 2000a , , 112 , 1383 dolphin , a. e. 2000b , , 112 , 1397 drilling , j.s . , & landolt , a.u . \n 2000 , in allen s astrophysical quantities , 4th ed . , ed . \n cox ( new york : aip ) , 381 gilmozzi , r. , et al . \n 1987 , nature , 328 , 318 lejeune , t. , & schaerer , d. 2001 , , 366 , 538 maiz - apellaniz , j. , et al . \n 2004 , , 615 , l113 nomoto , k. , et al . \n 2004 , in stellar - mass , intermediate - mass , and supermassive black holes , eds . \n k.  makashima & s.  mineshige , in press . \n ryder , s. , et al . \n 1993 , , 416 , 167 smartt , s. j. , et al . \n 2003 , , 343 , 735 smartt , s. j. , et al . \n 2004 , , 303 , 499 sonneborn , g. , altner , b. , & kirshner , r. p. 1987 \n , , 323 , l35 tammann , g.a . , & sandage a. 1968 , , 151 , 825 van dyk , s.d . , et al .  1999 , , 118 \n , 2331 van dyk , s.d . , et al . \n 2000 , , 112 , 1532 van dyk , s.d . , \n filippenko , a.v . \n , & li , w.  2002 , , 114 , 700 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003a , , 115 , 1 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003b , , 115 , 448 van dyk , s. d. , li , w. , & filippenko , a. v. 2003c , , 115 , 1289 zampieri , l. , et al .  2003 , , 338 , 711 zwicky , f. 1964 , , 139 , 514 zwicky , f. 1965 , in stars and stellar systems , vol . 8 , stellar structure , ed . l.h . \n aller & d.b . \n mclaughlin ( chicago : university of chicago press ) , 367", "StartTimeOffset": 1771437848263, "RequestID": "6ff8516a33d843cb8e9f2e4267194aa9", "TotalTokens": 4128}
{"ContextTokens": 2811, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "the configuration - interaction shell model is a useful framework for a detailed understanding of low - energy nuclear structure @xcite . \n the many - body basis is a large dimension ( @xmath0 ) set of slater determinants , which are antisymmeterized products of single - particle states . \n one must truncate the single - particle states , corresponding to one or a few shells ( typically using the harmonic oscillator as an approximation to the mean - field ) ; the many - body basis may be further truncated . for phenomenological calculations \n one writes the hamiltonian in terms of single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements , while for _ ab initio _ calculations one may extend this to three - body interactions @xcite . \n the two - body matrix elements are the matrix elements of the residual interaction in the lab frame , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the normalized , antisymmeterized product of particles in orbits labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 and coupled to good angular momentum @xmath5 and isospin @xmath6 . \n if one starts from a translationally invariant interaction between particles , one can either compute the integral in the lab frame or start in the relative frame and then transform to the lab frame ; in either case there are correlations between the matrix elements , although they are not obvious to the casual observer \n .    often for semi - phenomenological calculations , one starts from a `` realistic '' interaction , and then adjusts the two - body matrix elements until the rms error on a set of experimentally known energy levels is minimized @xcite . in the @xmath7-@xmath8 shell , such a semi - phenomenological interaction has been recently derived @xcite , improving on an earlier interaction@xcite . \n it has been found that the fits are empirically dominated by a few linear combinations of matrix elements . \n the physical meaning of those dominant combinations is not immediately obvious . \n one might naively guess the linear correlations are due to an underlying translationally invariant interaction ( although a density dependence would destroy this ) . \n somewhat more phenomenologically , it has been argued by appealing to mean - field properties that one can improve fits primarily through adjusting the monopole - monopole part of the interaction , that is , interaction terms that look like @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of particles in the @xmath11th orbit . \n this protocol for shifting monopole strengths has been successfully applied to several semi - empirical interactions @xcite    a related study @xcite , investigating the origin of many - body forces from truncation of the model space , also found an empirical fit dominated by a few linear combinations of matrix elements . \n while much of the fit was dominated by the monopole interactions , even better agreement was brought about using a contact interaction motivated by its usage in mean - field calculations @xcite and effective field theory@xcite .    in investigating the character and origin of the dominant matrix elements , \n it is useful to ask if there is anything special about the nuclear interaction . \n one way to ask this question is to compare with interactions drawn from the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) , which despite their arbitrary nature are known to echo some features of real nuclear spectra @xcite . in this paper \n we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the low - lying spectra of random interactions and compare against a standard empirical interaction , usdb . \n we find that for more measures all the interactions are nearly indistinguishable , at least on a statistical level . \n our methodology follows previous work @xcite ; we work in the @xmath7-@xmath8 valence space with an inert @xmath12o core . \n given an input set of two - body matrix elements ( we leave aside single - particle energies and any @xmath13-dependent scaling ) , which we write as a vector @xmath14 , we can calculate the eigenvalues @xmath15 of the many - body hamiltonian . for this work the label @xmath16 ranged over all nuclides with @xmath17 and took the ground state binding energy and the first five excitation energies . \n if one has a target spectrum @xmath18 , say from experiment , then the goal of the fit is to minimize @xmath19 ( for simplicity we leave off the experimental uncertainty in each state ) . \n expanding to first order @xmath20 then minimizing ( [ chi2 ] ) yields @xmath21 this equation is in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 the derivatives come via the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hamitonian operator whose strength is @xmath26 . \n we then find the eigenvalues of @xmath27 ( which is equivalent to finding the squares of the eigenvalues in the singular - value decomposition of @xmath28 ) . \n we do this for both the usdb interaction and for an ensemble of 100 sets of random two - body interactions , also called the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) . \n the results are shown for the tbre in fig .  1 , where we have separated out the sensitivity just for the binding energies ( ground state energies ) and the excitation energies . \n although not shown , the equivalent svd eigenvalues for usdb are completely within the tbre results . \n the lower curve is for ground states only , while the upper curve is for excitations energies relative to the ground state . clearly , and perhaps unsurprisingly , the ground state energies are predominantly sensitive to just a few linear combinations of matrix elements  significantly fewer than excitations energies .    fig . \n 1 characterizes _ eigenvalues _ of @xmath27 . the next step is to characterize the _ eigenvectors _ \n associated with the dominant eigenvalues , specifically by comparing with monopole and contact interactions . \n to do so we first discuss a method for quantifying the overlap between two vector subspaces @xcite . \n consider two vectors subspaces , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . \n let @xmath31 be a matrix whose column vectors are the ( orthonormal ) basis vectors of @xmath29 , and similarly with @xmath32 . from these one constructs the overlap matrix @xmath33 . \n note that if the subspaces are not of equal dimension then @xmath34 is not a square matrix . in any case \n we do a singular value decomposition of @xmath34 ; the svd eigenvalue spectrum then is a measure of the overlap of the two spaces . \n if the two spaces perfectly overlap then all eigenvalues are 1 , if just @xmath35 of the dimensions perfectly overlap than @xmath35 eigenvalues will be 1 and the rest zero . \n note that this method is invariant under arbitrary choice of orthonormal bases . \n we begin with the monopole - monopole interaction of the form @xmath36 , which has six unique terms , and thus six vectors or linear combinations of matrix elements , in the @xmath37-shell . \n these we combine with the @xmath38 most dominant linear combinations that arise from the previous analysis ; somewhat arbitrarily we chose @xmath39 ( our results do not change qualitatively for other small values of @xmath38 ) . \n the results , the svd eigenvalues of @xmath40 , are shown in fig . \n 2 . it is important to note we compute the spectrum separately for each randomly generated interaction and then compute the distribution . \n the results for ground states and for excited states are similar , so we combine all states into a single calculation . \n the eigenvalues for usdb are roughly @xmath41 higher than for the tbre , but otherwise qualitatively very similar . \n we also compared for contact interactions ; we took only two terms , the @xmath42 channel and @xmath43 channel ( there being only the @xmath44-wave channel in relative coordinates ) . \n these results we summarize in table 1 . \n usdb & 0.60 & 0.58 & 0.62 + tbre & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath45 +    for comparison , the leading eigenvalue for the overlaps of usdb versus the six - term monopole is 0.94 , while that of the tbre versus monopole is @xmath47 . \n there is somewhat more sensitivity to the monopole interaction than the contact interaction ; however , the reader should keep in mind that is not the whole story . recall that when fitting an interaction , the linearized equations are cast in the form @xmath48 . \n our analysis in this paper is entirely with the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , but in any fit one must also look to @xmath49 ( which in practice is the deviation of the theoretical spectra from experiment ) . for example , in @xcite it was found that using a contact interaction brought better agreement than a monopole interaction . \n one can understand this in terms of conjugate gradient methods @xcite : the direction of local steepest gradient may not in fact point towards the global minimum .    by our measures so far , both the tbre and the empirically - fit usdb look qualitatively similar . \n therefore we take a final analysis by comparing the dominant linear combinations of the usdb with those from the tbre . \n this is show in fig . \n 3 , using the same analysis as for fig .  2 . for comparison with the previous results , \n the leading eigenvalue is @xmath50 . \n we have analyzed the sensitivity of the low - lying spectra of the random two - body ensemble of interactions to variations of the hamiltonian matrix elements ; by using singular value decomposition , we find the dominant linear combinations , which would be important in any fit to experimental data . \n we found the svd eigenvalues follow a pattern remarkably similar to that shown by semi - realistic / semi - phenomenological interactions such as usdb . \n we also analyzed the most dominant linear combinations of matrix elements by computing the overlap with monopole and contact interactions . \n overall , both the tbre and the empirical usdb had qualitatively similar results . \n the u.s . \n department of energy supported this investigation through contracts de - fg02 - 96er40985 and de - fc02 - 09er41587 , and through subcontract b576152 by lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract de - ac52 - 07na27344 . \n a. poves and a. zuker : phys . \n rep . * 70 * , 235 ( 1981 ) . \n g. martnez - pinedo , a. p. zuker , a. poves , and e. caurier , phys . \n rev . c*55 * 187 ( 1997 ) . \n y. utsuno , t. otsuka , t. mizusaki , and m. honma : phys . \n c * 60 * , 054315 ( 1999 ) . \n m. honma , t. otsuka , b. a. brown , and t. mizusaki , phys . \n c * 69 * , 034335 ( 2004 ) . t. suzuki , s. chiba , t. yoshida , t. kajino , and t. otsuka phys.rev . \n c * 74 * , 034307 ( 2006 ) . \n skyrme , philos .  mag .  * 1 * , 1043 ( 1956 ) . \n m. bender , p .- h . \n heenen , and p .- \n reinhard , rev . \n phys . * 75 * , 121 ( 2003 ) u.  van kolck , prog . \n . phys . * 43 * , 337 ( 1999 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 2715, "GeneratedTokens": 171, "SynthesizedBody": "there has been a significant sensitivity improvement of the gravitational wave detectors since the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite and virgo observatory  @xcite started their operation . in 2007 \n ligo and virgo completed the two year run at sensitivity that allows detection of a merger of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) as far as @xmath0  mpc away  @xcite . in the most recent run ( may 2009 - october 2010 ) \n the binary neutron star horizon distance has been increased to @xmath1  mpc . however , even at this impressive sensitivity , the anticipated detection rate with the initial ligo and virgo detectors is quite low . \n a detection may be possible in the case of a rare astrophysical transient event such as a supernova explosion in our galaxy or a nearby merger of binary neutron stars . \n the signal is likely to be weak and it will be difficult to prove its astrophysical origin unless it is confirmed with a coincident observation of the electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart . \n for this reason the ligo and virgo collaborations are conducting a wide range of joint observations  @xcite with other astrophysical experiments including radio  @xcite , optical and x - ray telescopes  @xcite , and neutrino detectors  @xcite . \n a more robust detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources is anticipated in the next five years as advanced ligo and advanced virgo come online . \n numerous gw signals , expected to be observed by advanced detectors ( likely @xmath1 ns - ns events per year  @xcite ) , will begin our exploration of the gravitational - wave sky and start the era of the gravitational wave astronomy . \n along with the advanced gw detectors , a new generation of optical telescopes will come online  @xcite , which will enable a wide and deep survey of the electromagnetic sky . \n joint observations with the advanced gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic instruments will not only increase the confidence of detection but also bring fundamentally new information about the gw sources . \n they will reveal the physics and dynamic of sources , provide the identification of host galaxies and the associated redshifts , and in some cases determine luminosity distance to the source . \n one of the major challenges for such joint observations is to establish unambiguous association between a gravitational wave signal and a possible electromagnetic counterpart . \n it greatly depends on the ability of the gw networks to reconstruct sky coordinates of a detected gw source . \n given an accurate sky location , a corresponding electromagnetic transient may be identified in a list of events obtained with the all - sky telescope surveys , or the em instruments can be guided to take images of a small area in the sky . in the second case , it is important that the sky localization is performed by gw detectors in real time with low latency . \n the efficiency of the gw - em association and the choice of a partner telescope is affected by the sky localization error which should be well within the instrument s field of view ( typically less than few square degrees ) . moreover , exploring smaller area in the sky will decrease the probability of the false association . \n the problem of the source localization with networks of gw detectors is in the focus of research in the gravitational wave data analysis . \n there are several analytical studies  @xcite of this problem considering geometrical reconstruction of source coordinates based on the triangulation , which requires a measurement of the arrival time of a gw signal at different detectors \n . however , the accurate timing of the gw signal is intimately related to the reconstruction of the signal waveforms . due to the different detector sensitivities to the gw polarizations , the waveforms recorded by individual detectors may be different and they may not have a common timing reference ( like a signal peak time ) for a direct measurement of the differences in the arrival time . \n therefore , the problem of the source localization is better addressed in the framework of the coherent network analysis  @xcite , which reconstructs the waveforms and the sky coordinates simultaneously . by using both these methods ( triangulation and coherent network analysis ) , several practical source localization algorithms  @xcite have been recently developed and used during the ligo and virgo data taking runs in 2009 - 2010 . \n there have been a number of studies addressing benefits of individual detectors  @xcite and various detector networks  @xcite . in this paper \n we present a simulation study of the source localization and the reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of advanced detectors . \n the study is performed with a coherent network method , called coherent waveburst  @xcite ( cwb ) , based on the likelihood analysis . in cwb the data from all detectors in the network \n is processed simultaneously in order to reconstruct a common gw signal which is consistent with the recorded detector responses . \n the consistency is measured by the likelihood ratio , which is a function of the source parameters ( waveforms and sky location ) . \n the most probable source parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood ratio over the signal waveforms and sky coordinates . \n the method performs reconstruction of unmodeled burst signals ( arbitrary waveforms ) and signals with a certain polarization state : elliptical , linear and circular . \n the paper is organized as follows . \n possible networks of advanced detectors and their fundamental properties are descussed in section  [ sec : networks ] . in sections  [ sec : \n algorithm ] we describe the reconstruction algorithm . the simulation framework for this study \n is presented in section  [ framework ] . \n the results are reported in section  [ results ] . in sections  [ limitation ] and  [ conclusions ] \n we describe main factors limiting the source reconstruction and discuss the results . \n [ network ]    in 2001 - 2010 the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) and the virgo collaboration operated a network of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors which are the most sensitive instruments from the first generation of the gw interferometers ( 1 g ) . \n they consist of power - recycled michelson interferometers with kilometer - scale fabry - perot arms designed to detect gravitational waves with frequencies between tens of hz and several khz . \n the two ligo observatories  @xcite are in hanford , washington ( 4  km and 2  km detectors ) and in livingston , louisiana ( 4  km detector ) , and the 3-km virgo detector  @xcite is located in cascina , italy . \n other gravitational waves interferometers are the 300 m detector tama  @xcite in mitaka , japan , and the 600 m detector geo600  @xcite in hannover , germany . currently all 1 g interferometers are decommissioned , except virgo and geo600 , which continue to take data . \n the second - generation gw detectors ( 2 g ) are currently under construction . \n they include the advanced ligo detectors  @xcite , and the advanced virgo detector ( v )  @xcite which will have by an order of magnitude better sensitivity than the 1 g detectors . \n all advanced ligo detectors have 4-km long arms , with one detector in livingston ( l ) and two identical co - aligned detectors in hanford ( h and h ) . also there are plans to build the large cryogenic gravitational telescope ( lcgt )  @xcite in japan ( the j detector ) and possibly move the ligo h detector to a site in australia  @xcite ( the a detector ) . figure  [ fig:2gsensitivities ] shows the design sensitivity for the listed 2 g detectors . \n these , hopefully all five interferometers , compose the most advanced gw detector network which will be in operation after 2015 . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      there are several factors limiting the accuracy of the coordinate and waveform reconstruction due to the cwb algorithm . for high snr events the coordinate resolution is limited by the cwb sky segmentation which is @xmath2 degrees . therefore the error angle can not be less than @xmath3 degrees . \n also for the high frequency events the coordinate resolution is limited by the discrete time delays @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : algorithm ] ) with the step of 1/16384 seconds and by the accuracy of the time delay filter ( few percent ) used in the analysis . \n also in the analysis we did not use any unmodeled constraint specific for individual networks , which , in principle , may improve reconstruction . \n these limitations are not fundamental and the algorithm performance can be improved in the future . \n in the paper we present the results of the source localization and reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of gw interferometers . for a general characterization of the detector networks we introduce few fundamental network parameters , including the effective noise , and the network antenna and alignment factors . \n the effective power spectral density of the network noise determines the average network snr for a given population of gw signals . for each direction in the sky \n the network performance is characterized by its antenna and alignment factors . \n the antenna factor describes how uniform is the network response across the sky . \n the alignment factor , which strongly depends on the number of detectors and the orientation of their arms , determines the relative contribution of the two gw polarizations into the total network snr . \n it requires several non - aligned detectors ( preferably more than three ) for a robust detection and reconstruction of both gw components . \n the coordinate reconstruction strongly depends on the signal waveforms , network snr and the number of detector sites in the network . \n the reconstruction can be significantly improved when it is constrained by the signal model . \n although a crude coordinate reconstruction ( ring in the sky ) is possible with the networks of two spatially separated sites , at least three detector sites are required to perform the source localization . \n the accuracy of the localization dramatically increases for networks with more than three sites , particularly for the low snr events . \n for example , the lhhv and lhva networks are expected to have about the same detection rates , however , the 4-site lhva network would have much better performance for the accurate reconstruction of gw signals . \n the pointing resolution required for joint observations with the electromagnetic telescopes is achievable with the networks consisting of four sites . \n the lhvaj network demonstrates further improvements , both in the detection and reconstruction of gw signals , reaching a sub - degree angular resolution . \n in addition , due to the limited duty cycle of the detectors , both the lcgt and the australian detectors will significantly increase the observation time when any of 4-site networks are operational . \n the advanced ligo and virgo detectors are very capable of the first direct detection of gravitational waves . \n however , for better reconstruction of the gw signals more detectors are required . \n extra detectors introduce an important redundancy which lower the impact of limited duty cycle of the detectors , makes the coordinate reconstruction more accurate , and less dependent on the waveform morphology and calibration uncertainties . \n the construction of the lcgt and the detector in australia will significantly enhance the advanced ligo - virgo network and these detectors will play a vital role in the future gw astronomy . \n the authors are thankful to the ligo - australia committee members r.  weiss , p.  saulson , s.  sathyaprakash , f.  raab , p.  fritschel and s.  finn for useful discussion of the results . also the authors appreciate suggestions by l.  bildsten on better presentation of the results , particularly in figure  [ larshistograms ] . \n this work was supported by the us national science foundation grants phy-0855044 and phy-0855313 to the university of florida , gainesville , florida .", "StartTimeOffset": 1815629272252, "RequestID": "937c4bb851784526aabbae4122f0149c", "TotalTokens": 2886}

{"ContextTokens": 3531, "GeneratedTokens": 225, "SynthesizedBody": "despite their relative rarity , massive stars are dominantly dangerous for their environments . \n this is a result of their mass and energy input via stellar winds and subsequent core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) . a overarching parameter for the life expectancy of a massive star concerns its strong mass outflow which is driven by radiative forces on millions of ionic spectral line transitions , providing it with its name `` line - driven wind '' . \n on the one hand , mass loss is thought to be a key agent in revealing chemically processed material at the stellar surface , making it responsible for evolutionary scenarios such as the o @xmath0 luminous blue variable ( lbv ) @xmath0 wolf - rayet ( wr ) star @xmath0 sn sequence ( e.g. conti 1976 , chiosi & maeder 1986 , langer et al . \n furthermore , it determines the stellar mass before collapse and is thus relevant for the type of compact remnant that is left behind ( i.e. neutron star or black hole ) . on the other hand , \n the role of mass loss may be equally relevant for the loss of angular momentum ( e.g. meynet & maeder 2003 ) .    with respect to the latter , it has been suggested that low metallicity ( actually low `` iron '' contents ; vink & de koter 2005 ) leads to less mass and angular momentum loss in low metallicity environments , perhaps resulting in a preference of long gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) in the early universe , but however interesting the metallicity dependence and the long grb puzzle may be , the temperature dependence of stellar winds and its role in the angular momentum evolution of massive stars has been highlighted more recently with respect to the possibility of _ bi - stability braking _ ( vink et al . \n 2010 ) .    given the crucial role that mass loss plays for massive star evolution , we discuss the theory of massive star mass loss and its implications , with a focus on the metallicity ( @xmath1 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) dependence . \n we will see that the _ iron line opacity _ plays a dominant role in both cases . \n the theory goes back to the early 1970s when lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) suggested that selective radiation pressure on spectral lines is capable of driving stellar winds from the surface of massive stars , proving an explanation for the p cygni profiles observed in the ultraviolet spectra of o - type stars in the late 1960s . for an extensive overview of both the theory and recent observational developments , such as wind clumping \n , we refer the reader to puls et al . \n the theoretical framework is based around the momentum equation :    @xmath3    where for simplicity the gas pressure has been ignored ( as the radiative pressure is the much more dominant factor in most parts of the stellar wind ) . \n an oft - cited paper concerns the study of castor et al . \n ( 1975 , hereafter cak ) who expressed the radiative line acceleration @xmath4 as a function of the sobolev velocity gradient ( @xmath5 ) , involving a 2-parameter force multiplier ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) parametrization . \n subsequent improvements such as the inclusion of improved line lists by the munich group led to a reasonably good agreement with observed values ( e.g. pauldrach et al . \n we note that the cak - type wind dynamics is based on the assumption that @xmath8 plays the same role as @xmath9 , such that the critical point of the wind is no longer the sonic point ( as in solar wind theory ) but further downstream . \n the validity of this approach has been questioned by lucy ( 2007 ) . \n furthermore , these works relied on the assumption that stellar photons could interact with the outflowing ions only once .    in order to account for multiple scatterings abbott & lucy ( 1985 ) developed a monte carlo methodology , which was updated and extended by vink et al . \n ( 2000 , 2001 ) . in these oft - used mass - loss prescription the velocity law \n was originally adopted ( based on a semi - empirical motivation ) , but this assumption has recently been alleviated by mller & vink ( 2008 ) who express the line acceleration as a function of radius @xmath10 rather than the velocity gradient as done explicitly in cak theory . \n the implication is also that the critical point is mathematically the sonic point . \n the resulting mass - loss rates follow a scaling relation that only depends on the basic stellar parameters , approximately as :    @xmath11    over the entire range of @xmath12kk  except for the _ bi - stability _ jump around 25 kk , where the mass - loss properties are predicted to change drastically , with @xmath13 dropping by a factor of two ( pauldrach & puls 1990 ; vink et al . 1999 ) and the mass - loss rate jumping upwards by a factor of five ( vink et al . 1999 \n ; see sect.[s : tdep ] ) . \n massive stars rotate rapidly , with rotational velocities of up to 400 km / s . \n this is understood to have dramatic consequences for their evolution and ultimate demise , which may involve the production of a long - duration gamma - ray burst ( long grb ) .    as a result of this rotation , \n the pole becomes hotter than the stellar equator ( von zeipel theorem ) , which enables a rather complex meridional circulation in the stellar interior . during this process \n , nuclear processed material is transported from the core to the stellar envelope , thereby enriching the stellar surface with elements such as nitrogen ( n ) , which is produced during the cno cycle of hydrogen ( h ) burning . \n later on , the combination of mass loss and rotation also leads to the transfer of products of helium ( he ) burning to the surface , enriching the atmosphere with carbon ( c ) during the final carbon - rich wolf - rayet ( wc ) phases before the stellar core is expected to collapse , producing a supernova ( sn )  in some cases in conjunction with a long grb .      the most popular explanation for the long grb phenomenon involves the collapsar model ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) in which a rapidly rotating core collapses and produces an accretion disk surrounding a black hole . \n one of the persistent problems with the collapsar model was that the object not only requires a high rotational velocity at the very beginning of its life , but that it is required to maintain this rapid rotation until the end . \n this is a significant challenge because strong stellar outflows are expected to remove angular momentum . \n stellar models with rotation show that the objects not only remove up to 90% of their initial mass in winds when they have reached their final wolf - rayet phase , but as a result of this wind , the stars are also expected to come to a complete standstill . \n the question is what is expected for wolf - rayet stars in low metallicity galaxies . \n are they subject to similar mass and angular momentum loss ? \n radiation hydrodynamic simulations show that stellar winds from massive o - type stars are driven by the radiation pressure on metal lines , and specifically on iron ( fe ) , despite the fact that it is such a rare element . \n it should be noted that even in the metal `` rich '' environment of the milky way the h abundance is already 2500 times larger than that of fe . \n however , owing to iron s highly complex atomic structure it has millions of line transitions , which makes it an extremely efficient absorber of radiation in the inner atmosphere around the sonic point , where the mass - loss rate is set ( vink et al . 1999 , \n puls et al . 2000 ) . \n figure  [ fig : zrel ] shows the contribution of the different chemical elements ( h , he , cno , f ) to the total line acceleration for normal o - type stars . at solar @xmath1 , \n fe dominates the line acceleration near the sonic point , whilst its contribution drops significantly at lower density . \n therefore , the fe line contribution is less important in the supersonic region where the wind terminal velocity is set ( panel b ) . and similarly at lower @xmath1 ( panels c and d ) . here \n , the contribution of cno and elements such as cl , ar , p and s becomes highly relevant instead ( vink et al . \n 1999 , 2001 ) . \n up to 2005 most stellar modellers assumed that due to the overwhelming presence of c in wc atmospheres , it would probably be c that drives wolf - rayet winds , rather than fe . \n this assumption also implied that wc stars in low metallicity ( @xmath1 ) galaxies would have stellar winds equally strong as those in the galaxy , and still removing the required angular momentum . \n it was for this reason that there was no satisfactory explanation for the long grb puzzle . \n in 2005 , we performed a pilot study of wolf - rayet mass loss as a function of @xmath1 finding that although c may be the most abundant metallic element in wc atmospheres it is nonetheless the much more complex fe element that drives the stellar wind ( vink & de koter 2005 , grfener & hamann 2008 ) . \n in other words , host galaxy metallicity plays a crucial role : objects that are born with fewer fe atoms lose less matter by the time they reach the end of their lives , despite their larger contents of cno material . \n the striking implication is that objects in low metallicity environments  such as those characteristic for the early universe  can keep their angular momentum , enabling a potential grb event . \n interestingly , there indeed appears to be a preference for long grbs towards lower @xmath1 systems ( e.g. vreeswijk et al . \n as discussed at the end of sect .  [ s : theory ] , the mass - loss rates of massive objects are predicted to increase strongly when stars evolve towards the b supergiant regime . this @xmath14 jump is referred to as the bi - stability jump . \n the mass - loss behaviour is depicted as the dotted line in fig . \n [ fig : brott ] . \n recent stellar models with rotation of brott et al . \n ( 2010 ) that include this vink et al . \n mass - loss jump show a dramatic braking ( see solid line ) , which we refer to as _ bi - stability braking ( bsb)_. bsb might explain the general slow rotation of b supergiants . an alternative explanation for the slow rotation of b supergiants might involve a core he - burning nature for b supergiants ( see vink et al . \n 2010 for a detailed discussion ) . \n the cause of the mass - loss bi - stability jump is that the most important line driving element fe recombines from fe iv to fe iii at 25 000 k and that suddenly the fe lines become much more effective as they fall in the wavelength range where the flux distribution is maximal . \n the result is an increase in @xmath14 and a drop in terminal velocity . \n the latter has been confirmed in observed data - sets ( e.g. lamers et al . \n 1995 ) , but the jump in mass - loss rate is still controversial ( e.g. crowther et al . \n 2006 , benaglia 2007 , markova & puls 2008 ) . \n the relevance for stellar evolution is that when massive stars evolve to lower @xmath15  after the o star main sequence phase , they are expected to cross the bi - stability jump . \n interestingly , lbvs brighter than log ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ \n fig : hrd ] ) . are expected to encounter it continuously - on timescales of their photometric variability , which we discuss in the next section . \n 22 000 k ( after humphreys & davidson 1994 ; smith et al . \n 2004 ; vink 2009).,width=340 ]    in the previous section , we discussed the physics of the bi - stability jump in the context of normal ob supergiants . \n the jump might also play a role in the mass - loss behaviour of lbvs , in particular with reference to the normal `` s doradus '' type variations where the stars change their effective temperatures from values as high as 30 kk ( where they are identified as b supergiants ) to approximately 10 kk ( where they are identified as f supergiants ) . during these s dor excursions , \n the stars keep crossing the temperature range of the bi - stability jump ( see fig.[fig : hrd ] ) , thereby likely inducing variable mass loss . \n such variable mass loss is in turn understood to be responsible for a non - uniform circumstellar medium , which could show up in the lightcurves and spectra of core - collapse sne  if lbvs were in an advanced enough evolutionary state . \n current wisdom is that lbvs are not evolved enough ( e.g. langer et al . \n 1994 ) and that the lbv phase of evolution is the stage in which most of the outer hydrogen envelope is lost , prior to the objects turning to the much hotter wr phase . during this stage \n , they are thought to be subject to core he - burning for another couple of 100 0000 years before they finally run our of fuel and collapse . \n however , there have been recent observational hints that lbvs might explode early . \n kotak & vink ( 2006 ) noted that the variable radio emission of some transitional core - collapse sne such as sne 2001ig and 2003bg might be the result of variable lbv progenitor mass loss , which was subsequently followed up with spectroscopic wind velocity variations in sn 2005gj ( trundle et al . \n 2008 ) . in the meantime , \n smith et al . \n ( 2007 ) have argued for lbv super - outburst circumstellar material being responsible for a number of luminous interacting sne , whilst gal - yam et al . \n ( 2007 ) identified an lbv - type hypergiant star in the pre - explosion image of sn 2005gl . \n in other words , there appears to be a growing body of observational evidence that lbvs might explode already during their lbv phase of evolution . \n it might turn out to be an interesting puzzle to reconcile these findings with the theory of stellar structure and evolution . \n in this communication , we have presented a couple of examples of the type of information that mass - loss predictions can provide for our understanding of the evolution and fate of massive stars , especially with respect to sne and long grbs . \n the manner in which these mass - loss predictions depend on the basic stellar parameters , such as @xmath1 and @xmath18 , can ultimately only be as good as the underlying atomic data . \n extensive opacity data and linelists , such as those provided by kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) that have been used in our study , are thus of fundamental importance not only for the mass - loss predictions themselves , but also for understanding the lives and deaths of massive stars  over all cosmological epochs .", "StartTimeOffset": 1829563850065, "RequestID": "8b0edd9c2cc9436cad1ba0a7fa3ed707", "TotalTokens": 3756}

to - width ratios with _ type c _ being the most elongated . \n but many of the _ etls_s found in figure 1 are much more elongated and of far smaller widths ( typically one tenth of _ pc _ ) than most of the _ type c _ brcs in sugitani et al . \n ( 1991 ) and sugitani and ogura ( 1994 ) . \n we searched for such peculiar _ etls_s that have a star / stars at their tip on the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath2 m , 4.5 @xmath2 m , and 8.0 @xmath2 m images . \n table 1 gives the results , listing such stars with running numbers identified in figure 1 , the coordinates and some remarks . \n we refer to these stars as _ etls _ stars . \n some of them are listed in koenig et al . \n ( 2008 , their table 4 ) . \n [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab5 ] \n we paid attention to the numerous , elephant trunk -

whitmore et al .  1999 , \n zhang & fall 1999 ) regions of very intense star - formation arise as a result of the tightly compressed interstellar media . \n dozens and up to hundreds of young massive star clusters are observed to form in star cluster complexes ( or _ super - clusters _ ) spanning up to a few hundred pc in diameter . \n kroupa ( 1998 ) argues that these super - clusters have to be bound objects because their age ( @xmath17  myr ) indicates that they should be already dispersed . simulating super - clusters , by means of stellar dynamical @xmath18-body simulations , fellhauer et al . \n ( 2002 ) found that the star clusters within these super - clusters merge on very short time - scales ( a few dozens to a few hundred myr ) , namely a few crossing - times of the super - cluster . \n the age - estimate of w3 points to the possibility that it may have formed during the merger event of the host - galaxy ( i.e.  out of merging star clusters ) rather than it being the stripped core of a dwarf galaxy , which should be very old . \n in this project we perform stellar dynamical n - body simulations to show that the merging of star clusters in dense star cluster complexes is able to form massive objects like w3 in ngc  7252 . \n the simulations are carried out with the particle - mesh code superbox with high - resolution sub - grids which stay focussed on the simulated objects ( fellhauer et al . \n 2000 ) .    in our models the super - cluster \n is initially represented by a plummer sphere with a plummer radius of @xmath19  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath15  pc . \n the clusters inside this super - cluster have a total mass of @xmath20  m@xmath2 , which leads to a crossing time of the super - cluster of @xmath21  myr . inside the plummer sphere of the super - cluster , \n the particles have positions and velocities according to the plummer distribution function . \n the particles themselves are plummer spheres representing the star clusters with , respectively , plummer radii of @xmath22 or @xmath16  pc , masses of @xmath23 and @xmath24  m@xmath2 and crossing times of @xmath25 and @xmath26  myr , being represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28  particles . altogether the super - cluster is filled with @xmath29 star clusters , from which @xmath30 are light ones and @xmath31 are of the heavy type to mimic a mass spectrum similar to the one found in the young massive star clusters in the antennae ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .    this super - cluster \n is now placed into an analytical galactic potential consisting of a logarithmic potential for the underlying halo , a plummer - kuzmin disc and a hernquist bulge , which add up to an almost flat rotation curve of @xmath32  kms@xmath5 . \n the super - cluster is placed at a distance of @xmath33  kpc initially ( apogalacticon ) on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon of @xmath16  kpc . \n = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    in contrast to our previous models ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a , b ) where the merger objects were smaller and not that heavy , the merging process here takes more time . after the first clusters have merged and build up a massive and extended object with the remaining clusters within , it is not encounters between clusters and the merger object which govern the merging process ( the clusters are already within the object ) but dynamical friction acting on the remaining clusters . \n nevertheless a massive merger object is present from an early stage on . \n the top row of figure  [ fig : t300 ] shows the contour plot of the merger object ( left at @xmath34 and right at @xmath35  myr comprising the suggested age - range of w3 ) . \n the contours are spaced in magnitude intervals and masses are converted to luminosities taking a mass - to - light ratio of 0.15 . according to a single stellar population model run with starburst99 ( leitherer et al . \n 1999 ) a stellar population of this age has a @xmath36@xmath37 . in our model these two time - slices mark the transition between the time , when still many star clusters are visible as separate entities and the time when most of the star clusters have already merged or are dissolved within the merger object . \n another interesting feature of our model is that the merger object shows a cuspy structure with a dynamically cold core . \n the surface - density profile can be fitted by either two king profiles or two exponentials ( fig .  [ \n fig : t300 ] , middle row ) and the velocity dispersion is rising in the innermost part and reaches its maximum beyond the transition between the core and the envelope ( fig .  [ \n fig : t300 ] , bottom row ) . \n the outer part of the velocity dispersion , reaching from the maximum value to the tidal radius , can be fitted with an exponential profile with an exponential scale length of the order of the tidal radius of the object . beyond the tidal radius the velocity dispersion is rising again due to the large velocities of the extra tidal stars .    in fig . \n [ fig : evol ] we show the evolution of the total mass , of the effective radius and of the velocity dispersion of our model , whose dynamical evolution was followed for @xmath38  gyr . shown in the right panel of the figure \n are the central values of the dynamically cold core as well as the maximum values of the velocity dispersion . \n the boxes show the values measured for w3 . \n the total mass as well as the maximum velocity dispersion of our model is in reasonable agreement with the data of w3 . \n only the effective radius of our model is too small compared with w3 . \n it starts off at a value of about @xmath16  pc and it increases slightly until the majority of the star clusters have merged , deforming the core progressively . \n after the merging process has ceased the core of the merger object stabilises and the effective radius drops to about @xmath38  pc . but note the extremely large value at @xmath39  myr . at exactly that time a late merger event of one of the remaining star clusters happened . \n if our formation scenario is correct then this points to the possibility that we might be observing w3 at the time when a star cluster merges with the core of the object mimicking a large effective radius . \n = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm = 03.2 cm    the further dynamical evolution is mainly governed by the tidal shaping of the object due to its eccentric orbit . \n it leads to a successive mass loss and an increase in the effective radius as well as a decrease in the maximum velocity dispersion , while the central value increases slightly . \n looking at the merger object after @xmath38  gyr of its dynamical evolution ( fig . \n [ fig : t300 ] ) shows that this object is very stable against tidal disruption . \n also the dynamically cold core is not a transient feature but survives the evolution . \n the total mass of the object is still of the order of @xmath40  m@xmath2 which is an order of magnitude more than the most massive globular cluster ( @xmath41  cen ) of the milky way . \n the relaxation time - scale of this object , adopting the formula from spitzer & hart ( 1971 ) , is @xmath42  gyr . \n this shows that this object might to be thought of as a dwarf galaxy rather than a globular cluster , since @xmath43 is much longer than a hubble time . \n with our numerical model we introduce a formation scenario for the ultra - massive star cluster w3 found in ngc  7252 . we propose that this object may not have formed as one star cluster , but rather as a star cluster complex . \n the star clusters in this complex have merged and formed w3 . \n these star cluster complexes ( super - clusters ) are a common feature in interacting late - type galaxies . \n we predict how w3 should look like if it would be possible to resolve it . \n its age places it at about the transition time between having many remaining star clusters visible inside and the time when all star clusters have already merged . \n one should see the last surviving star clusters in the stage of merging . \n furthermore a merger object as massive as w3 should show a distinct core \n envelope structure . \n the merger object in our calculation had a dense , dynamically cold core and an extended envelope . \n this core \n envelope structure is not a transient feature but a stable configuration . \n we followed the evolution of our merger object for @xmath38  gyr and this structure remained . \n the core is formed out of the merged star clusters . \n the envelope consists out of the stripped stars , lost by the star clusters during the initial violent merger process . in our previous models the merger objects are not massive enough to keep stripped stars bound and they are lost . in the case of the w3 model \n the core object is massive enough to retain the stripped stars bound , forming the envelope structure of our model . \n w3 is said to be one of the newly discovered ultra - compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies and also one of the most massive ones ( maraston et al.2004 ) . \n other ucds are found and studied around the central galaxy in the fornax cluster ( ngc  1399 ) by hilker et al . \n ( 1999 ) , phillipps et al . \n ( 2001 ) and mieske et al . \n there these objects are quite old . \n there are two competing formation scenarios for ucds . while bekki et al . \n ( 2003 ) propose that these objects are the remaining cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies , fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002a ) proposed the merging scenario from star cluster complexes as a possible formation process , resulting naturally from the merging of gas - rich galaxies in groups as the groups merge with a galaxy cluster . \n a possible way to distinguish between the two scenarios would be an analysis of the stellar populations in these objects . \n while the merging star cluster scenario implies that the stars of the ucds have more or less the same metallicity and age ( this holds at least for the most prominent population formed in the starburst ) , cores of dwarf galaxies should show a more complex metallicity and age distribution . and \n as dwarf galaxies are believed to be the oldest building blocks in the universe , the cores should show a prominent very old population .    in the case of \n w3 the stripping scenario can be completely ruled out . \n age estimates of this object range from @xmath14 to @xmath15  myr , which is also the age of the interaction ( ngc  7252 is a merger remnant of two gas - rich disc galaxies ) . \n this time is much too short for a nucleus to be stripped of its surrounding dwarf galaxy . \n if this implies that all ucds must have formed in the same way or if both scenarios are possible and are realized by nature can not yet be asserted .", "StartTimeOffset": 1846910144148, "RequestID": "26ba75d7c1aa44b3862cb6dcc160f25b", "TotalTokens": 3481}
{"ContextTokens": 3587, "GeneratedTokens": 231, "SynthesizedBody": "it is not yet known what exactly induces and maintains galactic warps . \n it may well be that a number of mechanisms  from among those proposed already , or some new ones \n act together or alone to produce this ubiquitous phenomenon . \n some proposed mechanisms rely on a dark galactic halo as a direct actuator or as a mediator of perturbations ( for reviews with extensive references see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) \n . the modified dynamics ( mond ) repudiates dark halos , but it offers a new mechanism that increases the warping efficacy of external perturbers over and above their possible tidal effects , which , notoriously , are too weak . \n this results from the nonlinearity of mond and is most clearly demonstrated in the case where a system ( a galaxy ) falls in an external field that by itself is approximately constant in space . in a linear theory , such as newtonian gravity \n , the constant external field has no effect on the internal dynamics of the system ( motions with respect to its center of mass ) ; in mond it very much does . when the external field dominates the internal field of the system it is easy to deduce what its effects are , as discussed e.g. in @xcite , and @xcite . in the present context \n the external acceleration is small compared with the internal ones at the position of the warp , which necessitates numerical studies . \n for our mechanism to work in field galaxies , one or more perturbers must be present . \n there is , indeed , growing evidence that the appearance of a warp in a galaxy is strongly correlated with the presence of nearby perturbers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n even galaxies that had been thought to be isolated might , in fact , not be so ( @xcite ) . \n of course , perturber companions have always been suspected , but their direct tidal effects on disks seem to be too small .    the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate , by numerical solutions of simplified galaxy - perturber systems , that , with reasonable parameter values , this mond effect produces galactic warps of the magnitude observed . \n we have not included effects due to variations in the external field ( due to the motion of the perturber , or to the motion of the galaxy in a parent cluster ) . from the symmetry of our model problem \n the warps we produce have a straight line of nodes . \n the method is described in section 2 ; the results are detailed in sections 3 and 4 ; conclusions are drawn in section 5 . \n we use the nonrelativistic , modified - gravity formulation of mond suggested by @xcite . the acceleration field @xmath0 produced by a mass distribution @xmath1 is derived from a potential @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath3= 4\\pi g\\rho\\ ] ] instead of the usual poisson equation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the acceleration constant of mond . the form \n @xmath10 has been used in all rotation curve analyses , and we also use it here . \n this nonlinear potential equation is solved numerically using multi - grid methods as detailed in @xcite , and adumbrated in @xcite . \n we consider two classes of models . to simulate a far away companion , or the effect of the mean field of a cluster on a member galaxy , we solve for the field of a rigid disk in the presence of a given external acceleration field @xmath11 . in this case \n the field equation is solved subject to the boundary condition at infinity @xmath12 . \n then @xmath11 is subtracted from @xmath13 to get the field relative to the galaxy . \n this latter determines the galaxy s internal dynamics , warps , etc . to simulate the effect of a nearby companion , exemplified here by the effect of the magellanic clouds ( mc ) on the milky - way ( mw ) \n , we solve fully for a disk - plus - perturber system ( in which case @xmath14 at infinity ) . \n then , the center - of - mass acceleration of the galaxy is computed using the surface - integral method given by eq.(14 ) of @xcite , and is subtracted from the acceleration field to get the internal dynamics .    in each case , after the acceleration field relative to the center of mass of the galaxy is found , we find closed , nearly circular , nearly planar , test - particle orbits . \n the orbits are integrated for many periods to insure that , within our accuracy and patience , they are closed . \n thus , inasmuch as adiabaticity is a good approximation , these are non - precessing orbits . \n they are also found to be stable under small changes in their initial conditions . \n these are taken to trace a warp , in the spirit of the tilted - ring model ( @xcite ) . \n we take the model galaxy to be an exponential disk smoothly truncated at a radius that we use as our unit length , @xmath15 , and with a scale length of @xmath16 in these units . \n the surface density is of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 . \n the disk lies in the @xmath19 plane . to optimize the warping effect we take the external field to lie @xmath20 from the @xmath21 axis in the third quadrant of the @xmath22 plane . \n its absolute value is taken as @xmath23 in units of @xmath9 . \n ( we work in units where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , so masses are given in units of @xmath26 . ) in a more extensive study we plan to calculate the effect as a function of the field direction ( relative to the disk axis ) and also to follow the test particle orbits as the external field changes with time to mimic the relative motion of the galaxy and perturber . \n for the present , pilot study we ran models with two values of the disk mass @xmath27 and @xmath28 . \n the ( mond ) accelerations of the isolated disk models at @xmath29 are @xmath30 ; i.e. respectively , ten and twenty times larger than the external field . \n both accelerations are small compared with 1 ( @xmath9 ) so we are rather deep in the mond regime in the warp region . in the deep - mond regime \n the theory has obvious scaling properties so the above parameters represent a family of models spanned e.g. by scaling by the same factor @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 fixed ) . \n the results are summarized in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . \n we first show for each model a plot of the absolute value of the torque @xmath36 in the @xmath22 plane containing the disk axis and the external field ( @xmath37 is the field in the center - of - mass frame ) . \n this is a quantity that brings out clearly the departure of the field from both axisymmetry and left - right symmetry . in the spherical case @xmath38 everywhere ; \n in the isolated - disk case the @xmath38 line is the @xmath21 axis ( and the @xmath39 axis ) . \n this torque plot is also useful for homing in on closed orbits of the potential whose center is near the galactic center , because these should cross the @xmath22 plane near the zero - torque line . \n the orbits are found by actual integration , starting from a set of initial conditions . \n the projections of some such orbits are then shown . \n we surmise that in the spirit of the tilted - ring model they delineate the shape of the warp . \n the disk of the milky way is known to be warped beyond the solar circle ( @xcite , and for a recent description and references @xcite ) . at galactic longitude @xmath40 the hi disk curls steadily away from the plane . at @xmath41 the disk curves southward before turning back towards the plane ( see @xcite for an analytic expression that approximates the warp shape beyond 11 kpc ) .    the line of nodes in the tilted - ring picture is straight within the uncertainties , and is nearly perpendicular to the plane spanned by the inner - disk axis and the radius vector to the magellanic clouds . \n this makes the cloud system a prime suspect in producing the warp . \n it was , however , appreciated long ago that the tidal field of the clouds , in their present position , is too small to distort the disk to the extent observed . \n for example , @xcite estimated that a cloud mass @xmath42 would generate a warp of amplitude @xmath43 70 pc at a radius of 16 kpc . \n it has , however , been suggested by @xcite that a `` live '' halo that actively responds to the perturbation of the clouds might augment the effect to produce a warp of the observed magnitude and geometry . \n mond , as we said , excludes a dynamically important halo , but might lead to a large enough warp due to the non - linear effect discussed above . \n we model the system as follows . \n the mw is taken as a pure disk in the @xmath19 plane , centered at the origin , with the cutoff , exponential surface - density law described in section 3 ( with @xmath16 ) ; its dimensionless mass is @xmath44 . \n the magellanic clouds are represented by one point mass @xmath45 at a position whose dimensionless coordinates are ( 2.52 , 0 , -1.63 ) . \n this is at @xmath46 from the center of the galaxy , and at the correct galactic latitude of the lmc . \n this ratio would correspond for example to @xmath47 kpc ( @xcite ) and an lmc distance of 45 mpc ( @xcite ) . \n the uncertainties in these parameters are still large . \n two mass ratios were considered : @xmath48 . \n ( the b luminosity ratio of the clouds to the mw is about 0.2 . \n since the baryonic @xmath49 values of the two might be different , reasonable values of the mass ratio lie between 0.1 and 0.4 . ) other nearby galaxies are expected to have a smaller effect than the lmc ; for example , m31 , despite its higher mass , causes a rather smaller acceleration near the mw .    in figure [ fig3 ] we show , for each mass ratio , two closed , quasi - circular , stable orbits beyond the cutoff radius of the disk  presumed to delineate our calculated warp  together with a representation of the observed warp ( as given by the formula in @xcite ) . \n we see that for a constant external field whose ratio to the field of the isolated disk at @xmath50 is only ( 5 - 10)@xmath51 , a noticeable warp beyond this radius is indicated by test - particle orbits . \n this acceleration ratio increases in proportion to the galactocentric radius , but , still , rotational velocities will be affected only little even up to @xmath52 . note that the warp is not symmetric but is less pronounced on the attracting side of the field . \n we used an external - field inclination that is favorable for an s - shape warp . \n when the field is in the disk plane , the axisymmetry is broken but the up - down one is not , so no warp will be induced . \n if the field is perpendicular to the disk , axisymmetry is preserved but not the up - down one ; this might induce bowl - shaped warps . \n ( in the limit of a highly dominant , perpendicular , external field , the analytic results in @xcite show that the geometry remains up - down symmetric , but for a weak perturbing field this is not so . )    regarding the results for the mw - mc system , we see that even for a mass ratio of 0.1 a satellite at the position of the mc produces enough field distortion to accommodate inclined , quasi - circular orbit that rise to @xmath53 at @xmath54 on one side , and to a height of @xmath55 at @xmath56 on the other . with a mass ratio of 0.2 the amplitude of the warp is close to that observed for the mw . \n . a larger volume of the parameter space has to be surveyed . \n this includes more values of the relative strength of the perturbation , different disk - perturber alignments ( leading perhaps to a wider varieties of warp shapes ) , more complex perturbations such as two or more satellites , which would bend the line of nodes at larger radii , where we can not approximate the combined effect by a constant field . \n we would also have to study other galaxy mass distributions . \n for example , we expect that if a considerable fraction of the galaxy mass is put in a round bulge , a warp will form more easily . for the same reason , if @xmath57 is smaller ( but the mc distance remains the same ) the warp will be stronger at the same position . \n . we must reckon with the fact that in many relevant cases the geometry of the perturbation changes considerably during the response time of the disk ( say the orbital period at the position of the warp ) . \n this is true of galaxies moving in or near the core of galaxy clusters ; it is also true for the mw - mc system . \n the warp geometry will thus not just follow the perturbation adiabatically but , at larger radii , the geometry may reflect the past history of the perturbation ( leading , among other things , to curvature of the line of nodes ) . according to proper - motion observations and models of the mc and the magellanic stream motion \n ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the mc binary is moving on a nearly polar orbit around the galaxy with a tangential velocity that is now comparable with the rotational velocity of the galaxy . \n this means that the radius vector to the mc changes its angle with the galaxy s axis by @xmath58 during the galaxy s orbital period at about 15 kpc . \n this means that the adiabaticity assumption we have made might be broken , and more and more so at larger radii . \n our subtraction of a constant center - of - mass acceleration is then also not valid . \n this could lead to a more complicated warp geometry than the integral - sign shape that we get with adiabaticity . because the mc orbit is nearly polar we expect the line of nodes to remain straight . \n we think self - gravity of the mass in the warped region is not so important . \n this is because the relative contribution of the warped mass to the acceleration field is small everywhere , even within the warp itself . \n ( the surface density in the warp is smaller than the integrated surface density there . ) \n this contribution can then be treated as a perturbation  linearizing in it the mond field equation  and in mond such density perturbations produce an even weaker effect than in newtonian dynamics ( hence the added stability in mond ) . \n so we can at least expect that the nonlinearity of mond will not beget some peculiar amplification of self gravity . \n but we do not really know what these effects might be  a point that has to be checked numerically . \n we plan to perform @xmath59-body simulations whereby the @xmath60-body warped disk and the point - mass perturber orbit each other . this will account for non - adiabaticity and for self gravity in the disk , and also partly for point 2 above .", "StartTimeOffset": 1862012173473, "RequestID": "6dbabf14a97f4585b502209bd5dfba3f", "TotalTokens": 3818}

calibrated release of the library was published by prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) , it contained 906 spectra . \n the last previous release , elodie.3 was announced in prugniel & soubiran ( 2004 ) and represented a major progress in the coverage of the space of atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] ) .    the present version , elodie.3.1 is based on the same collection of spectra than elodie.3 . fig . \n 1 , 2 and 3 show the distribution of the 1388 stars of the library in the hr diagram , t@xmath0 - [ fe / h ] and t@xmath0 - @xmath1 planes . \n the main interest of this new version is the extended wavelength coverage , now including the h & k lines , and limited by the blue limit of the spectrograph . \n some important improvements are also summarized in the next section . \n the library has been used for population synthesis using the pegase.hr program ( le borgne et al . \n 2004 ) , and these models were used to study the stellar populations of galaxies and star clusters . the advantage of these models is the high spectral resolution provided by the library which allows to constrain simultaneously the internal kinematics and the parameters of the stellar population ( for instance age and metallicity ) . thanks to this library , the analysis is not anymore limited to the low resolution of the spectrophotometric indices . \n specific methods for the simultaneous analysis of the kinematics and of the stellar population were developed in ocvirk et al . \n ( 2006 ) and chilingarian ( 2007 ) . \n it was found that these approaches of full spectrum fitting are increasing the precision on age and metallicity by a factor 3 ( a factor 10 on observing time to get the same precision ) ( koleva et al . \n 2006 ) . \n the comparison between models based on the current release of the library and other models are presented in koleva et al ( 2007a ) and validation using galactic clusters in koleva et al . \n ( 2007b ) . \n we are now preparing a further version , elodie.4 , which will contain about 5000 spectra . \n this will allow a better investigation of the effect of the @xmath3-element abundances in stellar populations , possibly by coupling the library with a basis of theoretical spectra as presented in prugniel et al . \n since the first version of the library , the reduction procedure described in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) has been improved in several aspects but the general philosophy remains the same . \n the first steps of the data processing up to the extraction of the orders are made with the standard elodie pipeline ( baranne et al . , 1996 ) . \n the reconnection of the orders , and the flux calibration are explained in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) . \n extension of the wavelength range . \n : :    in the previous releases the first 4 orders in the blue were not    processed because of the difficulty of their reconnection and    calibration due to the low signal -

comparison in the library allow to detect    inconsistencies and to determine internal values : each wavelength    point of the spectra is modeled as polynomials in    t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] fitted to the    compiled parameters and the inversion of this function returns    internal determinations of the parameters ( see prugniel & soubiran    2001 , le borgne et al . \n 2004 ) . +    on one side we have updated the compiled input parameters , using    recent publications and fixing errors , and on the other side we    improved the polynomial functions used to model the spectra . \n the    present version is better , but , as seen in fig . \n 2 and 3 , some    artifacts persist in the temperature range 6500 - 7500k at low    metallicity ( some input metallicities are underestimated ) . \n +    by comparing the observed spectra with the polynomial model , we get an    idea of the quality of the model and of the consistency of the    atmospheric parameters . \n the rms residuals from the absolute model    ( ie . using the input atmospheric parameters ) is 2.0% . \n the rms    residuals from the internal model ( iterated using the atmospheric    parameters returned after an inversion with the absolute model ) is    1.4% . \n the decrease of the rms residuals after the iteration is due to    an improvement of the consistency of the atmospheric parameters . \n the    final residuals include the effect of the noise and of all the    neglected parameters , like rotation , detailed abundances ... the    internal determination of the atmospheric parameters may be biased    with respect to the input values : we checked these biases by averaging    them in some regions of the parameters space , and did not find    evidence for clear bias . \n tables 1 & 2 , and fig . \n 4 & 5 compare the lick indices measured on the elodie spectra with those of the lick ( worthey et al . \n 1994 ) and jones ( worthey & ottaviani , 1997 ) libraries . \n the comparison with the lick data shows an important spread due to the lower quality of the lick data , but the comparison with jones library reveals an excellent consistency . \n the zero - points are extremely small , and the slope between the two series is close to 1 . \n this test of the slope is critical since it may unveil some data - reduction errors in the cosmic ray clipping , the rebinning or the scattered light subtraction : these three aspects potentially affecting more the strong lines , hence high metallicity stars .    . \n comparison with lick indices from the lick library . \n col . 1 : designation of the lick index ; col \n . 2 , 3 : index(elodie ) = offset + slope @xmath4 \n index(worthey ) ; col . \n 4 : rms dispersion from the linear fit .

the present paper simulates the cmb in a poincar dodecahedral space  @xcite and checks the quadrupole - octupole alignment . \n absolutely no correlation is found . \n we use the late jesper gundermann s simulation  @xcite of the cmb in the poincar dodecahedral space , with modes through @xmath4 . this simplified simulation , while neglecting the doppler contribution and the sound speed , nevertheless produces a low-@xmath3 power spectrum essentially identical to the spectra produced by more refined simulations . \n thus we may be quite confident that if the dodecahedral topology imposed a nontrivial quadrupole - octupole alignment , this simulation would capture it . as we will see in section  [ sectionmeasuring ] , however , absolutely no such correlation is found . \n even if one were to add a doppler term and sound speed to the simulation , the distribution in figure  [ figurequadocthistogram ] would change by at most a tiny amount , not nearly enough to introduce a nontrivial quadrupole - octupole correlation . \n for each simulated cmb sky , we use the polynomial method  @xcite to compute the two quadrupole vectors @xmath5 and the three octupole vectors @xmath6 . following  @xcite \n , we take the cross product @xmath7 , which we normalize to obtain a unit vector @xmath8 orthogonal to the plane of the quadrupole . \n similarly , we take the cross product of each of the three possible pairs of octupole vectors @xmath9 which we normalize to obtain unit vectors @xmath10 orthogonal to each of the three octupole planes . \n the three dot products @xmath11 then measure the extent to which the quadrupole plane does or does not align with each of the three octupole planes \n .    in a simply connected universe one expects no correlation between the quadrupole vector @xmath12 and each octupole vector @xmath13 . \n as @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( for some fixed @xmath14 ) wander randomly over the 2-sphere , their dot product follows a flat distribution on the interval @xmath15 $ ] ( this is a consequence of the wonderful fact that radial projection of a sphere onto a circumscribed cylinder via @xmath16 preserves area ) . \n hence each @xmath17 , being the absolute value of the dot product , follows a flat distribution on @xmath18 $ ] .    in the real universe \n the quadrupole aligns surprisingly well with the octupole , giving dot products @xmath19 for the dq - corrected tegmark ( dqt ) cleaning @xcite of the first - year wmap data or @xmath20 for the lagrange internal linear combination ( lilc ) cleaning @xcite of the same data . \n the question of whether a multiconnected spatial topology might explain the observed quadrupole - octupole alignment may be rephrased more precisely as : does a given topology predict a flat distribution for each @xmath21 or does it predict a distribution skewed towards the high end ? for the poincar dodecahedral space , our simulations ( recall section  [ sectionsimulating ] ) yield a flat distribution ( figure  [ figurequadocthistogram ] ) , implying that the dodecahedral topology does nothing to explain the quadrupole - octupole alignment .    to be fully rigorous \n we should point out that even though the individual dot products @xmath21 follow the same flat distribution in the dodecahedral topology that they do in the simply connected model , it s nevertheless conceivable that their sum @xmath22 might follow a slightly different distribution in the two cases , depending on the internal correlations among the three @xmath21 in the dodecahedral case . in practice , however , our simulations find the observed sum to be unusual at roughly the @xmath2 level regardless of whether we compare to the dodecahedral topology or a simply connected space . \n the poincar dodecahedral space topology , while explaining the weakness of the low-@xmath3 modes , completely fails to explain the quadrupole - octupole alignment . \n while this negative result leaves one feeling less optimistic , good scientific practice demands that one analyze a few other plausible topologies before reaching any firm conclusion about whether topology might play a role . \n one must also keep an open mind about what observations may or may not be due to random chance alone . \n the quadrupole - octupole alignment might be due to chance , while the weakness of the low-@xmath3 modes has a physical explanation . or perhaps exactly the reverse is true . at this point \n the mystery remains open . \n i dedicate this article to my friend and collaborator jesper gundermann , whose untimely death on 10 june 2006 saddened all who knew him . \n his energetic enthusiasm and deep love of science brought joy to those of us lucky enough to work with him . \n copi , d. huterer and g.d . \n starkman , `` multipole vectors  a new representation of the cmb sky and evidence for statistical anisotropy or non - gaussianity at @xmath25 '' , _ phys . rev . _ \n * d70 * ( 2003 ) 043515 , astro - ph/0310511 . \n p. bielewicz , h.k . \n eriksen , a.j . \n banday , k.m . \n grski and p.b . \n lilje , `` multipole vector anomalies in the first - year wmap data : a cut - sky analysis '' , _ astrophys . \n j. _ * 635 * ( 2005 ) 750760 , astro - ph/0507186 . \n luminet , j. weeks , a. riazuelo , r. lehoucq and j .- p . \n uzan , `` dodecahedral space topology as an explanation for weak wide - angle temperature correlations in the cosmic microwave background '' , _ nature _ * 425 * ( 2003 ) , 593595 . \n eriksen , a.j . \n banday , k.m . \n grski and p.b . \n lilje , `` on foreground removal from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by an internal linear combination method : limitations and implications '' , _ astrophys . \n j. _ * 612 * ( 2004 ) 633646 , astro - ph/0403098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1882554927794, "RequestID": "8ce92eae4db149028f97174ead49cc44", "TotalTokens": 1869}
{"ContextTokens": 3639, "GeneratedTokens": 100, "SynthesizedBody": "the analysis of several sources of observational data , supernovae type ia , redshift of distant objects , temperature fluctuations of background radiation ( cfr . \n padmanabhan @xcite for a nice review ) has lead to accept that our universe is acceleratedly expanding nowadays . \n this unexpected feature , which can not be explained by means of an standard matter content for the universe , has motivated lots of theoretical work , such as a dark energy component in the energy - momentum tensor or modifications of the theory of gravitation . \n violation of energy conditions due to these new components have given rise to consider new types of singularities , different from the well - known big bang and big crunch . \n beyond the so - called phantom divide , @xmath0 , accelerated expansion ends up at a big rip ( caldwell @xcite ) . \n below the phantom divide , other atypical events may come up , such as sudden singularities ( barrow @xcite ) . \n usually the analysis of these singularities is made by just tracking where the curvature scalars blow up . \n for instance , a classification of singularities is provided ( nojiri and odintsov @xcite ) depending on which scalars are singular or not . however the use of more poweful tools , such as geodesic analysis , has proven quite successful to discover new features of the singularities . \n furthermore , this is the natural framework to talk about singularities ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) . \n we consider homogeneous and isotropic universes endowed with a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath1 where the coordinates have the usual ranges . \n we are mostly interested in spatially - flat models , @xmath2 , since observations point out this kind of universe . \n geodesics in these models are described by simple ordinary equations due to their high symmetry , @xmath3    the dot stands for derivation with respect to proper time @xmath4 , which allows parametrization of geodesics satisfying the unitary condition of the velocity , @xmath5where @xmath6 is one for timelike , zero for lightlike or minus one for spacelike geodesics . \n the constant @xmath7 is the specific linear momentum of the geodesic . \n there are then three families of causal geodesics : lightlike geodesics ( @xmath8 ) , fluid worldlines ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and timelike radial geodesics ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) .    in order to perform calculations with a general scale factor \n , we only need that @xmath12 has a power expansion ( catton and visser @xcite ) around the event at @xmath13 , where a singularity is deemed to appear , @xmath14 with real and ordered exponents , @xmath15 , and positive @xmath16 . \n hence , the model behaves close to @xmath13 as a power - law model of exponent @xmath17 . \n accordingly , several types of singular events may arise :    * @xmath18 : the scale factor vanishes at @xmath13 and we have either a big bang or big crunch . \n * @xmath19 : the scale factor is finite at @xmath13 . if @xmath12 is analytical , the event at @xmath13 is regular . otherwise a weak or sudden singularity appears . \n * @xmath20 : the scale factor diverges at @xmath13 and a big rip appears . \n the analysis of causal geodesics is easy to perform in this case and is shown in table 1 ( fernndez - jambrina and lazkoz @xcite ) . \n .singularities in flrw models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this table shows the first of the unusual features of sudden singularities ( fernndez - jambrina and lazkoz @xcite ) : they are weak according to tipler ( tipler @xcite ) and krlak s definitions ( krolak @xcite ) and therefore they do not exert infinite tidal forces that might destroy extended bodies going through them . in this sense \n , they can not be considered the final fate of a universe , since they can be avoided by some observers .    concerning the big rip , another issue unveiled by the survey of causal geodesics in flrw models with an effective equation of state @xmath21 \n , @xmath22 for late times is that lightlike geodesics need infinite proper time before meeting the big rip . \n that is , only massive objects see the big rip . in this sense , since photons do not reach this event , we could say that big rip may be considered quite an intimate experience  with lights turned out ! since dark energy models with @xmath23 just below minus one have been shown to be compatible with observations , this features can not be neglected as mathematical curiosities . \n the issue of singularities located at infinite time coordinate is not as pointless as it may seem at first glance . \n the example of photons close to a big rip shows us that a finite coordinate time lapse can be experienced as an infinite proper time lapse , in this case by massless particles . \n the relation between proper time and coordinate time is far from trivial . \n first , we have to determine when causal geodesics reach infinite coordinate time in finite proper time .    for lightlike geodesics we may integrate the geodesic equation ( [ geods1 ] ) , @xmath24 in order to attain a necessary and sufficient condition for reaching infinite coordinate time in finite proper time : integrability of the scale factor @xmath12 , @xmath25 for sufficiently large @xmath26 . \n the same condition is valid for radial timelike geodesics . on the contrary , fluid worldlines with @xmath10 \n are not to be considered since for them proper time is essentially coordinate time .    for a start \n , we may consider models which behave for large @xmath26 as a power - law model @xmath27 . \n for them the geodesic equation ( [ geods1 ] ) yields @xmath28 and obviously infinite @xmath26 is reached for finite @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 . \n this is not however the interesting case , since it involves models starting with a big rip at @xmath31 . \n but if we consider models starting at @xmath32 and ending up at a big rip at @xmath31 the same reasoning is valid \n . the origin of radial causal geodesics would be at a finite proper time .    at this point , \n two possibilities arise in order to explain the finite origin of causal geodesics in phantom models : there is either a singularity at @xmath32 which explains the abrupt startpoint of these geodesics instead of ranging from and infinite proper time or the flrw coordinate patch does not cover the whole universe and we need to enlarge it . \n this is done , for instance , with de sitter universes in the parametrization which is used for inflation , @xmath2 , @xmath33 , which fulfills condition ( [ conda ] ) and therefore its radial geodesics reach @xmath32 in finite proper time . however , in this case it is possible to extend the spacetime to a larger one , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with another change of coordinates ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) and hence the singularity at @xmath32 is only apparent and due to a bad choice of coordinates . \n this option appears to be the correct for other universes since at @xmath32 all curvature scalars vanish as @xmath36 for power - law models \n .    however if we reckon ricci tensor components along radial lightlike geodesics , unexpected features arise , @xmath37 since the first term diverges at @xmath32 for @xmath30 regardless of the value of @xmath38 . \n the same happens for radial timelike geodesics . \n this unexpected result could only be avoided in models for which the curvature term cancels the first term , @xmath39 . \n but curiously the solutions of this equation are well known universes .    for @xmath2 \n we recover the aforementioned parametrization of de sitter universe , @xmath33 . \n for @xmath34 we find another parametrization of de sitter universe , @xmath40 . and for @xmath41 , also another parametrization of de sitter spacetime arises , @xmath42 but also anti - de sitter spacetime , @xmath43 , but for a choice of time coordinate origin . \n since only the one with @xmath2 decreases at @xmath44 , they do not affect our results . \n therefore we are led to conclude that universes which asymptotically behave as power - law models with @xmath30 , @xmath22 , in spite of having vanishing curvature scalars at @xmath32 , they possess there a sort of directional singularity that affects only radial geodesics , a p.p . curvature singularity ( curvature singularity along a parallelly transported basis ) ( hawking and ellis @xcite ) . \n furthermore , this singularity is strong ( tipler @xcite , krlak @xcite ) and therefore can not be overlooked . \n radial observers would start their trajectories at a singularity at @xmath32 and would end up at a big rip at @xmath31 , though their life span would be finite , as we have shown . \n photons would start their paths at the singularity at @xmath32 but they would never reach the big rip in these models .    summarizing these results and extending the conclusions to non - asymptotically power - law models , \n we have :    * for scale factors growing or decreasing as @xmath45 or slower , radial causal geodesics reach @xmath32 in infinite proper time . * for scale factors decreasing faster than @xmath45 , radial causal geodesics reach @xmath32 in finite proper time , meeting a strong curvature singularity , except for de sitter spacetime .    cases with an ill - defined limit at @xmath32 may be handled directly with condition ( [ conda ] ) . \n the features which have been shown about the past of phantom models might seem useless since dark energy is a relevant component only for the future of the universe from coincidence time on in order to explain accelerated expansion , not for the past . \n nonetheless there are implications for the models . \n for instance , we may use our results to reckon the duration of a universe filled with a power - law phantom field as measured by an observer following a radial geodesic ( [ geods1 ] ) , @xmath46 which is finite again for @xmath30 . \n but most surprising is that this quantity can be made as small as wanted by increasing the total linear momentum @xmath7 of the traveller . \n it may be argued that this calculation is useless since we can not extend the validity of the phantom model towards the past , but this does not invalidates the result . \n we may calculate the time span measured by the observer from coincidence time to the big rip and reach the same conclusion : observers may reduce the life of the universe by increasing their linear momentum . \n we have always known that driving fast could be dangerous , but not to this extent ! since a negative exponent @xmath47 is necessary in ( [ p ] ) for this result , it is clear that this behaviour is exclusive of phantom models with @xmath0 for large times , that is , below the phantom divide . \n so far we have shown that phantom fields produce not only a big rip but a directional singularity in the past , that massless particles do not experience a big rip and that the duration of the universe may be shortened _ ad libitum _ by increasing the linear momentum of the observer . \n there are other exotic features inherent to phantom models ( fernndez - jambrina @xcite ) , especially of those which are closer to the phantom divide , but these should be enough to show the unexpected behaviour that one encounters on trying to model dark energy with phantom fields . \n this work is supported by the spanish ministry of education and science research grant fis-2005 -

[ \n fig : deuterium ] and [ fig : li7 ] ) . \n our most important result is apparent : the uncertainty estimate from our method is a factor of two smaller than the skm estimate . \n not only have we reduced the theoretical error estimate , but we have also put it on a firmer footing . \n our `` most probable '' yields also differ slightly ( less than @xmath30 ) from the corresponding results of skm . \n this reflects both differences in weighting the nuclear data , and the inclusion of new data . \n we computed `` sensitivity functions '' for the yields of d and @xmath1li for each reaction . \n these functions measure the fractional changes in yield caused by a delta - function change in cross section at a given reaction energy ( see fig . \n [ fig : he3ag ] and table [ table1 ] ) . \n the sensitivity functions quantify where precise cross section measurements are required . \n we have reduced the theoretical error estimate for bbn deuterium production by a factor of two , so that the deuterium abundance itself dominates the uncertainty in baryon density . \n the deuterium determination of the baryon density is thus sharpened , from 8% to 6% ( at @xmath30 ) , or @xmath4 ( 95% cl ) . in the next five years \n , the precision of the primeval deuterium measurement should improve significantly , because the sloan digital sky survey will increase the number of qsos with measured redshifts by a factor of almost 100 , with a similar increase in the number of deuterium systems expected . \n further improvement in the theoretical prediction is possible ; the key reactions in this regard are : d(p,@xmath31)@xmath0he ; d(d , p)@xmath0h above 100kev ; d(d , n)@xmath0he above 100kev ; and p(n,@xmath31)d at 30130kev ( see fig .  [ \n fig : deuterium ] ) . turning \n the deuterium determination of the baryon density into a few percent measurement will make possible a beautiful consistency test @xcite : comparison with a similarly accurate measurement of the baryon density from cbr anisotropy . \n the deuterium - inferred baryon density leads to a prediction for the big - bang @xmath5he abundance : @xmath32 ( all 95% cl ) . when the primeval @xmath5he abundance is determined to three significant figures \n , this will be a powerful consistency test . at the moment , systematic effects dominate the error budget ; in particular , underlying stellar absorption in the most metal - poor hii regions . izotov and thuan s sample @xcite excludes the tainted or suspected - to - be tainted systems , and they find @xmath33 . \n this is consistent with the deuterium prediction . \n a less homogeneous sample @xcite , which includes some of the tainted systems , indicates a lower value , @xmath34 , which is not consistent with the deuterium prediction . \n additional light particle species present around the time of bbn lead to increased @xmath5he production , and an upper limit to the primeval @xmath5he abundance can be used to constrain their existence @xcite . using @xmath33 , the deuterium - determined baryon density , and the prior @xmath35 \n , we derive the 95% cl limit , @xmath36 . \n one should be mindful that systematic error in @xmath37 could change the limit , and that it will become more secure with better @xmath5he measurements . \n finally , we turn to @xmath1li , the light element for which the uncertainty in the predicted abundance is largest . \n our analysis has reduced the theoretical uncertainty by a factor of two , though a small systematic uncertainty remains . using our full monte carlo with the deuterium observations , we predict ( @xmath1li / h)@xmath38 \\times 10^{-10}$ ] . \n the abundance derived from old , pop ii halo stars is ( @xmath1li / h)@xmath39\\times 10^{-10 } = ( 1.73\\pm 0.3)\\times 10^{-10}$ ] @xcite ( all at 95% cl ) . \n the discrepancy could represent a real inconsistency or merely a depletion of @xmath1li by a factor of around two in these stars ( predicted by some models of stellar evolution @xcite ) . a nuclear solution for the discrepancy is unlikely \n a @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) change in the @xmath42d rate would be required , and the unresolved systematics of @xmath26 can only make the problem worse . \n there is still much room to improve the bbn @xmath1li prediction ; the key reactions are : @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ; and @xmath46 . \n perhaps the most rewarding result of this work is that we have verified what david schramm many times proclaimed , `` the predictions of bbn are very robust because the key cross section are measured at the energies where they are needed . '' \n in particular , if all eleven critical cross sections were set to zero outside the intervals where they are measured , the final light - element abundances would change by less than 10% of their current theoretical uncertainty .                                      g.  m. hale , d. dodder , e. siciliano , and w. wilson , los alamos national laboratory , endf / b - vi evaluation , mat # 125 , rev . \n 2 , oct . 1997 ; retrieved from the endf database at the nndc online data service .", "StartTimeOffset": 1904015591308, "RequestID": "8538d60901574299b4abd6a75f157918", "TotalTokens": 3496}

not gate between neighboring qubits . \n the possibilities avoiding switching of interaction between qubits have been investigated in refs . \n @xcite . in ref . \n @xcite it has been considered architecture of the qc showing that the heisenberg interaction can be effectively negated by inserting epr spin pairs ( in singlet state ) between the information carrying qubits . in ref . \n @xcite it has also been considered architecture of the qc with ising interaction . with the encoded qubits ( two physical qubits ) ising interaction can also be negated . in ref . \n @xcite it has been shown that one can perform quantum computation in a one dimensional heisenberg chain in which the interactions are always on , provided that one can abruptly tune the zeeman energies of the individual qubits . \n other schemes avoiding problems of perpetual coupling exist too . \n for instance , in ref . \n @xcite authors describe an architecture of qc based on a processing core where multiple qubits interact perpetually , and a separate ` store ' where qubits exist in isolation . \n the obstacles connected with implementation of single and two bit gates with permanent interaction between qubits are also overcome in the proposal of qc , which is known as one way quantum computer  @xcite . here \n one can implement a quantum computer on a lattice of qubits with only single bit measurements on a cluster states @xcite , which are created with the controllable ising interaction .    in this work we consider the model of quantum computer , which is represented as a ising spin lattice where qubits ( spin - half systems ) are separated by the isolators ( two spin - half systems ) . \n this architecture is analogous to one considered in ref . \n @xcite for off diagonal interactions between qubits where it was proposed to implement a virtual switch by carrying out the steps of the quantum computation in and out of designed interaction free subspaces . \n in contrast to ref . \n @xcite the architecture considered in the present paper is based on the ising type interaction and it is not required turning on and off couplings between isolators . hence , this scheme allows to compute without switching the couplings and simplifies the operation of qc compared to one dimensional ising spin chain qc @xcite . \n the paper is organized as follows . \n the ising spin quantum computer model is described in sec . \n ii . the realization of the universal gates are considered in sec . \n iii . in sec . \n iv we summarize our results . \n architecture of the quantum computer with the ising spin lattice is shown in fig . \n 1 . it is assumed that information carrying qubits are situated in the middle chain and do not directly interact . \n qubits in the upper and lower chains play the rule of isolators . \n we assume that in the idle mode or at the single bit operations the spins of isolators are oppositely directed . in this case for two neighboring qubits of middle chain , the total ising interaction is vanished for arbitrary states of qubits . \n this can be achieved at the initialization of the system by two ways . \n firstly , if one applies a strong global field in the @xmath2 direction to all qubits , at low temperatures all spins will line up with the field \n . then one should flip the states of the qubits situated at either above or below chains . \n secondly , one can assume that the global fields are inverted for the upper and lower spin chains . \n hence , if larmor frequencies of qubits are much greater than ising interaction constant , then ground state of our model will coincide with the desired initial state of qc . \n then for the initialization of the qc one should just cool the system . \n note , that this architecture is also relevant to a system with the heisenberg interaction . \n as is known , if the frequency difference between the neighboring spins is much greater than the spin - spin interaction , then the heisenberg interaction tends to an effective ising form @xcite . in this case \n the main technical challenge is the creation of a large gradient of the magnetic field and the decoherence caused by the sources of the magnetic field . \n the latest development of the micropattern wires technique provides the magnetic field gradients @xmath3 @xcite and opens new possibilities for realization of ising spin qc . \n the hamiltonian for the ising spin lattice ( fig . \n 1 ) placed in an external nonuniform magnetic field can be represented as@xmath4@xmath5    here @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the operator of the @xmath2 component of @xmath8th spin ( @xmath9 ) with larmor frequency @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the interaction constant between qubits and isolators , and @xmath12 is the interaction constant between isolators . to distinguish the isolators from the information carrying qubits we additionally label these qubits via subscripts @xmath13  ( upper qubits ) and @xmath14  ( lower qubits ) . \n the initial wave function of the qc can be represented as@xmath15with the energy@xmath16 . \n \\label{energy}\\ ] ]    we assume that single bit gates are easy and fast to implement either by individual addressing of single qubits or by selective electromagnetic pulses whose frequencies are close ( resonant transition ) to the larmor frequencies of the desired qubits . for the latter case \n it has been assumed nonuniform magnetic field in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . \n since qubits are not coupled to each other , fully parallel operations are possible . \n in contrast to one dimensional ising chain @xcite in the considering model there is no need of complicated protocols for correcting the phase and probability errors due to permanent interaction between the qubits . as we will see below two qubit universal gate between neighboring qubits \n can be realized simply operating on the isolators . \n in this section we describe the protocols for the two qubit universal gates . for this purpose \n it is sufficient to consider one elementary cell , with two qubits and isolators . \n the hamiltonian of elementary cell in the external _ rf _ field can be represented as@xmath17@xmath18 + s_{a}^{+}\\exp \\left [ i\\omega _ { a}t\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{hceel}\\]]where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the frequency of the pulse , and @xmath21 is the rabi frequency . \n we assume that the initial state is@xmath22@xmath23 is the possible overall phase .    under the condition @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) the pulse effectively affects only above located spin ( resonant transition ) . \n in this case , evolution of the wave function ( [ iwf ] ) is confined within subspace ( 8 dimensional ) of the entire hilbert space of four qubits and can be written in the form ( in the interaction picture)@xmath26@xmath27\\]]@xmath28@xmath29 ,   \\label{wf}\\]]where @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are probability amplitudes of the states with energies:@xmath33@xmath34@xmath35@xmath36@xmath37from the schrdinger equation@xmath38one can obtain the equations for the probability amplitudes @xmath30 and @xmath39 . \n system of coupled differential equations for the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 splits into four independent groups . \n each group consists of two equations of the form@xmath40@xmath41the detunings in eq . \n ( [ eqc ] ) are @xmath42@xmath43assuming rectangular _ rf _ pulse , for the initial conditions@xmath44the solution of eq . \n ( [ eqc ] ) is@xmath45@xmath46where @xmath47 is the pulse duration and @xmath48 .    for the realization of controlled phase gate ( [ cphase ] ) we will consider two cases , depending on the magnitude of spin -

experiment . \n these results provide additional tests to qcd inspired models of fragmentation such as pythia @xcite or the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) @xcite , beyond the usual comparisons to charged hadron momentum distributions . \n furthermore , predictions for the modification of jet chemistry in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p have been made @xcite . \n these

in jets to inclusive spectrum measurements may help elucidate the contributions from hard processes to those measurements as a function of @xmath7 . \n the data presented are from @xmath8 8 million jet - patch triggered p+p @xmath9 gev events recorded in 2006 by the star experiment . \n the jet - patch trigger is designed to select events with jets , and thus requires energies above 8 gev to be

calorimeter , bemc , is used for neutral particles . \n three jet finders are employed from the fast - jet package @xcite : @xmath11 , anti-@xmath11 and sis . \n we select recoil jets with respect to the triggered jets to measure fragmentation functions . \n this is because the triggered jets have a bias towards the neutral jet component . \n the jets are found within a resolution parameter , r @xmath12 and a jet axis @xmath13 cut @xmath14 to ensure the jet area lies within the tpc / bemc acceptance . \n the resolution parameter can be thought of as an effective jet radius in the @xmath15 plane . \n the minimum @xmath7 cut for a charged particle is 200 mev / c , while the minimum calorimeter tower energy is 200 mev . \n towers which match charged particles are removed from the jet to avoid over counting of electrons and minimum ionising particles ( mips ) . \n no corrections are applied to the jet energy scale which means the reconstructed jet @xmath16 is likely to be less than the actual jet @xmath7 due to tpc / bemc detection inefficiencies , and missing neutral energy principally from undetected @xmath17 and @xmath18 particles . \n studies are underway to determine a correction for this . \n finally , in order to measure the momentum distributions of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 particles , v0s are identified within the jet area from tpc tracks . \n the invariant mass distributions are calculated to extract the yields of these particles via their dominant decay channels : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in conjunction with a minimum @xmath16 cut of 1 gev / c \n , a series of topological cuts are placed on the v0s to minimise the relative background contribution , and ensure the signal to background ratios are approximately the same for each particle . \n the residual background after all cuts is not yet removed from the fragment yields . \n strange particle momentum distributions as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath16 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . \n the momentum distribution is expressed in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the reconstructed jet and fragment @xmath7 respectively . for a particular particle species

different jet finders . \n a data point is the mid point value between the lowest and highest values the three jet finders give . \n the measured v0 yields are not yet corrected for acceptance and tpc tracking inefficiencies . \n the pythia predictions are obtained by processing pythia events with star s detector simulation , and running the track , jet , and v0 reconstruction software on the simulated output in the same way as the real data . \n this ensures the pythia events are subject to the same acceptance restrictions / detector inefficiencies as the real data . \n all pythia predictions shown in these proceedings are from version 6.4 with tune a. we find that pythia gives a reasonable description of the @xmath3 data . \n jetset ( the jet production scheme in pythia ) has also been shown to describe @xmath29 fragmentation functions in @xmath30 collisions well , where the jet energies range @xmath31 gev @xcite . \n furthermore , pythia has been shown to describe charged hadron momentum distributions in p+p collisions at the same center of mass energy @xcite . on the other hand , we note that the pythia description of @xmath1 and @xmath2 momentum distributions are less satisfactory . \n although the predictions appear to predict the correct yield over all @xmath28 , they tend to over predict the yields at low @xmath28 and under predict the yields at intermediate @xmath28 . whether this is due to a mismatch in the reconstruction of pythia events and real data , or due to physics , \n is under investigation .    in figure [ fig2 ] , \n we show ratios of integrated yields @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 gev / c as a function of reconstructed jet @xmath16 . \n the analysis shows the @xmath32 ratio is below 1 showing the baryon asymmetry in the colliding system ( p+p ) is transferred to jets over all jet energies measured . \n we also find the @xmath32 ratio is consistent with the value obtained from inclusive spectra measurements @xcite . \n pythia also seems to reproduce the magnitude of the ratio . \n the jaggedness of the predictions is due statistical fluctuations which are @xmath35 and not shown . regarding the @xmath33 ratios in jets , these are higher than values from inclusive spectrum measurements over all @xmath7 . \n the inclusive spectrum measurement will be dominated by production below 1 gev / c . \n when we compare the ratios in jets to the inclusive spectrum measurement above 1 gev / c , we find they are generally consistent . \n this may mean that @xmath19 and @xmath21 spectrum measurements with @xmath34 gev / c have a dominant contribution from hard processes i.e. jet production . \n however , measurements of the same ratio from the underlying event are needed to further qualify this observation . \n we also find pythia again reproduces the magnitude of the ratio .    in figure [ fig3 ] \n , we show the position of the maximum of the @xmath28 distribution , @xmath36 , for the various particles as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath7 . \n since the @xmath7 dependent tracking inefficiency / acceptance will distort the shape of the @xmath28 distribution , we correct the distributions using embedding which determines the v0 reconstruction efficiency . \n a gaussian is fitted in the peak region to extract @xmath36 . \n the fit range is chosen to avoid the region in @xmath28 affected by the minimum @xmath16 cut on the fragments . \n in the mlla scheme , the position of the maximum can be described by the following relation @xcite ; @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath39 is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the jet opening angle , and @xmath42 is the effective transverse momentum ( relative to the jet axis ) where a parton ceases to branch in the parton shower . \n mlla predictions for momentum distributions of hadrons with mass @xmath43 typically assume @xmath44 @xcite . \n equation [ equ : mlla1 ] then implies a scaling behaviour of @xmath36 with the mass of the hadron i.e. @xmath36 should decrease for the higher mass hadrons . \n the value of @xmath36 should also increase with jet energy for a given hadron which is observed in figure [ fig3 ] for all particles . \n however , we find that @xmath45 which is contrary to the expected scaling . on the other hand , @xmath46 and @xmath47 which is consistent with such a scaling assuming pions dominate particle production in jets . \n a similar observation was made for @xmath48 fragmentation functions for similar jet energies in @xmath30 collisions @xcite . finally , we note in interest that if we extract the mode of the transverse rapidity , @xmath49 , distribution ( motivated by this study @xcite ) , we find a mass scaling in @xmath49 space i.e @xmath50 for a given reconstructed jet @xmath7 bin . for a given particle species , \n we also find @xmath51 increases with jet energy .    in figure [ fig4 ] \n we show the momentum distributions of _ non - leading _ charged hadrons for the cases where the leading particle is a charged hadron , @xmath19 , or @xmath21 . \n we want to investigate whether tagging jets according to the species of the leading hadron , preferentially selects on gluon or quark jets . \n both measured data @xcite and theoretical predictions show hadron multiplicities are larger in gluon jets compared to quark jets : mlla gives the ratio 9/4 for gluon / quark jet multiplicities . \n thus , if tagging jets with particle a preferentially selected gluon jets , and tagging jets with particle b preferentially selected quark jets , we would expect the jets associated with particle a to have more non - leading charged hadrons compared to jets associated with particle b. however , in figure [ fig4 ] we observe at given jet energy , the charged hadron multiplicities are the same for each of the tagged jets . \n this might be expected for the highest jet @xmath16 bin where jet production is expected to be dominated by hard scattering of valance quarks , however at lower jet energies there should be mixture of quark and gluon jets @xcite . \n therefore , our observation suggests quark / gluon jets can not be tagged in this way . \n further studies are underway to confirm this . \n in summary , we have shown measurements of strange particle momentum distributions . we have found that pythia describes the @xmath21 momentum distributions well , however we observe some deviations for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 data . \n we have found that @xmath32 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets are consistent with values obtained from inclusive spectra . \n @xmath52 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets were found to be similar to values obtained from inclusive spectra in the same @xmath16 range . \n this may suggest that @xmath53 and @xmath21 production above 1 gev / c is dominated by hard processes in p+p @xmath9 gev collisions . \n we investigated a mass scaling of the peak position of @xmath28 ( inferred from mlla ) , and found although @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath45 . \n finally , we have found tagging jets with leading strange baryons / mesons may not preferentially select on quark / gluon jets . \n 10

{"ContextTokens": 3106, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , there was a great increase of interest in the study of the physics beyond the standard model , in particularly in the study of the supersymmetric grand unification theories ( susy guts ) . \n this interest was in particular stimulated by the new data due to lep1 and lep1.5 experiments . \n if one believes literally in all this data , especially in the @xmath1 measurements , one comes to the conclusion that neither the standard model ( sm ) nor the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are sufficient to explain the experimental results @xcite . \n one naturally has to turn to the other models . \n one of the most popular directions in the search for the new physics is the study of susy guts . \n unfortunately , one immediately encounters the problem of how to break supersymmetry ( susy ) . \n the most popular way is to use a hidden sector through which susy breaking is transferred to the visible world by means of supergravity ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) . \n recently a new approach to break susy was developed@xcite . in this approach susy \n is broken dynamically and the effects of susy breaking are transferred from hidden sector to the visible world by means of gauge interactions . \n the natural question is whether one can use this mechanism to construct realistic susy gut theories @xcite . \n there are several tools one can use at present to decide whether the gut theory is realistic or not . \n one of the most powerful among them is the experimental limit on the proton lifetime . \n it was shown in ref.@xcite that simple extension of mimimal su(5 ) susy gut with the mechanism of dynamical susy breaking due to refs . \n @xcite leads to the too small lifetime of proton . \n consequently , this model is ruled out . \n the purpose of this note is to return once again to the analysis of the proton lifetime in the minimal su(5 ) susy gut with dynamical supersymmetry breaking due to dine and nelson , and to include the yukawa couplings in the analysis of ref . \n we study the influence of yukawa couplings , both of the 3rd generation and of the hiden sector , on the proton lifetime and masses of the color triplet higgs boson @xmath2 . \n we shall see that the inclusion of yukawa couplings increases the proton lifetime but not significantly . \n however , the model can not be ruled out at @xmath3 level . \n the model is not ruled out in a small window at small @xmath4 if one takes into account the uncertainties in the lep data for @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 qed and weak coupling constants at @xmath8 scale . \n the note is organised in the following way : first we use renormalization group ( rg ) equations for gauge couplings taking yukawa couplings into account . \n we then find the masses of color triplet bosons @xmath2 , depending on @xmath9 ( qcd coupling ) for different values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 . \n we then use the formula for proton lifetime from ref.@xcite to find the proton lifetime for different allowed by lep data values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath9 . \n our final results are depicted in figs.1 - 6 , thus giving the bounds on the possibility of using mechanism of refs.@xcite to break susy in su(5 ) gut model . \n let us briefly describe the model we are going to study ( we refer to the reader to refs.@xcite for details ) . \n the model is the mimimal su(5 ) susy gut plus the messenger superpotential @xmath12 here l and d , that carry quantum numbers of sm gauge groups and form together into @xmath13 of su(5 ) , are the messenger lepton and quark chiral superfields added to the model . \n s is a scalar chiral superfield singlet under the sm gauge groups . \n s transfers the supersymmetry breaking from hidden sector to the fields of the standard model . at the messenger scale @xmath14 tev \n the singlet s and its f - component get vacuum expectation values and susy breaks down . \n the heavy superfields l and d transfer the information of susy breaking to the fields of sm through their couplings to the sm gauge groups . \n the analysis of proton decays in this note is similiar to the work by carone and murayama@xcite . \n however , these authors did not take into account the influence of the yukawa couplings on the evolution of gauge couplings . \n we use below the rg equations for yukawa couplings that can be derived using ref.@xcite . \n first , we evolute the rg equaions from @xmath8 to @xmath15 using the sm @xmath16-functions and then from @xmath15 to @xmath17 ( taken as 100tev ) using the mssm ones . above @xmath17 we take into account the effects of the messenger fields : @xmath18 the evolution of yukawa couplings themselves are taken into account in one loop approximation and are carried out using the following rg equations ( for scales larger than @xmath17 ) : @xmath19 our notations are self - evident : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are yukawa couplings of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 to the corresponding higgs doublets in the miminal su(5 ) susy model . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the messenger yukawa coupling constants to the singlet s. we proceed then in the same way as in ref . \n we use the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 to determine the gut scale @xmath26 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 unify into @xmath27 , and then get the mismatch between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which should be attributed to the gut threshold effects , that are assumed to originate from the color triplet @xmath30 . \n we get the mass of the color - triplet higgs @xmath31 from its dependence on the threshold effects ( the detailed formulae can be found in @xcite ) . \n once @xmath31 is determined , we use the standard formulae for the proton lifetime(see ref . \n @xcite ) to find the partial width and to compare them with the current experimental bounds .    in our numerical evolution , we use the following boundary conditions . \n first , we made a standard choice of the masses of @xmath32-quark , @xmath0-lepton and the top - quark as : @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev . \n we do not depict uncertainties in these boundary conditions due to masses , since their influence on the results is not large . \n for the messenger yukawa couplings we take the largest possible values : @xmath36 if we choose the boundary conditions to be given by eq . \n ( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 unify into a common value at the gut scale . \n if inputs larger than those in ( [ 7 ] ) is taken , the messenger yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale . \n the boundary conditions for gauge couplings are determined from lep data@xcite : @xmath37 for the qcd coupling we use @xmath38 @xcite  the number that incorporates both low energy data and lep1 data . \n all the gauge couplings are taken within @xmath3 variations in our estimations . \n our main results are depicted in figs . 1 - 6 . \n first , we depict the mass of the color - triplet , @xmath31 , as a function of @xmath9 for different @xmath4 . \n these results are depicted in fig . 1 - 3 for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n we take the lowest bound of @xmath4 as 0.85 . below this \n bound the yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale . \n this lowest bound can be achieved only when the yukawa couplings are included in the rg analyses . \n we see that for reasonable values of @xmath4 , yukawa couplings of messenger quarks and leptons actually do not influence @xmath31 greatly . \n however , when we consider the different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 within @xmath3 variations , we see that @xmath31 can change quite significantly as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n the most favored @xmath31 is gained when @xmath5 is taken at its upper bound while @xmath6 the lower one . \n next , we consider the decay rate of a typical process @xmath39 . this mode was argued in ref . \n @xcite to be the most appropriate one in analysing proton decay bound in susy gut . \n the results are shown in figs . \n we see that the allowed region of @xmath40 and @xmath4 depends on the inputs @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n inclusion of the usual yukawa couplings in rg equations improves the situation with the proton lifetime . on the other hand , inclusion of the messenger yukawa couplings \n even worses the situation slightly . as the current experimental bound@xcite of proton decay lifetime \n is concerned , the only window where the model survives is the region of small @xmath4 combined with large @xmath5 and small @xmath6 as input . \n our general conclusions are that , first , the inclusion of yukawa couplings does not lead to significant changes in the mass of color triplet and the allowed parameter space for the model we consider . \n second , the allowed parameter space , color triplet mass and proton lifetime seem to be quite sensitive to exact values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath41 scale . \n the authors thank m. shifman for useful discussion . \n 99 j. hewett , talk at workshop on heavy flavors , technion , december 1995 . \n j. ellis , invited talk at lp95 : international symposium on lepton photon interactions ( ihep ) , beijing , p.r . \n china , 10 -

{"ContextTokens": 3474, "GeneratedTokens": 81, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most serious challenges in the hunt for transiting extrasolar planets is the removal of the various systematics remaining in the photometric databases even after employing sophisticated methods of ccd image reduction . sometimes called as `` red noise '' \n @xcite , systematics / trends may show up in many ways . \n their most common appearance is a drift with @xmath0  d@xmath1 frequency due to variations of the point - spread function and numerous other parameters , for example focus change , sub - pixel coordinate drifts , etc . \n in addition to these most trivial systematics , we may have many others , from transients ( e.g. , imperfect removal of cosmic rays ) to periodic saturation of bright stars , depending on moon phase . during the past several years \n it has been realized that , except for the simple , high signal - to - noise ratio cases , filtering out these systematics from the databases is absolutely crucial from the point of view of transit search . \n therefore , efforts have been taken to devise post processing algorithms that are capable of whitening out the data from the systematics . \n there are two methods in this field that attracted wider interest . \n the method sysrem by @xcite uses basically an iterative principal component analysis to filter out the most prominent systematics from the data . the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ) by @xcite is a least - squares method that is capable of filtering out nearly arbitrary systematics , assuming that the selected set of templates is `` flavorous '' enough , i.e. , it contains the light curves necessary for the approximation of the type of trend observed in the target . \n here we present tests on the signal recovery capability of tfa . \n for completeness , we briefly summarize the basic steps of tfa . \n first we select a _ \n template set _ of @xmath2 light curves from the photometric database of the field of interest . from these \\{@xmath3 } time series ( sampled in @xmath4 moments of time ) \n , we construct the following filter : @xmath5 the coefficients \\{@xmath6 } for a target \\{@xmath7 } are determined by minimizing the following expression : @xmath8 ^ 2 \\hskip 2 mm .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the function @xmath9 is derived in the following way : @xmath10[r]{(3)}\\ ] ] namely , in the case of period search we assume that the observed signal is dominated by systematics and noise , and therefore , the filter is expected to yield minimum dispersion around the constant signal average @xmath11 . \n once the signal is identified , we can recover its shape by iteratively approximating the noiseless and trend - free signal \\{@xmath9}. ( the iteration is indicated by the symbol @xmath12 in eq .  ( 3 ) . ) in this iterative process we assume that \\{@xmath9 } can be represented by a low - parameter model , and that the observed signal minus the systematics yield the true signal with white noise . \n the datasets used in this paper are listed in table  1 . \n we test transit detection efficiency ( tde ) , false alarm probability ( fap ) and signal reconstruction capability ( src ) . \n for testing src on datasets different from those of hatnet @xcite , we use the hat - p-1 @xcite observations by the 60/90/180 cm schmidt telescope of the konkoly observatory .    to show that tfa is capable of filtering out nearly all systematics , we compute the distribution function of the peak frequencies obtained by the bls analysis @xcite . the result of this analysis for field # 125 \n is shown in fig .  1 . \n we see that the original data includes many stars with various periodic systematics , some of which are not too easy to relate to the daily change of the observational conditions . for example , the strongest peak at @xmath13  d@xmath1 is most probably associated with the saturation of the bright stars , because after omitting the first @xmath14 stars , the peak at this frequency becomes less prominent than the ones corresponding to other systematics . \n lrrrrl set & @xmath4 & @xmath15 & @xmath16[d ] & i [ mag ] & purpose + hatnet # 125 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & tde , fap + hatnet # 127 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & fap + hatnet # 148 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & src + hat -

of - transit variation . \n when computing dsp , we always use the tfa code in the signal reconstruction mode to get a better estimate on this parameter . \n properties of the injected signal and the number of detections are listed in table  2 . \n we note that the synthetic signal has a flat out - of - transit part and a trapeze shape with rather long ingress / egress durations . \n the condition of detection is given by a cutoff imposed on dsp . \n the value of this cutoff is large enough to eliminate false alarms ( see sect .  4 ) . \n we see that there is a highly significant increase in the detection probability due to the application of tfa . \n this increase is especially striking when the top 500 bright stars are tested . \n these are the ones that are most seriously affected by systematics related to saturation effects ( see above ) . \n we note that the detection ratio can be slightly increased ( from @xmath34% to @xmath35% ) if we choose templates only from this brighter set of stars . \n crrc tfa & @xmath15 & @xmath36 & @xmath36[% ] + 0 & @xmath33 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + 1 & @xmath33 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + 0 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + 1 & @xmath41 & @xmath44 & @xmath34 + \n by `` false alarms '' we mean those cases when the detection statistics indicate the presence of a signal , but the probability distribution of the statistics ( derived on pure noise ) shows that the observed value may also occur due to a random event and the probability of this to happen is `` greater than we would like to '' . in assessing fap we resort to direct statistical tests , in which we generate pure gaussian time series on the time base of the observed light curves . \n we analyze these artificial time series and count the number of cases when dsp exceeds a prescribed limit . in this way we get estimates on faps for a given dataset when \n tfa and bls are used . \n the results of the tests are presented in table  3 . \n several conclusions can be drawn from this table . \n first of all , as expected , application of tfa introduces correlation in the time series . \n this increases fap by a substantial amount . \n second , larger number of data points results in a decrease of fap . \n third , larger number of templates leads to stronger correlation , and therefore , to an increase of fap . \n fourth , although increasing the number of data points decreases fap , it is present in a relative high value even for higher dsp cutoff values ( when we already expect a visible sign of the ( fake ) transit in the folded / binned light curve .    in an attempt to reduce fap , the following method is suggested . by using several tfa runs , corresponding to various template numbers , we compute dsp values for the given database . due to the way the template sets are constructed , \n these results are expected to be largely independent from each other . in a conservative approach of signal detection \n , we require the signal to be present in all these runs . in the primary selection of transit candidates we require only that the dip is negative ( i.e. , corresponding to dimming ) and that @xmath45 . \n the result of this multiple template fap filtering is shown in the lower three lines of table  3 . \n we see that the method is very effective already with three different tfa runs . for example , even for the sparsely sampled field # 127 , with three or more different tfa runs we can filter out false alarms with a probability better than 99.9% for signals with dsp@xmath46 . \n lrrrcrrr & & & + @xmath47  : & 5 & 6 & 7 & & 5 & 6 & 7 + @xmath48 & 68 & 7 & 0 & & 26 & 3 & 1 + a & 827 & 400 & 107 & & 258 & 24 & 2 + b & 856 & 523 & 168 & & 306 & 31 & 6 + c & 842 & 560 & 220 & & 394 & 42 & 3 + d & 890 & 638 & 328 & & 474 & 60 & 5 + ab & 386 & 112 & 9 & & 73 & 2 & 0 + abc & 184 & 38 & 1 & & 25 & 0 & 0 + abcd & 97 & 21 & 1 & & 14 & 0 & 0 + \n signal reconstruction is an essential ( but optional ) part of signal processing when tfa is used . \n this is because we do not know _ a priori _ which part of the observed signal comes from the systematics and which one from the true signal ( and all these are coupled with noise ) . without knowing the signal parameters _ a priori _ , we resort to an iterative scheme in reconstructing the true signal ( see also sect .  2 ) . \n our experiments on the hatnet database show that this reconstruction can be quite successful without making any assumption on the signal shape . \n once the signal shape is reliably identified , one can proceed by more specific assumptions , e.g. , by using trapeze transit shapes , and thereby further decreasing the number of parameters fitted . to illustrate the efficiency of the tfa reconstruction , we show two examples in fig .  2 .    ] , signal -

type analysis is made with the goal of reaching the theoretical white noise limit of signal detection . in the search for extrasolar transiting planets \n this issue becomes even more highlighted due to the delicacy of the detection . \n we have shown in this paper that tfa is capable of filtering out various systematics , thereby allowing the detection and a concomitant reconstruction of faint regular ( e.g. , simple- or multi - periodic ) signals . \n furthermore , by requiring multiple detections in time series filtered by various tfa templates , false alarm probability can be pushed down near to the white noise limit . \n support for program number hst -

{"ContextTokens": 1321, "GeneratedTokens": 149, "SynthesizedBody": "analyses of the faint carina dsph have revealed that it contains a variety of stellar populations ( e.g. ,  [ 4 ] ) , exhibiting prominent old ( @xmath111gyr ) and intermediate - age ( 56 and 3gyr ) populations . \n this implies that carina must have undergone several star forming ( sf ) episodes with at least three significant pulses . despite this wide spread in ages , \n its colour - magnitude diagram features a remarkably narrow rgb . \n the reason for that can be an age counteracting spread in metallicities , where metal rich , young stars have colours comparable to the older , more metal poor ones . \n such a possible age - metallicity degeneracy can be overcome if accurate and independent [ fe / h ] measurements are obtained so that the remaining parameter of age can be estimated from isochrones . \n moreover , the overall shape and spatial variations of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) itself contain valuable implications for analysing carina s unusual sf history . \n in the course of an eso large programme , we observed 1257 red giants covering five fields in carina out to the tidal radius . \n our observations were performed during 23 nights with the multi - object spectrograph flames at the vlt in low - resolution mode , centered at the near infrared cat . \n the data were reduced using the standard flames reduction pipline . since sky contamination from bright emission lines is strong in the cat region , we calculated an average sky - spectrum from 20 dedicated skyfibres , which then was carefully subtracted from the science spectra . typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios for our spectra lie between 25 and 150 pixel@xmath2 . \n after rejection of foreground stars and stars with too low a s / n , 487 radial velocity members were analysed . \n finally , metallicities were derived from the reduced equivalent width w@xmath3 ( [ 1],[5 ] ) . \n the resulting mdf for our 487 red giants is shown in the top panel of fig . \n 1 . it is peaked at an average [ fe / h ] of @xmath4dex , which is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic study of  [ 6 ] , who found a value of @xmath5dex . \n we find a dispersion of @xmath6=0.25dex and as fig . \n 1 implies , the full spread of [ fe / h ] is at least one dex . \n this suggests that the wide range in age is in fact counteracted by a wide spread in metallicity , which can explain carina s narrow rgb and confirms that a complex mixture of stellar populations as in carina does not necessarily contradict the rgb s narrowness . \n the different stellar populations in carina have also different spatial distributions , where , the intermediate age red clump stars are clearly concentrated towards the center compared to the old hb ( see [ 1 ] ) \n . thus we plot in fig .  1 ( bottom panel ) the error - weighted mdfs for three different regions along the galaxy s axes . \n while the curves for the central region and larger minor axis distances do not differ largely and also resemble those along the major axis , there is a shift of the mdf s peak towards the metal poor end by 0.2dex when concentrating on the outer , northwestern region ( lower axis distances ) . \n 1 also overplots a model curve from  [ 3 ] , showing the predicted mdf for carina . \n this model uses a sf efficiency of 0.1gyr@xmath2 and a galactic wind efficiency at the lower end of wind rates in dsphs . \n such a lower wind rate nicely explains the smooth decline of the observed mdf towards the metal rich end , as a higher wind rate would expel enriched gas more efficiently thus preventing the formation of this metal rich tail . \n secondly , the low sf rate is able to explain the metal poor peak of the mdf in terms of a moderate enrichment history . \n however , remaining caveats are the higher fraction of predicted extremely metal poor stars and the lower number of metal poor stars around [ fe / h]@xmath7 , which can be understood in the context of the low infall timescale of gas assumed in dsphs ( [ 3 ] ) . with our accurate [ fe / h ] measurements at hand we will in the next steps pursue the underlying age distribution and use the abundance ratios from our multi - object high - resolution spectroscopy to further unravel the mechanisms governing carina s evolutionary history .    . \n the bottom plot shows spatially separated mdfs in three different regions of carina , measured along the major and minor axes.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] . \n the bottom plot shows spatially separated mdfs in three different regions of carina , measured along the major and minor axes.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]      cole , a.a . \n , et al . , mnras , 347 , 367 harbeck , d. , et . \n 2001 , aj , 122 , 3092 lanfrachi , g. , & matteucci , f. 2004 , mnras , 351 , 1338 monelli , m. , et al . \n 2003 , aj , 126 , 218 rutledge , g.a . , \n hesser , j.e . , stetson , p.b . \n 1997 , pasp , 109 , 907 smecker -

{"ContextTokens": 3783, "GeneratedTokens": 92, "SynthesizedBody": "charles darwin explained the evolution of living organisms on the basis of the observation that only the species best adapted to their surroundings survive in a competitive environment . \n this idea , paraphrased as `` survival of the fittest '' , has since become the cornerstone of evolutionary theories . \n the idea has been refined over the years , and we now understand its genetic underpinnings . \n hereditary transmission of genetic information is not perfect , and occasional errors in dna replication produce mutations of living organisms . \n the mutated organism is in essentially the same environment as the original one , and both have to compete for the available resources . \n the resources are limited , and so the organism that can use them more efficiently obtains an edge over its competitors . \n the net result is that if the mutation improves the ability of the organism to survive , the mutated organism grows in number , otherwise it fades away . in this mechanism , \n the mutations are not conscious adaptations . \n they occur randomly  as a matter of fact most of them fail  but once in a while they modify the organism in the right manner and improve the chances of its survival . if the intermediate steps are glossed over , the outcome looks like a solution to the optimisation problem , with the organisms adapting to the selection pressures exerted by the environment . \n all this is fairly logical , and can be illustrated by many examples ( see for instance @xcite ) . \n my aim here is to quantify this mechanism using a simple evolutionary model . \n more specifically , i consider the situation where a number of species are dependent on a common physical resource , say food . \n ( this leaves out predator - prey conflicts where one species may become another s resource . ) \n when the resource is available in plenty , there is hardly any competition , and all species prosper . \n the rate of growth of a species is then proportional to its population , and so all populations grow exponentially . \n this typically happens in the early stage of evolution of a new species . \n no resource is unlimited , however , even if it is continuously regenerated ( e.g. food availability ultimately depends on sunlight ) . \n a time comes when competition for the resource is inevitable . in the later stage of evolution , therefore , one species can prosper only at the expense of another , and eventually populations stabilise .    such a situation can be described by a set of linear evolution equations . \n ( quad - ratic evolution equations are more appropriate in a predator - prey setting . ) \n let the index @xmath0 label a set of coexisting species in a given environment , and let @xmath1 denote their populations at time @xmath2 . \n then the discrete time evolution of the populations can be written as a matrix equation ( generically @xmath3 is not symmetric ) , @xmath4 the fact that the next generation populations must arise from the present generation ones , even in case of mutations , makes this equation homogeneous . \n the diagonal terms @xmath5 represent the individual rates of growth , while the off - diagonal terms @xmath6 represent interactions between species . as mentioned above , \n when the resource is available in plenty , the populations evolve according to : @xmath7 the interesting situation is the competitive stage , where the populations become interdependent due to mutual interactions and the nature of the interactions ( para - metrised by @xmath6 ) determines how they evolve . \n to analyse the competitive stage , let us choose normalisations such that a unit population of any species consumes the same amount of resource , and the total resource available at any time is one . \n then we have the conservation laws : @xmath8 the constraint on @xmath9 arises because the total population supported by a fixed resource is fixed . when applied to both sides of eq.(1 ) , it yields the constraint on @xmath10 as a consistency condition . \n the continuity of evolution in time implies that @xmath11 the matrix @xmath12 , describing the change in populations , clearly shows that what is gained by some species is lost by some others . \n obviously @xmath6 can take positive as well as negative values . as a matter of fact , \n situations of both positive and negative interactions occur routinely in biological systems ( e.g. catalysis and inhibition , symbiosis and parasitic behaviour , defence mechanisms and cancer , etc . ) . \n situations of this type , where there is no net gain or loss , have been formally called zero sum games . in the conventional form of zero sum games , a multitude of strategies \n are available to the players , and competition amongst the players leads them to choose a stable strategy . \n this stable strategy turns out to be a `` mini - max solution '' , i.e. each player chooses the strategy that maximises his minimum gain @xcite . \n no player can improve his performance by unilaterally departing from this stable strategy , and the explicit solution can be obtained by linear programming methods . \n the model described by eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) is somewhat different . \n first , in the evolutionary context , the strategies are not actively chosen but are created by random mutations . also competition for the resource \n is guaranteed , because mutations produce closely related species in the same environment . \n it is then of importance to study the dynamics of the system to understand how the incorrect strategies are eliminated and the correct ones are selected . \n that requires not just the evaluation of the stable solution but also the manner in which it is approached . \n second , the quantitative gains and losses of various species depend not only on the choice of strategy but also on their current populations . in a sense \n , the more populous species gets more chances to grab the resources , and that alters the final outcome of the competition . \n let us first look at the simpler situation when @xmath13 . \n eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) then describe stochastic evolution of probability distributions , which has been extensively studied ( see for instance @xcite ) . the linear evolution is a markov chain , which in the generic case is ergodic and converges to a unique stationary distribution . \n ( if the matrix @xmath3 has a block - diagonal structure , then each block can be studied independently . ) to see this , consider the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath14 as @xmath15 . at every iteration \n , @xmath16 is the weighted average of @xmath17 @xmath18 with weights @xmath19 . \n the process of repeated averaging converges to the fixed point , @xmath20 with all rows identical , @xmath21 has only one non - vanishing eigenvalue , equal to one . \n it follows that @xmath3 has the leading eigenvalue @xmath22 corresponding to the stationary distribution , and remaining eigenvalues @xmath23 corresponding to transient distributions . \n the left and right eigenvectors for the leading eigenvalue are , @xmath24 the left and right eigenvectors satisfy the orthogonality relation , @xmath25 for @xmath26 . \n all transient distributions are orthogonal to @xmath27 and necessarily contain negative components . \n the next - to - leading eigenvalue @xmath28 provides the rate of convergence towards the stationary distribution , and can be obtained my maximising @xmath29 , with the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 orthogonal to @xmath32 and @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath33 . \n the convergence is monotonic because @xmath34 , @xmath35 . \n all these properties belong to altruistic evolution , since @xmath36 while @xmath37 . in the competitive case \n , some of the @xmath38 , and the consequences need to be analysed . \n the presence of both positive and negative contributions produces cancellations . \n monotonic convergence is no longer automatic ; oscillations and instabilities may occur in stead . \n an important restriction is imposed by the physical requirement that no population can become negative . \n ( note that there is no such requirement on the components of the individual eigenvectors of @xmath3 . ) \n the evolution must be modified whenever it drives some @xmath9 negative . \n the correct procedure is to stop the evolution at the instance @xmath9 becomes zero , eliminate @xmath39 row and column from the matrix @xmath3 , and then continue evolution in the reduced dimensional space . \n obviously , @xmath9 can be driven negative only if some @xmath6 is negative . \n the reduction of dimensionality , therefore , decreases the number of negative @xmath10 and increases the stability of the system . \n the inverse process , increasing dimensionality of the space , occurs when chance mutation creates a new species . \n it is known that even with @xmath13 , eq.(1 ) can not be evolved backward in time _ \n indefinitely_. this is true in spite of the fact that generic stochastic matrices are positive definite and @xmath40 exists . \n if backward evolution is attempted , some @xmath9 is driven negative at some stage , and beyond that point interpretation of @xmath9 as populations ( or probabilities ) is lost . \n evolution further back in time is possible only by modifying @xmath3 . \n this is easy to see because eigenvalues of @xmath40 are the reciprocals of those for @xmath3 , and with @xmath41 , the growing transient distributions drive some @xmath9 out of their physically allowed range @xmath42 $ ] . \n it is useful to compare this evolution problem to quantum algorithms . \n both are constrained by conservation laws . \n while eq.(3 ) preserves the linear norm of the vector , quantum evolution preserves the quadratic norm . \n the most general evolution preserving the quadratic norm is described by orthogonal transformations for real variables , and by unitary transformations for complex variables . \n orthogonal transformations are generated by antisymmetric matrices ( generating matrices parametrise infinitesimal group transformations in the neighbourhood of identity ) , and they inevitably contain negative matrix elements  the negative elements are an automatic consequence of the underlying conservation laws . \n ( only orthogonal transformations without any negative matrix elements are simple permutation matrices . ) \n although complete understanding of quantum evolution requires use of complex numbers , classical language extended to include negative probabilities can explain unusual features of certain simple systems ( e.g. quantum correlations of two spins violating bell s inequalities ) @xcite . \n recent developments in algorithms for quantum computation ( see for instance @xcite ) offer a hint of how evolution may change in presence of negative matrix elements . \n classical algorithms based on boolean logic can be expressed in terms of permutation matrices . \n quantum algorithms exploit two features to beat them , superposition of states ( which is a generic property of waves ) and quantum entanglement ( which is not relevant here ) . \n superposition means letting multiple states be in the same place at the same time , and it can reduce the spatial degrees of freedom required for the algorithm exponentially . cleverly designed destructive interference amongst superposed states can reduce the the time required to execute the algorithm by eliminating unwanted states . \n coexistence of species in biological evolution is not quite the same as superposition ; it allows simultaneous evolution of all species but without reducing the spatial degrees of freedom . but destructive interference is still an option available to reduce the evolution time . \n the known quantum algorithms reduce the execution time compared to their classical counterparts , at least by a constant factor if not polynomially or exponentially . \n it is important to note that biological evolution occurs over long time scales , and even a tiny change in the rate of growth  fraction of a percent  matters because that can translate into exponential changes in populations over a long time . \n the lessons learnt from quantum computation thus suggest that negative values of @xmath10 may create destructive interference and help the species reach their asymptotic populations faster , i.e. competition should beat altruism in picking a winner amongst the contenders . \n let us now explicitly analyse how evolution changes , when the range of @xmath6 is extended to include negative values . \n clearly , extending the range of @xmath10 can not make the evolutionary process any less powerful . \n the stationary eigenvalue of @xmath3 , @xmath43 , which follows just from the averaging properties as described above , remains unaffected . \n but other eigenvalues and eigenvectors change , and modify evolution . \n an example with two interacting species illustrates the possibilities . in this case , the solution of eq.(1 ) in terms of the ( unnormalised ) right eigenvectors of the evolution matrix is : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 are small , @xmath47 . \n the evolutionary behaviour depends on their signs : + ( a ) @xmath48 : the asymptotic population is proportional to @xmath32 . @xmath49 and \n the transient part proportional to @xmath50 fades away . \n the two species coexist , and their population ratio is stable against small perturbations . such a behaviour does not occur in quantum algorithms . \n + ( b ) @xmath51 : both @xmath32 and @xmath50 contain negative components , and so the non - negative population vector has to be a mixture of the two . \n in course of evolution , the population @xmath9 with @xmath38 is monotonically driven to zero . \n thereafter evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space . \n + ( c ) @xmath52 : the eigenvalue @xmath53 , and dominance of @xmath50 drives one of the @xmath9 to zero . the relative size of initial populations ( i.e. comparison of @xmath54 vs. @xmath55 ) determines which @xmath9 is driven to zero . \n afterwards evolution has to continue in the reduced dimensional space . \n such a dependence on the initial populations is quite distinct from the `` mini - max analysis '' . \n these results for two interacting species have a topological interpretation . \n the three regimes can be looked upon as minimisation of a function over an interval , when it ( a ) has a single minimum , ( b ) is monotonic , and ( c ) has a single maximum . \n the relation between linear evolution and gradient of a quadratic form is generic , and the features exhibited in the above example can be expected to generalise to more complicated multi - species systems . specifically , whenever some @xmath38 : + ( 1 ) the non - stationary eigenvectors play an important part in evolution . \n + ( 2 ) having any @xmath38 makes the stationary eigenvector unstable , and drives the system towards reduced dimensionality . \n + ( 3 ) evolution one by one eliminates species @xmath9 with some @xmath56 , till the reduced dimensional system no longer has any @xmath56 . \n + ( 4 ) the elimination of species takes place in finite time , which depends on initial populations and @xmath10 , but is roughly @xmath57 . \n this is in contrast to exponentially decaying tails of transient parts in an altruistic evolution . \n + ( 5 ) the surviving population is given not by the stationary eigenvector of the original system , but by the stationary eigenvector of the reduced dimensional system . \n the simple model presented above provides a quantification of features anticipated in darwinian evolution . \n the crucial ingredient has been the limited availability of a resource leading to destructive interference . \n chance mutation may introduce a species that snatches away the resource from another one . \n this always produces an instability , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time . \n the stronger survivors are stable until the next mutation instability . \n it is worthwhile to observe that the elementary components of biological systems are so simple and cheap that they can be produced in large numbers even with limited resources . as a result , \n biological systems often exhibit wastefulness , e.g. millions of eggs and pollen grains are produced when a few would have sufficed to propagate the species in a secure environment . \n such an overkill actually strengthens the competition and enforces survival of the fittest .    to summarise , \n the analysis presented in this article is straightforward , and points out certain similarities between competitive evolution , zero - sum games and quantum computation . \n the latter two possess a sound mathematical framework , and so even a simple analogy with them can help us understand better the behaviour of highly complex biological systems . \n the analogies are not perfect , however , and the effect of the differences has to be incorporated properly in the results . \n my conclusion is that limited availability of resources leads to competition , which eliminates the weaker species in a finite time . \n the arguments presented here can also be applied to other competitive situations , e.g. economic and social interactions .", "StartTimeOffset": 1962750448124, "RequestID": "391bedb7118d406b8c57f9d84a0a97ed", "TotalTokens": 3875}
{"ContextTokens": 3905, "GeneratedTokens": 194, "SynthesizedBody": "energy loss of a high @xmath0 hard parton travelling through low @xmath0 soft matter has long been recognized as a promising tool to study the initial high - density phases of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) @xcite . however , if one considers the whole dynamical system created in the collision of two relativistic nuclei and not only the partons emerging from a particular hard scattering vertex , energy is not lost but rather redistributed into the medium . \n measurements of angular correlations of hadrons associated with a given hard trigger allow , as a function of associate hadron momentum , to study how and at what scales this redistribution of energy and momentum takes place . \n such measurements for semi - hard hadrons with 1 gev @xmath1 2.5 gev associated with a trigger 2.5 gev @xmath2 4.0 gev have shown a surprising splitting of the away side peak for all centralities but peripheral collisions , qualitatively very different from a broadened away side peak observed in p - p or d - au collisions @xcite . on the other hand , for a high @xmath0 trigger and associate hadron back to back jet peaks with vacuum width \n albeit reduced strength have been observed @xcite .    as most promising explanation for these findings , \n the assumption that mach shockwaves are excited by the energy lost from the hard parton to the medium has been brought forward @xcite . while we focus on colorless sound here @xcite , we point out that also colored collective modes could contributed in a deconfined phase by a supersonically traveling jet , if the plasma s collective longitudinal mode exhibit a space - like dispersion relation @xcite . for a short overview of those as well as alternative mechanisms , see @xcite and references therein .    in the following , \n we investigate under what conditions signals from such shockwaves remain observable in the dynamical environment of a heavy - ion collision , provided that a realistic description of the evolving medium and the experimental trigger conditions are taken into account , and what properties of the medium are reflected in different momentum regimes . here , we summarize and expand on @xcite and @xcite . \n we perform a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of hard back to back processes in a medium in order to calculate the induced hard hadronic correlation pattern . \n the model is described in detail in @xcite . \n there are four main elements : 1 ) the primary hard pqcd process 2 ) the description of the soft medium and 3 ) the energy loss from hard to soft degrees of freedom and 4 ) the simulation of shockwave propagation and its modification of soft medium decoupling .    for the soft medium we use the parametrized evolution model defined in @xcite which gives a good description of bulk matter transverse momentum spectra and hbt correlation radii . \n the energy loss for a given parton path inside this medium is described in a probabilistic language . in order to determine the probability @xmath3 for a hard parton with energy @xmath4 to lose the energy @xmath5 while traversing the medium on its trajectory , we make use of a scaling law @xcite which allows to relate the dynamical scenario to a static equivalent one for each trajectory @xmath6 by calculating    @xmath7    as a function of the jet production vertex @xmath8 and its angular orientation @xmath9 . \n we set @xmath10 whenever the decoupling temperature of the medium @xmath11 is reached . using the numerical results of @xcite \n , we obtain @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 as a function of jet production vertex and the angle @xmath9 . \n we generate hard pqcd back to back events inside the evolving bulk matter model , using eq . \n ( [ e - omega ] ) to determine @xmath12 for each parton , followed by leading and next to leading fragmentation once the parton emerges from the medium . \n the simulation describes the yield of hard back to back correlations well @xcite . \n selecting events leading to a trigger determines the distribution of vertices and parton energies which we use as a starting point to simulate the away side shockwave . \n first , we determine the direction of the away side parton in the transverse plane and rapidity . in order to take into account intrinsic @xmath15 \n , we calculate a random @xmath15 kick by sampling a gaussian distribution with @xmath16 width . \n we have verified that this distribution , folded with the width of the near side peak reproduces the width of the away side peak in the case of d - au and 60 - 90% peripheral au - au collisions .    since we are not interested in folding the result with a steeply falling spectrum but rather into the energy deposited on average in a given volume element we focus on the average energy loss of the away side parton @xmath17 in the following . \n we assume that a fraction @xmath18 of the energy and momentum lost to the medium excites a shockwave characterized by a dispersion relation @xmath19 while a fraction @xmath20 in essence heats the medium and induces collective drift along the jet axis conserving longitudinal momentum . \n we calculate the speed of sound @xmath21 locally from a quasiparticle description of the equation of state as measured on the lattice as @xmath22 . \n the dispersion relation along with the energy and momentum deposition determines the initial angle of propagation of the shock front with the jet axis ( the mach angle ) as @xmath23 . \n we discretize the time into small intervals @xmath24 , calculate the energy deposited in that time as @xmath25 . \n we then propagate the part of the shockfront remaining in the midrapidity slice ( i.e. in the detector acceptance ) . \n each piece of the front is propagated with the local speed of sound and the angle of propagation is constantly corrected as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is determined by the propagation path . \n once an element of the wavefront reaches the freeze - out condition @xmath11 , a hydrodynamical mode can not propagate further . \n we assume at this point that the energy contained in the shockwave is not used to produce hadrons but rather is converted into kinetic energy . in the local restframe , we then have a matching condition for the dispersion relations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of a volume element at freeze - out temperature . \n once we have calculated the additional boost @xmath30 a volume element receives from the shockwave using the matching conditions , we employ the cooper - frye formula @xmath31\\ ] ] to convert the fluid element into a hadronic distribution . \n the resulting momentum spectrum is thus a thermal two component spectrum resulting from an integration involving volume not part of the shockwave and volume receiving an additional boost from the shockwave . \n the fact that the medium in which shockwaves propagate is nt static has considerable impact on the resulting shape of the medium recoil . \n since the wavefront propagates with @xmath21 relative to the flowing medium , its maximal longitudinal extension has to be determined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the longitudinal flow velocity . \n the effect of this is illustrated in fig . \n [ f-1 ] , left panel . if , for a trigger at midrapidity , the away side parton would always be found at midrapidity and the shockfront would not be modified by longitudinal flow , a peak at a relatively large angle would be observed . \n however , averaging over the pqcd probability @xmath34 to find the away side parton at the ( unobserved ) rapidity @xmath35 shifts the peak inward as one gets contributions from events where the away side parton is outside the acceptance . in those only a slice of the cone \n falls into the acceptance in which the opening angle does nt appear maximal . \n however , an elongation of the cone in longitudinal direction is induced by longitudinal flow which lessens this effect . \n we include longitudinal flow using eq . \n ( [ e - lflow ] ) and determine the corresponding rapidity boost from the fireball evolution model@xcite . \n one can also turn this argument around : scenarios which do not predict a substantial elongation as it emerges in the mach cone framework are strongly disfavored by the data since the correlation signal is easily washed out via rapidity averaging over @xmath34 @xcite . \n another manifestation of flow is visible in fig . \n [ f-1 ] , right panel . \n we point out that this 2-particle correlation signal is the one corresponding to our recent mc simulation of 3-particle correlations ( see below ) . in this specific calculation \n we suppressed a full rapidity averaging , leading to a somewhat larger angle than expected if averaging were performed . \n we show two different longitudinal expansion patterns ( bjorken and non - bjorken evolution ) and two different transverse densities ( box and nuclear profile @xmath36 ) . due to the position of the freeze - out hypersurface at large radii for the box density , the shockwave gets on average longer exposure to transverse flow in this scenario . \n we find the following pattern : the observed angle is consistently larger for longitudinal bjorken expansion . \n this is due to the fact that in this scenario initial cooling is rapid and therefore the average temperature quickly approaches the phase transition temperature @xmath37 where @xmath21 is small ( and hence the mach angle large , cf . \n ( [ e - c_s ] ) ) . \n furthermore , the peak is consistently less pronounced for box density scenarios where there is longer exposure to transverse flow . \n as argued in @xcite , transverse flow can erase a peak for associate momenta above 1 gev if the direction of flow and shockwave propagation are not aligned . \n this has important consequences for 3-particle correlations which are sensitive to the question if only one wing or both wings of the shockwave are seen for each event . \n we calculate 3-particle correlations as factorized two particle correlations , i.e. we calculate a 2-particle correlation as outlined above , subtract the background ( which is obtained by evaluating eq . \n ( [ e - cf ] ) without @xmath30 ) and assume that a second hadron in the same event has the same probability distribution of being found at a given angle with the trigger independent of the position of the first hadron . \n this assumption ignores the possibility of genuine 3-particle correlations . \n however , the only such genuine 3-particle effect which is expected is due to conservation of momentum @xmath38 and @xmath39 which is shared across @xmath40 hadrons @xcite and hence their influence on the signal is very small . \n we then average the generated 3-particle correlation over several hundred events , as large event by event fluctuations in the correlation signal occur due to the probabilistic nature of the collisions ( modeled in our mc approach ) . \n we show the resulting 3-particle correlations for two different density distributions ( not including the region around the trigger ) in fig . \n [ f-3pc ] . \n the result fits nicely into the earlier observation that transverse flow tends to erase one ( or even both wings of the shock cone ) . in this case , only the diagonal region is populated , whereas if both wings of the shock cone projection into the transverse plane survive in an average event , off - diagonal elements appear . \n thus , we can understand that the box density where flow has greater effect shows less strength in the off - diagonal peaks , as in typical events only one wing of the shock cone is observed . \n as a side remark , we note that there is no scenario involving flow in which the strength of off - diagonal peaks equals the strength of the peaks on the diagonal . \n the correlation pattern found in the case of the nuclear profile @xmath36 density resembles very much the pattern measured by star @xcite . \n in addition to the rich correlation structure on the away side , there has also been an observation of a long - range @xmath41 correlation on the near side , the so - called ridge @xcite . \n theoretical explanations suggested for this calculation include e.g. longitudinal broadening of jet cones by turbulent color fields @xcite . \n so far , the ridge correlation has only been observed on the near side whereas the mach cone like correlation has been seen only on the away side . \n while it is clear that a ridge - like correlation can not be observed on the away side due to the unknown rapidity of the away side parton , the intriguing question remains why a cone should not be seen on the near side . \n while in the simulation about 75% of all partons leading to a triggered hadron do not experience energy loss @xcite , there is energy transfer into the medium from the rest which should give rise to a shockwave if the above scenario is correct . \n however , the timescales for development of a cone are rather different on near and away side , as the bulk of trigger partons originates from @xmath42 fm depth from the surface ( thus the average away side parton has a pathlength @xmath43 fm ) . it is thus tempting to identify the ridge with an incompletely formed shockwave and try to explain near and away side phenomenology with the same mechanism . \n clearly , this interpretation can not be verified by exact calculations in our present model . \n however , one can verify that basic scales are correct and that such an interpretation quite naturally fits the general framework . \n using eq . \n ( [ e - lflow ] ) for the typical near side parton vertex , we find that the timescale is sufficient for the longitudinal flow to expand the correlation into the interval @xmath44 . \n furthermore , if the ridge correlation is driven by energy lost from the trigger parton , it should not scale with the trigger energy , but with the expected energy loss given a trigger energy , a quantity which is approximately constant in the kinematic range probed so far . \n finally , if the ridge is akin to the shockwave , its main effect should be an additional boost to hadrons , i.e. an upward shift in apparent temperature with a mass ordering of this shift just like in the case of radial flow , i.e. the shift in apparent temperature should be stronger for nucleons than for pions . \n the most useful measurement to discover more about the relationship between ridge and cone is to trigger on a back to back hadron pair . in this case , the rapidity position of near and away side parton is approximately known , i.e. if there is a ridge on the away side it should become visible . furthermore , the vertex distribution of events can be dialed by chosing appropriate momenta on both sides : if equal momenta back to back are required the situation has to be symmetric and most vertices occur in the center , otherwise the vertex distribution is shifted towards the medium surface on the high - momentum side . \n thus , such a 4-particle correlation measurement could also check if properties of ridge and cone depend crucially on the average in - medium pathlength of the parent parton . \n we have shown that the correlation pattern of associate hadrons back to back with a hard trigger can be understood in terms of shockwaves induced by the energy loss of th away side parton . \n many properties of the observed signal find a natural explanation once this fundamental mechanism is adopted @xcite . \n if so , the resulting correlation pattern shows a sensitivity to several properties of the medium : first , the angular position of the peak is sensitive to the average temperature of the system and hence sensitive to the expansion ( which determines the rate of cooling ) or , if the expansion is assumed to be known , to the eos ( which determines @xmath45 ) . \n flow corrections modify the position somewhat . in particular , longitudinal flow is crucial to spread the correlation signal over a large rapidity interval whereas transverse flow has a strong influence on the structure of the observed 3-particle correlations . within the given framework \n , we could demonstrate that the data favour one density profile assumption over another , however more detailed studies are needed before medium properties can be inferred in a more direct way from the data . \n we would like to stress that a detailed simulation of the background medium , the acceptance and trigger conditions and the energy loss as performed in our calculations is crucial for these features . \n especially we observe strong event by event fluctuations of the 2- and 3-particle correlation signals , and while some events may be similar to the average , the majority is not . \n hence the simulation of a single event can not be considered as a good representative of the ensemble and should not be compared with measured data . \n likewise , the average speed of sound in medium can not reliably be obtained from the measured angle without a simulation including the effects of flow . \n finally , we have outlined a 4-particle correlation measurement which would provide valuable insights into the nature of both ridge and cone correlation . \n we would like to thank j.  cassalderay -

{"ContextTokens": 3019, "GeneratedTokens": 61, "SynthesizedBody": "although the conservation of energy and momentum of electromagnetic fields in vacuum is a very well understood problem , inside a polarizable medium it is still a matter of discussion . \n a review of the literature on this subject can be found in @xcite .    in the vacuum , poynting s equation for the exchange of energy between the field and free charges is easily derived starting from lorentz s force density on charges and currents @xmath2 and from the power density on the currents @xmath3 the resulting equation @xmath4 written in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is an identity valid for any solution of maxwell s equations . \n it is interpreted as a local energy conservation equation by taking @xmath7 as the energy density of the electromagnetic field and poynting s vector @xmath8 as the energy flux current vector . the power exerted by the matter on the fields \n is assumed to be the opposite of ( [ power - density ] ) . \n electromagnetic fields also carry momentum . \n the derivation of the equation for the momentum exchange requires the use of maxwell s stress tensor and a somewhat more involved calculation which do not make easy an elementary presentation of the subject . in many textbooks ( e.g @xcite , @xcite ) \n radiation pressure is simply introduced as a new fact , sometimes referring to it as one of maxwell s achievements . in the vacuum \n the momentum density is accepted to be @xmath9 which leads to the relation @xmath10 for the energy and momentum that an electromagnetic wave releases when absorbed . \n because of this in other elementary presentations ( e.g @xcite ) the density of momentum ( [ momentum - density ] ) is justified by working on the analogy with a relativistic particle , whose momentum and energy are related by @xmath11 for an ultra relativistic particle ( @xmath12 ) holds @xmath13 by assuming that this last relation is also valid for a packet of electromagnetic waves traveling in some direction , one gets ( [ deltap ] ) and therefore @xmath14 in accord with ( [ momentum -

isotropic material . \n poynting s density is the vacuum energy density @xmath7 plus terms that depend on the polarization @xmath26 and the magnetization @xmath27 , @xmath28 the electric term corresponds to the energy density of deformation of matter as it develops electric dipole moments . \n the magnetic term is the work density made on microscopic currents by the induced electric field . \n the work done on electric and magnetic moments is already included in poynting s energy density , that is the reason why in the right hand side of equation ( [ poynting - eq ] ) only the power of the free current density appears . in other words , for an electromagnetic wave in a material medium , poynting s expression corresponds to the energy density of the whole wave , including the change of energy of matter as the wave propagates in the medium .    for the momentum density of the fields in matter \n the situation is less clear . \n there is a dispute that has lasted more than a century @xcite on the subject . \n minkowski @xcite proposed @xmath29 which for individual photons corresponds to using ( [ particle - momentum - ultra ] ) replacing @xmath30 by the speed of light in matter @xmath31 . \n this was challenged by abraham @xcite who proposed instead @xmath32 which for photons corresponds to using directly ( [ particle - momentum ] ) .    to shed some light on this issue , \n in this paper we study a simple example that can be solved exactly . \n it consists of a packet of plane waves propagating in a material with permeability @xmath23 and permittivity @xmath22 . \n the medium being homogeneous there is no refraction and the wave travels conserving momentum and energy . inside the material there is a flat thin film of conducting material in which ohm s law holds , @xmath33 . \n when the wave packet falls on the film it splits in reflected and transmitted packets , whose amplitudes are fixed by the boundary conditions ( see figure [ [ paquetes ] ] ) . the total work done on the currents in the conducting film can be calculated using ( [ power - density ] ) . \n the result is consistent with poynting s energy density ( [ poynting - density ] ) . \n also , the impulse on the currents of the film can be calculated using ( [ force - density ] ) . \n we found that the result is consistent with momentum conservation only if the momentum carried by the waves is given by minkowski s expression ( [ minkowski ] ) . \n consider a medium with electric and magnetic permeabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 filling the space . at the plane @xmath34 there is a sheet of thickness @xmath35 made of a conductive material of resistivity @xmath36 . a packet of electromagnetic plane waves polarized in the direction @xmath37 is traveling in the @xmath38 direction . \n suppose it has a spatial length @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 a time scale , and a wave length @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in terms of a suitable function @xmath45 which vanishes outside the interval @xmath46 $ ] \n the incident wave is , @xmath47 the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath34 @xmath50 is continuous , @xmath51 implying @xmath52        there is an electrical current in the sheet . \n the magnetic field is discontinuous at @xmath34 . \n taking a rectangular path of length @xmath53 in the @xmath54 direction and width @xmath35 in the @xmath38 direction we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the plane surface with boundary @xmath57 ( see figure [ [ camino ] ] ) . the second integral vanishes because the width of the surface is negligible . \n the current density is @xmath58 substituting this in the previous equation we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 introducing @xmath61 and solving the system we have , @xmath62 the energy of the wave is given by poynting s expression @xmath63 for @xmath64 we consider a cylindrical piece of the incident packet with axis parallel to @xmath38 and cross section @xmath65 . \n the energy is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 the energies of the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath69 ^ 2u_1\\ , \\\\ \n u_3&=&\\epsilon e_3 ^ 2 a v \\bar{t}=\\left[\\frac{1}{1+b}\\right]^2u_1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the power density on the current is @xmath70 the total power transferred by the wave is , @xmath71 and the work on the current is @xmath72 ^ 2}u_1\\ .\\ ] ] the energy is conserved @xmath73 let us now discuss momentum conservation for this system . \n we compute first the force applied on the sheet . \n the force density on the current is @xmath74 in the approximation where @xmath35 is infinitesimal , the current density in the sheet , @xmath75 , is constant because the electric field is continuous . \n the magnetic field then varies linearly between its values at both sides of the sheet . in computing the total force one \n has to take the average on the sheet volume . \n for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{h(t)}{v}e_1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this in ( [ force ] ) and using ( [ currentdensity ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) we get \n @xmath79 the impulse applied to the current sheet is @xmath80    the momentum carried by the wave is directed in the same direction in which the wave propagates , that is , the direction of @xmath81 . \n the momentum density of the wave may be written in the form , @xmath82 with @xmath83 a constant to be determined . \n for @xmath84 the momentum density is minkowski s and for @xmath85 it is abraham s . \n then , the momentum carried by the incident wave is @xmath86 analogously @xmath87 for the balance equation we get , @xmath88 momentum is conserved if @xmath84 . the momentum density \n ( [ momden ] ) turns out to be minkowski s expression , @xmath89    the key in the previous argument is the factor @xmath90 that appears in the impulse ( [ applimp ] ) . \n this can be traced back to the magnetic force in lorentz s force ( [ force -

{"ContextTokens": 3449, "GeneratedTokens": 370, "SynthesizedBody": "studies in astroparticle physics link astrophysics , cosmology , particle and nuclear physics and involve hundreds of scientific groups linked by regional networks ( like aspera / appec @xcite ) and national centers . \n the exciting progress in these studies will have impact on the knowledge on the structure of microworld and universe in their fundamental relationship and on the basic , still unknown , physical laws of nature ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) . \n virtual institute of astroparticle physics ( via ) @xcite was organized with the aim to play the role of an unifying and coordinating structure for astroparticle physics . \n starting from the january of 2008 the activity of the institute takes place on its website @xcite in a form of regular weekly videoconferences with via lectures , covering all the theoretical and experimental activities in astroparticle physics and related topics . \n the library of records of these lectures , talks and their presentations was accomplished by multi - lingual forum . in 2008 via complex was effectively used for the first time for participation at distance in xi bled workshop @xcite . since then via videoconferences became a natural part of bled workshops programs , opening the virtual room of discussions to the world - wide audience . \n its progress was presented in @xcite . here \n the current state - of - art of via complex , integrated since the end of 2009 in the structure of apc laboratory , is presented in order to clarify the way in which via discussion of open questions beyond the standard model took place in the framework of xv bled workshop . \n the structure of via complex is illustrated on fig . \n [ homevia ] . \n the home page , presented on this figure , contains the information on via activity and menu , linking to directories ( along the upper line from left to right ) : with general information on via ( about via ) , entrance to via virtual rooms ( rooms ) , the library of records and presentations ( previous ) of via lectures ( previous @xmath6 lectures ) , records of online transmissions of conferences(previous @xmath6 conferences ) , apc seminars ( previous @xmath6 apc seminars ) and apc colloquiums ( previous @xmath6 apc colloquiums ) and courses , calender of the past and future via events ( all events ) and via forum ( forum ) . in the upper right angle \n there are links to google search engine ( search in site ) and to contact information ( contacts ) . \n the announcement of the next via lecture and via online transmission of apc colloquium occupy the main part of the homepage with the record of the most recent via events below . in the announced time of the event ( via lecture or transmitted apc colloquium ) it is sufficient to click on `` to participate '' on the announcement and to enter as guest ( printing your name ) in the corresponding virtual room . \n the calender links to the program of future via lectures and events . \n the right column on the via homepage lists the announcements of the regularly up - dated hot news of astroparticle physics .    in 2010 \n special cosmovia tours were undertaken in switzerland ( geneva ) , belgium ( brussels , liege ) and italy ( turin , pisa , bari , lecce ) in order to test stability of via online transmissions from different parts of europe . \n positive results of these tests have proved the stability of via system and stimulated this practice at xiii bled workshop . \n these tours involved special equipment , including , in particular , the use of the sensitive audio system konftel 300w @xcite . \n the records of the videoconferences at the xiii bled workshop are available on via site @xcite .    in 2011 via facility was used for the tasks of the paris center of cosmological physics ( pccp ) , chaired by g. smoot and for the public programme `` the two infinities '' conveyed by j.l.robert . \n it has effectively supported participation at distance at meetings of the double chooz collaboration : the experimentalists , being at shift , took part in the collaboration meeting in such a virtual way . \n the simplicity of via facility for ordinary users was demonstrated at xiv bled workshop . \n videoconferences at this workshop had no special technical support except for wifi internet connection and ordinary laptops with their internal video and audio equipments . \n this test has proved the ability to use via facility at any place with at least decent internet connection . \n of course the quality of records is not as good in this case as with the use of special equipment , but still it is sufficient to support fruitful scientific discussion as can be illustrated by the record of via presentation `` new physics and its experimental probes '' given by john ellis from his office in cern ( see the records in @xcite ) .    in 2012 via facility , regularly used for programs of via lectures and transmission of apc colloquiums , has extended its applications to support m.khlopovs talk at distance at astrophysics seminar in moscow , videoconference in pccp , participation at distance in apc - hamburg - oxford network meeting as well as to provide online transmissions from the lectures at science festival 2012 in university paris7 . via communication \n has effectively resolved the problem of referee s attendance at the defence of phd thesis by mariana vargas in apc . \n the referees made their reports and participated in discussion in the regime of via videoconference . \n the discussion of questions that were put forward in the interactive via events can be continued and extended on via forum . \n the forum is intended to cover the topics : beyond the standard model , astroparticle physics , cosmology , gravitational wave experiments , astrophysics , neutrinos . \n presently activated in english and russian with trivial extension to other languages , the forum represents a first step on the way to multi - lingual character of via complex and its activity . \n one of the interesting forms of forum activity is the educational work . for the last four years \n m.khlopovs course `` introduction to cosmoparticle physics '' is given in the form of via videoconferences and the records of these lectures and their ppt presentations are put in the corresponding directory of the forum @xcite . \n having attended the via course of lectures in order to be admitted to exam students should put on forum a post with their small thesis . \n professor s comments and proposed corrections are put in a post reply so that students should continuously present on forum improved versions of work until it is accepted as satisfactory . \n then they are admitted to pass their exam . \n the record of videoconference with their oral exam is also put in the corresponding directory of forum . \n such procedure provides completely transparent way of estimation of students knowledge . \n first tests of via system , described in @xcite , involved various systems of videoconferencing . \n they included skype , vrvs , evo , webex , marratech and adobe connect . in the result of these tests \n the adobe connect system was chosen and properly acquired . \n its advantages are : relatively easy use for participants , a possibility to make presentation in a video contact between presenter and audience , a possibility to make high quality records and edit them , removing from records occasional and rather rare disturbances of sound or connection , to use a whiteboard facility for discussions , the option to open desktop and to work online with texts in any format . the regular form of via meetings assumes that their time and virtual room are announced in advance . \n since the access to the virtual room is strictly controlled by administration , the invited participants should enter the room as guests , typing their names , and their entrance and successive ability to use video and audio system is authorized by the host of the meeting . \n the format of via lectures and discussions is shown on fig . \n [ ellis ] , illustrating the talk `` opera versus maxwell and einstein '' given by john ellis from cern . \n the complete record of this talk and is available on via website @xcite . \n the sensational character of the exciting news on superluminal propagation of neutrinos acquired the number of participants , exceeding the allowed upper limit . \n for the first time the problem of necessity in extension of this limit was put forward and it was resolved by creation of a virtual `` infinity room '' , which can host any reasonable amount of participants . \n the ppt or pdf file of presentation is uploaded in the system in advance and then demonstrated in the central window . \n video images of presenter and participants appear in the right window , while in the upper left window the list of all the attendees is given . to protect the quality of sound and record \n , the participants are required to switch out their microphones during presentation and to use lower left chat window for immediate comments and urgent questions . \n the chat window can be also used by participants , having no microphone , for questions and comments during discussion . \n the interactive form of via lectures provides oral discussion , comments and questions during the lecture . \n participant should use in this case a `` raise hand '' option , so that presenter gets signal to switch our his microphone and let the participant to speak . in the end of presentation \n the central window can be used for a whiteboard utility as well as the whole structure of windows can be changed , e.g. by making full screen the window with the images of participants of discussion . \n regular activity of via as a part of apc includes online transmissions of all the apc colloquiums and of some topical apc seminars , which may be of interest for a wide audience . \n online transmissions are arranged in the manner , most convenient for presenters , prepared to give their talk in the conference room in a normal way , projecting slides from their laptop on the screen . \n having uploaded in advance these slides in the via system , via operator , sitting in the conference room , changes them following presenter , directing simultaneously webcam on the presenter and the audience . \n via sessions of xv bled workshop have developed from the first experience at xi bled workshop @xcite and their more regular practice at xii , xiii and xiv bled workshops @xcite . \n they became a regular part of the bled workshop s programme . \n in the course of xv bled workshop meeting the list of open questions was stipulated , which was proposed for wide discussion with the use of via facility . the list of these questions was put on via forum ( see @xcite ) and all the participants of via sessions were invited to address them during via discussions . during the xv bled workshop the test of not only minimal necessary equipment , but either of the use of via facility by ordinary users was undertaken . via sessions were supported by personal laptop with wifi internet connection only , as well as for the first time the members of via team were physically absent in bled and all the videoconferences were directed by m.khlopov at distance from paris . \n it proved the possibility to provide effective interactive online via videoconferences even in the absence of any special equipment and qualified personnel at place . only laptop with microphone and webcam together with wifi internet connection \n was shown to be sufficient not only for attendance , but also for via presentations and discussions .    in the framework of \n the program of xv bled workshop , p. belli , staying in his office in rome , gave his talk `` dama / libra results and perspectives '' ( fig . \n [ dm ] ) and took part in the discussion of puzzles of dark matter searches , which provided a brilliant demonstration of the interactivity of via in the way most natural for the non - formal atmosphere of bled workshops ( see @xcite ) . \n in the course of this discussion n.s . \n manko bortnik and g. bregar , being in bled , have considered possible dark matter candidates that follow from the approach , unifying spins and charges , and maxim khlopov presented from paris the state - of - art of composite dark matter scenario , stipulating the open problems of this solution for the puzzles of direct dark matter searches . via sessions \n were finished by the via talk `` the atlas experiment at the lhc : present status and its future '' by a.s romaniouk and discussion of problems of experimental search for new physics at accelerators .    via sessions \n provided participation at distance in bled discussions for m.khlopov ( apc , paris , france ) , p. belli ( rome tor vergata , italy ) , e. soldatov ( cern , switzerland ) , k.belotsky , n.chasnikov and a.mayorov ( mephi , moscow ) , j .- \n cudell and q.wallemacq ( liege , belgium ) , r.weiner ( marburg , germany ) and many others . \n current via activity is integrated in the structure of apc laboratory and includes regular weekly videoconferences with via lectures , online transmissions of apc colloquiums and seminars , a solid library of their records and presentations , together with the work of multi - lingual via internet forum . \n the scientific - educational complex of virtual institute of astroparticle physics can provide regular communications between different groups and scientists , working in different scientific fields and parts of the world , get the first - hand information on the newest scientific results , as well as to support various educational programs at distance . \n this activity would easily allow finding mutual interest and organizing task forces for different scientific topics of astroparticle physics and related topics . \n it can help in the elaboration of strategy of experimental particle , nuclear , astrophysical and cosmological studies as well as in proper analysis of experimental data . \n it can provide young talented people from all over the world to get the highest level education , come in direct interactive contact with the world known scientists and to find their place in the fundamental research . via applications can go far beyond the particular tasks of astroparticle physics and give rise to an interactive system of mass media communications .    via sessions \n became a natural part of a program of bled workshops , opening the room of discussions of physics beyond the standard model for distant participants from all the world . \n the experience of via applications at bled workshops plays important role in the development of via facility as an effective tool of science and education online . \n the initial step of creation of via was supported by aspera . \n i am grateful to p.binetruy , j.ellis and s.katsanevas for permanent stimulating support , to j.c . \n hamilton for support in via integration in the structure of apc

{"ContextTokens": 2934, "GeneratedTokens": 94, "SynthesizedBody": "although principally devoted to studies of compact galactic sources and active galactic nuclei , the beppo - sax satellite has devoted a small fraction of time to galaxy cluster observations . \n the primary motivation for performing observations of galaxy clusters with beppo - sax is the high spatial resolution of the mecs instruments . in these proceedings \n i briefly review the beppo - sax observational program for galaxy clusters . after having listed contributions on galaxy clusters to these proceedings by other authors \n i describe results from the analysis of the perseus observation . \n the mecs instrument on board beppo - sax is well suited for the analysis of extended sources . \n as discussed in giommi et al . \n ( 1998 ) in these proceedings , the effective area of the 3 mecs units is comparable to that of the 2 gis units on board asca in the 2 - 10 kev ( see their figure 1 ) . \n the point spread function of the mecs is significantly sharper than that of the asca gis ( see giommi et al . 1998 figure 2 ) . at 6.4 \n kev the half power radius ( hpr ) of the mecs psf is @xmath0 1 arcmin while the hpr of the asca gis psf is @xmath0 2 arcmin . \n moreover , unlike the asca gis psf , the mecs psf does not vary strongly with energy ( see fig.1 of dacri et al . \n 1998 , these proceedings ) . \n another important point is that the instrumental background for the mecs units on - board beppo - sax is quite low @xmath1 in the 1.5 - 10 kev band to be compared with @xmath2 in the same band for the gis units on board asca . \n moreover , due to the low inclination orbit adopted by the beppo - sax satellite , the background is extremely stable . \n the beppo - sax observing program includes observations of a few galaxy cluster . \n a list of observations scheduled and performed is presented in these proceedings by pallavicini ( see his table 3 ) . \n almost all these observations are devoted to extended objects , the main aim being spatially resolved spectroscopy . within these proceedings \n beppo - sax observations of galaxy clusters are presented by a few authors . \n kaastra et al . \n ( 1998 ) discuss spatially resolved spectroscopy of a2199 . \n they find evidence of a spectral hardening in the outer parts of this cluster . \n moreover , using pds data they confirm the presence of a hard tail in a2199 . \n colafrancesco et al . \n ( 1998 ) discuss the analysis of 2 intermediate redshift clusters namely a33 and a348 . \n they combine their data with previous asca measurements to place constraints on the @xmath3 relationship at @xmath4 . \n dacri et al . \n discuss an analysis technique which they have developed to correct for the spectral distortions introduced by the energy dependent mecs psf . \n they apply this technique to the core of the virgo cluster finding a temperature decrement towards the inner parts of cluster , in agreement with previous measurements made with rosat and asca . \n the central region of the perseus cluster was observed by the beppo - sax satellite ( boella , butler et al . \n 97 ) between the 20@xmath5 and the 21@xmath6 of september 1996 during the science verification phase ( svp ) . \n the observation was rather long with a total effective exposure of 89 ks for the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) ( boella , chiappetti et al . \n 97 ) , 38 ks for the hpgspc instrument ( manzo et al . 1997 ) and 30 ks for the pds instrument ( frontera et al . \n 1997 ) . \n i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin . \n i have fitted the mecs , hpgspc and pds spectra simultaneously using a thermal emission code ( mekal in xspec version 9.01 ) absorbed by an equivalent hydrogen column density of n@xmath7 @xmath8 the fit to the broad band spectrum ( figure 1 ) shows an excess of the data with respect to the model at energies e 20 kev . \n this excess can not be fitted with a thermal component , unless an unphysical temperature of more than 20 kev is assumed . \n a power - law component fits adequately the high energy excess . \n the intensity of the power - law component is @xmath9 erg @xmath8s@xmath10 in the 20 - 100 kev band . \n comparison of our measurement with previous detections by oso7 ( rothschild et al . 1981 ) , heao1 ( levine et al . 1984 ) and with the osse upper limit ( osako et al . 1994 ) indicate that the power - law component is undergoing a secular decrease in intensity . \n an asca analysis of the central region of perseus ( fabian et al . 94 ) shows that the spectrum below 3 kev is strongly contaminated by a cooling flow . by comparing the surface brightness profile of perseus in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , derived from the analysis of rosat pspc archive data , with a king profile we find that the cooling flow extends out to @xmath0 8 arcmin , corresponding to 240 kpc . \n i have attempted to spatially resolve the cooling flow component with the mecs by analyzing spectra from 4 concentric annuli centered on the emission peak and with bounding radii of 0 - 2 arcmin , 2 - 4 arcmin , 4 - 6 arcmin and 6 - 8 arcmin respectively . \n i have fitted each spectrum in the 3.5 - 10 kev range with a thermal model ( mekal ) allowing the temperature and the abundances to be free . \n i have then reintroduced the data in the 1.5 - 3.5 kev range and plotted the residuals to the fits ( see figure 2 ) . \n as can be clearly seen the relative intensity of the cooling flow component decreases as the radial distance from the peak of the emission increases ( the increase observed when going from panel 1 to panel 2 is due to instrumental effects , more specifically the detector psf , below 3 kev , redistributes a large fraction of photons coming from a circular region with a radius of 2 arcmin over a larger region ) . \n as described in the previous subsection i have fitted spectra accumulated in concentric annuli with a thermal emission model . in figure 3 \n i plot the temperature derived from the fits . in order to avoid contamination from the cooling flow \n the fits were performed in the 3 - 10 kev band . \n our data clearly indicates that the temperature presents a strong gradient in perseus over a region of 8 arcmin ( corresponding to 240 kpc ) in radius . \n i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a circular region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 200 kpc . \n i have modeled the spectrum in the 3 - 10 kev band using a bremsstrahlung for the continuum and two gaussian lines , one for the 6.8 kev iron complex , the other for the 8 kev iron - nickel complex . \n data at energies below 3 kev has been excluded because significantly contaminated by the cooling flow . \n i find a temperature of @xmath11 kev for the continuum component , an energy e@xmath12 kev and a width @xmath13 kev for the lower energy line and an energy e@xmath14 kev and a width @xmath15 kev for the higher energy line , where both e@xmath16 and e@xmath17 are given in the source rest - frame . \n the 8 kev feature is clearly broad and most likely due to a blend of different lines from highly ionized iron ( fe xxv and fe xxvi ) and nickel ( ni xxvii ) . \n fits with thermal emission codes such as meka , mekal or raymond & smith do not reproduce satisfactorily the 8 kev feature , all these models underestimate significantly the intensity of the emission feature , the reason being that all the above codes predict an 8 kev over 6.8 kev line intensity ratio in the range 0.11 - 0.13 against an observed ratio of @xmath18 . \n the most convincing explanation i have found for the observed anomalous ratio involves a process known as resonant scattering ( a detailed discussion of alternative explanations and of other aspects of the line ratio analysis is presented in molendi et al . \n the inter - galactic medium in clusters , while optically thin to the continuum and many lines , may be optically thick in the center of some lines . indeed the process describing the absorption of an fe k@xmath19 line photon by an iron ion followed by the immediate re - emission , which is known as resonant scattering , can be quite effective for typical cluster gas densities and temperatures . \n gilfanov et al . \n ( 86 ) have shown that the cores of rich cluster , such as perseus and virgo , should have optical depths , for the above process , of the order of a few . \n if the gas is optically thick to resonant scattering , the line emission coming from the core of the cluster will be attenuated because of the photons which are scattered out of the line of sight . \n if this is the case then the abundances measured using standard thermal emission codes , which assume optically thin thermal emission , can be significantly underestimated . in figure 4 \n i show the abundance profiles computed under the assumption of optically thin line emission ( open circles ) and of optically thick emission , using 2 different methods ( filled circles and open squares ) . \n i find that the the fe abundance in the innermost circular region , with radius 2 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 60 kpc , is @xmath0 0.9 solar and consistent with 1 . \n the obvious implication is that a very large fraction of the gas in the core of perseus has been processed in stars . \n i acknowledge support of various nature from my colleagues in the beppo -

{"ContextTokens": 3131, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "this paper deals with selective pressure and diversity in cellular genetic algorithms ( cgas ) which are a subclass of genetic algorithms where the population is embedded in a grid . \n these concepts are closely related to the exploration / exploitation trade - off . \n previous studies on cgas selected the size and the shape of neighborhoods @xcite , or the shape of the grid @xcite as basic parameters to tune the search process . \n altering these structural parameters entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem . \n for instance , there is no built - in mean to swap from a rectangular grid to a square grid without misshaping the neighborhood relation . \n we suggest using _ anisotropic selection _ ( as ) to promote diversity and to control accurately the selective pressure in genetic search . the main advantage of the _ anisotropic selection _ \n scheme is that it allows to control the exploration / exploitation trade - off without affecting neither the grid topology nor the neighborhood shape ; so the cellular genetic algorithm we propose merely works on a square grid and a simple von neumann neighborhood shape . \n + the paper is divided in 6 sections . \n section [ section1 ] gives a brief definition of cgas and an overview of existing techniques used to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff . \n section [ section2 ] introduces the as scheme . \n section [ section3 ] studies the influence of as on the selective pressure . in section [ section4 ] \n we compare as and rectangular grids topologies influence on the selective pressure . in section [ section5 ] \n we show how as promotes the emergence of niches . in section [ section6 ] \n we use a cga on a quadratic assignment problem to measure the correlation between anisotropy and performance . \n finally we tie together the results of the previous sections and suggest directions for further research . \n this section presents a brief overview on cellular genetic algorithms and a standard technique to measure the selective pressure . \n [ section1 ]      cellular genetic algorithms are a subclass of genetic algorithms ( gas ) in which exploration and population diversity are enhanced thanks to the existence of small overlapped neighborhoods @xcite . such algorithms are specially well suited for complex problems @xcite . \n we assume a two - dimensional toroidal grid as a spatial population structure . \n each grid cell contains one individual of the population . \n the overlapping neighborhoods provide an implicit mechanism for migration of genetic material throughout the grid . \n a genetic algorithm is assumed to be running simultaneously on each grid cell , continuously selecting parents from the neighborhood of that grid cell in order to produce an offspring which replaces the current individual .      a standard technique to study the induced selection pressure without introducing the perturbing effect of variation operators is to let selection be the only active operator , and then monitor the number of best individual copies @xmath0 in the population @xcite . \n the takeover time is the time it takes for the single best individual to conquer the whole population . \n the grid is initialized with one cell having the best fitness and all the other having a null fitness . since no other evolution mechanism but \n selection takes place , we can observe the way the best individual spreads over the grid by counting generation after generation the number of copies of this one . \n a shorter takeover time thus means a higher selective pressure . \n it has been shown that when we move from a panmictic population , as in standard ga , to a spatially structured one of the same size with synchronous updating of the cells , the global selection pressure induced on the entire population is weaker @xcite . \n links have been established between takeover time and neighborhood size and shape or grid topology . \n neighborhood size and shape in a cga are parameters that have some influence on the takeover time \n . a larger overlap of local neighborhoods of the same shape speeds up the best individual s spreading over the grid . \n the influence of the shape is given by sarma and de jong through a measure on the neighborhood which represents the spatial dispersion of a cell pattern @xcite . \n rather than the size of the neighborhood in terms of individuals , the key particularity of a local neighborhood is its radius . \n the takeover time decreases while the radius increases in a spatially structured population . \n [ sec - effectgridtopo ] we measure the relation between grid topology and selective pressure for rectangular grids where the population size is fixed to @xmath1 . \n we use the following grid shapes : @xmath2 ; @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 individuals . \n the selection strategy is a binary tournament . \n for each cell we randomly choose two individuals in its neighborhood . \n the best one then replaces the individual of the cell on the grid if it is fitter or with probability 0.5 if fitnesses are equal . \n figure [ fig - crois - tournoi ] shows the average of @xmath8 independant runs of growth of @xmath0 against generations ; the takeover time is reached when @xmath0 is equal to the size of the grid ( see table i ) . the average growth rate @xmath9 , that is the number of new best individual copies per time unit , of these curves for four rectangular grid shapes ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4,@xmath5 ) is plotted in figure [ acrois_tournoi ] . \n this figure helps us to understand the growth of @xmath0 . \n the growth rate @xmath9 is the same for all grids for the first generations . \n then , the spreading speeds down to reach a constant speed for rectangular grids . \n this constant is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability of selecting the best individual when there is one copy of it in the neighborhood and @xmath12 the shortest side of the grid @xcite . \n more accurately , @xmath9 decreases when @xmath12 is filled by copies of the best individual ( see figure [ display_rec](b ) ) . \n then , the speed becomes constant until the best individual has spread over to the other side ( see figure [ display_rec](c ) ) . \n this explains why the @xmath2 grid curve has no constant period : the two sides are filled at the same time . \n finally , the growth rate falls down to zero as the best individual finishes conquering the grid . \n the results of the experiments we conducted are in agreement with e.alba and j.troya observations that narrow grid shapes induce low selective pressure @xcite . \n we will see in the next sections that this behavior can be observed with the as too . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ display_two ] \n we experiment a cga using anisotropic selection on a quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) : nug30 . \n our aim here is not to obtain better results with respect to other optimization methods , but rather to observe the behavior of a cga with as . in particular , we seek an optimal value for the anisotropy degree . \n the qap is an important problem in both theory and practice . \n it was introduced by koopmans and beckmann in 1957 and is a modal for many practical problems @xcite . \n + the qap can be described as the problem of assigning a set of facilities to a set of locations with given distances between the locations and given flows between the facilities . \n the goal is to place the facilities on locations in such a way that the sum of the products between flows and distances is minimal . \n + given @xmath13 facilities and @xmath13 locations , two @xmath14 matrices @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] where @xmath17 is the distance between locations @xmath18 and @xmath12 and @xmath19 the flow between facilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the objective function is : + @xmath22 where @xmath23 gives the location of facility @xmath20 in the current permutation @xmath11 . \n + nugent , vollman and ruml suggested a set of problem instances of different sizes noted for their difficulty @xcite . \n the instances they suggested are known to have multiple local optima , so they are difficult for a genetic algortihm . \n we experiment our algorithm on their 30 variables instance called nug30 . \n we consider a population of 400 individuals placed on a square grid . \n each individual represents a permutation of @xmath24 . \n we need a special crossover that preserves the permutations :    * select two individuals @xmath25 and @xmath26 as genitors . * \n choose a random position @xmath20 . \n * find @xmath21 and @xmath18 so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . * \n swap positions @xmath20 and @xmath21 from @xmath25 and positions @xmath20 and @xmath18 from @xmath26 . \n * repeat @xmath29 times this procedure where @xmath13 is the length of an individual . \n this crossover is an extended version of the upmx crossover proposed in @xcite . \n the mutation operator consists in randomly selecting two positions from the individual and exchanging these positions . \n the crossover rate is 1 and we perform one mutation per individual in average . + we consider 500 runs for each anisotropy degree . \n each run stops after 1500 generations . \n figure [ alpha - perf ] shows the average performance of the algorithm towards @xmath30 : for each value of @xmath30 we average the best solution of each run . \n performances are growing with @xmath30 and then fall down as @xmath30 is getting closer to its limit value . \n this curve shows the influence of the selective pressure on the performances and how important it is to control it accurately . \n the best average performance is observed for @xmath31 , which corresponds to a good exploration / exploitation tradeoff . in the neighborhood of this optimal value \n the algorithm favors propagation of good solutions in the vertical direction with few interactions on the left or right sides . \n this kind of dynamics is well adapted to multi - modal problems as we can reach local optima on each columns of the grid and then migrate them horizontally to find new solutions . \n performances would probably improve if the selective pressure did not remain static during the search process . \n as in @xcite , we can define some criteria to self - adjust the anisotropy degree along generations . \n furthermore , we can assign a different anisotropy degree to each cell of the grid , so that we can determinate criteria to self - adjust selective pressure locally upon measures on neighborhoods . \n this paper presents a new selection scheme in cellular genetic algorithms . \n the main objective is to control the exploration / exploitation tradeoff in a flexible way . \n we propose to exploit the cellular ga characteristics to promote diversity during a genetic search process . \n previous studies on cgas selected structural parameters , as neighborhood or grid shape , to tune the selective pressure . \n the main drawback of these techniques is that altering a structural parameter entails a deep change in the way we deal with the problem . \n the new selection scheme we suggest is based on _ fuzzy neighborhood _ where a cell is chosen according to different probabilities . in order to favor one direction rather than the other one , _ \n anisotropic selection _ chooses individuals in fuzzy neighborhood . \n experiments performed in order to establish relation between the takeover time and the degree of anisotropy are consistent with our expectation that selection pressure decreases with the degree of anisotropy . \n analysis of the growth curves allows to distinguish three different phases in the diffusion process . \n experimental results establish linear correlation in takeover between as and cga using rectangular grid . \n then we point out capabilities of as to promote the emergence of niches . finally , using a cga with as on a qap \n we have shown the existence of an anisotropic optimal value of @xmath30 such that the best average performance is observed . \n this paper is a preliminary investigation and a more extensive analysis must be made to confirm that equilibrium between exploration and exploitation makes as a good technique for complex problems in static or dynamic environments . \n future work should address the following issues : comparison between as and changes in the neighborhood shape and size , measuring as effects with cga using mutation and crossover , change the balance of directions dynamically . \n the latter point is an important feature : by tuning the control parameter @xmath30 , it would be possible to make the algorithm to self - adjust the selective pressure , depending on global or local measures . \n this adaptive ability has two important advantages : first , parameter @xmath30 may vary in a continuous way , second , variations of this parameter have affect neither on the grid topology nor on the neighborhood shape . \n such self - adaptive algorithms have been studied in previous works , but they need to change the grid topology to control the selective pressure @xcite , which means it is uniform in the grid . as allows different propagation speeds on each area of the grid , promoting diversification and intensification ( exploitation ) at the same time on different spots . in general , we have to continue investigation of _ anisotropic selection _ to assess its validity and generality . \n m.  giacobini , a.  tettamanzi , and m.  tomassini . \n modelling selection intensity for linear cellular evolutionary algorithms . in p. \n l. et  al . , \n editor , _ artificial evolution , sixth international conference , evolution artificielle , ea  2003 _ , lecture notes in computer science , pages 345356 , marseille , france , october 2003 . springer .", "StartTimeOffset": 2013388778322, "RequestID": "f2a31cd0982441dc9abae3329931b367", "TotalTokens": 3324}

perot cavity @xcite . \n the collective force exerted by solar chameleons bouncing off the membrane surface @xcite will cause a displacement from its equilibrium position which can be sensed by monitoring the cavity resonant frequency . \n since , in addition , the membrane is a mechanical resonator , the displacement sensitivity is enhanced by the mechanical quality factor of the membrane . for a detailed description of the kwisp force sensor see @xcite . \n an absolute calibration of the kwisp sensor in terms of force has been obtained in the infn trieste optics laboratory by applying a known external force supplied by the radiation pressure of a laser beam ( _ pump beam technique _ ) . \n this external force is modulated at a given frequency allowing one to explore the frequency region near the mechanical resonance of the membrane . here \n we obtain a force sensitivity already at the 300  k thermal limit @xcite . in order to effectively use the kwisp sensor for chameleon detection \n it is necessary to find a means of modulating the amplitude of the expected chameleon beam . by exploiting the ability of chameleons to reflect off any material surface when impinging at grazing incidence , and to correspondingly traverse it when at normal incidence @xcite \n , we have originally devised and built a _ \n chameleon chopper _ prototype . \n the chopper allows one to shift the expected chameleon signal away from the noisy region near zero frequency , eventually reaching , with a suitable high frequency chopper , frequencies near resonance . \n we have used the prototype chopper , working at frequencies below 200 hz , for preliminary solar chameleon search runs , also taking advantage of the fact that the kwisp membrane orientation in space is such , that a hypothetical chameleon beam from the sun will reflect off it at grazing angles between 0 and 20 degrees for about 1.5 hours each day . in the following \n we will briefly describe the sensor setup , the results from absolute calibration measurements , the chameleon chopper prototype and its use in preliminary solar runs . \n the main element of the kwisp force sensor is a vacuum chamber containing an 85 mm long fabry - perot cavity made with two 1-inch diameter , 100 cm curvature radius , high - reflectivity , multilayer dielectric mirrors . \n a si@xmath4n@xmath5 , 5x5 mm@xmath6 , 100 nm thick membrane is inserted inside the cavity and it is initially placed approximately midway between the two cavity mirrors ( _ membrane - in - the - middle _ configuration ) . the fabry - perot cavity is excited using a cw 1064 nm laser beam emitted by a nd : yag laser . a second , frequency doubled , cw beam at 532 nm emitted by the same laser is used as an auxiliary beam ( _ pump beam _ ) for alignment and for exerting a known external force on the membrane . when the sensor is in detection mode \n the fabry - perot cavity is frequency locked to the laser using an electro - optic feedback loop @xcite . \n the error signal generated by this loop is proportional to the instantaneous frequency difference between laser and cavity and its power spectrum contains the information on membrane displacements . \n the pump beam , amplitude - modulated at a given frequency , is then injected into the cavity and it exerts a known force on the membrane by reflecting off it . \n the intensity of the pump beam corresponds in our case to a net force of @xmath7 n. the presence of this force is detected as a peak in the measured spectrum of the error signal . \n the membrane behaves as a mechanical oscillator and its fundamental resonant frequency and quality factor can be directly measured with the pump beam technique . \n figure [ fig : resfreq ] shows a plot of several power spectra of the feedback loop error signal . \n the peaks indicate the presence of the calibration force , while different peaks correspond to different excitation frequencies . \n the peak with the largest amplitude occurs when the the pump beam modulation frequency matches the membrane mechanical resonance freqeuncy . \n the background level in figure [ fig : resfreq ] gives a force sensitivity of @xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath3 in terms of displacement . \n these values correspond to the thermal limit at 300 k @xcite . \n to investigate the possible presence of a signal from a beam of chameleons emitted by the sun , it is necessary to impress a time modulation on it . \n this can be done by exploiting the general chameleon property of traversing any material when impinging on it at right angles , and of reflecting off it when arriving at grazing incidence ( see @xcite for details ) . \n we have designed and built a prototype chameleon chopper ( see figure [ fig : chamchop ] ) exploiting this property . \n hz , corresponding to a chopping frequency of @xmath8 hz , as a grazing incidence surface is presented to the incoming beam 4 times each turn.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the chopper was placed in the proper position in order to intercept a hypothetical solar chameleon beam hitting the membrane at grazing incidence angles between 0 and 20 degrees , depending on the time of day . \n data were then acquired by recording 40 s long power spectra of the feedback loop error signal . \n a partial preliminary analysis of the solar data was conducted by computing for each spectrum the signal - to - noise ratio and by plotting the snr as a function of time . \n a sample plot of this type is shown in figure [ fig : snr ] . \n the kwisp force sensor now running in the infn trieste optics laboratory has been calibrated in absolute terms using a known force exerted by an auxiliary pump beam . \n the measured sensitivity of @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath3 in terms of displacement , is already at the 300 k thermal limit . \n the _ chameleon chopper _ \n concept has been implemented in a working prototype @xcite . \n this was used in combination with the force -

{"ContextTokens": 3871, "GeneratedTokens": 207, "SynthesizedBody": "plants are complex biological systems , which feed , develop and function thanks to a variety of elementary and cooperative processes that ensure transport of energy and matter in the form of mineral elements , carbohydrates , and hormones in watery solutions called sap \n . two categories of sap are transported in conductive tissues : xylem sap transported in xylem , a continuum of dead cells forming a pipe that opposes little resistance to the transport of water and mineral elements from roots to leaves ; and phloem sap , containing water and sugar , formed in the leaves by photosynthesis , and transported in phloem ( sieve tube elements ) from the leaves to the roots . \n explanations for xylem sap transport includes the cohesion - tension theory @xcite and multiforce theories @xcite ; and the pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism for phloem sap transport @xcite . \n notwithstanding their relative merits , it is of interest to note that as saps contain ions , a net voltage may be recorded within plants . \n furthermore , as a living plant is naturally submitted to a temperature gradient between its roots and its leaves , heat may also flow from its hotter to its colder regions . \n these two facts lead to the questions of the existence and strength of a coupling between electrical current and heat flux in plants , and whether this coupling plays a significant role in the plants lives . \n answers to these questions are of importance to gain further insight into plant homeostasis , closely related to the le chatelier - braun principle in chemical thermodynamics , and to develop further the field of plant electrophysiology by analysing the impact of thermoelectric coupling on photosynthesis , plant respiration , and any other processes involving bioelectrochemical phenomena @xcite . \n biophysical processes , which include energy and matter transport in dedicated structures , are essentially nonequilibrium in nature . \n their description involves the notions of thermodynamic forces and their conjugate fluxes which , in a linear response description , are proportional to each other . in a general manner , \n transport phenomena are nonequilibrium irreversible processes@xcite : fluxes within a system result from applied external constraints , and they are accompanied by energy dissipation and entropy production . as the forces applied to a system \n derive from potentials , the description of the system s nonequilibrium properties relies on the definition of these potentials and their degree of coupling @xcite . \n thermoelectricity is sometimes mistakenly viewed as a phenomenon pertaining to solid - state systems@xcite , but this effect has also been reported in liquids@xcite and gels@xcite . \n now , considering more specifically electrical phenomena in plants , one should also account for their dependence on temperature and the local variations of this latter . as a matter of fact \n , one learns from the equilibrium thermodynamics of charged fluids that heat and electricity are fundamentally related through the gibbs - duhem relation ; so , since plants , as any other system , are subjected to the laws of thermodynamics , one may anticipate that a proper understanding of the coupled transport of heat and electricity in plants will pave the way towards the potentially rich new field of thermoelectricity - based plant energy conversion , and harvesting metabolic energy from plants @xcite . \n thermoelectricity as part of non - isothermal processes in living organisms , has already been mentioned ; but except for the case of insects like hornets and bees @xcite , for which genuine thermoeletric effects have been analysed , the other studies simply reported the record of the temperature rise of colocasia odora leaves using a thermocouple @xcite , or analysed pyroelectricity , mistakenly taken as a thermoelectricity , amongst the nonequilibrium processes at the origin of life @xcite . \n we propose here to consider bean sprouts as an illustrative case of a living plant system whose physiological properties also entail thermoelectric effects , with a particular focus on the thermovoltage response of the plant . \n while a voltage difference along the stem of a plant has already been measured and analysed @xcite , its interpretation does not account for a likely the thermoelectric origin . \n nevertheless , it is clear that the source of any voltage difference is due to concentration gradients of charges inside the plant , regardless of the cause of the gradients . \n the underlying processes may thus originate in various electrochemical processes , including acid - base and redox effects@xcite . in the present work we focus on the voltage response due to a temperature difference . \n the system is presented in fig . \n the stem and leaves are kept at constant temperature while the temperature of the roots can be modified ; the thermoelectric response is recorded on both the plant ( a ) and a control wire ( b ) . \n thermoelectricity differs from electrochemistry as the latter considers isothermal systems only . \n thermoelectric effects , on the contrary , manifest themselves in non - isothermal conditions and their thermodynamic description is best done with the coupled variables @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electrochemical potential and @xmath2 the temperature of the considered system . in a force - flux approach , as a temperature bias is applied to a conductor , both heat and charges are transported in coupled flows since each electron carries an electric charge , @xmath3 , and energy ; the thermoelectric coupling parameter or seebeck coefficient @xmath4 is thus defined as :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the spatial gradient . \n equation ( [ seebeck ] ) may be viewed as a generalization of the gibbs - duhem relation to the dynamical response of the coupled intensive variables @xmath0 by defining the thermodynamic forces acting on the system as the gradients of the thermodynamic potentials . \n each force is conjugated to a flux which is proportional to the time derivative of the corresponding extensive parameter , and it follows that forces and fluxes are linearly combined as proposed by onsager @xcite . \n note that the coefficient @xmath4 , which in eq . \n ( [ seebeck ] ) is defined locally , is also often expressed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the global difference between two distant points of the system . \n these general considerations apply for any system containing free charge carriers . as a consequence , for a given temperature difference \n , the measurement of a thermovoltage directly gives an estimation of the average ratio of charge concentrations in separate parts of the system . \n therefore , any system containing free mobile carriers may be exhibit a thermoelectric signature . \n one should note that depending on the specific properties of the considered system , this signature may intertwine or not with those of other temperature - dependent processes ; hence the need for specific system - dependent approaches to extract the thermoelectric signal . in the case of liquids and gels , \n the studies usually focus on the thermoelectrophoresis parameters @xcite . for solid state - systems , \n the conduction is ensured by mobile electrons and holes , leading to a possible steady - state electrical current . for ionic carriers , in liquids and gels , \n such a steady - state current may only take place if a redox process occurs at the ends of the system . \n the experiment aims to identify and characterize the thermoelectric response of a living plant ( a bean sprout in the present work ) . as the response of the plant necessarily entails physiologic effects , \n the measured data is compared to the purely thermoelectric response of a control wire . as depicted on fig . \n [ fig : figure1 ] , the temperature of the plant s roots is imposed by a thermostatic bath ; two thermocouples are used to measure the temperatures of the roots and the leaves , and two electrodes are placed respectively in contact with the roots and the leaves of the living plant . \n the roots are bathed in an aqueous dilute kcl solution . \n the electrodes connected to the leaves are made of ag / agcl wires . \n all the temperatures and voltages are recorded using a keithley k2700 scanning multimeter and a k182 nanovoltmeter . \n the thermoelectric control wire ( cw ) is made of two chromium - nickel - steel junctions , with a seebeck coefficient @xmath9v / k ; it is placed in the same configuration as that of the plant . \n the recorded voltage at the ends of the control wire describes a _ pure _ thermoelectric response , exempt from any influence of the physiologic process . \n ( upper left panel ) and of the plant @xmath10 ( upper right panel ) , both submitted to a time - varying temperature difference @xmath11 , reported on the lower panel . \n the magnitude of measured voltage @xmath12 has been multiplied by a factor 2000 in order to report it on the same scale as that of @xmath10 . \n the red - dotted lines indicate the average slope of the collected data . in the lower panel , \n the scale is that of the temperature difference ; the voltages are also depicted in this lower panel to see how close their time - dependent behaviour is to that of the measured temperature difference.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the voltage response of the living plant and that of the control wire to the temperature difference @xmath11 are both shown on fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , where the time evolution of @xmath11 is also displayed , illustrating the dynamics of the plant and that of the control wire . \n these data were recorded over a period of four hours for various temperature differences and variation rates . \n the two upper panels show separately the parametric plots characterising the thermoelectric response of the control wire and that of the plant . \n notice that the response of the control wire is strictly proportional to the temperature difference , as expected for a thermoelectric material , with a _ passive _ seebeck coefficient . \n conversely , the plant exhibits a complex response , which includes the effects of its physiological processes thus giving rise to an _ active _ seebeck response . \n the curves represented on the lower panel are displayed together on the same scale to qualitatively show how the responses ( voltages @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) follow the applied constraint ( temperature difference @xmath11 ) . \n the figures on the @xmath13-axis correspond to @xmath11 in @xmath14c . \n the values taken by the voltages @xmath12 and @xmath10 may be determined from the curves using a scaling factor that corresponds to the relevant seebeck coefficient . \n the control wire shows a faithful homothetic response to the temperature difference , with a linear factor of scaling of @xmath15v / k as expected for the seebeck coefficient of the corresponding chromium - nickel - steel thermocouple . \n the response of the plant gives an average seebeck coefficient of 2.5 mv / k . \n such a large value in a solid - state material would correspond to a system with low electrical conductivity . here , this results from ion movements through xylem and phloem saps circulating in opposite directions .    to analyze precisely these data , it is convenient to split each panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] into three parts , which correspond to three distinct time domains . \n the first and third ones , figs.[fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] , respectively , describes the plant s response when its roots are heated ; while the second , fig.[fig : fig4 ] , reports the response over the cooling sequence . \n .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]            depending on the precise thermal condition supported by the plant , we can identify different thermoelectric responses . consider the first warming sequence of fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . \n one may identify five events ( labelled from a to e ) . during the first period ( fig . \n [ fig : fig3]a ) , the temperature difference is roughly constant . \n the plant presents a large fluctuating thermoelectric response while the control wire is characterized by a constant seebeck coefficient . during the second period , shown on fig . \n [ fig : fig3]b , the plant s reaction is essentially sensitive to the temperature variation rate @xmath16 . \n this sensitivity has already been observed in studies devoted to plant sensing @xcite . \n the processes taking place within the zones a and b can be also observed in the c and d zones ; and when the rate @xmath16 is reduced , we observe a linear response for the plant , as shown in the zone e. it thus appears clearly that the passive response , probably mostly due to the xylem properties , can be strongly modified by active physiological processes . \n this latter appears to be particularly sensitive to the time derivative of the stress , but not so much on the intensity of the stress itself ; this observation is perfectly consistent with previous findings @xcite . \n we now turn to the cooling sequence , fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] . \n the cooling rate is approximately constant , except for the two events when it is clearly larger than the average as indicated with the labels a and b , on the upper right panel . \n these events relate to time delays , also apparent in the measured data for the control wire on the upper left panel : these are signatures of the change of rate @xmath16 . \n note that although these may serve as a probe , time delays must be considered with care , since in the case of very large time response of a system , they may lead to erroneous interpretations @xcite . \n the shape of the plant response for events taking place in the zones a and b is very similar to that of figs . \n [ fig : fig3]b and [ fig : fig3]d , which confirms the acute sensitivity of the plant to the rate @xmath16 . \n this physiological response is the fastest response to a stress that a plant can use , as it has no means to avoid it . \n the last sequence depicted on fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] concerns the plant s response to warming at a reduced rate . \n it is essentially linear , thus confirming the presence of a threshold rate process for the plant s response to a given stress . \n it also shows unambiguously that thermoelectricity naturally partakes in the complex processes that contribute to a plant s life . \n all the effects discussed in the present work are related to the internal modifications of the ionic concentrations inside the plant , including the regulation of cellular ion transporters allowing ion release into the xylem sap toward the shoots . \n it is clear that while the response is mainly driven by a classical thermoelectric process with a giant seebeck coefficient , the physiology of the plant interferes in a complex way with it . \n a complete numerical model , including series and parallel assemblies of living ( phloem sieve tube elements , root and endodermis cells ) and dead cells ( xylem tracheids and vessels ) , will be considered for further investigation of the interplay between physiologic and thermoelectric response to a thermal stress . \n further , since there is no limitation in the number of thermodynamic potentials which may be coupled @xcite , we may account for pressure and derive a complete response of a system to the direct and the cross- effects of the three thermodynamic potentials , @xmath17 . \n then the lowering of a local pressure gradient , by the coupled effect of the temperature and the electrochemical potential becomes possible . \n this latter process may contribute to the motion of saps in plant , and especially in trees . \n the reported measurements are fully scalable from the unique cell size to a complete plant or tree . in addition to \n the stationary response observed here , the voltage fluctuations are also of great interest since they permit the study of the threshold of the physiological response through its noisy signals . \n as observed in other systems , the noise response is a very sensitive probe of the emergence of a macroscopic response @xcite . \n taking each cell as a fluctuator , the convolution of the individual responses may lead to different signatures depending on the considered scale of the sample . \n seeds of bush bean ( phaseolus vulgaris l. cv . \n contender ) were sown into pots containing vermiculite as soil . \n the bean seedlings were grown in a growth chamber at @xmath18c with a cycle of 12 hours of light ( 40 @xmath1mol photon m@xmath19 s@xmath20 ) , 12 hours of darkness . \n the plants were watered at the bottom of the pots every three days . \n the 21 days old plants were removed from the vermiculite . \n roots were carefully rinsed with water to remove vermiculite particles and then transferred in dilute kcl solution ( 120 mm ) for experiments . \n two electrodes were placed respectively at the surface of the root and the stem of the living plant . \n the electrodes connected to the stems are made of ag / agcl wires moistened with 200 mm kcl and wrapped in cellophane to provide appropriate contact with the plant surface .", "StartTimeOffset": 2044234348679, "RequestID": "d1be97c6b99f4b9bbde687feba17252b", "TotalTokens": 4078}

distributions have been introduced and studied . especially well - known are functions from the glauber and cahill s - parameterized class of distributions @xcite containing the wigner function , the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-representation @xcite , and the husimi or the @xmath1-representation @xcite .    for many systems the wigner function is well known and has been carefully studied , but there are some elementary quantum mechanical states , for which this phase space representation is not known . \n an example of such system is the hydrogen atom . \n no exact analytical formula of the wigner function is known even for the 1s state . in the literature \n one can find a limited number of papers devoted to this subject @xcite , and all the published results have been achieved using methods of approximation . \n it is the purpose of this short communication to present an analytical phase space representation of the hydrogen atom using a lesser - known kirkwood  rihaczek ( k - r ) distribution function @xcite . \n its form allows us to obtain analytical results , and as we have shown in @xcite this distribution , like the wigner function , fully characterizes a quantum state . \n in general , the problem of defining a joint probability function in phase space lies in the operator ordering . \n because different orderings of position @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 operators are not equivalent , the association of the quantum operator with classical functions has no unique solution . \n the association of classical phase space functions @xmath4 with quantum operators is shown by : @xmath5 the fourier decomposition of the dirac delta functions makes it possible to rewrite the above equation in the form @xmath6 for every operator ordering there exists a corresponding probability quasi - distribution in phase space . \n the wigner distribution function is obtained by taking a quantum average of the above formula with the respect to the wigner - weyl ordering : @xmath7 in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 operators are put in the same exponent .    the k \n r distribution function corresponds to an ordering called the anti - standard ordering , that is obtained by putting all @xmath10 operators on the left of all @xmath11 operators : @xmath12 the complex conjugation of the k \n r function corresponds to the standard ordering ( all operators @xmath11 are on the left followed by @xmath9 operators ) , and the real part of the k \n r distribution function is obtained by a symmetric superposition of the anti - standard and the standard ordering : @xmath13 . \n obviously , the wigner - weyl ordering and the anti - standard ordering are not equivalent , so they lead to different quasi - distributions . but both of these orderings are intuitive and simple ones , and appropriate phase space distribution functions have the same marginal properties . \n the definition of the famous wigner quasi - distribution function was firstly presented as : @xmath14 although for most one dimensional systems formula ( [ zwig ] ) allows to evaluate the wigner function relatively easily , in three dimensions this problem is more complicated . \n integrals become quite cumbersome and sometimes impossible to handle analytically . as we have mentioned before , an analytical formula for the wigner function \n is not known even for 1s state of hydrogen atom . \n that is why , in order to investigate the hydrogen atom in phase space we shall use the k \n r distribution . \n this function was introduced by kirkwood @xcite just one year after wigner introduced his function . \n then , in 1968 , the same function was rediscovered by rihaczek @xcite in the context of signal time - frequency distributions and is known by his name in signal transmitting theory . \n the definition of the k \n r function in terms of anti - standard ordering has a simple form : @xmath15 elsewhere @xcite we have presented an extensive analysis of the k  r distribution and its comparison with the wigner distribution function . here \n we will only mention the main properties of the k  r function . \n similar to the wigner function , the k - r distribution has the correct marginal properties : @xmath16 hydrogen atom in phase space ----------------------------    the definition of the k - r distribution ( [ zrih ] ) allows one to evaluate analytical formulas of this distribution for many complicated quantum mechanical states , for which the analytical expression of the wigner function is not accessible .    in the following \n we will present analytical results obtained for states of the hydrogen atom . \n the wave functions of a non -

sections . \n we have decided to use the following method to represent the hydrogen atom in phase space : all the figures labelled by ( a ) , ( b ) ( later called fig . \n x.a , x.b ) are auxiliary ones \n they present hydrogen atom wave functions in position and momentum representation and the arrows depicted on those figures show the directions chosen for the cross - sections . \n the corresponding cross - sections of the k - r phase space functions are plotted in figures labelled by ( c ) and ( d ) ( fig . \n x.c , x.d ) . \n all the figures are organized as follows : fig x.a shows cross - section @xmath32 of the absolute square of hydrogen atom wave function in the position representation , i.e. @xmath33 which is the probability density of finding an electron at point @xmath34 ( and which does not depend on the value of @xmath35 ) . \n x.b shows cross - section @xmath36 of the absolute square of the same wave function in the momentum representation , i.e. @xmath37 which is the probability density of finding an electron with momentum @xmath38 ( and here again , a cross - section does not depend on the value of @xmath39 ) . \n the arrows depicted on the fig . \n x.a , x.b show the directions chosen for the cross - sections of the corresponding k - r phase space functions that are presented in fig . \n x.c , where the real part of the k  r distribution and appropriate contour plot are shown , and in fig x.d , where the absolute value of this k  r distribution and its contour plot are plotted . \n let us first study the k - r function of the @xmath40 state . \n well - known solutions of the radial part of the schrdinger equation are given by , in atomic unit : @xmath41 fig . \n 1.a shows spatial probability density @xmath42 of finding an electron at certain point , and fig . \n 1.b shows momentum probability density @xmath43 of finding an electron with definite momentum . \n note , that those are not radial distributions and they have nonzero values at @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the wave functions were not multiplied by @xmath46 or @xmath47 factors . \n the k - r distribution of @xmath26 state is given by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 fig . \n 1.c shows the real part of eq . \n ( [ s1 ] ) , @xmath53 , multiplied by @xmath54 : @xmath55.\\ ] ] the cross - section is chosen in the directions depicted by arrows in fig . \n 1.a , 1.b . \n next we have displayed its contour plot . \n the absolute value of eq . \n ( [ s1 ] ) multiplied by @xmath54 is : @xmath56\\ ] ] and its contour plot is presented in fig 1.d . in this case , \n @xmath57 and @xmath58 look quite similar mainly because the wave function both in position and momentum representation decreases rapidly with the increase of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , and the oscillating @xmath59-like structure characteristic for the real part of k - r distribution is not clearly seen on the scale used to make these figures . \n these oscillations are merely marked in the contour plot of @xmath53 by dashed lines which correspond to @xmath60 . \n next we shall examine the k \n r distribution of 2s and 2p states . \n solutions of the radial part of the schrdinger equation in momentum representation are given by : @xmath61 thus , the corresponding k \n r distribution are of the form : @xmath62 where @xmath49 is defined by eq . \n ( [ q ] ) . \n the real part of eq . \n ( [ s2 ] ) and appropriate contour plot are shown in fig . 2.c and the real part of eq . \n ( [ p2 ] ) in fig . \n 3.c . the absolute value of eqs . \n ( [ s2],[p2 ] ) and their contour plots are presented in fig . \n 2.d and fig . \n 3.d , respectively . the plot presented in fig . \n 3.d has one maximum at @xmath63 the location of which does not depend on variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath39 chosen for the cross section . \n this result is in perfect agreement with what we expect for the state which has quantum numbers @xmath22 , @xmath23 satisfying the condition @xmath67 . in fig . \n 3.c , where the real part of the k \n r distribution is presented , we see the additional minimum . it is due to @xmath59-like oscillations of the real part of the k  r distribution . \n actually , there is an infinite number of alternate maxima and minima but their amplitude decreases rapidly and only two are seen on this scale . \n dashed lines depicted on this ( and every other contour - plot ) denote @xmath68 . according to the results of fig . \n 2.d the absolute value of the k \n r distribution for the @xmath27 state also has quite a simple form : we notice one global and three local maxima on this cross section . fig . \n 2.c , where the real part of the same function is presented , is much more complicated when we look at it close up ( see contour plot ) : extrema are localized on lines where @xmath59 achieves its extremal value , but on this regular structure is another one  the wave function dependence on @xmath50 and @xmath51 that is responsible for the appearance of additional zeros and sign  changes of the plotted figure . \n finally we shall present an instructive example of a rydberg state . \n figure [ f4 ] shows the k - r distribution for a state with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . \n the real part of the k \n r distribution is shown in fig . \n [ f4].c , and the absolute value is shown in fig . \n [ f4].d . just as one would expect \n there is one peak in the absolute value plot and similar , but modified by @xmath59 , structure in the real part of the plot . comparing the figures with that shown in fig . \n [ f3].c - d we notice similarities in their structure . \n obviously , peaks are located at different values of @xmath71 but there is the property that for states with @xmath67 we observe one maximum in the absolute value plot . \n its location changes with the increase of @xmath22 ( it moves towards larger @xmath50 and smaller @xmath51 ) and the maximum value gets much smaller , but it is apparent this class of states has much in common . \n figure [ f5 ] shows the k \n r distribution for state @xmath69 , @xmath72 . \n analysis similar to that made above holds true when we compare fig . \n [ f5 ] and [ f2 ] . without counting that all the scales have changed we find 4 extrema ( @xmath73 ) in the absolute value plots and similar oscillating structures in the real part plots . \n it is a general and well known result that @xmath74 is equal to the number of extrema of hydrogen atom wave functions both in position and momentum representation . \n we only stress that the k - r distribution renders very well this property : its absolute value has @xmath73 extrema . \n we have presented a phase space representation of the hydrogen atom using the k - r distribution . \n an advantage of such a representation is that the system can be treated analytically . \n it is an attractive feature of the k - r distribution that as long as one knows the wave function of the system there is no need to perform any integrals to obtain this distribution value in every point of phase space . \n we have described in detail the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 states of the hydrogen atom . \n plots corresponding to the k \n r functions of these states were presented and compared with the plots of probability densities in position and momentum representations . \n we thank s. daffer for comments about the final draft . this work was partially supported by a kbn grant 2p03 b 02123 , and the european commission through the research training network quest .", "StartTimeOffset": 2075475448941, "RequestID": "ca2d769dc0a240dc879756c038f91be8", "TotalTokens": 3779}
