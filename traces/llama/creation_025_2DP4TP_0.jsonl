One employee tells WSOC that the room \"erupted in emotion,\" with people \"crying\" and \"yelling,\" partly because a deputy on staff had recently been lost to suicide. After the meeting, the EMS workers banded together with other EMS workers across the state, as well as local firefighters and retired law enforcement members, to protest Bronson's words. Per WIS, the head of an EMS crisis management group called Bronson's remarks \"absolutely appalling,\" \"insensitive,\" \"unprofessional,\" and \"childish,\" especially to a group of workers \"who deal with death and crisis situations every day.\" Per Quorum Columbia, Bronson tried to apologize Friday in an email, noting he'd lost someone close to him to suicide, but he submitted his resignation Monday, acknowledging the \"horrible and terrible thing\" he'd said.

No motive was given for the attack, though police say the men were involved in a long-running feud. The Herald Courier reports the warrant for Ferguson's arrest couldn't be served until Tuesday because of how serious Ferguson's injuries were. He remains jailed on a $25,000 bond.

But officials in charge of the Kaduna airport first have a few logistical challenges to deal with before all of the new flights are redirected there: namely, to stop cows from sleeping on the runway, keep safe the travelers heading from the airport into Abuja on a route known to be hit by bandits, and prevent local livestock from wandering onto the premises. \"The goats have chewed some holes, but we're patching them up,\" Mohammed Sani, one of the airport's engineers, says. The difference in flight loads between the two airports is stark: While Abuja saw more than 800 flights land in December, Kaduna handled only a dozen. Some international carriers, including Lufthansa and British Airways, are already balking at the rerouting and say they won't fly into Kaduna. But aircraft and law enforcement officials told Nigeria's Guardian last week that the airport is ready for the influx, complete with technology upgrades and security reinforcements. Sani, who's been tasked with helping to bring the Kaduna airport up to speed, is determined to overcome all of the formidable-sounding challenges. \"We have no choice,\" he tells the Journal, adding, \"I'm keeping a mattress here.\" (Check out the best and worst airports in the US.)", "StartTimeOffset": 565632671299, "RequestID": "6ea912d30ad54768b5400e07cd39c88d", "TotalTokens": 1004}

As the New York Times recounts, Gustafsson says he and the others stopped counting the number of times they were moved once that count hit 100. They were initially blindfolded, bound, and forced to make ransom videos in Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits. That all changed four months in once the men decided to convert to Islam. For their remaining time in captivity (Rijke was released in April 2015, McGown in August), they lived alongside their captors in a situation Gustafsson likened to \"a prison sentence and Robinson Crusoe.\" He tried to escape once, and spent two nights walking through the desert before being recaptured. Sweden's foreign minister says diplomatic efforts eventually prevailed; a source disputes that, telling the Times $4.2 million made its way to the captors via a South African charity.

The investigation by Yellowstone officials into Murphy's death was kept private, but KULR obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request, the AP reports. The investigative report reveals Murphy's wife told park authorities that Murphy was looking for the treasure when she called to report him missing. Murphy's body was found June 9, 2017. He had fallen about 500 feet down a steep slope. The report ruled the death an accident. The lure of the treasure, which is said to be worth nearly $2 million, has prompted thousands to comb areas of New Mexico, Yellowstone National Park, and elsewhere. Murphy is one of several people who have died while looking for the treasure; the deaths have led some to call for an end the treasure hunt. Besides the danger to the treasure hunters, they note that search and rescue efforts for missing treasure hunters are costly.

That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to childbearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfillment of women as people.\" The Times reports Morais, now 72, plans to pursue her case once more in Portugal with the goal of being awarded greater damages.

In what the study in Gender Issues describes as a \"low violation\" scenario, the male asks to borrow a pen; in the \"high violation\" or \"disconcerting\" scenario, he suggests she try modeling and asks to take her photo. The women were then asked a series of questions, including whether they would comply; most said yes to the pen and no to the photo, regardless of how attractive the man was. But they also ranked each man as to how friendly, ambitious, mean, rude, and creepy (and more) he was. In the low-violation case, both men's personalities were perceived to be similar.

This has real-world implications, says researcher Jonathan Gore. \"A man who stands trial has already shown himself to have violated social norms in one way or another.

Cardi allegedly confronted Jade and her sister, fellow bartender Baddie Gi, and then told her entourage to attack the women. Cardi, who just had a baby the month prior to the incident and also recently got into an alleged brawl with Nicki Minaj, was \"throwing chairs, bottles, and hookahs in the club at 3am,\" a police spokesperson tells CNN.

At hearings that started Monday at the court's headquarters in the Hague, Tehran asked judges at the world court to urgently suspend the sanctions to protect Iranian interests while the case challenging their legality is being heard\u2014a process that can take years. The AP has much more: Background: Trump said in May that he would pull the United States out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don't cut off Iranian oil imports by early November. US response: In a written statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the legal move an attempt by Tehran \"to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security.\" The United States, which argues that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case, is to present its legal arguments to judges on Tuesday. More on Iran's argument: Iranian representative Mohsen Mohebi told the court the US decision was a clear breach of the 1955 treaty as it was \"intended to damage, as severely as possible, Iran's economy.\" Mohebi said the re-imposition of sanctions was unjustified as Iran was abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal. He said sanctions are already having damaging effects on Iran's economy and society and threaten to further destabilize the volatile Mideast. More background: The 1955 treaty was signed when the US and Iran were still allies following the 1953 revolution\u2014fomented by Britain and the US\u2014that ultimately cemented the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Iran and the US have a history of litigation at the International Court of Justice, in cases covering crises including the Tehran embassy hostage-taking and the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet mistaken by a US warship for a fighter jet. Rulings by the world court, which settles disputes between nations, are final and legally binding.

Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, says she's \"surprised\" by the rapid melt-off (about 13 feet during July), per NBC News, \"even though it has been ridiculously warm.\" Once towering 6,892.4 feet, the southern peak was down to 6,879.2 feet as of Friday, per Business Insider. The northern peak measures at 6,879.3 feet. Rosqvist, speaking to a local Swedish paper, says the melting glacier is symbolic of climate change, per the Times. When first measured in 1880, the southern peak was more than 6,965 feet tall. Since 1995, it has shrunk about 3 feet per year. Still, the southern tip is expected to gain back a bit of lost height during the winter, and the title of highest point may vacillate between the southern and northern peaks in years to come. One consequence of the melting southern peak is that climbers may now opt to tackle the northern peak so they can say they climbed to the highest point in Sweden, a rescue worker tells the Times. And, he says, that peak is \"much harder to climb\" due to the topography. Record heat has also affected Sweden's reindeer herders, causing a lack of vegetation and snow melt that makes it so \"not even the reindeer can find a place to get relief from the sun,\" Rosqvist says.", "StartTimeOffset": 1227829536291, "RequestID": "81af26857bb14858851b3b549f70bc22", "TotalTokens": 1404}

Luckily the potato was removed without surgery, and medical staff predicted no long-term physical effects, but Rojas blamed the mother for giving her daughter such bad advice.

She and her child (no age is given) were watched via baby monitor and kept in a padlocked room with a concrete floor, in an arrangement that the US attorney called \"modern-day slavery.\" The suspects allegedly kept their captives in line by beating them and threatening to kill them and using pit bulls and pythons to frighten them. They also took SE's monthly public assistance payments. Among the many horrifying details in the affidavit: SE's child was kept in a single room all day, and she was not permitted to feed the child fruits or vegetables\u2014though she was ordered to feed those items to an iguana. The affidavit also states that Callahan and Hunt intentionally injured SE (in one case, striking her hand with a rock) so she would be prescribed pain medication they could take. Police were clued into the situation in October, when SE stole a candy bar from a Family Dollar while shopping for her alleged captors\u2014and asked authorities to take her to jail. When police questioned her, she revealed that the people she lived with were \"mean,\" and police launched an investigation.

And it explains why humans' yawns, at 6.5 seconds, are the longest yawns in the animal kingdom, beating out those of gorillas, lions, elephants, and more. However, not all scientists are convinced yawning serves a cooling function, and some point to its contagiousness as evidence of a sociological function.

To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually.

Critics say it fits with a narrative that Pruitt plans another run for office, perhaps as governor or senator, and is cultivating political ties in his home state, reports Reuters. An EPA spokesperson disputes that, saying that \"Administrator Pruitt works long hours and is available around the clock,\" she says. \"He is extremely focused and disciplined, which is evident by the fact that he spearheaded over two dozen significant regulatory actions since being sworn in.\" The report shows that Pruitt traveled home 10 times over the three-month span, generally for long weekends. On some of those trips, he picked up a portion of the travel costs himself, though the Times frames the costs as being \"largely at taxpayer expense.\" In all, his federal travel expenses totaled $12,000. The EIP says it sought the records after fielding complaints that it was difficult to arrange meetings with Pruitt in Washington, DC, because he was so rarely there. \"The American people aren't paying taxes for part-time Cabinet officials,\" says Liz Purchia Gannon, who served as spokeswoman for former Obama EPA chief Gina McCarthy. The report shows that Pruitt would sometimes stay in Oklahoma three to five days, though he had only one official meeting on his schedule. Pruitt's appointment to the EPA was controversial because he frequently sued the agency as Oklahoma's AG.", "StartTimeOffset": 1683832205117, "RequestID": "d5db39c9d1404cfab9d9a439aeb9c0d6", "TotalTokens": 1115}

In fact, more than 4,000 brewers are battling for less than a dozen popular hop varieties \"like a bunch of wolves going after a carcass,\" Wicked Weed Brewing co-owner Luke Dickinson tells the Wall Street Journal. The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65% in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature (it takes the vines two to three years), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. \"To deal with a few boxes of this [variety] and few pellets of that is a real challenge,\" says Diane Gooding of Gooding Farms in Idaho.

It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to Burgos or Beresford-Redman. Witnesses recant: Hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said Beresford-Redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a British family had complained\u2014in a handwritten note\u2014of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: A forensic scientist and criminologist hired by Beresford-Redman's Mexican defense attorney said Burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel. He also found no evidence tying Beresford-Redman to the crime. An expert for the prosecution and an independent forensic expert brought in by the judge couldn't link him to it either. Beresford-Redman is now facing more charges, because Mexican officials are upset about a recent 48 Hours special in which the producer recorded video diaries revealing, among other things, the \"noisy ... smelly ... sweaty and hot and cramped\" conditions of his life in prison.

The photo angered Peter Booth, who confided in a cousin about what he had seen on the night of the boy's death nearly 50 years ago.

Peter Booth told the court that he snuck down from his room the night of Oct. 1, 1968, to get a drink and saw Dearlove deliberately swing Paul Booth by his ankles into the fireplace, head-first. He said he fled back to his room in fear, because Dearlove was regularly abusive, and kept what he saw a secret.
