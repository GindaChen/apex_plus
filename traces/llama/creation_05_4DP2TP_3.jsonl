Their formula-filled study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, kicks off with this sentence: \"Popcorn is the funniest corn to cook, because it jumps and makes a 'pop' sound in our pans.\" But Emmanuel Virot and Alexandre Ponomarenko get far more scientific from there, noting that while previous studies have examined the conditions needed to properly pop corn, the physical origin of a kernel bursting open, jumping, and making that sound remain \"elusive in the literature.\" Using elementary tools of thermodynamics and fracture mechanics (along with an oven, a microphone, and some cameras), they set out to solve the mystery. Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees Fahrenheit, 96% of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture (the Guardian reports kernels are 14% water) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains Phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture. A camera taking 2,900 frames per second captured what happens next: At 6.9 milliseconds, the starch expands; at 13.8ms, \"we observe the formation of a 'leg' which is compressed on the plate.\" Some 7ms later, \"this leg bounces and the popcorn jumps.\" As for the pop, they determined that it's not caused by the kernel cracking or the popcorn jumping (as in a pan)\u2014it's triggered by the pressurized vapor being released. \"More precisely, the pressure drop excites cavities inside the popcorn as if it were an acoustic resonator.\" (Scientists have also finally figured out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.)", "StartTimeOffset": 211294966541, "RequestID": "ffe5104a5a9b4883bacb4c1d48784c75", "TotalTokens": 1423}

He performed with a regional affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan starting in 2012, Courthouse News Service reports.

The story was later corrected, but TMZ never issued a retraction, and other news outlets picked up TMZ's original, incorrect version, the lawsuit says. As a result, the Wu-Tang Clan apparently believed Roxx to be the person who had done the penis-cutting and put a picture of him on its blog along with a blog post saying, \"This motherf---er ain't got s--- to do with the Wu-Tang brand!\" Roxx says that, though the Wu-Tang Clan's Killah Priest later acknowledged Roxx wasn't the true subject of the story, he said he couldn't allow Roxx to perform with Wu-Tang-affiliated musicians since some members of the public still believed him to be the penis-cutter. Now Roxx is suing not just TMZ and its parent company but, according to the Hollywood Reporter, a number of other media outlets that picked up the story, blaming them for his loss of the Wu-Tang Clan's endorsement, as well as for the harassment he received in prison (where he was when the story broke) from other inmates over the story.

Shortly after the Allied victory, a British officer removed the phone from the Fuhrerbunker, his son Ranulf Rayner, 82, previously told CNN. \"My father didn't see it as a relic of Hitler's glory days, more a battered remnant of his defeat, a sort of war trophy.\" The auction house explains that as the Russians gave Rayner's father, Ralph, a tour of the bunker, they offered him the black phone used by Hitler's wife, Eva Braun. He responded that his favorite color was red, and so they handed him Hitler's phone instead.

Elise Huchard and Dieter Lukas studied 260 species; in about 45% of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says Huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies\u2014though not their own\u2014so the mom is available for mating. In the case of Chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes Lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the \"most detailed to date\" on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But Mom has a Jerry Springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the Telegraph reports. After all, \"males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own,\" Lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: The researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports Smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too.

Mashable reports on a photo tweeted out Thursday by the Washington Free Beacon that showed a somewhat disheveled-looking Schumer chatting with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse (who looked like he just came from the gym) outside the US Capitol. The paper asked viewers to come up with their own caption, and Sasse was one of the first to acknowledge the odd candid, noting the pic looks like he and Schumer were \"smoking reefer outside a wedding.\" Schumer replied with a \"well that escalated quickly\" (a line from Anchorman, Business Insider helpfully notes), right before the memes started proliferating. That's when Cruz must have started feeling left out of the senatorial snarkfest. \"So anyway, it's a romper for guys and it's called the RompHim and I just ordered two,\" Cruz (or whoever runs his Twitter account) tweeted, referencing the \"fashion revolution\" that's been circulating online this week. Mashable concedes the joke was \"really great,\" while one commenter pointed out a peripheral subject in the photo: a \"creepy\" face-like object in one of the building's windows. \"Spicy in a Michael Myers mask,\" riffed another.

Prosecutors say Maria Kukucova shot Andrew Bush twice in the head and once in the shoulder at his home in the southern beach resort of Estepona on April 5, 2014, and are seeking to have her imprisoned for 20 years. Kukucova, 26, testified she didn't know how many shots were fired because the first one was so loud that she went temporarily deaf, hearing nothing just after it. \"I didn't want to cause him any harm,\" Kukucova says, sniffling and trying to hold back tears. \"The gun just went off. I only wanted to break free from his grasp.\" Her jury trial in Malaga started Monday and is expected to last at least three days. Bush was 48 and owned a jewelry store in Britain where Kukucova had worked before he moved to Spain. The two broke up about a month before the killing following a relationship of more than two years. Kukucova testified she spent two days alone inside his house and that he arrived after a trip with a Russian girlfriend, Maria Korotaeva. Bush told Korotaeva to go outside the home and get into his car after finding Kukucova, and he and Kukucova started fighting, the suspect testified. Kukucova claims Bush grabbed her and said he'd kill her and her family, then locked the door and pointed the gun at her, the Telegraph reports. Kukucova fled to Slovakia and turned herself in to police four days after the killing. She was extradited to Spain a month later.", "StartTimeOffset": 1575150168623, "RequestID": "6c8979dfcf7446449b5681c5afef4d16", "TotalTokens": 1009}
