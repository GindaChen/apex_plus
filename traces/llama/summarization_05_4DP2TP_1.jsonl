murphy _ et.al . \n _ from oxford university reported their design of a frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) for precise alignment of the atlas inner detector @xcite . \n given the demonstrated need for improvements in detector performance , we plan to design an enhanced fsi system to be used for the alignment of tracker elements in the next generation of electron positron linear collider detectors . \n current plans for future detectors require a spatial resolution for signals from a tracker detector , such as a silicon microstrip or silicon drift detector , to be approximately 7 - 10 @xmath1@xcite . to achieve this required spatial resolution \n , the measurement precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be on the order of 1 @xmath1 . \n simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers will be used to determine the 3-dimensional positions of the tracker elements . \n the university of michigan group constructed two demonstration frequency scanned interferometer ( fsi ) systems with laser beams transported by air or single - mode optical fiber in the laboratory for initial feasibility studies . \n absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency@xcite . \n the main goal of the demonstration systems was to determine the potential accuracy of absolute distance measurements that could be achieved under controlled conditions . \n secondary goals included estimating the effects of vibrations and studying error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy . \n the main contents of this proceedings article come from our published paper@xcite . \n however , new material in this paper includes a description of a dual - laser system and a possible optical alignment for a silicon tracker detector . \n the intensity @xmath2 of any two - beam interferometer can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the intensities of the two combined beams , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the phases . assuming the optical path lengths of the two beams are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the phase difference in eq . \n ( 1 ) is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical frequency of the laser beam , and c is the speed of light .    for a fixed path interferometer , as the frequency of the laser \n is continuously scanned , the optical beams will constructively and destructively interfere , causing `` fringes '' . \n the number of fringes @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the optical path difference between the two beams , and @xmath15 is the scanned frequency range . \n the optical path difference ( opd for absolute distance between beamsplitter and retroreflector ) can be determined by counting interference fringes while scanning the laser frequency . \n a schematic of the fsi system with a pair of optical fibers is shown in fig.1 . \n the light source is a new focus velocity 6308 tunable laser ( 665.1 nm @xmath16 675.2 nm ) . a high - finesse ( @xmath17 ) thorlabs sa200 f \n - p is used to measure the frequency range scanned by the laser . the free spectral range ( fsr ) of two adjacent f - p peaks \n is 1.5 ghz , which corresponds to 0.002 nm . \n a faraday isolator was used to reject light reflected back into the lasing cavity . \n the laser beam was coupled into a single - mode optical fiber with a fiber coupler . \n data acquisition is based on a national instruments daq card capable of simultaneously sampling 4 channels at a rate of 5 ms / s / ch with a precision of 12-bits . \n omega thermistors with a tolerance of 0.02 k and a precision of 0.01 @xmath18 are used to monitor temperature . \n the apparatus is supported on a damped newport optical table .    in order to reduce air flow and temperature fluctuations , \n a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the optical table . \n pvc pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam . inside the pvc pipes , \n the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about @xmath19 . \n temperature fluctuations were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and pvc pipes . \n detectors for hep experiments must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation , high voltage or strong magnetic fields . \n in addition , precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other detector components , making access difficult . for practical hep application of fsi , optical fibers for light delivery and return \n are therefore necessary . \n the beam intensity coupled into the return optical fiber is very weak , requiring ultra - sensitive photodetectors for detection . \n considering the limited laser beam intensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of interferometers , it is vital to increase the geometrical efficiency . to this end , a collimator is built by placing an optical fiber in a ferrule ( 1 mm diameter ) and gluing one end of the optical fiber to a grin lens . \n the grin lens is a 0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture , 1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength of 630 nm . \n the density of the outgoing beam from the optical fiber is increased by a factor of approximately 1000 by using a grin lens . \n the return beams are received by another optical fiber and amplified by a si femtowatt photoreceiver with a gain of @xmath20 . \n for a fsi system , drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the scan will be magnified by a factor of @xmath21 , where @xmath11 is the average optical frequency of the laser beam and @xmath22 is the scanned frequency range . for the full scan of our laser , @xmath23 . \n small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible effects for many optical applications may have a significant impact on a fsi system . a single - frequency vibration may be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitude , frequency and phase of the vibration , respectively . if @xmath28 is the start time of the scan , eq . \n ( 2 ) can be re - written as @xmath29/c \\end{array } \\eqno{(3)}\\ ] ] if we approximate @xmath30 , the measured optical path difference @xmath31 may be expressed as @xmath32 \\times \\\\ \\sin[\\pi f_{vib}(t+t_0)+\\phi_{vib } ] \\end{array } \\eqno{(4)}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the true optical path difference in the absence of vibrations . \n if the path - averaged refractive index of ambient air @xmath34 is known , the measured distance is @xmath35 . \n if the measurement window size @xmath36 is fixed and the window used to measure a set of @xmath37 is sequentially shifted , the effects of the vibration will be evident . \n we use a set of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting the fixed - length measurement window one f - p peak forward each time . \n the arithmetic average of all measured @xmath37 values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan ( although more sophisticated fitting methods can be used to extract the central value ) . for a large number of distance measurements @xmath38 \n , the vibration effects can be greatly suppressed . \n of course , statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination , dominant in our current system , can also be reduced with multiple scans . \n averaging multiple measurements in one scan , however , provides similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from independent scans , and is faster , more efficient , and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift . in this way \n , we can improve the distance accuracy dramatically if there are no significant drift errors during one scan , caused , for example , by temperature variation . \n this multiple - distance - measurement technique is called slip measurement window with fixed size , shown in fig.2 . \n however , there is a trade off in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of @xmath38 because of the larger magnification factor @xmath39 for a smaller measurement window size .    in order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration , another multiple - distance - measurement technique called slip measurement window with fixed start point \n is used , as shown in fig.2 . in eq . \n ( 3 ) , if @xmath28 is fixed , the measurement window size is enlarged one f - p peak for each shift , an oscillation of a set of measured @xmath37 values indicates the amplitude and frequency of vibration . \n this technique is not suitable for distance measurement because there always exists an initial bias term , from @xmath28 , which can not be determined accurately in our current system . \n the typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in one scan using the above technique is shown in fig.3(a ) , where the scanning rate was 0.5 nm / s and the sampling rate was 125 ks / s . \n measured distances minus their average value for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(b ) . the standard deviations ( rms ) of distance measurements for 10 sequential scans \n are plotted versus number of measurements ( @xmath38 ) per scan in fig.3(c ) . \n it can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of @xmath38 . \n the rms of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is 1.6 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan ( @xmath40 ) . \n if @xmath41 and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is considered as the final measured distance of the scan , the rms of the final measured distances for 10 scans is 41 nm for the distance of 449828.965 @xmath1 , the relative distance measurement precision is 91 ppb .    the standard deviation ( rms ) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is approximately 1.5 @xmath1 if there is only one distance measurement per scan for closed box data . by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique , the distance measurement precisions for various closed box data with distances ranging from 10 cm to 70 cm collected in the past year are improved significantly ; precisions of approximately 50 nanometers are demonstrated under laboratory conditions , as shown in table 1 . \n all measured precisions listed in table 1 . \n are the rms s of measured distances for 10 sequential scans . \n two fsi demonstration systems , air fsi and optical fiber fsi , are constructed for extensive tests of multiple - distance - measurement technique , air fsi means fsi with the laser beam transported entirely in the ambient atmosphere , optical fiber fsi represents fsi with the laser beam delivered to the interferometer and received back by single - mode optical fibers . \n .distance measurement precisions for various setups using the multiple - distance - measurement technique . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     based on our studies , the slow fluctuations are reduced to a negligible level by using the plastic box and pvc pipes to suppress temperature fluctuations . \n the dominant error comes from the uncertainties of the interference fringes number determination ; the fringes uncertainties are uncorrelated for multiple distance measurements . in this case \n , averaging multiple distance measurements in one scan provides a similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from multiple independent scans . \n but , for open box data , the slow fluctuations are dominant , on the order of few microns in our laboratory . \n the measurement precisions for single and multiple distance open - box measurements are comparable , which indicates that the slow fluctuations can not be adequately suppressed by using the multiple - distance - measurement technique . \n a dual - laser fsi system@xcite intended to cancel the drift error is currently under study in our laboratory .    in order to test the vibration measurement technique , \n a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) was employed to produce vibrations of the retroreflector . \n for instance , the frequency of the controlled vibration source was set to @xmath42 hz with amplitude @xmath43 nanometers . \n the magnification factors , distance measurement residuals and corrected measurement residuals for 2000 measurements in one scan are shown in fig.3(d ) , fig.3(e ) and fig.3(f ) , respectively . \n the extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique , @xmath44  hz , @xmath45 nanometers , agree well with the expectation values . \n in addition , vibration frequencies at 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were studied extensively using our current fsi system . \n the measured vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10 - 15% level for amplitudes , 1 - 2% for frequencies , where we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations . \n vibration frequencies far below 0.1 hz can be regarded as slow fluctuations , which can not be suppressed by the above analysis techniques . \n detailed information about estimation of major error sources for the absolute distance measurement and limitation of our current fsi system is provided elsewhere@xcite . \n a dual - laser fsi system has been built in order to reduce drift error and slow fluctuations occuring during the laser scan . \n two lasers are operating simultaneously , the two laser beams are coupled into one optical fiber but isolated by using two choppers . \n the principle of the dual - laser technique is shown in the following . \n for the first laser , the measured distance @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is drift error during the laser scanning . for the second laser , the measured distance @xmath48 . \n since the two laser beams travel the same optical path during the same period , the drift errors @xmath49 and @xmath50 should be very comparable . under this assumption \n , the true distance can be extracted using the formula @xmath51 , where , @xmath52 , the ratio of magnification factors from two lasers . \n the laser beams are isolated by choppers periodically , so only half the fringes are recorded for each laser , degrading the distance measurement precision . missing fringes during chopped intervals for each laser must be recovered through robust interpolation algorithms . \n the chopper edge transitions make this interpolation difficult . \n several techniques are under study . \n one possible silicon tracker alignment system is shown in fig.4 . \n the left plot shows lines of sight for alignment in r - z plane of the tracker barrel , the middle plot for alignment in x - y plane of the tracker barrel , the right plot for alignment in the tracker forward region . \n red lines / dots show the point - to - point distances need to be measured using fsis . \n there are 752 point - to - point distance measurements in total for the alignment system . \n more studies are needed to optimize the distance measurments grid . \n fox -

beam interactions which can be characterized by collective type behaviour . \n we consider different but related models [ 1 ] of the beam - beam interaction from the point of view of construction of reasonable numerical - analytical approaches . \n it is very important because some beam - beam effects limit luminosity and stability of collider . \n such approaches may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential equations with or without some ( functional ) constraints . \n wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods , which gives us the possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and gives the maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases . \n our approach is based on the variational - wavelet approach from [ 2]-[13 ] , which allows us to consider polynomial and rational type of nonlinearities . \n the constructed solution has the multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes . in this way \n we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time/(phase ) space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode . \n fig.1 demonstrates such decomposition for the finite kick term . \n the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contribution from each level / scale of resolution . in all models below numerical modelling demonstrates the appearance of ( coherent ) high - localized structures and ( stable ) pattern formation . \n starting in part 2 from beam - beam interaction models [ 1 ] we consider in part 3 the approach based on variational - wavelet formulation . \n we give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes . \n our solutions are parametrized by solutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlinearity as initial models and the rest are the linear problems which correspond to concrete details of wavelet calculations . \n in part 4 we consider numerical modelling based on our analytical approach . \n in a.  chao e.a . model [ 1 ] for the simulation of beam - beam interaction the initial collective description by some sort of vlasov - maxwell equation for distribution function @xmath0 @xmath1 is reduced to fokker - planck ( fp ) equation on the first stage    @xmath2    and to some nontrivial dynamical system with complex behaviour @xmath3 on the second stage . \n its solution gives the parameters of enveloping gaussian anzatz for solution of fp equation . \n related model of r.  davidson e.a.[1 ] is based on vlasov - maxwell equations :    @xmath4 \n we obtain our multiscale / multiresolution representations ( formulae ( 9 ) below ) for solutions of equations ( 1),(2),(4 ) via variational - wavelet approach for the following formal systems of equations ( with the corresponding obvious constraints on distribution function ) , which is the general form of these equations . \n let l be an arbitrary ( non ) linear differential / integral operator with matrix dimension @xmath5 , which acts on some set of functions @xmath6 + @xmath7 , @xmath8 from @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 let us consider now the n mode approximation for solution as the following ansatz ( in the same way we may consider different ansatzes ) : @xmath12 we shall determine the coefficients of expansion from the following conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 2]-[13 ] ) : @xmath13 so , we have exactly @xmath14 algebraical equations for @xmath14 unknowns @xmath15 . \n such variational approach reduces the initial problem to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage . \n we consider the multiresolution expansion as the second main part of our construction . \n the solution is parametrized by solutions of two set of reduced algebraical problems , one is linear or nonlinear ( depends on the structure of operator l ) and the rest are some linear problems related to computation of coefficients of algebraic equations ( 8) . these coefficients can be found by some wavelet methods by using compactly supported wavelet basis functions for expansions ( 7 ) . \n we may consider also different types of wavelets including general wavelet packets [ 2]-[13 ] . \n the constructed solution has the following multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes @xmath16 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time / space scales . \n formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into the slow part @xmath17 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary n , m , k. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical process . \n the first terms in the rhs of formulae ( 9 ) correspond on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second ones to detail space . \n particular one - dimensional case of formulae ( 9 ) determines the solution of equations ( 3 ) ( more exactly corresponding constructions are considered in other papers presented during this conference ) . \n but , it should be noted that in this one - dimensional case we have really nontrivial nonlinear dynamics only for functional parameters of enveloping gaussians , which give the solution only for linearization of equations ( 1),(2),(4 ) . \n as we demonstrated , our representation ( 9 ) provides the solution as in linear as in nonlinear cases without any perturbation technique but on the level of expansions in ( functional ) space of solutions . \n the using of wavelet basis with high - localized properties provides good convergence properties of constructed solution ( 9 ) . because affine group of translation and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope . \n we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces or from each underlying scale : the closed subspace @xmath18 corresponds to level j of resolution , or to scale j. our full multiresolution / multiscale decomposition of functional space @xmath19 of solutions of initial problems , which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces @xmath20 : @xmath21 , provides us with formulae ( 9 ) . \n this functional space decomposition corresponds to ( exact ) nonlinear eigenmode decomposition . \n it should be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding ( phase)space / time coordinates . in contrast with different approaches , formulae ( 9 ) \n does not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and represents dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion . \n so , by using wavelet bases with their good ( phase)space / time localization properties we can construct high -

{"ContextTokens": 3493, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last two decades , a significant amount of observational and theoretical effort has been dedicated towards the understanding of an `` unusual '' class of pulsars , namely the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) . \n these relatively bright x - ray sources ( @xmath1ergs@xmath2 ) , discovered either as peculiar short x - ray bursts or steady x - ray emitters , were soon recognised as a distinct class of neutron stars with respect to the well known radio pulsar or x - ray binary populations ( see @xcite for a review ) . \n the arguments that lead to this conclusion are the following : first , axps and sgrs are x - ray pulsators with spin periods in the range 5 - 12s . \n furthermore , their rotational energy loss @xmath3 inferred from their spin - down rate ( @xmath4 , where i , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the neutron star moment of inertia , angular velocity and angular velocity time derivative ) is insufficient to power the observed x - ray luminosity ( note that for the large majority of isolated pulsars , detected both in radio and x - ray band , the x - ray luminosity is typically 0.1% of the @xmath3 ; @xcite ) . \n second , there is no evidence for a companion star ( through the search for doppler orbital modulation of the x - ray spin period , and through observations at other wavelengths ; @xcite ) , which might power their emission through the accretion mechanism , at least with a mass greater than 0.1m@xmath7 . \n an alternative source of energy is therefore required to power the x - ray emission of axps and sgrs .    assuming these sources being isolated x - ray pulsars with a dipole magnetic field configuration and purely magnetic dipole losses , their inferred magnetic fields are extremely high , b@xmath8  g : these magnetic fields have been identified as the possible additional energy reservoir . in fact , \n if axps and sgrs are indeed `` magnetars '' , i. e. isolated highly magnetic neutron stars , many of their bizarre x - ray properties might be explained : the x - ray luminosity is naturally provided by the decay of these ultra - strong magnetic fields , while their peculiar short bursts may result from magnetic induced cracks on the neutron star surface ( @xcite ; 1995 ) . \n moreover , the long lasting flux enhancements observed in some magnetars @xcite may be associated to single fractures on a larger spatial scale , or to the episodic onset of a wind energised by frequent , small scale fractures and/or quasi - steady seismic vibrations @xcite . in this scenario , \n the magnetars magnetic fields are all above the so - called `` quantum critical field '' @xmath9  g , at which the radio pulsations are expected to be suppressed by processes such as photon splitting which may inhibit pair - production cascades @xcite responsible for creating the radio emission of the normal radio pulsars . \n however , the discovery of high magnetic field radio pulsars @xcite and transient radio pulsed emission from one axp @xcite put many uncertainties with this respect making again theoretically plausible a link between axps and radio pulsars .    in the past years , radio observations of axps and sgrs , performed using different antennas and arrays , have given always negative results ( e.g. @xcite ) both to timing and interferometry searches , but revealing in a few cases some reliable associations with snrs @xcite and in one case an interesting stellar wind bubble blown by the massive progenitor @xcite . \n however , in some peculiar circumstances radio counterparts were detected : a ) the sgrs giant flares , rare , catastrophic and highly energetic events , have been discovered powering a radio outburst , which slowly faded with a timescale of weeks @xcite , b ) during the outburst of the only confirmed transient axp , xte j1810 - 197 , the very large array ( vla ) observations ( with angular resolution of 6 \" ) revealed a point source of flux density @xmath10mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite , which has recently been discovered as pulsated at the neutron star spin period @xcite .    with this picture in mind \n we have undertaken a systematic deep search for radio pulsations in three confirmed ( , , ) and one candidate axp ( ) , visible from the southern hemisphere using the parkes radio telescope . \n observations and data analysis are described in  [ sec : obs ] while in  [ sec : results ] we report on the obtained results , discussed in the context of the magnetar scenario in \n [ sec : conclu ] . \n diagram for radio pulsars ( dots ) and magnetars ( stars ) . \n the dashed line represents the limit for radio emission quenching . \n the four sources surrounded by a square emit in radio besides being above this line . \n the three confirmed axps of our sample for which a determination of @xmath11 is available are surrounded by a circle . ] \n in table [ tab1 ] the sample of observed axps is presented . for each object the name , period and period derivative of x - ray pulsations , the derived surface magnetic field , \n the estimated distance d and the association with a snr or with a nebula are listed .    [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     none of the pulsed signals found during this blind search could arise from any of the axps that we observed , because of the discrepancy in position . \n figure [ fig4 ] shows , for four different values of the dm , the upper limits on the flux density at 1.4 ghz reached for the four pointed regions of the sky as a function of the spin period . \n these limits have been estimated using equation [ eq1 ] with @xmath12 and multiplying the limit obtained by a factor @xmath13 taking into account losses due to the search technique ( see @xcite ) . \n note that the @xmath14 threshold adopted here is higher with respect to the one used in the previous step of the analysis : this is because , given the huge amount of radio frequency interferences ( rfi ) with which we have to deal when doing a blind periodicity search ( especially at low s / n ) , we can not safely state as a good candidate a suspect with s / n less than , usually , 8 . \n the rfi problem is not so important when folding the time series at a specific value of the period , hence in that case we can be less conservative using a lower threshold for the candidate selection and , consequently , for the @xmath14 to adopt in the @xmath15 calculation .        in order to verify the reliability of the quoted flux density limits \n , we can compare the catalogued fluxes of the 18 redetected pulsars ( obtained from the atnf pulsar catalogue : ) with those estimated putting in equation [ eq1 ] their detection periods , dms and s / ns ( or mean s / n , for pulsars with multiple detections ) and considering the offset of the detection beam with respect to the true position of the pulsars . \n the ratio between the estimated and the catalogued values of the flux densities are shown , as a function of the rotational period , in figure [ fig5 ] . \n note that the s / n used to estimate the flux density , may sensibly vary from one observation to another ( e.g. because of the different response of different beams in which the pulsar is detected , or because of rfi ) , leading to a large uncertainty in the estimate of the flux density . \n averaging the s / ns from different observations would lead to a better match between the estimated and catalogued fluxes .    ) and the catalogued value of the flux density of the 18 redetected pulsars . the errorbars are drawn assuming , besides the errors on the measured values , a 20% error on the estimated fluxes . \n the mean value of the ratio calculated over the 18 sources is @xmath16 ( 2-@xmath17 error ) . ]    finally no new rrat - like signal has been found in the single pulse search over the 52 observed regions , while two previously known pulsars ( j17053950 and j18440433 ) have been detected also through their single pulses . \n no radio pulsation has been found from the four southern axps observed , down to a limit of @xmath18 mjy ( table [ tab2 ] ) .    comparing the upper limits on the luminosity at 1400 mhz ( defined as @xmath19 ) for our targets with the luminosity of the observed radio pulsar population in the galactic field ( figure [ fig6 ] ) \n , we note that the limits reached by our search are a factor of six lower than the median of the population . \n the values obtained for our sample are in fact in the range 2.8  3.8 mjy kpc@xmath20 ( shaded region in fig . \n [ fig6 ] ) while the median of the distribution in luminosity of the observed radio pulsars in our galaxy is 18.0 mjy kpc@xmath20 . \n if the luminosity function of axps reflects that of observed canonical pulsars we can calculate that the probability for all our four targets to have luminosities below our limits is only @xmath21 . \n similar results are obtained comparing the upper limits on @xmath22 for our sample with the luminosity distribution of only young pulsars ( with characteristic ages @xmath23 yr ) or long period pulsars ( with p @xmath24 3 s ) . \n a comparison with the few high magnetic field radio pulsars ( having magnetic field strengths above the quantum critical field line ; figure [ fig1 ] ) is not statistically significant , having only four objects in this class . \n however we note that all their luminosities , as well as the radio luminosity of @xcite , are greater than the limits obtained for the axps . \n note however that , if we compare our results with the _ intrinsic _ luminosity distribution of the radio pulsars ( dashed line in figure [ fig6 ] ; @xcite ) , we obtain a probability of @xmath25% that our observations are not deep enough to detect a radio pulsed signal from our targets .    in considering the causes of the non detection of a radio pulsed signal from our four targets , besides the luminosity bias , we must take into account the possibility that , although the x - ray beam is pointing toward us , the radio beam , usually narrower , is not . assuming a pulse duty cycle of @xmath26 ( hence a beam semi - aperture @xmath27 ) , typical of long period pulsars and similar to that of the radio pulsed signal detected by @xcite in the transient axp ( @xmath28 at 1.4 ghz ) \n , we can calculate , following e.g. @xcite , that the probability that such a narrow radio beam misses the earth is @xmath29 . \n the composite probability that the beams of all four axps are not pointing toward us is hence @xmath30 . \n the non detection of rrat - like bursts from any of these axps , despite our long exposures , seems to weaken the hypothesis that rrat bursts might be related to the short bursts observed from the magnetars leaving us with other plausible conjectures of a relation with other classes of neutron stars such as middle aged radio pulsars displaying giant pulses @xcite or with x - ray dim isolated neutron stars @xcite . \n the only case of a detection of radio pulsations from an axp concerns the only confirmed transient magnetar @xcite . \n radio emission from this source is strongly related with the occurrence of an outburst of its x - ray emission @xcite , as well as an ir enhancement @xcite . \n furthermore , whereas the x - ray flux is decaying exponentially with timescale of a few hundreds days @xcite , radio emission is still on more than 3 years after the x - ray outburst . \n interestingly the sole other possible transient axp is the candidate , one of our targets . \n our radio observations of this source were performed more than six years after its possible x - ray outburst occurred in 1993 , hence unfortunately nothing can be safely concluded from our upper limits , in favor or against the possible radio and x - ray correlation during the outbursts of this source . \n however , assuming that experienced , after the x - ray outburst , a phase of radio emission similar to that of , our null detection implies that the fading of the radio emission has a time scale of the order of few years : in particular , if at the onset of its putative radio emission phase had a similar luminosity as , this would imply a decrease in @xmath22 of a factor of @xmath31 over six years . \n mb , ap , lb , tds and nda received support from the italian ministry of university and research ( miur ) under the national program _ \n prin2005 2005024090_001_. nr is supported by an nwo post - doctoral fellow . \n the parkes radio telescope is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro . \n f. , pivovaroff m.  j. , kaspi v.  m. , manchester r.  n. , 2002 , in slane p. , gaensler b. , eds , asp conf . \n ser . 271 : neutron stars in supernova remnants a sensitive targeted search campaign at parkes to find young radio pulsars at 20 cm . \n pp  37 +          gaensler b.  m. , kouveliotou c. , gelfand j.  d. , taylor g.  b. , eichler d. , wijers r. a. m.  j. , granot j. , ramirez - ruiz e. , lyubarsky y.  e. , hunstead r.  w. , campbell - wilson d. , van  der horst a.  j. , mclaughlin m.  a. , fender r.  p. , garrett m.  a. , newton - mcgee k.  j. , palmer d.  m. , gehrels n. , woods p.  m. , 2005 , nature , 434 , 1104                g. , faulkner a. , stairs i.  h. , camilo f. , manchester r.  n. , lyne a.  g. , kramer m. , damico n. , kaspi v.  m. , possenti a. , mclaughlin m.  a. , lorimer d.  r. , burgay m. , joshi b.  c. , crawford f. , 2004 , mnras , 352 , 1439      m. , bell j.  f. , manchester r.  n. , lyne a.  g. , camilo f. , stairs i.  h. , damico n. , kaspi v.  m. , hobbs g. , morris d.  j. , crawford f. , possenti a. , joshi b.  c. , mclaughlin m.  a. , lorimer d.  r. , faulkner a.  j. , 2003 , mnras , 342 , 1299      lorimer d.  r. , faulkner a.  j. , lyne a.  g. , manchester r.  n. , kramer m. , mclaughlin m.  a. , hobbs g.  b. , possenti a , stairs i.  h. , camilo f. , burgay m. , damico n. , corongiu a. & crawford f. mnras , submitted          m.  a. , lyne a.  g. , lorimer d.  r. , kramer m. , faulkner a.  j. , manchester r.  n. , cordes j.  m. , camilo f. , possenti a. , stairs i.  h. , hobbs g. , damico n. , burgay m. , obrien j.  t. , 2006 , nature , 439 , 817", "StartTimeOffset": 45704852736, "RequestID": "05225e71b963fdad3dc1de58a0f3dc7a9b2395b3", "TotalTokens": 3722}
{"ContextTokens": 4004, "GeneratedTokens": 64, "SynthesizedBody": "the uncertainty relations are one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum theory . in spite of its importance and long history [ 18 ] \n the problem of finding such relations in the case of the quantum mechanics on a circle still remains open . \n in fact , the experience with the standard heisenberg uncertainty relations suggests that the uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle should be related with the corresponding coherent states . \n nevertheless , the existing approaches connecting the uncertainty relations with the coherent states can hardly be called satisfactory .    in this work \n we introduce the new uncertainties for the position and momentum of a quantum particle on a circle and new uncertainty relations referring to the very recently found coherent states for the circular motion [ 9,10 ] . \n we also introduce the squeezed states for the quantum mechanics on a circle and discuss them in the context of the uncertainty relations . \n we begin with a brief account of the alternative approaches linking the uncertainty relations for a quantum particle on a circle to the coherent states . \n as far as we are aware there are only two such approaches . in the first one we deal with the uncertainty relations implied by the @xmath0 algebra satisfied by the angular momentum operator and the cosine and sine of the angle operator \n @xmath1={\\rm i}\\hbar\\sin\\hat\\varphi,\\qquad [ \\hat j , \\sin\\hat\\varphi]=-{\\rm i}\\hbar\\cos\\hat\\varphi,\\qquad   [ \\sin\\hat\\varphi,\\cos\\hat\\varphi]=0.\\ ] ] these relations are of the form @xmath2 the states minimizing ( 1.2_b _ ) [ 3 ] are referred to as the circular squeezed states . \n recently , those states have been applied in the study of the rydberg wave packets [ 8 ] . \n we point out that ( 1.2_a _ ) and ( 1.2_b _ ) can not be minimized simultaneously [ 8 ] . \n let us write down the ( normalized ) wave packets corresponding to the circular squeezed states , i.e. , the position representation of these states in the space of square integrable functions on a circle @xmath3 . \n we have @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the packet is peaked at @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the expectation value of the angular momentum , @xmath7 is the squeezing and @xmath8 is a modified bessel function of the first kind . \n of course , the wave packet on a circle should be @xmath9-periodic . in view of ( 1.3 ) this implies that @xmath10 is integer . \n but the classical angular momentum is an arbitrary real number . \n therefore , the circular squeezed states are not labelled by points of the classical phase space . \n bearing in mind that the standard coherent states for a particle on a real line are marked with points of the classical phase space we conclude that ( 1.3 ) are rather poor candidate to represent the coherent states for a particle on a circle . on the other hand \n , it turns out that the uncertainty relations ( 1.2 ) can not be used for determining the correct coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle . in our opinion \n the genuine coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle are those introduced in our joint paper [ 9 ] as a solution of some eigenvalue equation ( see the next section ) , and , independently , by gonzles and del olmo [ 10 ] who applied the weil - brezin - zak transform . an attempt to connect these coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle with the uncertainty relation of the form [ 6,10 ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 where @xmath13 , was made in [ 10 ] . \n namely , an upper bond @xmath14 was found therein for the product of uncertainties @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the ( normalized ) coherent state @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 we point out that @xmath16 can not be identified with any uncertainty of the angle . \n indeed , in the eigenvector of @xmath19 we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n but the maximal uncertainty for the position of a particle on a circle is @xmath22 , so @xmath16 should be taken modulo @xmath22 . \n obviously , @xmath20 and @xmath23 violate the inequality ( 1.4 ) , a contradiction . \n it also seems unlikely that the condition ( 1.6 ) allows to determine uniquely the coherent states . \n it thus appears that the meaning of ( 1.4 ) both in the context of the quantum mechanics on a circle and corresponding coherent states is dim . \n we finally remark that the uncertainty relation ( 1.4 ) is implied by ( 2.5 ) and the following inequality [ 11 ] : @xmath24 where we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n in this section we summarize the elementary facts about the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle [ 9,10 ] . \n we begin by recalling the basic properties of the quantum mechanics on a circle . \n consider a free particle on a circle @xmath27 . \n the classical hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angular momentum and we have assumed for simplicity that the particle has unit mass and it moves in a unit circle . clearly , we have the poissson bracket of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle specifying the position on a circle . \n the poisson bracket ( 2.2 ) leads according to the rules of the canonical quantization to the commutator @xmath32 = { \\rm i},\\ ] ] where we set @xmath33 . \n it can be demonstrated that the commutator ( 2.3 ) is defined only on the zero vector . \n therefore , the better candidate than @xmath34 for representing the position of a quantum particle on a circle is the unitary operator @xmath35 such that @xmath36 an immediate consequence of ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) is the following algebra : @xmath37 = u.\\ ] ] we also point out that ( 2.5 ) can be obtained directly from ( 1.1 ) and ( 2.4 ) . consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath38 from ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) it follows that the operators @xmath35 and @xmath39 are the ladder operators . \n namely @xmath40 demanding the time - reversal invariance of the algebra ( 2.5 ) we find [ 9 ] that the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the operator @xmath42 can be only integer or half - integer . in this work \n we restrict , for simplicity , to the case with integer @xmath41 . \n we finally write down the orthogonality and completeness conditions satisfied by the vectors @xmath43 such that @xmath44    we now collect the basic facts about the coherent states for a particle on a circle . \n these states can be defined by means of the eigenvalue equation [ 9 ] @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the complex number @xmath47 parametrizes the circular cylinder which is the classical phase space for the particle moving in a circle . \n we remark that in view of the identity @xmath48 ( 2.10 ) has the form analogous to the eigenvalue equation satisfied by the standard coherent states @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the standard bose annihilation operator and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the position and momentum observables , respectively . \n the projection of the vectors @xmath54 onto the basis vectors @xmath43 is given by @xmath55 on using the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath31 ( 2.13 ) can be written in the following equivalent form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 . \n the coherent states are not orthogonal . \n we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the jacobi theta - function defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . \n it follows immediately from ( 2.15 ) that the squared norm of the coherent states can be written in the form @xmath64 the expectation value of the angular momentum @xmath42 in the coherent states obeys @xmath65 where the maximal error arising in the case @xmath66 is of order @xmath67 and we have the _ exact _ equality in the case of @xmath10 integer or half - integer . \n therefore , the parameter @xmath10 labelling the coherent states can be interpreted as the classical angular momentum . \n the fact that the parameter @xmath31 can be regarded as the classical angle is a consequance of the following formula on the relative expectation value @xmath68 : = @xmath69 , which is the most natural candidate to describe the average position on a circle : @xmath70 where the approximation is very good . \n more precisely , regardless of the concrete value of @xmath10 , the maximal error is of order @xmath67 . in our opinion \n the meaning of ( 2.18 ) and ( 2.19 ) is that the coherent states are as close as possible to the classical phase space . \n our purpose now is to introduce the uncertainties of the momentum and position for a quantum particle on a circle . \n we first write down the following relation implied by ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.17 ) , ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.16 ) : @xmath71 on setting @xmath72 in ( 3.1 ) we get @xmath73 further , using ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.7 ) , ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.16 ) we find @xmath74 eqs .  ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) taken together yield the remarkable identity @xmath75 we now introduce the following measure of the uncertainty of the angular momentum : @xmath76 and the measure of the uncertainty of the angle @xmath77 where @xmath78 notice that both uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) are nonnegative . indeed , for arbitrary hermitian operator @xmath79 we have @xmath80 following directly from the schwarz inequality @xmath81 by putting @xmath82 and @xmath83 \n . an immediate consequence of ( 3.8 ) is nonnegativity of @xmath84 . \n the inequality @xmath85 ensuring the positivity of @xmath86 is implied by the well - known relation @xmath87 \n . the inequality ( 3.11 ) can be easily obtained from ( 3.9 ) by setting @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    at first sight the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) \n seem to be weird without any reference to such measures of uncertainties as a standard variance . \n nevertheless , we observe that ( 3.7 ) has the identical form as the equation satisfied by the variances of the momentum and the position in the standard coherent states for a particle on a real line @xmath90 furthermore , we have the cumulant expansion @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , are the cumulants ( semiinvariants ) . \n the first four cumulants are obtained from moments as @xmath96 notice that the second cumulant is the usual variance . \n the third and fourth cumulant is called skewness and curtosis , respectively . using ( 3.13 ) , ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) \n we get @xmath97 it thus appears that in the first approximation neglecting the cumulants of order four and higher ( even ) ones , the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) coincide with the usual variances of the angular momentum and angle , respectively . \n we point out that @xmath98 vanishes in the eigenstates @xmath43 of @xmath42 when we know the exact value of the angular momentum , and is infinite in the eigenstate @xmath99 of the operator @xmath35 corresponding to the fixed position on a circle . \n analogously , @xmath100 vanishes in the state @xmath99 and is infinite in the state @xmath43 . \n we conclude that the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) behave correctly in the states with fixed angular momentum and angle . \n last but not least we remark that the relations ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) take place also in the case with the half - integer eigenvalues of @xmath42 . \n we now discuss the uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle . \n equations ( 3.2)(3.6 ) taken together yield @xmath101 so @xmath102 the identity ( 3.18 ) indicates the following form of the uncertainty relations for a quantum particle on a circle : @xmath103 minimized at the coherent states . the uncertainty relations ( 3.19 ) are supported by the numerical calculations ( see fig . \n we finally point out that ( 3.19 ) has the form identical as the uncertainty relations for the sum of variances of the position and momentum of a particle on a real line implied by the standard heisenberg uncertainty relations , of the form @xmath104 where we set @xmath33 . \n we finally study the squeezed states for the quantum mechanics on a circle and the connected uncertainty relations . \n we first observe that the eigenvectors of the operators @xmath105 defined as [ 12 ] @xmath106 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the standard position and momentum operators , respectively , and @xmath107 is a real parameter , are the standard squeezed states . in analogy to ( 4.1 ) we introduce the operators @xmath108 such that @xmath109 and define the squeezed states @xmath110 for a quantum particle on a circle by @xmath111 it should be noted that in view of ( 4.2 ) the coherent states for a particle on a circle satisfying ( 2.10 ) correspond to the particular case @xmath112 . \n we also remark that we have a generalization of the formula ( 2.11 ) such that @xmath113 therefore , the squeezed states are related with the scaling of the angular momentum . making use of ( 4.3 ) , \n ( 4.2 ) , ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) we easily obtain the following generalizations of the relations ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.13 ) : @xmath114 where @xmath115 . from ( 4.5 ) and ( 2.9 ) we derive the overlap integrals such that @xmath116 leading to the following expression on the squared norm of the squeezed states : @xmath117 we point out that the above formulae imply positivity of the parameter @xmath7 . \n we also recall that we study the case of the integer eigenvalues of the operator @xmath42 . \n we now examine the uncertainties in the squeezed states . taking into account ( 2.9 ) , ( 2.6 ) , \n ( 4.5 ) and ( 4.7 ) we get a generalization of ( 3.1 ) @xmath118 hence , putting @xmath119 , we find @xmath120 we have also the generalization of ( 3.3 ) of the form @xmath121 by ( 4.9 ) and ( 4.10 ) @xmath122 which leads to the following most natural generalization of the uncertainties ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) of the angular momentum and angle , respectively @xmath123 using the uncertainties ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) we arrive at the identity @xmath124 indicating the generalized uncertainty relations such that @xmath125 where the equality is reached in the squeezed state @xmath126 . \n the uncertainty relations ( 4.15 ) are corroborated by the numerical calculations ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) . \n in this work we have identified the uncertainties and uncertainty relations for the quantum mechanics on a circle minimized by the corresponding coherent states . \n we have also introduced the squeezed states generalizing the coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle and found the appropriate uncertainty relations saturated by these states . \n notice that generalized uncertainty relations ( 4.15 ) , where the uncertainties are given by ( 4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) , do not provide any criterion for distinguishing coherent and squeezed states as in the case with the quantum mechanics on a real line . \n the situation is even more complicated in view of the fact that the squeezed states with different @xmath7 are not related by a unitary transformation . \n namely , we have @xmath127 thus the states with different @xmath7 are not unitarily equivalent and the problem naturally arises concerning the physical interpretation of the ( dimensionless ) parameter @xmath7 . \n we point out that in the case of the standard squeezed states for a particle on a real line the states with different squeezing are related by a unitary transformation . \n vv judge d 1963 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 5 * 189 luisell w h 1963 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 7 * 60 carruthers p and nieto m m 1968 _ rev \n _ * 40 * 411 biaynicki -

'' \n the java servlet application is a complex set of java code with many data structures and interfaces . \n there are two major data formats that will be used : standard user interface format ( suif ) and standard internal classifier format ( sicf ) . \n the suif will be used when presenting data to the user on the client machine ( web browser ) . and \n sicf will be used when presenting data to any of the supported classifiers ( data mining tools ) . \n the sicf format is proposed as a tool - independent representation format for holding all information necessary to conduct a classification / data mining run . \n we expect to provide a user interface on the web browser that looks very much like a spreadsheet program \n . this familiar view will allow the user to inspect and possibly update data easily . \n note that a `` donut '' object indicates a data format conversion is needed at that point . \n some of these data format conversions may require additional information , which would require the use of web pages to interact with the user . and \n the wide arrows indicate data flowing across the internet from server to client ( browser ) .    the control of when and where the data flows is completely independent of this diagram . \n imagine a controller sitting above this page directing the data to flow along the various paths of the diagram . \n this controller is a web - based menu system under the direction of the user . \n the design of this perspective of the grb tool shed is least developed at this time . \n it is clear there needs to be a login menu screen . \n once that information has been verified , the user will be placed in a main menu / dispatcher web page . \n this page will allow the user to click on various functions on a menu bar either along the side , the top , or the bottom . \n the menu selections / actions might be :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     each of these items constitutes a large implementation effort . \n for example , the `` work with the data '' selection initiates a sequence of web pages / forms where the user is required to make selection criteria for the various rows and columns of the data . \n the `` initiate classification '' selection will cause the user to be prompted for which classifier tool to invoke , then guide the user through selecting parameter values that are specific to that tool . \n with the creation of this software comes a powerful research tool capable of automating many aspects of manipulating grb data . \n our goal is to go beyond the tool creation and build up the collection of attributes about the grbs , emerging as a significant repository of grb information with a built - in efficient methodology . \n paciesas , w.s . , _ \n et al . _ , 1999 , _ apj _ , 519 , 206 . \n hakkila , j. , _ et al . \n _ , submitted to _ \n hakkila , j. , _ et al . \n _ , this conference . \n quinlan , j.r . , _ \n c4.5 : programs for machine learning _ \n , san francisco : morgan kaurmann , 1993 . \n roiger , r.j . , _ \n _ , `` esx  a tool for knowledge discovery '' , in _ proc . of the federal data mining symp . & exposition 99 _ , edited by w.t . \n price , afcea international , publisher , fairfax va . \n , 1999 , pp . 109120 .", "StartTimeOffset": 60159178926, "RequestID": "36ec5635f3840726cae5fdbcb4082eb1f0f9c055", "TotalTokens": 3075}
{"ContextTokens": 1489, "GeneratedTokens": 214, "SynthesizedBody": "recent advances in ubiquitous computing and wireless sensor networks continue to obliterate the boundaries between the physical and the digital world  @xcite . \n sensor networks can be utilized in a large variety of deployments , ranging from personal homes over offices and cars to industrial facilities and public areas  @xcite . to cope with the resulting increase in demands for storing and processing sensor data , cloud computing elastically \n provides the necessary computation and storage resources  @xcite . \n cloud computing allows the collection , processing , and storage of sensor data at large scales and as well enables the world - wide sharing of said data  @xcite . in the context of the sensorcloud project  @xcite \n , we consider a scenario in which operators of sensor networks ( i.e. , private users , companies , or public institutions ) connect their sensor networks to the cloud  @xcite , where collected sensor data is processed by cloud services selected by the sensor network operator  @xcite . besides the remarkable advantages of cloud computing , it is important to note that sensor data often contains sensitive information . \n hence , when transferring this sensitive data to entities outside of trusted sensor networks , it might , e.g. , be unintentionally forwarded to third parties or used for non - authorized purposes  @xcite . \n furthermore , data stored and processed in the cloud might be subject to access by the cloud provider or governmental agencies  @xcite . \n thus , one major challenge when interconnecting sensor networks with the cloud is to account for the aforementioned security and privacy concerns .    as part of the efforts of the sensorcloud project \n , we developed a trust point - based security architecture for outsourcing sensor data to the cloud and the sensorcloud security library  @xcite . \n one important challenge in securely outsourcing sensor data to the cloud lies in the representation of sensor data and the corresponding security measures taken to protect the sensor data . in this paper \n , we report on the sensorcloud protocol , which has jointly been developed within the sensorcloud project to represent sensor data and actuator commands using json and subsequently secure this data using object security mechanisms . to this end \n , we rely on mechanisms that have been or currently are in the process of being standardized at the ietf and provide a best practice on how to utilize and combine them in an actual system .    the remainder of this document is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : scenario ] , we present the sensorcloud scenario in more detail and provide references to more detailed descriptions of the overall security architecture . section  [ sec : json - representation ] defines the json - based representation of sensor data and actuator commands in sensorcloud . in section  [ sec : security - extensions ] , we describe the security extensions to this representation to realize the secure outsourcing of sensor data to the cloud . \n we conclude this paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . \n in sensorcloud , we consider a scenario where each sensor network ( with an arbitrary number of sensor nodes ) is connected to the cloud via a dedicated gateway as depicted in figure  [ fig : scenario ] . \n our goal is to store data securely in the cloud such that it can only be processed by authorized cloud services . to this end , the gateway encrypts sensitive sensor readings using a symmetric cipher before uploading it to the cloud . \n the encryption process is influenced by a user - configurable access control list containing services that are authorized to ( partially ) obtain and process the user s sensor data . \n now , only entities in possession of the symmetric key used for encrypting a piece of sensor data ( referred to as a data item ) have access to this specific data item . \n hence , to grant a cloud service access to a given data item the gateway has to provide this cloud service with the corresponding key . \n to this end , the gateway asymmetrically encrypts the corresponding symmetric key with the public key of the cloud service that should gain access to the sensor data and forwards the resulting encrypted key to the respective cloud service . \n more details , especially with respect to the design and implementation of the underlying security architecture as well as our choice of cryptographic primitives , can be found in the corresponding publications  @xcite . \n notably , sensor data originating from a single ( possibly virtual ) sensor node can contain multiple sensor readings from different sensors . \n for example , one data item measured by a meteorological sensor might consist of multiple single sensor readings such as humidity and temperature . \n hence , sensorcloud supports the transmission of multiple sensor readings of one sensor node in a single message  @xcite . as a cloud service \n might only be granted access to parts of the sensor readings , sensorcloud supports the encryption of individual parts of sensor data , thus realizing fine - grained access control . \n the processing of sensor data by a cloud service requires the verification of the integrity of received data , the decryption of the symmetric key , and finally the decryption of the actual sensor data . \n these operations have been implemented in the sensorcloud security library , which allows the transparent decryption of sensor data and the verification of its integrity by a cloud service  @xcite . \n it is available as open source software under the mit license . \n the remainder of this document defines the json - based messages used by the sensorcloud protocol to encode data items as well as additional configuration messages . \n more precisely , the json - based message layout defined by this document is used for both internal communication within the gateway and cloud , respectively , and for communication between those entities . \n the field ` ver ` contains the version number of the protocol , which defines the structure of the remainder of the message . \n hence , whenever the message structure or encapsulated payloads are subject to changes , the version number must be increased . \n the receiving peer must support the indicated version number . otherwise , it should notify the sending peer that the message was dropped . \n the version number is a positive integer and is currently defined as ` 1 ` . \n the sequence number ` seq ` is currently unused and must therefore be set to ` 0 ` . \n however , it enables end - to - end acknowledgments at the application layer . \n the corresponding retransmission mechanism will need to be developed in the future . \n if used , ` seq ` is a positive integer that must be increased by one for each json message header sent . a potential wrap - around of \n the sequence number is to be expected and implementations must interpret this case as an incrementation of the sequence number . \n the messages to be transmitted using one header are stored within an array in the field ` pl ` . \n section  [ sec : payload - types ] defines a list of message types supported by sensorcloud . \n additional message types can be defined as necessary . \n messages must contain the field ` typ ` to indicate their message type for message processing purposes . \n moreover , they must include the ` gw ` field to indicate the gateway device that participates in the communication . among other aspects , \n this information is required for applying object security measures . \n note that multiple messages of different types can be batched using one message header in order to reduce the overall communication overhead . \n each message indicates its message type via the field ` typ ` , which must be included in any message . \n the message type is a positive integer value and can currently take one of the values described in table  [ tab : msg - types ] .", "StartTimeOffset": 66388608714, "RequestID": "c42602d073239ae88dab4fb055e055f2b09ac2f8", "TotalTokens": 1703}
{"ContextTokens": 2943, "GeneratedTokens": 201, "SynthesizedBody": "our aim here is to study the results of competition of two types of contact processes ( cp ) @xcite in the watts - strogatz network . \n the idea is as follows . \n the network nodes are assumed to be in one of two states , say s and d. one of cp is the voter dynamics @xcite , where a randomly selected s node changes the state of one of his neighbor from d to s. the other cp is the unifying step of the sznajd dynamics @xcite , where a randomly selected pair of neighboring nodes , once both d , change the state of all their neighbors from s to d. + in a recent text @xcite , a similar competition has been investigated on the watts - strogatz ( ws ) and the erds - rnyi ( er ) networks . also there , one process of activating nodes has been ruled by the voter dynamics , and the other was triggered by a pair of mutually connected nodes . \n the difference between that approach and the present work is that in paper @xcite a node was activated by a pair of d nodes only if it was a nearest neighbor of both nodes of the pair . on the contrary , in the sznajd dynamics used here all neighbors of each member of the d pair \n are activated @xcite . \n we note that the third model of this family is the bootstrap percolation , where nodes of the activating pair are not necessary neighbors of each other @xcite ; the latter model is not investigated here . \n + our motivation is as follows . in @xcite , \n the clustering coefficient @xmath0 was used as a control parameter . in ws , @xmath0 \n was controlled by rewiring , while in er , it was controlled by adding new links , along the method proposed by holme and kim @xcite . \n the results of @xcite indicate , that in ws , tuning of @xmath0 can lead to switching the d process off and on . \n namely , the d process is blocked if the clustering coefficient is below some critical value . \n this effect is a consequence of the model assumption , that both nodes of the activating pair must be neighbors of the activated node . \n the density of triangles is controlled by @xmath0 . \n if the triangles in the network are rare , the d process is stopped . to check this conclusion \n , we are going to investigate the same process with the sznajd dynamics , where triangles are not necessary . \n consequently , the clustering coefficient @xmath0 should be less important . + it is worth to add that the competing cp s enables a more precise measurement of intensity of the investigated process by its comparison with the voter dynamics . in a finite network , in particular a small - world network , \n the process can reach the whole lattice in a few steps . to switch another process on allows to find their mutual intensity when both processes balance each other . in @xcite , \n the voter process was more intense and therefore it was applied with probability @xmath1 , while the d process was applied with probability 1 . here \n the situation is opposite ; the sznajd dynamics is applied with the probability @xmath1 , and the voter dynamics with the probability 1 . \n we look for the values of @xmath2 where the stationary percentage of both kinds of nodes is 50 - 50 . \n fifty ws networks of @xmath3=1000 nodes and degree @xmath4 are prepared by gradual rewiring of randomly selected links , and they are stored when their clustering coefficient @xmath0 is in the range @xmath5 . \n the demanded @xmath6 are from 0.5 down to 0.1 . \n next we select randomly a given percentage of nodes and assign them to be in the state s ; other nodes are in the state d. + the simulation is performed as follows . \n a node is selected randomly ; if it is in the state s , we check all its neighbors . \n if there is a node d , it is converted to be s. if the randomly selected node is in the state d , we continue with the probability @xmath1 : namely , we check all his neighbors . if there is a node d , all its neighbors and all the neighbors of the initially selected node ( which appeared to be d ) are converted to be d. having done this , we select another node and continue . the change is done immediately . \n + in each time step , @xmath3 nodes are selected . \n there is 2500 time steps . \n the results are averaged over 50 networks , except in the case @xmath7 , when there is only one network and the simulation is run 50 times . \n the influence of the clustering coefficient @xmath0 on the population of s nodes is most apparent in the range of small initial population of these nodes , then the results to be shown here are obtained in this range . also , their dependence on the initial state is visible there . \n + in figs . 1 and 2 we show the time dependence of the population of s nodes for two values of the clustering coefficient @xmath0 , 0.1 and 0.5 . \n we observe that for @xmath0=0.1 ( fig.1 ) the time of simulation is long enough to get the stationary state . \n although we have not obtained this state for @xmath0=0.5 ( fig . \n 2 ) , the results clearly show that in the latter case the relatively large probability @xmath1 of the d process is not enough to reduce the population of s nodes as strongly , as it is found for @xmath0=0.1 . \n namely , while @xmath1=0.27 is enough to eliminate s nodes for @xmath0=0.1 , we find that for @xmath0=0.5 s nodes still prevail for @xmath1=0.38 . \n + the results on the population of s nodes after 2500 time steps are shown in figs . 3 and 4 for different values of @xmath0 and two different values of the initial population of s nodes , 0.1 and 0.25 . \n the results show how the fall of the observed population of s nodes with the probability @xmath1 depend on the clustering coefficient @xmath0 . \n clearly , the larger @xmath0 , the stronger is the process s , as larger values of @xmath1 are necessary to damp the population of s nodes . \n + from these results , we can evaluate the probability @xmath2 when the calculated population of s nodes is 0.5 after 2500 time steps . as shown in fig . \n 5 , the initial population of s nodes does not change these results qualitatively . in both cases , \n the observed probability @xmath2 increases with @xmath0 from about 0.26 to about 0.4 in the investigated range of @xmath0 . \n +    = 0.1 . \n the probability @xmath1 is from 0.2 to 0.27 with step 0.01 , in ascending order from the top to the bottom of the graph.,width=472 ]    = 0.5 . \n the probability @xmath1 is from 0.20 to 0.38 with step 0.02 , in ascending order from the top to the bottom of the graph.,width=472 ]     for the ws network ( 10 percent of all 1000 nodes are initially s - nodes ) for different clustering coefficient @xmath0= 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 ( curves from left to right , respectively),width=472 ]     for the ws network ( 25 percent of all 1000 nodes are initially s - nodes ) for different clustering coefficient @xmath0= 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 ( curves from left to right , respectively),width=472 ]     against the clustering coefficient @xmath0 for the ws network for different initial s - nodes participations equal to 10 percent ( bottom curve ) and 25 percent ( top curve).,width=472 ] \n the results indicate , that the s process is relatively more active for ws networks with large clustering coefficient @xmath0 . in particular , for the case \n when the initial amount of s nodes is 0.1 , the critical value @xmath2 is about 0.38 for @xmath7 , but only 0.25 for @xmath8 . when the initial amount of nodes is 0.25 , the same numbers for @xmath2 are 0.40 and 0.28 . \n this means , that in clusterized networks , a larger probability of the d process is necessary to balance the s process , than for the case when the clustering is small . + \n this result is opposite to the one obtained in our previous calculations @xcite , where the activation of d nodes was possible only if a node was simultaneously a nearest neighbor of both nodes of the activating pair of d nodes . \n this detail appears to be the cause of the observed different role of the clustering coefficient . \n while it seems natural that in our case the variation of @xmath0 is simply not relevant , the reversed influence of the clustering calls for an interpretation . \n + to accomplish this , let us compare two limit cases : the ws network without rewiring , where the clustering coefficient is maximal , and the bethe lattice . for the mean degree @xmath9=4 , as assumed here , the respective values of @xmath0 are 0.5 and 0.0 . \n although in our case the ws network with large amount of rewiring is not equivalent to the bethe lattice , it is anyway close to an erds - rnyi network , which could be approximated by a regular tree . for the purpose of our explanation , it is important only that in both cases the clustering coefficient is small . \n let us consider the simplified case of the velocity of spread of the d phase from a pair of neighbours , with the s process switched off and all nodes are simultaneously updated . in the ws network \n , this velocity is constant : for @xmath10=4 , two nodes are switched from s to d at each step . on the contrary , in the bethe lattice with the same degree the number of nodes switched from s to d along one tree branch is multiplied by @xmath11 at each time step . \n we should add that for the process investigated in @xcite , the above multiplication does not occur ; in trees the d process considered there does not work at all . \n + the list of applications of the sznajd model in politics and economy can be found in @xcite . \n here we add that the comparison of the results presented here and of those in @xcite reveals that a subtle modification of the mechanism seriously alters the intensity of the sznajd dynamics in clusterized networks . in the literature on the sznajd model , \n often we find a reference to the threshold effect introduced to sociology by granovetter @xcite . in this effect , people are inclined to imitate the others behaviour if more than a given number of persons behave in a given way . \n this means , that the imitators see all the imitated persons , and not only one . \n accordingly , this sociological effect is described more accurately by the model described in @xcite or even by the bootstrap percolation , than by the sznajd dynamics . \n the calculations were performed in the ack cyfronet , cracow , grants no . \n mnisw/ ibm_bc_hs21/agh/070/2010 and mnisw / sgi3700/ agh/070/2010 . \n this work was partially supported from the agh ust project no . \n 10.10.220.01 . \n 99 j. marro and r. dickman , _ nonequilibrium phase transitions in lattice models _ , cambridge up , cambridge 2002 . \n t. m. liggett , _ interacting particle systems _ , springer -

{"ContextTokens": 2824, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "in the last ten years , thanks to high precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements , more than 100 extrasolar planets have been found . \n the most important observational campaigns up to now have focused on old solar type stars because such stars present all the characteristics ( small @xmath5 , high number of spectral lines , low activity ) to exploit the best potentialities of the rv technique . \n the orbits of the extra - solar planets are strikingly different from those of our solar system : some of them have massive planets of extremely short orbital periods ( so called `` hot jupiters '' or `` pegasides '' ) , while others exhibit very high eccentricities . \n these results have given a new strong impulse to the theoretical efforts to explain the formation and evolution of planetary systems . \n however , even the most fundamental questions are still open . \n how common are planetary systems ? \n how do planets form ? by core accretion or by gravitational instability in the disk . where do they form ? \n close - in jupiter mass planets can form in situ , or do they have to form at a certain distance and then migrate inward ? \n new insights should come from the determination of the orbital parameters for planets in early evolutionary phases . according to some scenarios the frequency of planets \n was initially much higher than is observed in old stars , as a substantial fraction of the planets might have been either ejected from the system , or have been engulfed in the host stars . since capture of planets is highly unlikely , the frequency of planets of young stars ought to be higher than that of old stars . \n the aim of this survey is to find out by how much . \n another issue we could address concerns the evolution of the orbital parameters . in particular it would be important to know whether close - in planets have round orbits when they form or eccentric orbits , which then get circularised by tidal interaction with the host star .    there is an additional reasons for searching for planets of young stars . as pointed out by sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny ( 2003 ) even old exo - planets orbiting a solar - like star at 0.1 au would have a temperature of up to 900  k , because they are heated by the star . a massive , isolated planet with an age between @xmath6 to @xmath7 \n yrs would also have a temperature of more than 800  k but this time because it is still contracting . for close - in young planets both effects would add up resulting in objects of spectral type early l or even late m , which would be only 5 to 7 mag fainter than the host star . \n the direct detection of these objects , especially in the infrared light , would be possible by means of interferometric observations as well as tracking down spectral signatures , giving access to fundamental parameters like temperature , radius and true masses . \n the presence of spots and/or plages in the photosphere of active stars changes the profile of spectral lines causing fictitious variations in the rv measurements ( the so - called jitter ) . \n not only this source of noise can mask the periodical variations which are the characteristic signature of the presence of a planet , but what makes it even worse is the fact that the presence of spots combined with the stellar rotation can itself introduce spurious periodicities in the radial velocity signal.this explains why young stars , which are supposed to be active , have so far been excluded from the major rv surveys for planets detection . \n however paulson et al . ( 2002 ) monitored 82 stars in the hyades ( age @xmath8 700 myr ) finding a significant correlation between simultaneous rv and @xmath9 for only 5 stars . indeed exactly \n to what extent the stellar activity can hinder the detection of exoplanets in rv measurement has not yet clearly assessed . \n weighing pros and cons we finally decided to undertake a rv survey of young stars . \n observations began in 2001 . \n we monitored a sample of 46 young , nearby dwarf stars of late spectral type and took 1500 spectra of these up to now . \n the observations have been carried out at the state observatory of turingia ( tls ) using the 2 m `` alfred jensch '' telescope which is equipped with a coud echelle spectrograph . \n we used the visual grism which cover the spectral region from 4660 to 7410 @xmath10 in 44 orders . with a slit width of 1.2 arcsec a resolution of @xmath11 \n is achieved . an iodine cell placed in front of the slit generates a very dense system of absorption lines superimposed onto the stellar spectrum , which provides a highly precise wavelength scale and at same time allows to measure the psf in situ over the spectrum . \n radial velocities ( rv s ) are measured by means of a software package called radial developed at the university of texas and mcdonald observatory , based on the methods described in marcy & butler(1992 ) and valenti , butler & marcy(1995 ) . \n the identification of bona - fide young post - t - tauri stars near the sun still is an open astrophysical issue ( jensen 2001 ) . \n recently many nearby associations of young stars have been recognised : twa , @xmath12 pic , tucana - horologium , @xmath13 cha , ab dor ( zuckermann & song 2004 ) . for such coeval stellar groups statistics considerations help to achieve reliable estimations of the common age . \n unfortunately all those associations are located in the southern hemisphere.thus in selecting the sample of stars to survey we did the hobson s choice and looked out for young field stars . \n one of the best indicators of young age , especially for g and k stars , is the presence of the lithium lii@xmath146708 absorption line . \n the convective envelope of these stars brings the lithium in contact with the stellar core where the temperature is high enough to cause its burning . as a consequence the lithium in the stellar atmospheres is progressively depleted . \n the lithium abundances can thus be used as an age estimator . \n fig.1 shows the lii@xmath146708 equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of the @xmath15 for the stars in our sample and , as a comparison , for the pleiades ( age @xmath16 myr ) . as can be seen for the stars of pleiades , the lii@xmath146708 ew scatters significantly for the same @xmath15 . \n thus it is not possible determine the age for every single star in our sample precisely . \n rather , in a schematic way , we can subdivide our sample in two groups , one having ages comparable to the pleiades and the other consisting of older stars . \n in fact , many stars in the latter group have been recognised as members of the ursa major association which is 300 myr old ( soderblom & major 1993 ) ( 500 myr according to king & schuler 2005 ) .    based on the hipparcos \n parallaxes all our stars are at a distance of less than 50 pc from the sun , and 36 of them are closer than 30 pc . \n accordingly , they are relatively bright , ranging from the fifth to the ninth visual magnitude . \n fig.2 ( left panel ) shows the average internal errors @xmath17 in the rv s as a function of the projected stellar rotational velocity @xmath5 . \n as expected for rapidly rotating stars , the spectral lines broadening makes it difficult to achieve high precision rv values . \n however , up to a @xmath18 km / s , we routinely get internal errors of 10 to 15 m / s . \n apart from the fact that the rv s for rapidly rotating stars are more difficult to determine , these stars are also more active . in order to demonstrate this , we consider the @xmath19 which is defined as the square - root of the difference between the standard deviation of the observed rv s ( @xmath20 ) and the @xmath17 squared . \n @xmath19 thus is a measure of the rv - variations presumably due to stellar activity . \n 2 ( right ) shows @xmath19 against @xmath5 . \n it can clearly be seen that stars of larger @xmath5 also show larger @xmath19-values . on the other hand the majority of stars in our sample which \n have @xmath18 km / s show a @xmath19 lower than 35 m / s . \n such a level of ` noise ' in the rv - measurements , even if larger than typical values for old dwarf stars of the same spectral type ( santos et al . \n 2000 ) , still allows the detection of a rv - signal of most of the known exo - planets . \n for instance , a planet with @xmath0 = 1 @xmath2 in a circular orbit around a 1 @xmath21 star with a period @xmath22 days induces a stellar wobble with a rv semi - amplitude of @xmath23 m / s which is larger than the scatter caused by activity for a star with a @xmath18 km / s .      in order to derive upper limits for the detection of planets in our sample \n , we carried out simulations . \n for each point on a grid of values of the orbital period @xmath3 and the planetary mass @xmath24 , assuming for the star a mass on the basis of its spectral type , we generate a sinusoidal rv curve . \n the curve is then sampled in the same way as the real data for that star , obtaining a set of simulated rv values.in the next step , we add noise of normal distribution to the data . \n the noise is scaled so that the @xmath25 of the simulated data is equal to the observed @xmath20 . the whole procedure is repeated 5000 times , varying the phases randomly . for \n each of the 5000 simulated data - sets we then derive the value of the periodogram ( @xmath26 ) for that period @xmath3 ( scargle 1982 ) and thus obtain for a given @xmath3 and @xmath0 a distribution of @xmath26 , which is compared to a similar distribution for @xmath27 . \n if the two distributions do not overlap , we conclude that a planet of that @xmath3 and @xmath0 can be excluded . \n similarly , from the overlap of the two distributions , we can calculate the probability for excluding such planet . \n the results of our simulations for two opposite cases are shown in fig.3 . \n quite remarkably in the best conditions ( panel @xmath28 ) we easily would have been able to detect a planet with @xmath29 for a period as large as 300 days . besides , even in the worst case ( panel @xmath30 ) \n thanks to the high number of data points ( @xmath31 ) we are still sensible to very hot jupiter - mass planets .      in the whole sample \n we have found only three objects which show a long period rv trend compatible with the presence of a stellar companion and one young planet candidate . \n the rv data set for all these stars has been analysed in the same way : we calculated the scargle periodogram and in correspondence to the periods with higher peaks we estimate the weighted least squares best - fit orbital solution . \n the phase - folded rv curve for our candidate planet is shown in fig.4 together with the best - fit orbital parameters . as we know that rv variations can also be induced by stellar activity , we analysed the hipparcos photometry and found a p=1.6477 days periodicity . \n it is hence possible that the rv as well as the photometric variations originate from a @xmath8 1.5 days stellar rotational period . \n however the star does not present enhanced x - ray luminosity and strong emission in the cores of the caii h and k lines , which are typical of fast rotators , and the @xmath32km / s would imply that we are observing the star almost pole - on . \n further simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations will possibly confirm or discard the planet hypothesis . \n jensen e.l.n . \n 2001 , in asp conf . \n 244 , young stars near earth : progress and prospects , ed . \n r. jayawardhana & t.p . \n greene ( san francisco : asp ) , 3 king j.r . & schuler s.c . \n 2005 , , 117 , 911 marcy g.w . & \n butler r.p . \n 1992 , , 104 , 270 paulson d.b . , saar s.h . \n , cochran w.d . & hatzes a.p . \n 2002 124 , 572 santos n.c . , \n mayor m. , naef d. , pepe f. , queloz d. , udry s. & blecha a. 2000 , 361 , 265 scargle , j.d . \n 1982 , , 263 , 835 soderblom d.r . & major m. 1993 , , 402 , 5 sudarsky d. , burrows a. , & hubeny i. 2003 , , 588 , 1121 valenti j.a . , butler r.p . & marcy g.w . \n 1995 , , 107 , 966 zuckermann b. & song i. 2004 , , 42 , 685", "StartTimeOffset": 79840643706, "RequestID": "c6a83ce833589f6f87d641439a7be58d71bc03c3", "TotalTokens": 2956}
{"ContextTokens": 3173, "GeneratedTokens": 88, "SynthesizedBody": "classical and recurrent novae  distinguished by the observation of one or more eruptive events , \n respectively  are thermonuclear runaways ( tnr ) on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) star which ensues following extensive accretion of hydrogen rich material from a less evolved secondary star . \n the ejected material is rich in heavy elements which enrich the interstellar medium ( @xcite , see also gehrz et al . , these proceedings ) . \n the nova eruptions are the most common thermonuclear runaways in the galaxy ( 34@xmath0 novae per year ; @xcite ) and scale with galaxy size ( @xcite ) . \n the infrared temporal evolution of the nova is nicely described in gehrz et al . \n ( these proceedings ) and for detailed reviews on interefometric observations of novae , see chesneau & banerjee ( 2012 ) and chesneau ( 2014 ) . of particular interest , to this work , is that during the initial phases of the eruption the ejected material can be modelled as an optically thick fireball that radiates like a blackbody and as the expansion continues and reduces in density , the infrared continuum becomes dominated by optically thin free - free emission with strong hydrogen re - combination lines on top . \n observations of novae are going through a renaissance over the last decade or so driven by the upgrade of telescopes , instruments , and new discoveries ( see the various contributions in @xcite ) . \n of particular note , the discovery of high energy @xmath1-ray emission ( @xcite ) and pinpointing the location of @xmath1-ray production , from internal shocks due to different velocity components at the equatorial and polar regions ( @xcite ) .    a number of factors are required to be systematically studied across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to understand the evolution of the nova eruption . of paramount importance , in any field of astrophysics , is the distance to an object . in the milky way , \n the distance to novae allow us to derive their spatial distribution in order to understand from which population / s novae arise from \n disc / bulge  and also the occurrence of novae in our galaxy . \n the first observations with an infrared interferometer occurred with nova v1974  cygni ( 1992 ) on the mk iii interferometer ( @xcite ) . the nova was resolved aroudn 10 days after maximum light . fitting a uniform disk model to the data the distance was estimated to be 2.5 kpc , in line with other studies ( @xcite ) . \n there was one more nova - like eruptive event , in v838 mon ( @xcite ) , that was followed with palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) . \n however , this event is largely accepted to have been the merger of two stars . \n it was not until the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi erupted in 2006 that infrared interferometric observations truly come to play . \n rs oph was observed first with the infrared optical telescope array , keck and pti ( @xcite ) , suggesting that the near - infrared emission arose due to a non - expanding , dense , and ionised circumbinary gaseous disk or reservoir . however , lane et al . ( 2007 ) resolve the emission in rs oph using pti providing clear evidence for a near - infrared source that initially expanded and then began shrieking . \n the amber instrument on the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) was also used , on day 5.5 after eruption , to measure the @xmath2-band continuum and the br@xmath1 and hei 2.06 @xmath3 m lines ( @xcite ) . \n the @xmath2-band emission is dominated by free - free emission and had a smaller size than the br@xmath1 and hei lines ( 3x2 mas , 5x3 mas , and 6x4 mas , respectively ) . \n these results were also contrary to monnier et al . \n furthermore , chesneau et al . ( 2007 ) found two velocity fields in the br@xmath1 line ; a slowly expanding ring - like structure ( @xmath4  1800  km  s@xmath5 ) , and a fast structure extended in the e - w direction ( @xmath6  25003000  km  s@xmath5 ) . \n a two velocity component was also required to replicate the hubble space telescope narrow band imaging observations of the resolved remnant , at day 155 after eruption , and the ground - based optical spectroscopy ( @xcite ) . \n lastly , rs oph observations with the keck interferometer nuller , around day 3.8 after eruption , showed evidence for dust that is present in - between eruptions , rather than created during the eruption ( @xcite ) in line with findings from the spitzer space telescope of silicate dust that survives the hard radiation impulse and shock blast wave from the eruption ( @xcite ) . \n other novae have been observed since rs oph with infrared interferometric instruments ; the recurrent nova t  pyxidis ( @xcite ) , the dust forming nova v1280 sco ( @xcite ) , and the @xmath1-ray detected classical nova v339 delphini ( 2013 ; @xcite ) . \n what is clear from the various bodies of work is that the nova eruption is far from spherical , or uniform disks . \n efforts are now under way to understand the progress of the nova eruption from optical to radio observations applying one single model . for example , optical emission line profile fitting of the classical nova v959  mon proved useful in determining , the ejection morphology , inclination angle and the expansion velocity of the ejecta ( @xcite ) . these results are also corroborated with the observations of eclipses at x - ray and optical wavelengths ( @xcite ) and observations of a bipolar ejection morphology at radio frequencies ( @xcite ) . \n lastly , applying the free - free thermal process to the models derived at optical wavelengths above we were able to derive the distance to v959  mon ( @xcite ) .    up to now the observations \n have provided important information on the distances to these objects assuming uniform / gaussian fitting to the visibilities / images when available as well as departure from these morphologies for the ejecta . \n in fact , the distance may also be constrained assuming the blackbody angular radius and doppler expansion velocity which give day of the eruption , the distance and the outburst luminosity ( @xcite and gerzh et al . \n these proceedings ) \n . however , we can extract further information if we assume a thermal free - free emission . \n here we will , also , be able to extract ejected masses , temperature of the ejecta , and density profiles of the ejecta . \n ideally , we would want to combine all this information with other wavelengths , such as optical for the doppler expansion velocity , in order to reduce the amount of free parameters and computational time . \n although the distance is a very important issue , the gaia satellite will largely solve this in the coming years . \n furthermore , a suit of new instruments are to be installed in the vlti which will provide marked improvement , both in resolution and sensitivity ( matisse and gravity ) , over current capabilities . \n the author would like to thank bob gehrz for reading and commenting on the manuscript and christiaan brinkerink for useful discussion on interferometric observations . \n the author also acknowledges financial support from the radboud excellence initiative . \n 99 abdo , a.  a. , ackermann , m. , ajello , m. , et al . \n 2010 , science , 329 , 817 ackermann , m. , ajello , m. , albert , a. , et al . \n 2014 , science , 345 , 554 barry , r.  k. , danchi , w.  c. , traub , w.  a. , et al . \n 2008 , apj , 677 , 1253 bode , m. f. & evans , a.  2008 , editors _ classical novae _ , 2nd edition ( cambridge university press ) chesneau , o.  2014 , in _ stella novae : past and future decades _ , eds . \n p. a. woudt & v. a. r. m. ribeiro , aspcs , vol . \n 490 , 243 chesneau , o. & banerjee , d.  p.  k.  2012 , basi , 40 , 267 chesneau o. , banerjee d. p. k. , millour f. , et al . \n 2008 , a&a , 487 , 223 chesneau o. , clayton g. c. , lykou f. , et al . \n 2009 , a&a , 493 , l17 chesneau , o. , lagadec , e. , otulakowska -

{"ContextTokens": 3174, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "aerogels are materials with density and refractive index in the region between gases and liquids or solids . \n already some time ago , cantin et al . \n @xcite proposed that cherenkov radiation from silica aerogels could be used for detection of particles . \n besides particle detectors like for example tasso @xcite , such threshold counters found applications also in other fields @xcite . with improved manufacturing techniques , aerogels of higher transparency \n i.e. less rayleigh scattering became available , permitting their consideration as radiators in ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) counters @xcite . \n ypsilantis and seguinot @xcite proposed a combined aerogel+gas , mirror - focused rich counter for the lhc - b experiment at cern . \n the hermes team @xcite constructed and operated such a ring imaging detector at desy . \n the present paper reports on experimental investigation of an aerogel based rich detector not requiring mirrors i.e. of the proximity focusing type . \n such a detector is being considered in connection with a possible upgrade of the belle particle identification system at kek @xcite . \n initial tests of the apparatus with cosmic rays were reported recently @xcite . \n the present paper describes measurements and results obtained with the @xmath1 beam at kek . \n a beam particle - pion , muon or electron - traversing the apparatus is signaled by two @xmath2  @xmath3 scintillation counters which determine the time of arrival . \n two co@xmath4 gas cherenkov counters produce signals only upon the passage of electrons so these signals could be used either to select or to exclude electrons .    the aerogel radiator and the position sensitive , single photon detector are contained in a light tight box ( fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) , of which the entrance and exit sides each have a multiwire proportional chamber for measuring the track of the incident particle . \n these @xmath2  @xmath3 mwpc s , with 15 @xmath5 m diameter , gold - plated tungsten anode wires at 2  mm pitch and with 90% ar + 10% ch@xmath6 gas flow , are read out by delay lines on the x and y cathode wires .    after passing through the entrance mwpc , \n the charged particle hits the aerogel radiator in which it emits cherenkov photons . \n measurements have been made mainly with 2  cm thick aerogel slabs of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , produced by the method described in @xcite . \n the position sensitive detector of cherenkov photons is situated 17 - 29  cm downstream of the aerogel , depending on the refractive index value of the specific aerogel . \n the detector is a @xmath10 array of 16 channel multianode photomultiplier tubes ( hamamatsu pmts type r5900 - 00-m16 with borosilicate window @xcite ) at 30  mm pitch . the sensitive surface of the m16 pmt is divided into 16 ( @xmath11 ) channels , each covering @xmath12 mm@xmath13 . \n it follows that only 36% of the detector area is occupied by the photosensitive channels , the rest being dead space . \n the photon detection system and the aerogel radiator tile may be rotated around an axis perpendicular to the beam direction , enabling measurements of angular acceptance i.e. measurements of the number of detected cherenkov photons as a function of the charged particle incident angle . \n the pmts are plugged into voltage divider boards inside the light tight box with signals passing through connectors to the readout system located outside the box . \n the pmt anode signals are first discriminated and then recorded by camac multihit , multichannel tdcs , for which the common stop is provided by the scintillation counter signals . \n the tdc information is stored for later analysis in a personal computer .    as only 196 readout channels were available for the 576 pmt anode outputs , only part of the system \n could be read out with the 4.5  mm pixel size . however , by connecting 4 ( @xmath14 ) anodes to one readout channel , the entire system could be read out with 9  mm pixel size . \n pion given by the measured track position.,width=340 ]    a few typical events are displayed in fig . \n [ fig2 ] . from the photon hit position and the measured direction of the incident charged particle , the cherenkov angle is calculated . \n accumulated distributions of hits , depending on their cherenkov angles , are plotted in figs . \n [ fig3 - 0 ] and [ fig3 ] . \n peaks and rings , corresponding to pions , muons and electrons , are clearly visible . \n signals from the gas cherenkov counters may be used for either selecting or excluding electrons . \n fitting these distributions with gaussian peaks and linear backgrounds yields the average values and standard deviations of the measured cherenkov angles . \n the main contributions to the resolution in cherenkov angle as determined from a single photon ( standard deviations of the peaks in distributions of figs . \n [ fig3 - 0 ] and [ fig3 ] ) come from pixel size and from uncertainty in the emission point . for normal incidence of tracks the first contribution \n could be estimated as @xmath15cos@xmath16 , where d is the pixel size , @xmath17 is the cherenkov angle and @xmath18 is the distance from aerogel to detector . \n the second contribution is @xmath19 sin@xmath20cos@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the aerogel thickness . \n the uncertainty in the track direction is negligible at 3  gev/@xmath23 , but increases at lower momenta . \n the error due to dispersion in the radiator ( chromatic error ) should also be negligible , but contributions could arise due to possible non - uniformities of the aerogel ( position variations in refractive index ) , non - flat aerogel surface , forward scattering of photons etc .    the measured cherenkov angle resolution , i.e. the standard deviation of peaks in distributions of photon hits versus the value of aerogel refractive index , is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] for 3  gev/@xmath23 pions .     pion beam . \n full symbols correspond to the measured values , empty ones to estimates of contributions from pixel size and emission point uncertainty only . \n x is the radiator - to - photon - detector distance , l is the radiator thickness and d is the photon detector pixel size.,width=340 ]    different data points in the figure refer to different values of parameters such as the radiator thickness , the radiator - to - photon - detector distance and the photon detector pixel size . \n the measured values are represented by full symbols , with different symbol shapes indicating different combinations of parameter values . using the above expressions for the contributions of pixel size and emission point uncertainty and summing them in quadrature , one obtains estimates for the resolution , represented with empty symbols in fig . \n it may be seen from the figure that such estimates give a good approximation to the measured resolution . \n pion beam . \n l is the aerogel radiator thickness . \n full symbols correspond to the measured values , empty ones to estimates.,width=340 ]     ( open symbols ) and @xmath7 ( full symbols ) . squares and circles \n correspond to different granularities of the photon detector . \n the curves are fits to corresponding data.,width=340 ]    the other important parameter of a rich counter is the number of detected photons per incident charged particle . \n this is usually parametrised as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the cherenkov angle , l is the radiator thickness and @xmath26 is a figure of merit depending on the radiator and system transparency , geometrical acceptance of photons ( area and angle ) , quantum efficiency , photoelectron collection efficiency etc . due to rayleigh scattering , \n the aerogel transparency has a strong wavelength dependence in the region of r5900-m16 pmt quantum efficiency , so one may expect a sensitivity of the number of detected photons on the particular aerogel sample i.e. on the production procedure . the number of detected photons per cherenkov ring is shown in fig . \n [ fig5 ] for 3  gev/@xmath23 pions . \n first one notices that the number of photons does not increase with refractive index as may be expected for @xmath27 particles ; @xmath28 sin@xmath29 . \n then it is also obvious that the 4  cm thick aerogel radiator does not produce two times as many photons as does the 2  cm thick aerogel . and finally we see that the 2.8  cm thick aerogel tile @xcite , produced in a different process @xcite , yields more cherenkov photons than the 4  cm thick aerogel @xcite . that a higher refractive index of the aerogel sample does not necessarily produce more photons , is observed also in fig .  [ fig6 ] . \n although the threshold for @xmath8 is reached , as expected , at lower particle momenta than for @xmath7 , the saturated number of detected photons per cherenkov ring is more or less the same for both radiators . \n the above discrepancies can be well understood , and have been estimated from the known aerogel attenuation lengths and the response of the counter ( fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . \n the attenuation lengths at 400  nm for the samples of fig . \n [ fig5 ] are 36  mm , 15  mm and 7  mm for the aerogel samples with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and 36  mm for the 28 mm thick novosibirsk sample with @xmath8 @xcite .    it has been already noted by the hermes group @xcite , that a loss of cherenkov photons occurs at the side wall boundaries between adjacent aerogel tiles . \n we have confirmed this finding by measuring the number of photons on the cherenkov ring as a function of the distance of the charged particle impact point from the boundary between two tiles . the measurement is shown in fig . \n [ fig7 ] , where a dip is seen at the tile boundary @xmath30  mm . in order to eliminate other geometrical factors , like for example \n the acceptance of the photon detector , the measured yield was normalized to the yield obtained with one tile covering the entire range . \n the result clearly indicates the reduction of yield when the charged particle is closer than about 5  mm to the boundary of a 2  cm thick @xmath8 aerogel tile . \n it is worth noting that a simple model , where all photons hitting the boundary between the two tiles get lost , accounts for most of the observed dependence . \n we have constructed and tested a proximity focusing rich detector module with aerogel as radiator and multianode pmts as position sensitive detectors of individual cherenkov photons . \n the measured values of the basic parameters i.e. the single photon cherenkov angle resolution and the number of photons detected per cherenkov ring , look promising . \n the resolution is in relatively good agreement with estimates based on pixel size and emission point uncertainty . \n the number of detected photons , however is sensitive to the particular aerogel used . \n it seems that these differences are due to rayleigh scattering , which reduces the aerogel transparency mainly in the wavelength region of maximal photocathode sensitivity . \n photomultipier tubes with a higher fraction of active area , possibly combined with a light collection system , consisting of lenses or light guides , are expected to increase the number of detected cherenkov photons by reducing the dead space of the photon detector . \n the increase in photon yield , however , is in the latter case at the expense of an increase in the effective pixel size , so a compromise , optimizing the final resolution of the charged particle cherenkov angle should be found . \n the information obtained from the results of the present tests suggests that a proximity focusing aerogel rich as required by the belle particle identification upgrade is feasible , so investigations of optimal detector parameters are being continued . \n 15 m.  cantin , m.  casse , l.  koch , r.  jouan , p.  mestreau , d.  roussel , f.  bonnin , j.  moutel and s.j . \n teichner , `` silica aerogels used as cherenkov radiators , '' _ nucl . \n instrum . methods _ , vol . \n 177 - 182 , 1974 . \n h.  burkhardt p.  koehler , r.  riethmuller , b.h . \n wiik , r.  fohrmann , j.  franzke , h.  kraseman et al . , ` ` the tasso gas and aerogel cherenkov counters , '' _ nucl . \n . methods _ , vol . \n 319 - 331 , 1981 . \n fields , h.  van  hecke , j.  boissevain , b.v . \n jacak , w.e . \n sondheim , j.p . \n sullivan , w.j . \n willis , k.  wolf , e.  noteboom , p.m.  peters and r.  burke , `` use of aerogel for imaging cherenkov counters , '' _ nucl . \n instrum . methods _ , \n a349 , pp.431 - 437 , 1994 . \n n. akopov , e.c . \n aschenauer , k. bailey , s. bernreuther , n. bianchi , g.p . \n capitani et al . , `` the hermes dual - radiator ring imaging cerenkov detector , '' _ \n instrum . methods _ , \n a479 , pp . \n 511 - 530 , 2002 . \n i.  adachi , i.  bizjak , a.  goriek , t.  iijima , m.  iwamoto , s.  korpar et al . \n , `` tests of a proximity focusing rich with aerogel as radiator , '' proceedings of the 4th workshop on rich detectors , june 2002 , pylos , greece , to be published in _ nucl . \n methods _    s.  korpar , i.  bizjak , m.  brako , a.  goriek , t.  iijima , m.  iwamoto , p.  krian , r.  pestotnik , m.  stari and a.  stanovnik , `` tests of a proximity focusing rich with aerogel as radiator '' 2001 ieee nuclear science symposium , san diego , california , usa , november 4 - 10 , 2002 , conference record ( 2002 ) , 4 pages .", "StartTimeOffset": 97470356646, "RequestID": "01f1871828c665a461845121c093988afe61a5a2", "TotalTokens": 3402}
{"ContextTokens": 3814, "GeneratedTokens": 344, "SynthesizedBody": "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) was originally introduced by wigner @xcite in 1951 into physics in order to describe statistics of isolated , high - lying nuclear levels . \n a detailed analysis of each state seemed neither possible nor desirable . \n statistical properties , on the other hand , were needed for nuclear technology and were well described by the goe . \n about a quarter of a century ago there was considerable interest in the so called embedded ensembles and in particular in the two - body random hamiltonian ensemble ( tbre ) @xcite , because it was realized that the goe represented an @xmath6-body interaction in a mean field basis , while it is generally assumed that nuclei can be fairly well described by an effective two - body interaction in this basis . \n thus @xmath6-body hamiltonians were constructed from two - body goe s assuming degenerate single - particle states . \n the spectral statistics of these two - body random ensembles were analyzed . \n the main findings were :    1 . \n the level density of the tbre is gaussian @xcite , rather than semi - circular . \n the tbre is neither stationary @xcite nor ergodic @xcite . \n 3 .   unfolding the tbre individually goe statistics is recovered @xcite . \n the deviation with respect to goe is due to the variance of average spacings over the ensemble @xcite . \n fluctuations at the edge of the spectrum of a tbre are very large @xcite compared to those of a goe and can be roughly described by a brody distribution @xcite of nearest - neighbour spacings with a parameter @xmath7 @xcite . \n these results , with the exception of the one for the level density , are exclusively numerical . \n they were obtained at a time of very limited computer facilities . as a consequence , \n only few particles were treated and the dimension of the tbre matrices was small . \n there has been recently a flurry of interest in the tbre regarding properties of wave functions and spectra @xcite - @xcite . in this context \n the old work was ignored to a large extent . \n yet it seems worthwhile to take it into account , because it is not clear what effects non - ergodicity could have in the new context . \n the numerical results can be improved considerably upon and by consequence the old results can be tested . \n furthermore it seems desirable to go beyond the tbre to what we may call a realistic two - body random ensemble ( rtbre ) by lifting the degeneracy condition on the single - particle spectrum . \n applications in nuclear physics and in other fields certainly require this .    in what follows we \n will first fix notation defining the tbre properly and proceed in section 3 to analyze properties in the center of the spectrum . in the fourth section \n we consider properties at the edge of the spectrum and we discuss the rtbre which seems to differ mainly there . \n conclusions will be given in the last section . \n the tbre is defined for a fermionic system of @xmath6 spin @xmath8 particles in three dimensions . \n a set of degenerate single - particle states with well defined angular momentum and other quantum numbers is used to construct @xmath6-particle states , that belong to a good total angular momentum @xmath9 , and if we think of a nucleus , also a good isospin @xmath10 . due to the pauli principle and the corresponding blocking of states \n , the lowest single - particle states may not enter the picture because we assume them to be filled and inert . \n the effective two - body interaction usually used in this context was replaced by a gaussian distributed two - body interaction matrix whose strength is irrelevant as no energy scale is established by degenerate single - particle states .    for our numerical studies \n we choose a strength parameter @xmath11 such that the value @xmath12 corresponds to a typical interaction strength in the nuclear @xmath13 shell on which we shall concentrate . \n this parameter will be important for the rtbre , where realistic mean field parameters yield the relevant single - particle energies and thus provide an energy scale . \n the calculations reported here were mainly carried out for eight particles in the @xmath13 shell . \n information about the quantum numbers , dimension of the spectra and the number of matrices of each ensemble used can be found in table [ tabqn ] . \n the corresponding shell model calculations were carried out using the code oxbash @xcite . \n as far as spectral statistics are concerned we shall mainly consider the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution @xmath14 and the number variance @xmath15 and occasionally the skewness and the excess ; for definitions we refer to a standard book such as mehta @xcite . \n .quantum numbers , dimension of the matrices and the number of members for the ensembles analyzed in this paper [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this indicates that the tbre is not ergodic and thus unfolding with the ensemble averaged level density is inappropriate . \n we therefore proceed to adjust a polynomial of degree 7 to each spectrum individually and use this individual density for the unfolding procedure .     after each spectrum \n is unfolded individually . \n the solid line corresponds to the goe . \n ( b ) number variance @xmath15 for the same case . \n the dotted and dashed curves correspond , respectively , to spectral average and ensemble average after re - centering the spectra and normalizing their widths . \n the full line is obtained for the goe . ]    figs 2a and 2b show that now @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in good agreement with the goe prediction and figs . 3a and 3b \n show a similar agreement     and ( b ) excess @xmath16 for the spectral average of the tbre . \n the full line corresponds to the goe . ]    for the skewness and excess . \n we should remark that in this case we could increase the energy interval and decrease the degree of the polynomial in order to get the high quality of the result for @xmath15 up to @xmath17 . \n we discarded 85 states both at the upper and lower end of the spectra . \n these numbers were chosen because omitting fewer states showed significant edge effects while omitting more reduced the range of @xmath18 for which the fluctuations of @xmath15 were acceptable . \n we next wish to check whether the variations of the centers and widths of the spectra were alone responsible for the deviations with respect to the goe . \n therefore we repeated the calculations with an ensemble unfolding after first re - centering all spectra to the same value or , alternatively , normalizing their width to the same value . the result for the number variance for both procedures \n is drawn in fig . \n 1b . both curves for the number variance represent an improvement but remain very far from goe . \n obviously we should apply both corrections , _ \n i.e. _ both re - center and dilate the spectra such as to correspond to uniform centers and widths before the ensemble unfolding . \n the result is such that on the scale of fig . 1b \n it is not distinguishable from the goe . the result is therefore plotted in fig . \n 2b and is comparable to the one obtained by unfolding the individual spectra .    on the average we discarded 105 states at the edges of the spectra and found @xmath19 as the optimum degree for the polynomial in this analysis . \n the quality of the energy averaged @xmath15 is only marginally better . \n higher moments play a minor role . \n we obtained the same result for an ensemble of comparable size and quantum numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n similar agreement was found for @xmath14 , as well as for skewness and excess . \n these results seem to indicate that the first and second moments are basically responsible for the non - ergodicity of the tbre , but we have no theoretical argument to support this conjecture , and thus it might not always be true , or break down with higher exactitude . \n the above procedure eliminates the large fluctuations in the average density of each spectrum , but it is not totally equivalent to the procedure proposed by french @xcite . in the original paper \n the correction he calculated was given for the distribution of widths of @xmath6-th neighbour spacings as a function of @xmath18 . \n we translated the correction to one for @xmath15 ( see equations ( 5.3 ) and ( 6.3 ) of reference @xcite ) that reads as @xmath22 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{d^2 } } { 1 -

centering the spectra . \n this is not explicit in the original paper , but it is the only reasonable way to interpret the basic argument given there . \n indeed , application of the formula to non re - centred spectra gives unreasonable results .    for correlations up to about @xmath18=5 and \n certainly for the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution the correction works quite well ; at larger distances discrepancies become large , as is to be expected if the aim is to simulate the adjustment of the width of a near gaussian . \n the larger the spectra the larger the range on which we expect the correction to work well . in earlier calculations with smaller ensembles \n the number variance was not considered at large distances , and thus the deviation could not be detected . \n the spectral properties of the rtbre at the center are also found to be of goe type up to some energy range which depends on the subspace defined by the quantum numbers we consider and on the interaction strength . \n the fluctuations at the edge of the spectra are of interest because of the comparison with low - lying nuclear states @xcite , and in the context of recent work on the angular momentum dependence of ground states @xcite . \n the quantity to consider is the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution . \n the old results are fitted with a brody distributions @xcite with parameters around @xmath27 . \n recent studies have suggest the use of semi - poisson distributions @xcite , that might be relevant as we are interested in the edge of the spectra . \n these distributions have been discussed in relation with triangles with irrational relations between angles @xcite , where the coincidence is spotty . \n we shall keep this additional option in mind to expand on the old discussions .    the simplest way to proceed \n is to take all spacings between the first and the second level and normalize them to average 1 ( for improved statistics we shall use the corresponding spacings at the upper end of the spectrum also , without mentioning it explicitly each time ) .    ) . \n the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the semi - poisson and the dashed line to the best brody fit . \n ( b ) the same as in ( a ) for the quantum numbers ( @xmath28 ) ]    in fig . \n 5 we show the spacing distribution obtained in this way , and we find amazingly large spacings up to 8 in the case @xmath29 and up to 6 for the ensemble with quantum numbers @xmath28 . note that the same procedure performed on a goe of the same size leads to a spacing distribution very similar to that at the center of the spectrum . \n the semi - poisson distribution does not yield a very convincing fit , but is not worse than the usual brody distribution , despite of the fact that the latter has one free parameter . \n normalizing the distances to @xmath30 might seem too nave . \n although the polynomial unfolding of the integrated spectrum delivered good results for the analysis of the central region it is not useful at the edges . \n therefore we proceed to use a gaussian to unfold each spectrum individually adjusting its parameters . \n this procedure has some merit ; a gaussian is the exact result for the ensemble with infinite dimension , though the fact that we have already re - confirmed the non - ergodicity of the tbre casts some doubt on its application to individual spectra .        in fig . \n 6 we show the spacing distribution between the first and the second states for @xmath29 and @xmath28 unfolded in this way . \n the extremely large spacings have disappeared though the result still differs markedly from a goe . \n the confidence levels , discussed in @xcite for a brody fit , rely heavily on binning the small intensities in the tail in one large bin and are therefore somewhat arbitrary . \n in particular , a few large spacings would not invalidate the fit . \n the analysis of the ensemble for @xmath31 delivered qualitatively the same result and they agree substantially with the old results . the semi - poisson distribution drawn in the same picture \n gives a surprisingly good fit in fig . \n 6b and is somewhat worse in fig . \n note though that the discrepancies again are considerably smaller for the longer spectrum and are not larger for the shorter one than for the brody distribution with an adjusted parameter . \n yet we may ask if the gaussian unfolding is really that meaningful . in this context \n two questions arise : first , is the procedure stable ? and second , does it relate to the only experimental data we have ? while the latter point will be discussed later , the former may be considered by using a gaussian multiplied by a polynomial for unfolding \n . we may then ask if we find any plateau of the result as a function of the degree of the polynomial . \n we considered the brody parameter as a function of the degree of the polynomial and we find that for the short spectrum a polynomial up to degree 2 and for the longer one a polynomial up to degree 4 can be added without a significant change of the brody parameter . \n this , combined with the theoretical expectation of a gaussian in the limit of large matrices , gives us some confidence to use the unfolding mentioned and should encourage further analysis as to the significance of the agreement found with a semi - poisson distribution . \n we next look at the comparison with the nuclear physics results of ref . \n note that here the normalization of the spacings is made as a function of mass number and angular momentum , but in no way is the spectral density further up in the spectrum involved . \n we therefore conclude that only a comparison with the simply normalized spacings shown in fig . \n 5 is legitimate . \n yet these data have a very long tail that seems incompatible with the nuclear data . as we discarded a more sophisticated unfolding \n , we have to fall back on an alternative option . \n obviously the assumption of degenerate single - particle levels is not fulfilled in the nuclear case . \n it therefore seems justified to consider realistic splitting of the single - particle levels combined with a realistic interaction strength , i.e. the rtbre . in this case \n we must limit ourselves to the spacings at the bottom of the spectrum , as symmetry is destroyed by the single - particle energies . \n note that the results we now obtain are dependent on the shell splitting and by no means universal . yet \n if we compare these results in fig . 7 with the experimental ones we see less discrepancies .    . \n the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the semi - poisson and the dashed curve to the best brody fit . ] \n as the nuclear data have poor statistics the agreement is not very meaningful , but at least the few large spacings are consistent and the general shape seems correct . fits with a brody distribution fails in this case and the agreement with a semi - poisson distribution is similarly poor . \n comparison with the unfolded tbre for the smaller sample , on the other hand would give a better fit , but has no real foundation . \n we may conclude that the phenomenology observed in earlier papers for the tbre is essentially correct when viewed with larger spectra . \n the correction formula proposed in @xcite will only correct short - range behaviour if we re - center the spectra previously . \n we found that re - centering spectra and normalizing their widths would remove the non - ergodicity at the center of the spectrum to a large extent . \n note though , that this non - ergodicity is not really a problem at least if we consider the center of the spectra , because in practice we have to unfold each nuclear , atomic , resonance cavity or whatever spectrum individually , anyway . at the center of the spectrum the fluctuation properties of the rtbre \n coincide with those of the tbre on the range determined by the strength of the interaction . \n as far as edge effects are concerned , the situation changes . \n spectral properties with realistic splitting of single - particle levels differ significantly from those of the tbre . \n the rtbre seems to be in better agreement with the nuclear data , but no doubt a new compilation of such data is desirable because the small sample does not allow a detailed comparison . \n the unfolding procedures at the edge of the spectrum are quite sensitive , but we have found unfolding with a gaussian to be quite satisfactory both because of its theoretical background and because of its stability . \n we certainly confirm earlier findings of large fluctuations , and with the gaussian unfolding we found very reasonable agreement with a semi - poisson distribution for the longest spectrum we have . \n we may conclude that future attention should be concentrated on two points : first we should look out for possible effects of the non - ergodicity on wave function properties , and second we should investigate the possible significance of the semi - poisson distribution at the edge of spectra . \n +   we gratefully acknowledge valuable discussions with f.  leyvraz and i.  rotter . \n this work is supported by the following grants : conacyt 32101-e , 32171-e , dgapa ( unam ) in-112998 and nsf 0070911", "StartTimeOffset": 106069492458, "RequestID": "da617cecbe40f0655dcc512dcbd3d809bbc1833e", "TotalTokens": 4158}
{"ContextTokens": 2280, "GeneratedTokens": 168, "SynthesizedBody": "ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions explore extreme conditions of strongly interacting matter . \n these studies connect to a diverse set of forefront topics ranging from saturation of gluonic fields to string theory @xcite . \n experiments at the brookhaven national laboratory rhic facility indicate that a new state of matter is formed in a - a collisions with @xmath0 200  gev / nucleon based on a number of key observations . \n this picture is consistent with extensive lattice qcd studies predicting a phase transition as well as the results from cern experiments at lower energies suggesting the onset of a phase transition . among the key observations , the discovery of _ jet quenching _ is perhaps the clearest indication of the formation of an ultra - dense system - the `` disappearance '' of one of the two jets in back - to - back jet production in central collisions , together with the associated suppression of high-@xmath1 jet events . \n further exploration of this phenomenon , as well as systematic investigations of these collisions , will be possible at the lhc . with a planned ultimate energy of 5.5 tev / nucleon for pb - pb collisions , the anticipated program benefits from a factor of 30 increase in @xmath2 as well as from highly hermetic detector systems with essentially complete coverage in precision calorimetry . \n the complementary heavy ion studies planned for the atlas , cms , and alice experiments at lhc together cover the full spectrum in @xmath1 and pseudorapidity @xmath3 needed to understand the complex and potentially surprising collision events that are anticipated . in the following \n is a brief discussion of the planned program for the atlas experiment , with an overview of the detector and the heavy ion program followed by the prospects for advances in jet quenching studies . \n atlas and cms are the two broad - focus experiments at lhc , with complementary designs that provide excellent resolution and highly hermetic coverage in calorimetry , tracking , and muon systems . \n the atlas calorimetry is a particular strong point for jet quenching studies , with an angular coverage down to @xmath4 5 ( 0.001@xmath5 ) and fine - grained segmentation . \n atlas is comprised of three major detector component types : the inner tracking systems , the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and the muon systems . each is made up of several subsystems ; for an in - depth discussion of these as well as of the superconducting magnets , trigger , readout , data acquisition , controls and other system components , see @xcite . \n the inner tracking systems , which operate in a 2 t solenoidal magnetic field , consist of three subsystems with a total of more than 86 million electronic channels . \n the calorimeters , which represent nearly 190,000 channels , are configured in four subsystems , three of which are based on liquid argon technology . \n the muon systems , which have in total one million channels , make use of toroidal magnetic fields of up to 2.5 and 3.5 t in the barrel and endcap region , respectively . \n an average of 99% of the channels in each of these subsystems were operational well in advance of the 2009 data taking . \n a complex , three - level trigger and data acquisition system selects and transports the data to disk ; calibration , reconstruction , and simulation software are exercised on the worldwide computing grid of lhc , a network of @xmath6 computers located in more than 50 countries around the world . \n the expectations for the heavy ion data are based on extrapolations from rhic energies and from the first p - p data acquired at lhc in 2009 and 2010 . \n because the energy available in the collisions is so much greater than for previous measurements , the first order of business is to check the validity of these extrapolations @xcite . \n of particular interest are the energy density and degree of collectivity of the response , as expressed by global observables such as the charged particle multiplicity and the elliptic flow @xcite . these observables are critical for validating the physical picture extrapolated from rhic measurements , and they can begin to be determined with a relatively small integrated luminosity from the first few days of heavy ion collision data . \n subsequent topics that can be addressed with a one - month run at the planned luminosity of @xmath7 include studies of quarkonia production and of hard probes such as jets and high-@xmath8 hadrons . \n in addition to light quark jets , heavy quark jets and heavy mesons can be accessed . \n the expected sensitivity of atlas to heavy ion events has been fully explored using the hijing @xcite event generator and the full simulation and reconstruction chain of atlas . \n some highlights of these studies are mentioned here , and the results are more fully documented elsewhere @xcite . the first variable to be determined from the data is the event centrality , on which most other observables depend . \n the event centrality can be estimated from the response of the calorimeters ; according to the simulations , the number of collisions within the event , the number of collision participants , and the impact parameter are all monotonically related to the total energy deposits in the forward calorimeter , the electromagnetic calorimeters , and the hadronic calorimeters . \n the estimation of the event centrality using such a primitive measure from several calibrated detector systems will facilitate consistency checks over a wide range in pseudorapidity @xmath3 . \n r0.5     a fundamental observable depending on the event centrality is the charged particle multiplicity @xmath9 . \n it has been shown that @xmath9 can be independently estimated by counting the number of pixel hits in the first , second , and third layers of the atlas pixel detector @xcite . \n the method requires application of a simple correction function that is determined primarily from geometry . \n other methods have also been explored , such as the `` tracklet '' method [ 8 ] that combines an event vertex with hits in the first two pixel layers . \n the determination of @xmath9 will allow a first estimate of the energy density and will eliminate significant uncertainties in extrapolations of this quantity from lower energy collisions . \n the distribution of the transverse energy with angle @xmath10 has been shown to be accurately determined in atlas using a simple energy sum over the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter cells . according to simulations , \n this method reproduces the event - by - event distribution in @xmath11 to the few percent level over the wide angular range @xmath12 . \n elliptic flow @xmath13 is a parameter characterizing the azimuthal angular distribution of particles emitted with respect to the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter vector and the beam axis . \n it is defined through the fourier expansion of this angular distribution    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the angle of the reaction plane within atlas and @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle of an individual particle . \n measurement of elliptic flow in atlas has been explored using three different methods , the reaction plane method , the two - particle correlation method , and the lee - yang zeros method @xcite . \n hijing events have been simulated for impact parameters b=2.3 , 7.0 , and 10.7 fm , and the three methods give results that are consistent within approximately 5% for the most central collisions and somewhat better for the most peripheral collisions as seen in fig . \n the resolution for determination of the reaction plane is particularly good for atlas since this can be performed independently in several different detectors systems , all of which have complete coverage in azimuthal angle @xmath16 . in the simulation studies , the resolution correction averaged over seven subsystems for central events was 0.86 , very close to unity , demonstrating the excellent event plane resolution available in atlas . \n the capability for heavy quarkonium reconstruction has been studied in the dimuon channel . as an example , the mass resolution found for the @xmath17 1s state was found to be approximately 120 mev , easily adequate for separation of the 1s and 2s @xmath17 states @xcite . \n this capability will significantly extend the reach of the color screening studies with quarkonia that have been performed previously at rhic and cern . \n additional studies in the dimuon channel have been performed to determine the atlas performance for identification of @xmath18 and @xmath19 bosons in the heavy ion environment . in these studies , \n a mass resolution for @xmath19 bosons of approximately 2.2 gev was found , comparable to that found in the p - p environment , with a background level of less than 10% for central collisions . \n .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] \n jet suppression is an important component of the atlas heavy ion physics program , and an area where the excellent calorimetry and hermetic coverage of the calorimeters is very beneficial . \n simulations have been performed for light quark jets and photon - tagged jets as well as for heavy quark signatures . \n the background from the low - energy qcd interactions is significant , thus , methods have been developed for identifying light quark jets using a background subtraction procedure , and to identify photons with good efficiency while rejecting signals from other neutral particles @xcite .    in the heavy ion environment , \n jets in atlas after background subtraction are reconstructed with essentially full efficiency above 70 - 80 gev , with no additional corrections required @xcite as seen in fig . \n 2 ( left panel ) . further , according to simulations , there is essentially no distortion of the extracted light quark jet fragmentation function above @xmath20 , and the distortions due to the heavy ion background for @xmath21 can be corrected reliably @xcite . \n extensive studies of direct photons and photon - jet correlations have been performed with hijing simulated data . in order to reject background , isolation cuts and shower shape cuts \n have been developed which can be optimized to preserve good reconstruction efficiency while rejecting hits from neutral hadrons . \n these studies show that excellent direct photon statistics will be obtained as seen in fig . \n 2 ( right panel ) . further , photon - jet correlations are clearly accessible as seen in fig . 3 ( left panel ) @xcite . \n heavy quark jets have been studied in the dimuon channel , using the semileptonic decay of b and c quarks . according to these simulations , \n the purity of the dimuon sample above 50 gev is substantial as can be seen in fig . \n 3 ( right panel ) . heavy quark suppression at rhic remains an unsolved puzzle @xcite , although it can be explained in alternative pictures @xcite , and thus it is of high scientific interest to address it at the lhc . \n further studies relevant to heavy quark jet suppression in atlas are planned , e.g. , in the semileptonic decay to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and in reconstruction of heavy mesons using detached vertex tagging .", "StartTimeOffset": 114023062704, "RequestID": "fac5c40227010381ce8f3ae3199f6ae59389f838", "TotalTokens": 2448}
{"ContextTokens": 2996, "GeneratedTokens": 130, "SynthesizedBody": "bag - of - words ( bow ) was originally proposed for document retrieval . in recent years , the method has been successfully applied to image retrieval tasks in computer vision community @xcite . \n the method is attractive because of its efficient image representation and retrieval . \n bow represents an image as a sparse vector of visual words , and thus images can be searched efficiently using an inverted index file system . \n other major application areas of the bow method are appearance - based mobile robot localization and slam problems . \n the fundamental issue involved with the appearance - based approach to both visual slam and global localization is the place recognition . \n robot should be able to recognize the places it has visited before to localise itself or refine the map of the environment . \n this task is performed by matching the current view of the robot to the existing map that contains the images of the previously visited locations . in this paper \n we consider the problem of appearance - based localization in which the map is known _ a priori_.    in large - scale environments maps contain too many images to match . \n the image search in such a large map is still a challenging and open problem . \n matching images by comparing the local features of each image directly to the local features of all other images in the map is not practical . \n bag - of - words proposes a more efficient approach ; first , rather than matching with a pool of million visual features extracted from many thousands of images , the local features are mapped to a smaller number of vocabulary words that are built in an offline phase . this process is called vector - quantization . \n once the visual words are identified in the query image , they are used as indices into the image database , to directly retrieve the images that share the same words . \n when the vocabulary is large , the vector - quantization process can be a computationally expensive task in real - time localization . \n considerable research has been done to speed up the search ; some papers @xcite do approximate nearest - neighbor search using structures like vocabulary trees @xcite ; some methods reduce the number of local image features by selecting only a fraction of features that are highly discriminative @xcite ; another group makes use of more compact feature descriptors like @xcite . in this paper , we first show that some image retrieval tasks are _ easier _ for bow method . \n the hardness criteria , defined later , concerns how distinctive the image query is among all images in the dataset . given this criteria , \n we show that the bow search can be terminated earlier for easier queries . \n this means , in such queries , mapping only a portion of features can be sufficient to yield a relatively good result . \n the stopping rule saves considerable amount of computational resources . \n the intuition behind this is that when there are many similar images to the query image , in terms of the number of common words they share , the search becomes more difficult as more processing is required to find the closest match candidate . \n whereas when the query image has only a few match candidates , i.e. , it shares its visual words with only a few images , the search becomes easy as vector - quantizing only a small number of features is sufficient to find the closest match to the query . by exploiting this fact \n , we can stop the vector - quantization when the search is easy and the nearest neighbor to the query is easy to find . \n our method acts as an approximate image search algorithm . \n our experimental results show that the accuracy decreases only slightly while the computational cost decreases dramatically \n .    our approach can be best compared with the approach of cummins and newman @xcite who use concentration inequalities ( bennett s inequality in their case ) for early bail - out in multi - hypothesis testing that excludes unlikely location hypotheses from further evaluation . \n however , we use a different bail - out strategy for the process of vector - quantization . in the next section , \n we briefly review the image representation and the inverted - index search algorithm used in bow framework . \n this is followed by a review of the localization algorithms that employ bow for the image search . \n our proposed method to improve the efficiency of bow is described in section  [ sec : method ] . \n section  [ sec : results ] presents the experimental results and the evaluation criteria , and the result of our comparisons . \n finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclud ] . \n bag - of - words is a popular model that has been used in image classification , objection recognition , and appearance - based navigation . because of its simplicity and search efficiency \n it has been used as a successful method in web search engines for large - scale image and document retrieval @xcite . \n bag - of - words model represents an image by a sparse vector of visual words . \n image features , e.g. , sifts @xcite , are sampled and clustered ( e.g. , using k - means ) in order to quantize the space into a discrete set of visual words . \n the centroids of clusters are then considered as visual words which form the visual vocabulary . \n once a new image arrives , its local features are extracted and vector - quantized into the visual words . \n each word might be weighed by some score which is either the word frequency in the image ( i.e. , _ tf _ ) or the `` term frequency - inverse document frequency '' or _ \n tf - idf _ @xcite . \n a histogram of weighted visual words , which is typically sparse , is then built and used to represent the image . \n an inverted index file , used in the bow framework , is an efficient image search tool in which the visual words are mapped to the database images . \n each visual word serves as a table index and points to the indices of the database images in which the word occurs . \n since not every image contains every word and also each word does not occur in every image , the retrieval through inverted - index file is fast . \n bag - of - words model has been extensively used as the basis of the image search in appearance - based localization or slam algorithms @xcite . \n cummins and newman @xcite propose a probabilistic framework over the bag - of - words representation of locations , for the appearance - based place recognition . along with the visual vocabulary they also learn the chow liu tree to capture the co - occurrences of visual words . \n similarly , angeli _ et al . _ \n @xcite develop a probabilistic approach for place recognition in slam . \n they build two visual vocabularies incrementally and use two bow representations as an input of a bayesian filtering framework to estimate the likelihood of loop closures .    assuming each image has hundreds of sift features , mapping the features to the visual words , using a linear search method , is computationally expensive and not practical for real - time localization . \n researchers have tackled this problem with different approaches that speeds up the search but at the expense of accuracy . \n a number of papers have employed compact feature descriptors that speeds up the search . \n glvez - lpez and tards in @xcite propose to use fast @xcite and breif @xcite binary features and introduce a bow model that descritizes a binary space . \n similarly , @xcite use surf @xcite to have a more compact feature descriptor . \n another approach is to use approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms , like hierarchical k - means @xcite , kd - trees @xcite or graph - based search methods @xcite and @xcite , to speed up the quantization process . \n achar _ et al . \n _ @xcite and zhang @xcite propose reducing the number of features in each image , thereby reducing ( removing ) the vector - quantization process . \n they keep track of the features that are repeatable over time . however , these approaches are more specific to the navigation problems where the data is sequential and there exists considerable overlaps between consecutive images . \n our approach is more similar to this group as we also reduce the amount of feature mapping . \n however rather than only selecting a small set of features , we use all features but we stop the mapping process when necessary . our approach is also more general as it does not depend on the sequential property of the data . \n vector - quantization ( vq ) is an expensive process when the bow - based image retrieval is performed in large - scale environments , in which hundreds of features extracted from an image need to be matched against hundreds of thousands of visual words . \n the question is if we really need to vector - quantize all features ? \n depending on the difficulty level of the search , the number of features to be converted to visual words may vary . \n we call a search difficult when there are many similar images to the query and thus finding the nearest neighbor among all those candidates requires more computations \n . whereas in an easy search , the query image is similar to only a few images in the database and it can find its true match after processing only a small percentage of features . \n figure  [ diff_search ] and figure  [ easy_search ] show examples of easy and difficult searches . \n the histograms show the similarity of each database image to the query based on the _ tf - idf _ score . \n the difficult search needs to process at least @xmath0 of features to find the closest match to the query ( indicated by the peak of the histogram ) , however the easy search can stop the search after processing only @xmath1 of features as the peak does not change until the end of the search . comparing the distance between the peak and average of the histograms , it can be seen that in difficult search this distance is smaller than that in easy search , which is expected . \n initially each image starts with no vote . in original bow \n , image features are converted to visual words one by one and the histogram ( of images scores ) is built incrementally . \n each bin of the histogram corresponds to one of the database images and indicates the score of that image . \n each visual word will cast a distance -

{"ContextTokens": 3593, "GeneratedTokens": 278, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent observation on the cosmic microwave background by _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) has revealed that the dark age in the universe ended quite early by the reionization at @xmath3 @xcite . \n but , the origin of ionizing radiation in such an early epoch and the subsequent ionization history after the early reionization are not elucidated very well . \n the first possibility for the ionizing source is pop iii stars @xcite , and the other possibilities are mini quasars @xcite or bh accretion @xcite . \n the early reionization by pop iii stars is recently under debate . \n @xcite argue that the reionization by pop iii stars is marginally compatible with the thomson optical depth measured by the _ wmap _ , @xmath4 , even if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from early formed objects is unity . \n in addition , @xcite explore the feedback effect by supernova ( sn ) energy input in pop iii objects , and find that the suppression of pop iii star formation by sne is so intensive that pop iii stars can not contribute significantly to the cosmic reionization . the strong suppression of pop iii star formation or the early shift to pop ii or pop i star formation may bring the vanishment of ionizing radiation , resulting in the re - neutralization of intergalactic medium ( igm ) . \n this may lead to the so - called double reionization @xcite . \n also , pop iii sne can be the origin of igm heavy elements @xcite . \n the detailed analysis on quasar metal absorption lines have shown that the igm is enriched by heavy elements from a level of @xmath5 10@xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the solar abundance @xcite . \n it is quite perplexing that heavy elements are observed commonly and uniformly in the low density space where no bright galaxies are found . \n although the outflow from small proto - galaxies could be responsible for the enrichment of igm @xcite , the much earlier enrichment by pop iii objects may provide a potential solution for the uniformly distributed metagalactic heavy elements . hence , pop iii star formation history in high redshifts could be a key for the early enrichment . \n we can not observe directly pop iii stars at @xmath11 , but grbs at high redshifts can be a potential tool to probe the formation history of pop iii stars . since the discovery of x - ray afterglow from grb 970228 @xcite , the distances to bright grbs are known to be cosmological @xcite . \n the most distant grb hitherto identified spectroscopically is grb  000131 at @xmath12 @xcite . however , there are numerous much weaker grbs without known distance , listed in the archive by the _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) _ on - board the compton gamma - ray astronomy satellite @xcite . \n recently , @xcite estimated distances of 689 batse weak grbs , based on the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation @xcite , and found that most of grbs are more remote up to @xmath13 . \n a recent great advance on grbs is the finding of the obvious association between grb  030329 and sn  2003dh @xcite . \n this association firmly established the connection between a grb and an energetic supernova ( hypernova ) , which is the collapse of a massive star @xcite . \n since pop iii stars are likely to form in a top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , a portion of grbs at high redshifts possibly result from pop iii hypernovae . \n actually , @xcite estimated the fraction of pop iii grbs using the imf by nakamura & umemura , and found that several percent of pop iii stars result in grbs .    in this letter \n , we derive the star formation rate ( sfr ) of pop iii stars observationally for the first time out to @xmath13 by use of the absolute grb event rate . \n then , using the pop iii sfr , we assess the uv photon emission rate at @xmath2 , in which redshift range no observational constraint has been hitherto placed on ionizing radiation intensity . \n also , we analyze the early metal enrichment of igm by the derived pop iii sfr . here \n , we assume a @xmath14cdm universe with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . \n @xcite published the relative value of the grb event rate up to @xmath13 , based on the spectral peak energy - to - peak luminosity relation . in this letter , we need to estimate an absolute value of grb event rate ( @xmath18 ) in the early universe . in order to do that \n , it is necessary to make corrections for jet - collimation , because the grb emission is collimated in the order of 0.1 radian @xcite . \n if the reported evolution in luminosity @xcite can be attributed to the evolution of jet - collimation , we can correct the collimation using the observed evolution in luminosity with the index @xmath19 defined as ( 1+z)@xmath20 , where 2.6 represents the observed evolution in luminosity @xcite . \n after the correction against jet - collimation , the absolute event rate @xmath18 in a comoving volume is obtained . \n it is not quite certain whether the observed evolution in luminosity is fully due to the collimation or partially due to intrinsic evolution in luminosity . \n so , we use the intermediate case of @xmath19=0.5 for simplicity in this paper . the resultant rate in units of gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 is shown in fig . \n 1 together with the observed data with the systematic and statistical errors . \n the typical rate at @xmath23 is roughly 10@xmath24 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 for the case of @xmath19=0.5 . \n the absolute grb rate allows us to estimate the sfr of pop iii stars with the assistance of the pop iii imf . because of the lack of heavy elements , the imf for pop iii stars is likely to be top heavy with massive stars of @xmath25 , in contrast to the present - day stars @xcite . \n the possible formation of even lower mass pop iii stars with 1 to 50 m@xmath26 is also pointed out @xcite . \n but these stars might be a quite small contribution to the uv emission rate or grb event rate , and therefore omitted in the present analysis . \n the theory on the stellar evolution of extremely metal poor ( @xmath27 ) stars @xcite shows that the stars with about 8 to 40 m@xmath26 will evolve and explode as type - ii sne , leaving a neutron star or a black hole and supplying heavy elements into space . \n the stars with 40 to 140 @xmath28 will produce uv photons during their evolutionary pass , but will not supply any heavy element into space , because they will collapse completely , forming a black hole . \n the stars with 140 to 260 m@xmath26 will explode as a pair - instability sne , forming a black - hole and supplying heavy elements into space . among these stars , \n the key interest is the stars with 100 to 140 @xmath28 , which can result in grbs as progenitors . \n this mass range is sometimes called an energetic sn ( hypernova ) . hence , in metal poor environments , grb events occur only in the narrow mass range in the pop iii imf .    here , we employ the pop iii imf by @xcite , which is in the form of a double - peaked function with sharp cutoffs with power - law shape : @xmath29 and cutoffs : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively ( see nakamura & umemura 2001 for details ) . \n as stated above , we consider only a high - mass part of the imf . \n the normalization factor can be determined by the grb event rate , @xmath18 , which corresponds to a mass range of @xmath32 . \n then , if the pop iii fraction @xmath33 in the observed grb rate is given , we can derive the pop iii sfr in terms of @xmath34 after an integration over the imf . actually , @xmath35 is a function of time . \n @xcite show that the grb range quickly expands for @xmath36 ( pop i / ii ) , but simultaneously the imf is likely to become the present - day type ( salpeter ) imf for the enriched gas @xcite . as a result , the mass fraction of grbs originating from pop i / ii stars is roughly twice as high as that of pop iii grbs . \n hence , if @xmath37 is the fraction of pop iii stars , the @xmath35 is given by @xmath38 it is expected that @xmath37 is near unity in an early epoch , and then decreases with the metal enrichment . @xcite \n have derived the @xmath37 as a function of redshift . \n theyhave analyzed the dependence of @xmath37 upon the total energy input into outflows from pop iii ejecta per unit gas mass , @xmath39 in units of @xmath40  ergs @xmath41@xmath42 . \n the model with @xmath43 is roughly corresponding to @xmath44 , while the model with @xmath45 is to @xmath46 . \n hence , combining ( [ fgrb ] ) with ( [ sfr ] ) , it is concluded that the observed grb event rate implies the continuous formation of pop iii stars at @xmath1 . \n the massive stars with more than 50 @xmath28 radiate photons in the black body of @xmath47 k , which are energetic enough to ionize neutral hydrogen . \n their luminosities should be near the eddington luminosity @xcite , so @xmath48 uv photons are emitted during their lifetime of @xmath49 yrs . \n for the pop iii sfr assessed above , we can evaluate the total uv photon emission rate per unit cosmological comoving volume as @xmath50 for stars heavier than 50 @xmath28 , where @xmath51 is given in units of @xmath52 . \n the resultant uv emissivity by pop iii stars is shown in fig . \n 2 . on the other hand , \n the uv photon emission rate required to keep ionizing hydrogen in the universe is estimated as @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the clumping factor of igm and @xmath55 is the recombination time , @xmath56 . \n several authors have argued the effect of clumpiness on the reionization @xcite . \n since the clumpiness shortens the recombination time in hii regions , then the clumping factor should be estimated by @xmath57 . \n when all the matter is totally ionized , @xmath54 becomes equal to the clumping factor of baryons , @xmath58 . \n but , if the igm is partially ionized where density peaks are self - shielded , @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath59 \n . therefore , @xmath60 corresponds to the minimum level requisite for the igm ionization , while @xmath58 does to the maximum level . in fig . \n 2 , the uv emission rate for reionization is shown for @xmath60 and @xmath58 which is taken from @xcite . \n the most recent results of wmap suggest much higher clumping factor than their value but we should wait for the second wmap results for more accurate disccusion . as seen in fig . \n 2 , the uv photon emission rate inferred from the grb events exceeds the maximum level for the igm ionization at all epochs of @xmath2 , for the @xmath61 model or for the pop iii grb fraction larger than several 10% . \n however , if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much smaller than 10% , the photon emission rate can fall below the maximum rate . \n especially , when larger systems form at lower redshifts in a cdm universe , the escape fraction may be reduced significantly @xcite . \n then , the igm may be neutralized at some redshift , at lower redshifts , pop i / ii stars would make more contributions to ionizing photon budget , which may reionize the igm again . \n next , we consider the enrichment by heavy elements synthesized in pop iii objects . \n since the amount of mass ejection from energetic sne ( hypernovae ) and from pair instability sne into space is very roughly @xmath5 0.1 and @xmath5 0.5 of the initial mass for @xmath32 and @xmath62 respectively @xcite , we can estimate the heavy element production rate into the igm as @xmath63 @xmath28 gpc@xmath21 yr@xmath22 . using the pop iii sfr , \n the metallicity of the igm enriched by pop iii stars is estimated to be @xmath64 for @xmath45 and @xmath65 for @xmath43 . \n the model with @xmath43 appears to overproduce the igm metals , if compared to @xmath5 10@xmath8 at @xmath9 @xcite . \n however , it should be noted that all synthesized metals can not be spread out from pop iii objects @xcite . \n then , even the model with @xmath43 may not provide sufficient metals for the igm metallicity . \n in this paper , we have estimated the absolute grb event rate out to @xmath6612 observationally with the correction for collimation . \n there have been also several efforts to estimate a grb event rate in the early universe , using the independent method @xcite . \n all the results are broadly consistent with each other and show that there is no break in the grb event rate as a function of redshift .    based on the grb event rate \n , we have found that pop iii stars could form continuously at @xmath1 . \n this implies that pop iii star formation is not likely to be strongly suppressed in early epochs . \n this is qualitatively consistent with the recent study on the star formation history in dwarf spheroidals in the local group , which shows the continuous star formation even after the reionization @xcite . \n also in recent theoretical studies , it is shown that dwarf galaxies can form owing to the self - shielding even during the reionization @xcite , and the star formation can be induced by sn - driven shock @xcite . \n as for the reionization , it has been found that the uv emission from pop iii stars can make a noticeable contribution to the early reionization . \n if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is large enough , then the uv emission from pop iii stars can keep ionizing the igm at @xmath2 . \n but , if it is smaller , it can lead to the re - neutralization of igm at some redshift , which may result in the double reionization @xcite . regarding the enrichment , \n a high pop iii fraction in high-@xmath67 grbs may lead to the overproduction of igm metals if all synthesized metals are spread out into the intergalactic space . \n but , if they are confined around pop iii objects , it may be difficult to account for igm metals solely by pop iii stars . \n finally , it is noted that there still remain a few less robust factors in this type of analysis . \n the most unknown factor is the validity of the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation for grbs out to @xmath68 12 . although yonetoku et al . \n ( 2004 ) derived a firm relation out to about @xmath68 5 based on the observed redshifts , this relation to higher redshifts is not confirmed . \n the second key is the correction for collimation of grbs . \n grbs are really collimated , but we do not know a degree of collimation in luminosities for grbs at @xmath69 . \n these should be confirmed by detecting grbs out to @xmath70 10 in the mission like the _ swift _ grb satellite . \n also , we should check the consistency of the obtained pop iii sfr with the infrared background . \n we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments . \n this work is supported in part by a grant -

{"ContextTokens": 2903, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "with ever increasing global population and even faster densification of various large metropolitan areas of the world , mass transit systems are becoming more important . \n improved transit systems are also important for keeping personal cars off of congested road networks , thus addressing climate change concerns and making future switch to cleaner energy source easier . \n urban planners are hard at work designing faster , cheaper , safer and more comfortable transit systems . \n most often local and federal governments are in charge of building transit systems . \n if we view transit systems as a public utility then this government control is reasonable . \n but it also means that there is almost no competition in most cities . \n it is widely believed that for most businesses competition may improve efficiency and quality of service . \n one area where fierce competition has helped reduce inefficiencies is electronic capital markets . global stock exchanges and market places \n are more at sync and bid - ask spreads are low . \n one core principle that guides such optimization is the elimination of arbitrage or riskless profit making \n .    the goal of this paper is to investigate whether there are pricing inefficiencies in mass transit systems that can lead to arbitrage and ask how we can improve transit fares for commuters . as a case study we looked at san francisco bay area rapid transit ( bart ) system , which is the fifth largest transit system by ridership in the us . \n we also took a cursory look at washington dc metrorail , which is the second largest system in the us . \n a motivating example is the case when one individual is traveling from millbrae station , a suburb south of san francisco , to embarcadero station which is downtown san francisco , and at the same time a second individual is traveling from glen park station , a residential area in san francisco , to berkeley station where university of california berkeley is located . \n the two tickets cost ( according to http://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/bart%202014%20fare%20chart_tab.pdf[2014 fare chart ] ) $ 4.50 and $ 4.20 respectively . \n but if during the segment between glen park station and embarcadero station the two travelers agree to exchange their tickets the cost becomes $ 5.10 and $ 1.85 . \n so from a total cost of $ 8.70 a simple ticket swap saves $ 1.75 or 20% . \n another similar example comes from washington dc metrorail . \n if one individual is traveling from vienna / fairfax station to metro center station on the orange line and another individual is traveling from rosslyn station to new carrollton station on the same train then during peak hours they pay $ 5.3 and $ 4.9 . \n but if the travelers decide to swap tickets they pay $ 5.75 and $ 2.1 instead \n . so the saving is $ 2.35 or 23% of total trip cost .    in the following sections we discuss general conditions for arbitrage and how those are reflected in real systems like bart \n in this paper we use the phrase _ fare arbitrage _ as the scenario where two individuals traveling separately have overlapping routes and may agree to exchange tickets to decrease the total price of their trips . higher order arbitrage where more than two travelers decide to exchange tickets \n is not considered here . \n fig  [ fig : transit - diagram ] shows a transit route from station a to d via stations b and c. suppose one traveler is going from station a to c while another traveler is going from station b to d. between stations b and c both travelers are on the same train . \n if they choose to swap tickets the transit system will see one traveler going from station a to d while another from b to c. if the total price of latter two tickets is less than the actual trips then there is fare arbitrage . \n the reverse case could also be true  if two travelers going from a to d and b to c respectively have to pay higher price than a to c and b to d then arbitrage becomes possible . \n one simple pricing method that is quite common is to have a fixed fare for all trips . \n large transit systems such as new york city and chicago have such flat rates . \n although this method eliminates fare arbitrage , it may only be feasible for a city with a large population , high density and high fraction of citizens using the service for daily commute . \n another common strategy is to use a price proportional to distance traveled . \n this fair pricing model is showed as the grey line in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] . \n san francisco bay area caltrain system breaks up the route into zones and uses prices that are proportional to the number of zones traveled . like the flat rate method \n , this pricing strategy also eliminates fare arbitrage . \n but it may not be optimal for revenue maximization if the transit system is complex and population density is non - uniform . \n it may also not be ideal if policy makers wish to change population density by encouraging people to move closer to city center or farther out . \n attempts to explain these curves using population density . ]    going back to the example in fig  [ fig : transit - diagram ] let us assume that the individual going from station a to c is traveling distance @xmath0 while the individual going from station b to d is traveling distance @xmath1 . \n suppose @xmath2 and @xmath3 . \n let us assume @xmath4 is the fare as a function of distance . \n we can express the arbitrage condition as follows . \n @xmath5    if @xmath6 and our two travelers swap their tickets during their trip , they get a discount worth @xmath7 . \n this scenario is possible if the fare function has a concave shape , as shown by the blue curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] .    in fig \n [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] the blue curve is above the fair grey line . \n this implies short distances are penalized to maxmize transit revenue . if the blue line had the same concave shape but were below the grey line then short distances are fair but long distances are subsidized .    if @xmath8 then a pair of travelers where one is traveling from a to d and the other from b to c can get a discount of @xmath9 if they choose to swap tickets mid trip . \n convex price functions such as the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] give rise to such arbitrage . \n since the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] is below the grey line , short distances are subsidized but long distances are fair . \n a similar convex curve above the grey line would mean short distances are fair but long distances are penalized . \n hypothetical population density scenarios related to price functions in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] are shown in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] . in the top diagram \n a ( blue ) transit line starts and ends in sparse suburbs and passes through a dense region . in this case revenue can be increased by following the blue concave curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] where there is an extra charge to enter the dense region .    in the bottom diagram of fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] the ( red ) transit line connects two dense regions , with sparse area in between . in this case revenue \n is maximized if fares follow a convex curve similar to the red curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] but above the grey fair price line . \n both these scenarios are likely in real world and both give rise to fare arbitrage . \n intuitively , the top diagram in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] should match global structure of most metropolitan areas . \n san francisco bart and washington dc metrorail does indeed resemble this . \n but we also see evidence of smaller instances of the bottom diagram of fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] in some part of the transit system . \n san francisco bay area rapid transit ( bart ) is the fifth largest transit system in the us with almost half a million riders on average on a weekday . \n fig  [ fig : bart - map ] shows a simplified diagram of bart with denser areas in ovals . \n five routes of bart according to fig  [ fig : bart - map ] are shown in table  [ tab : bart - routes ] . \n four out of the five routes pass through dense san francisco city , cross the bay tunnel ( thick line in fig  [ fig : bart - map ] ) , then through dense oakland and end in suburban areas . \n the other route is the richmond - fremont line which passes through oakland . \n all five routes resemble the top diagram of population scenario in fig  [ fig : fare - scenario ] .    . \n the thick line between san francisco city and oakland represents the bay tunnel . ] \n fig  [ fig : millbrae - richmond ] shows fares from millbrae towards richmond at various stations as a function of number of stops . \n we notice that the region between station 3 and station 7 corresponds to the steep price of entering san francisco city . once inside downtown san francisco fares from millbrae \n are flat until the bay tunnel is crossed . \n there is a small bump between station 12 and station 14 to enter oakland . beyond oakland fare increases roughly linearly . \n .bart routes in fig  [ fig : bart - map ] . \n [ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : bart - arbitrage ]    the first two rows in table  [ tab : bart - arbitrage ] are due to the higher price commuters have to pay when they travel from san francisco to oakland compared to commuters who have started outside san francisco and already paid a high price to enter the city . \n someone going from san francisco airport to embarcadero can swap tickets with someone from balboa park and leverage the lower price to cross into oakland . \n the last two rows in table  [ tab : bart - arbitrage ] are due to increased fares near the end of the routes shown in fig  [ fig : millbrae - richmond ] and fig  [ fig : richmond - fremont ] . \n this is similar to the red convex curve in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] . \n so a commuter going from richmond to fremont can swap tickets with someone from bay fair and avoid the higher price of the full route . for a commuter from bay fair , \n hayward and fremont have very similar fares . \n bart has 44 stations and @xmath10 = 946 unique trips . from these 946 trips we get @xmath11 = 446,985 unique pairs of trips . out of these pairs of trips \n 60,334 or 13.5% have arbitrage opportunity of at least 5 cents and 4,666 or 1% have at least $ 1 to be gained . \n the full list of these 4,666 pairs of trips with net arbitrage amount and percentage is available at this https://github.com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage/blob/master/data/sf/arbitrage.txt[`github repo file ` ] ] . \n computing such pairs involves exhaustively finding overlapping paths between trips where the cost would be lower . \n given that transit graphs are often spanning trees , even a brute force solution has complexity @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of stations in the system \n . for bart @xmath13 = 44 and computation finishes in under a minute on a laptop . \n source code , input and output data is available at https://github.com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage[`github.com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage ` ]    if bart authorities release anonymized data of every trip for users traveling through the system it would be very interesting to compute the total amount in dollars that san francisco bay area commuters can save every day \n .    it would be interesting to explore washington dc metrorail in detail as well . \n since it is a larger system with peak and off - peak rates , arbitrage strategies could be more complicated . \n preliminary investigation exposes possibility of arbitrage . \n fig  [ fig : vienna - carrollton ] shows fares from vienna / fairfax station towards new carrollton on the orange line of washington dc metrorail . \n we can see that the price structure is indeed very similar to the blue line in fig  [ fig : dist - vs - fare ] and what we have seen for bart . \n the initial steep part passes through falls church suburbs leading to slight flattening around george mason university ( station 5 ) . \n there is another steep part leading to dc city center around station 10 . \n heading out towards the suburbs prices are essentially flat for commuters coming all the way . \n in this paper we have explored basics of transit fare arbitrage and analyzed bart fare structure both qualitatively and quantitatively via exhaustive computation . our study highlights the need for careful design of pricing models for transit systems . \n one interesting direction that might lead to an efficient fare system is if tickets are all electronic , ideally via a smartphone app , that third parties can manage to optimize inidividual trips . in recent years bart \n has moved from paper tickets towards clipper cards ( nfc tags ) . \n data is encrypted on these cards and can be read by any nfc reader but not written to except for bart machines . \n if in future we start using smartphone nfc capabilites ( google wallet for example ) and allow third parties to dynamically swap account profile on the smartphone app then arbitrage will be technically very easy \n . it may even allow arbitrage between routes that do not have overlapping paths and ultimately force the prices to be arbitrage free and thus efficient . \n we can imagine companies like uber and lyft managing such apps to provide commuters with a uniform payment interface encompassing ride shares and mass transit .", "StartTimeOffset": 159713208552, "RequestID": "29186ffe3a250145f71793c1d91914a376415875", "TotalTokens": 3061}

passivated nanoparticles where used , where the attached chains determine the minimum distance between two neighbouring nanoparticles . \n another way to induce desired interaction between two nanoparticles was designed recently with attaching the pieces of biologically compatible strands of dna molecules to different nanoparticles @xcite . \n the dna - mediated interaction then utilizes the _ biological recognition _ and binding energy of the compatible dna base pairs . depending on the number of other factors , which we will also discuss later \n , this programmable self - assembly may lead to random as well as regular super - crystal structures , as shown in recent experiments in refs . \n @xcite . somewhat similar ( but in a different potential range ) , is the bio - recognition assembly which utilizes biologically compatible protein molecules , for instance the antigen \n antibody recognition @xcite , which can be used in biosensors . \n the nanoparticle assemblies exhibit a wide range of physical properties which are not found in the bulk materials and at the level of a single nanoparticle @xcite . \n moreover , the emergent physical properties of the nanoparticle assemblies can often be related to their spatial structure @xcite . \n for instance , new optical and magnetic properties have been found in super - lattices made of nanocrystal @xcite . by speciffic functionalization of their surfaces \n gold nanoparticles develop directionally dependent exchange interaction @xcite . assuming that such nanoparticles can be arranged on nodes of a sparse scale - free graph \n , numerical simulations predict new features of the magnetic response of such a structure @xcite , compared to the classical memory materials @xcite . similarly , the films of gold nanoparticles under voltage bias conduct current via _ single - electron tunneling \n _ processes @xcite due to their small capacitances and the coulomb blocade effects @xcite . \n in contrast to classical conduction , the single - electron conduction processes have numerous advantages , e.g. , the absense of dissipation due to heathing , and the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics , which are important in the nanoelectronics . experimentally a large nonlinearity of the current  voltage curve has been found in self - assembled nanoparticle films on substrates , which appears to be fairly correlated with the film structure @xcite . \n the random structure of nanoparticle films on substrates can be adequately modelled by planar graphs ( _ nano - networks _ ) @xcite . for the charge transport via single - electron processes , which we study here , the topological elements of these nano - networks are suitably selected as follows : the _ nodes _ represent nanoparticles , whereas _ edges _ ( links ) are the tunneling junctions between two nanoparticles . \n for the junction ( link ) to occur between two nanoparticles , the distance between them must be smaller than the _ tunneling radius _ of the electrons for that kind of nanoparticles @xcite . \n the charge transport through the film under applied voltage can be described within the model of the capacitively - coupled nanoparticles on substrate @xcite . in our previous work @xcite we generalized the model of capacitively - coupled nanoparticle assemblies for an arbitrary topology of the nano - networks @xcite and implemented a numerical model of single - electron tunnelings driven by the external voltage through such networks . \n theoretical background and the details of the numerical implementation is reviewed in ref . \n the simulation results revealed the topology - induced nonlinearity in the @xmath0 curve , in a good agreement with the experiments @xcite .    in the present work we study the collective dynamic behavior which makes the physical basis for the observed @xmath0 nonlinearity , in particular , the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations monitored at each nanoparticle and inhomogeneous charge flow along the conducting paths through the sample and at the electrode . \n we determine the probability distributions of various quantities related to the conduction process and demonstrate how the topological and charge disorder affect the quantitative statistical properties and the @xmath0 dependences . \n the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  2 we present the model of the particle self - assembly with bio - recognition bonding and show some of the typical emergent structures . in section  3 \n we summarize the theoretical background of the conduction with single - electron processes and its numerical implementation for an arbitrary network topology . \n the visualization of the conduction paths through two network types , the regular and inhomogeneous nanoparticle aggregates , as well as the statistical properties of the topological and charge flow are shown in section  4 . in section  5 \n we analyse the simulated time series of charge and current fluctuations and the related @xmath0 curves . \n section  6 gives a short summary of the results . \n different assembly processes make use of the liquid phase , that provides the nanoparticle diffusion and affects the interaction . \n the assembly with fast evaporation of the liquid @xcite induces additional constraints to the particle motion and interaction . \n the interaction itself between pairs of the nanoparticles moving in a liquid is taking part at short distances and depends on the type of functionalization of their surfaces , as mentioned above . in the case of bio - recognition binding , which we will discuss shortly here , \n the attached dna induce the differences between two types of nanoparticles , i.e. , type a and type b nanoparticles , each of which carry the biologically compatible strand of the same dna molecule . \n thus , the interaction between a  b type is attractive within some bonding distance @xmath1 . \n the bonding distance depends on the lengths of the attached molecules and on the number of the compatible base - pairs on them @xcite . \n therefore , it exceeds the sum of the particle radii @xmath2 . the effective interaction between a \n b particles can be then modeled by the lennard - jones potential @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the actual distance between particles and the potential minimum corresponds to the optimal bonding distance . in the present case , \n the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend , roughly speaking , on the lengths of the attached dna chains and the strength of binding ( number of the compatible base pairs)@xcite . on the contrary , the particles which carry biologically incompatible dna strands have no attractive interaction of this type . the repulsive part alone of the potential in eq . \n ( [ eq - ljpotential ] ) can describe the interaction of the equal - type particles a  a and b  b , occurring at short distances .    [ \n cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the correlations in the current fluctuations at the electrode , i.e. , at the last layer of the nanoparticles connected to the electrode , are caused by the tunneling processes deeper in the sample . \n the time - series of the number of tunnelings \\{@xmath7 } at all nanoparticles in in the whole network and their power spectra are shown in fig . \n [ fig - nt ] . \n the power spectrum of the number of tunnelings exhibits long - range correlations for high frequencies , according to @xmath8 the exponent @xmath9 ( within numerical error bars ) for the topologically disordered nano - network nnet1 , suggesting strong cooperation between the conducting paths . \n whereas , the correlations are much weaker in the triangular array , leading to @xmath10 for high frequencies , and the absence of correlations at low frequencies . \n in our numerical study of the conducting nanoparticle films on substrates , we pointed out several steps that play an important role in designing the conduction properties of the films . specifically , we study in quantitative details the emergent properties of such nanoparticle assemblies along the line from the self - assembly processes , the topology of structures , and conduction through such structures .    *   _ self - assembly _ processes are leading to different types of structures of the film . \n we have shown that both regular and highly inhomogeneous nanoparticle films , which are typically fabricated in entirely different techniques@xcite , can be assembled within the same process with the bio - recognition binding and varying a single control parameter . \n *   _ conducting paths _ through the film have been identified and their topological centrality and the dynamical flow computed for for @xmath11 . \n coalescence of flow along different paths contributes to the nonlinear @xmath0 dependences in a range of voltages above the transition @xmath12 . in our simulations , \n the nonlinearity exponent @xmath13 depends strongly on the structure , in agreement with measured @xmath14 curves in different nanoparticle films @xcite . *   _ collective dynamical effects _ in the tunneling processes deep inside the sample lead to the non - gaussian current fluctuations at the electrode . \n we have determined various statistical measures of these collective effects . \n in particular , we find the long - range correlations in charge fluctuations at all nanoparticles , broad distribution of flow on junctions through the nano - network , and non - gaussian distribution of the current increments on the electrode . a non - gaussian distribution have been found in the experiments with nanowires @xcite . \n our numerical results suggest that @xmath15-gaussian distribution with different parameters could be measured in the nanoparticle films . \n the occurrence of the @xmath15gaussian in a larger class of complex dynamical systems with long - range interactions has been discussed recently @xcite . \n furthermore , we demonstrate how different types of disorder affect the conduction in our comparative study of the regular nanoparticle array in the presence of local charge disorder , on one side , and the topologically inhomogeneous nano - network without charge disorder , on the other . \n we hope that our detailed numerical study of the processes leading to different structures and the structure - dependent function of the nanoparticle assemblies sheds a new light on the problem of engineering of the functional materials with desired characteristics . \n we thank the project mrtn -

{"ContextTokens": 3138, "GeneratedTokens": 105, "SynthesizedBody": "the primary purpose of the microboone @xcite experiment is to explore an anomaly in its predecessor , miniboone , ( sec [ sec : miniboone ] ) by utilizing the unique properties of a lartpc . \n it will also be an important step in the u.s . \n lartpc program , being the largest lartpc to be built in the u.s . \n to date as well as achieving some important milestones in the technology worldwide . \n microboone will be located at fermi national laboratory along the booster neutrino beam . \n the detector hall will be located slightly upstream of the miniboone detector hall and below ground on the beamline . \n microboone will contain 170 tons of lar with a fiducial volume of roughly 60 tons . \n lartpcs consist of a volume of lar with an applied electric field produced by a potential difference across the detector ( 125 kv , or 500 v / cm in microboone ) , and planes of wires on the @xmath0 end of this field . \n there are also often phomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) to see the scintillation light from the argon . \n when a charged particle travels through the argon , it ionizes the argon atoms , producing ionization electrons along its path . \n the ionization electrons rapidly reach terminal velocity and drift towards the wire planes due to the applied electric field . \n microboone has 3 wire planes \n the first two are induction planes , which measure the induced current in the wires by the ionization electrons , and the third is a collection plane , which collects these electrons . \n the information from these planes allows the 3d paths of the initial charged particles traveling through the detector as well as their deposited energy to be reconstructed ( figure [ fig : eventdisplay ] ) . from this \n , we can reconstruct the energy of the neutrino that produced these charged particles . \n the primary motivation for microboone is an anomalous result seen in the miniboone experiment . \n miniboone is a cherenkov detector searching for @xmath1 neutrino oscillations . \n miniboone measured an unexplained 3@xmath2 excess of events at low energies ( fig [ fig : miniboone ] ) . \n this excess can be due to some unexpected background or new physics . \n the main problem with determining the nature of this excess is that cherenkov detectors can not distinguish converting photons ( @xmath3 ) from electrons , since cerenkov detectors only have a  20 cm vertex resolution where @xmath4 2 cm or the ability to measure @xmath5 would be needed to distinguish @xmath6 s from @xmath7s . \n microboone however , is sensitive to the different amounts of energy they deposit and can produce a high resolution reconstruction of events . \n there is a clear separation in microboone between electrons , which deposit  1 mip of energy , and photons converted into electron - positron pairs , which deposit  2 mips of energy in the first few centimeters of their tracks ( fig [ fig : egamma ] ) . \n candidate data as a function of energy . \n an excess of events above background is visible at low energies.,width=377 ]    ) , width=302 ]      microboone is also an important stage in the development of lar technology in the community . \n microboone will be the largest lartpc to be built in the u.s . \n it will also be the first lartpc to attempt to drift ionization electrons 2.5 m . demonstrating this 2.5 m drift is an important milestone which must be achieved in order to be able to build larger lartpcs . \n the goal of our lartpc r&d is to make this technology a viable option for next generation kiloton scale detectors . \n lartpc technology has many features that can benefit neutrino physics , but we first must demonstrate the scalability of the technology . some of the challenges that microboone will be addressing are noise - reducing cold electronics , lar purity in larger detectors , analysis tools , and understanding cross sections in lar . \n argoneut @xcite has already made important measurements of cross sections in lar , but microboone will build on this with its larger fiducial volume and higher statistics . \n microboone has a variety of other physics goals as well . \n firstly , the low energy neutrino cross section measurements are an important physics goal . \n it is important to understand how to model neutrino interactions on different nuclei . \n microboone is also sensitive to a burst supernova . \n it is sensitive to all neutrino species for elastic scattering , charged current , and neutral current events . \n this is not unique to lar , but we can learn a lot from detecting these neutrinos in lar , particularly in future larger detectors . \n we are also able to prepare for future proton decay searches ( @xmath8 ) . \n microboone is not large enough to see proton decay , but we can develop particle i d , triggers , and understand background . \n the ability to see proton decay is a very attractive feature of lar detectors as the outgoing k is below cherenkov threshold and therefore invisible to cherenkov detectors , which are currently the leading detector type for kiloton scale detectors . \n microboone is also sensitive to @xmath9 , the fraction of proton spin carried by the strange quark , through neutral current elastic scattering . \n this is impossible for most detectors because it is difficult to tell protons from neutrons , but liquid argon detectors can measure the energy of the outgoing proton and may be able to see the disconnected neutron - proton vertex . measuring @xmath9 in lar will help us to better understand proton spin . \n lastly , microboone will be able to search for exotic physics such as decays of exotic heavy particles . \n while the information provided by the argon scintillation light is not directly used in the determination of the energy of the incident neutrinos , the @xmath10 it provides is required . without it , there is some uncertainty between where the event occurred in the detector and when the event took place , since we only know when the event reached the wire planes . \n a light collection system allows us to reject background by comparing interaction time with the beam time structure , which is crucial for a surface detector like microboone . \n it also allows us to trigger on interesting non - beam events , which is necessary in order to study events like from supernovae or proton decay in liquid argon . knowing the exact location of an event can also allow corrections for charge losses and diffusions as a function of drift distance which allows for a more accurate measurement of energy deposits . \n the light that we are interested in measuring is the scintillation light of the argon . \n there are two paths for scintillation light to be produced @xcite @xcite :    the fast scintillation path : :    makes up about 25% of the scintillation light . \n as a charged particle    travels through the lar , it may excite the argon atoms . \n when this    occurs , the excited argon atom may combine with another argon atom to    form a singlet state excimer which will then decay to form two argon    atoms and a 128 nm photon . \n this process takes   6ns . \n the slow scintillation path : :    makes up the other 75% of the scintillation light and begins with the    charged particle traveling through the lar ionizing the argon atom    ( the same process by which the ionization electrons are produced ) . the    resulting argon ion can recombine with another argon atom and another    electron in order to produce a triplet state excimer . \n this excimer    then decays into a singlet state excimer , which as before , decays into    two argon atoms and a 128 nm photon . \n this process takes 1.6    @xmath11    this 128 nm scintillation light is in the vacuum uv , a range of wavelengths which is unable to pass through most substances , including air . \n this 128 nm light is also unable to pass through the glass of a photomultiplier tube , so we must first shift the light to wavelengths in the visible range in order to detect it .      in order to detect the argon scintillation light with photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) \n , we use a wavelength shifting material called tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) to coat acrylic plates positioned in front of the pmts . \n tpb absorbs light in the uv and re - emits in the visible ( fig [ fig : tpbspectrum ] ) . the efficiency for re - emission of light absorbed at 128 nm has been determined by ref @xcite to be 120% for a film of pure tpb made through vacuum evaporation . \n we plan to use a coating of 50% tpb and 50 % polystyrene ( ps ) for our plate coating , which we have measured to have about 50% of the efficiency of the evaporative coating . \n we find that this mixture makes the plates more durable and also more cost effective . \n the tpb coated plates have a diameter of 12 \" and will be placed on top of posts so that they are suspended directly above the pmts ( fig [ fig : pmtmount ] ) . \n the posts , which are made of the thermally resistant material polyether ether ketone ( peek ) , also serve to hold the pmt in place . there will be 30 pmts in microboone arranged behind the wire planes along the side of the detector outside of the electric field region ( fig [ fig : pmtmount ] ) . \n while the microboone light collection system is a good fit for a  100 ton lar detector , there are many challenges this system would face when scaling up to a larger multi - kiloton detector . \n the proposed multi - kiloton detectors use modules which each have their own electric fields and wire planes , so that the electric field does not have to be applied across too large of a distance , as the necessary field strength would be difficult to work with . having a light collection system only on the edges of such \n a detector is unlikely to be successful , as the light has a large probability of being absorbed during multiple rayleigh scatters . \n having a system that could slide in between wireplanes would be a solution to this problem . \n our solution is a lightguide detection system @xcite where lightguides are bent to guide light adiabatically into pmts which are placed out of the electric field region . \n ( see fig [ fig : tesspaddle ] ) . \n these lightguides would take up far less of the fiducial volume of the detector than a system of pmts , as well as being able to go places that pmts can not such as in electric fields and tighter spaces . \n a much larger area of coverage is also possible .          in order for lightguiding to occur without the light having originally entered at the end of the guide \n , the light must be produced inside the guide . \n this is accomplished by embedding the tpb in a thin film of polystyrene ( ps ) , a good index of refraction match to acrylic , and applying this coating to the surface of the acrylic . \n the coating is a mixture of 25% tpb to 75% ps . \n when the uv light hits a tpb molecule , the outgoing visible light is emitted isotropically inside the film and may be totally internally reflected if the light is emitted above the critical angle of the guide . \n this coating must be optically smooth for better lightguiding properties . \n the lightguides are tested using a small @xmath12 disk source placed @xmath13 5 mm from the lightguide which produces @xmath14 mev @xmath15 particles . \n these @xmath16 travel @xmath17 in argon , producing photons along its path through the mechanism described in section [ sec : light_in_lar ] which may hit the lightguide and be transmitted to a r7725-mod pmt . \n our setup is shown in fig [ fig : lightguide_setup ] . \n the pmt observes a multi - photoelectron prompt pulse from the fast scintillation light , which arrives all at once , as well as single photoelectron ( p.e . ) \n late pulses ( fig [ fig : pulse ] ) . \n disk source placed @xmath185 mm from the lightguide emits photons through argon scintillation which hit the lightguide , are shifted , and reemitted down the lightguide and into the pmt , width=188 ]        these pulses are calibrated in two ways in ref @xcite . \n we must define one p.e . in terms of adc counts . \n the first method is to define one p.e . by the late light , as most of the late light pulses only contain one p.e . , and take the mean of the gaussian that results by fitting the pulse heights of these late light charges . \n the second method is to fit the early pulse with equally spaced gaussians ( with the spacing allowed to float ) . \n there are natural peaks in the data , representative of a poisson distribution around each number of p.e . that a pulse can have . \n both of these methods yield the same answer . for our new studies \n , we are using the integrated pulse charge and calibrate using the late light only for simplicity . \n the resulting fits @xcite yield an average of  8 p.e . and \n an attenuation of  75 cm . using 1 m paddles ( 8 lightguides curving into a 2 in pmt ) , we would need 27 paddles to detect a 40 mev proton ( defined as observing 5 p.e . ) in microboone . \n this is practical , though not nearly as good as the current microboone system . \n since this paper , we have switched to using uv transmitting acrylic for our coating in which to embed the tpb , and switched to using cast acrylic instead of extruded acrylic for our lightguides , as the cast acrylic should have a higher attenuation length . with these new lightguides \n , we are seeing an average of 35 p.e . \n per @xmath15 , which is a factor of 4 more light . \n this makes this r&d even more promising . \n we plan to set up a demonstration detector ( fig [ fig : demodetector ] . with six 20 cm wide by 40 cm long paddles of eight lightguides each in order to demonstrate this technology as well as measure the muon lifetime in argon . \n microboone is an important state in the development of future lar tpcs . \n it will also help our understanding of the miniboone experiment as well as making other important physics contributions . \n the new developments in lightguide r&d for general purpose light collection in lar look promising , and may be a solution to the problems that will be faced when scaling up systems which are currently in use to the kiloton scale .", "StartTimeOffset": 180591009396, "RequestID": "ae990c9d10bfe30002308878bd54ca809c8b14cd", "TotalTokens": 3243}
{"ContextTokens": 4048, "GeneratedTokens": 212, "SynthesizedBody": "recently , device - to - device ( d2d ) communication as a promising technology of 5 g cellular networks , has been emerged to increase the spectral efficiency by reusing the same radio resources among multiple links @xcite . \n it is considered as a solution to implement proximity services among multiple devices , such as mobile social networks , public safety and location - based advertisement @xcite , or for video content delivery @xcite . \n d2d peer discovery is an important procedure to find potential d2d candidates to communicate with each other . \n several studies have focussed on different aspects of d2d discovery in recent years . \n particularly , long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) infrastructure is widely used in which , there is no need for extra designs and modifications in current cellular networks . in such systems , \n peer discovery procedure is under fully control of a central base - station ( enodeb ) and is called centralized network - assisted d2d peer discovery . interference and power control schemes for d2d discovery in inband cellular by considering user densities , addressed in lte - a enhancements \n @xcite .    in current lte - a networks , \n energy consumption aspects of d2d discovery mechanisms which are discussed in the third generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) are studied in @xcite . \n a probabilistic model and random access procedure in the lte - a system that discovers pairs of user equipments ( ues ) in a centralized manner have been also proposed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . \n furthermore , a centrally controlled device discovery scheme tailored to the lte system is proposed in @xcite . \n this scheme @xcite consists of a comprehensive application layer procedure that enables the device discovery services , and a set of media access control ( mac ) layer enhancements that provides a resource request / allocation procedure for discovery transmissions . by utilizing sounding reference signal ( srs ) channel , which can be accessed by ues that are lte - compliant \n , a neighbor discovery with d2d channel estimation is proposed in @xcite . \n one approach to allocate radio resources to d2d peer discovery procedures is using lte - a uplink radio resources . in this \n regard , physical uplink control channel ( pucch ) of cellular network is used to establish peer discovery signaling messages between bs and potentially d2d pairs . \n however it can cause inter carrier interference ( ici ) and also transmitted signaling messages need to be strong enough to make sure that the bs and d2d candidates can receive the messages , correctly . \n boosting transmit power of signaling messages symbols can increase the average transmit power of discovery signal , while maintaining low ici and cellular pucch reception performance @xcite . \n users also may use broadcasting to advertise their presence and service , to discover other devices , autonomously and continuously[11 , 12 ]    in this paper , we propose an uplink underlay network - assisted novel scheme for d2d discovery . a network - controlled signaling algorithm is proposed to exchange discovery messages a ) between user devices in potential d2d pairs , and b ) between d2d pairs and bs . in this scheme , \n proximity users feedback their identity and channel information to bs in order to provide accurate estimation of the link quality between d2d pairs candidates . \n in contrast with the existing works in the literature @xcite in which the transmitted discovery messages assumed to be always successful in delivering to the respective receivers without considering cellular users influence , we propose a realistic network model based on the poisson point process ( ppp ) to include channel state information ( csi ) in d2d discovery process by considering imposed interference from cellular users on d2d pairs . \n we employ stochastic geometry to analyze the system performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the experienced signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) at d2d receivers and the expected number of needed time slots for d2d discovery processes in a multi - node scenario . \n the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section \n ii , we first delineate our system model and discovery mechanism . then \n , we present ppp analysis in section iii . \n the analytic and simulation results are presented in section iv and section v concludes this paper . \n we consider an infinite cellular network as shown in fig . \n 1 with randomly distributed user devices and bss within the network area . \n we define @xmath0 as a poisson point process ( ppp ) with density of @xmath1 , which determines the locations of the bss within the network area . \n we also define @xmath2 as another ppp with density of @xmath3 , which determines the locations of the ues . \n potential d2d pairs are sharing cellular users resources underlay uplink cellular infrastructure , hence , the mutual interference at d2d receivers is taken into account . the broadband connection is provided for the bss by central scheduler via wired links . for the notational simplicity and mathematical derivations , we focus on a typical random cell , termed representative cell , and analyze the performance of the proposed d2d discovery algorithm in terms of the transmitted signal s success probability and the expected number of required time slots , to satisfy the system minimum constraints \n . we neglect co - channel interference and neighboring cell users influence , for the sake of simplicity , however , the analysis can be applied for multi - cell scenarios , as well . \n all d2d communications are under fully control of the bs and they transmit signaling messages at the beginning of each time slot . \n the transmission scheme is time division multiple access ( tdma ) which implies , given a time for d2d discovery mechanisms , the whole time is divided into small portions called `` time slots '' and each user transmits its message at the beginning of each time slot , according to a transmission probability . for a given time slot \n , one d2d discovery message is allowed to pass at the beginning of this time slot , hence , if two users send their discovery message at the same time , collision occurs and therefore failed messages need to be retransmitted in the next time slots . \n we further assume that the system operates under interference - limited regime , therefore , the background noise is negligible in comparison with the experienced interference at the receivers .      in this subsection , \n we propose new d2d discovery algorithm by considering the bs as the central management system . technically , to initiate a d2d link between two users , \n some signaling messages need to be exchanged , through the network entities . in our proposed scheme , \n since the bs is the central management system to exchange required signaling messages for d2d discovery scheme , the proposed scheme is centralized . \n we focus on a potential d2d pair ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) as a representative for all potential d2d pairs and describe the proposed d2d discovery mechanism by considering @xmath4 as transmitter and @xmath5 as its receiver . assuming that the users can detect other users in their proximity ( such a detection can be done by flashlinq mechanism proposed by lte - a for proximity services @xcite ) \n , the proposed algorithm can be defined in five signaling steps as follows .    1 \n .   user @xmath4 sends a request message to the bs to initiate a d2d link with user @xmath5 . \n 2 .   after receiving \n @xmath4 s transmitted signal at bs , the bs forwards discovery message to the user @xmath5 and schedules the user @xmath5 to listen discovery messages transmitted by the user @xmath4 in its vicinity , and sends acknowledgment signal to user @xmath4 . \n user @xmath4 sends discovery message to user @xmath5 . \n 4 .   after receiving discovery message at user @xmath5 \n , it measures the experienced signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) and sends it back to the bs . \n bs receives measured sir and queues the d2d pair to initiate d2d communication ; if the received sir satisfy the system threshold , bs initiate users @xmath4 and @xmath5 to initiate d2d communication ; otherwise discovery process will fail and the d2d pair need to retransmit their discovery message in the next time slots .    in all the aforementioned steps , \n when users send the signaling messages to the bs , the received signal at bs should satisfy the system sir threshold , likewise . \n in this section we provide the analysis for the proposed scheme by employing stochastic geometry to analyze the transmitted signals success probability . for the proposed system in section \n ii , there are two key conditions to successfully deliver a discovery message from the transmitter to receiver . \n \\a ) collision : when two users transmit their discovery message at the beginning of a given time slot at the same time , collision occurs and both users have to retransmit their discovery messages . denoting @xmath6 as the number of potential d2d pairs , the signal from user @xmath4 will successfully be delivered to its respective receiver , if all other pairs are in idle mode . \n each user transmit its discovery signal with a specific transmission probability . \n hence we define @xmath7 as the probability of successful signal transmit in a given time slot as @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the transmission probability . \n now , we aim to maximize @xmath7 by seeking optimal transmission probability : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the optimal transmission probability . hence , denoting @xmath12 as the optimal probability of transmitting a signal without collision , we have : @xmath13    \\b ) sir : for a given transmitter and its respective receiver , the received signal strength and consequently the sir level should meet the system design thresholds . \n this means that a transmitted signal from user @xmath4 can be successfully delivered to receiver @xmath5 , if the experienced sir at receiver @xmath5 is equal or greater than a threshold @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 eq . \n ( 4 ) also delineates the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of experienced sir at receiver @xmath5 . \n since all potential d2d pairs transmit their discovery message at the beginning of a given time slot , the parameter @xmath6 can be considered as the number of messages which are simultaneously transmitted by potential d2d users . \n now , we define success probability for a transmitted signal from transmitter @xmath4 to its respective receiver @xmath5 , by considering joint collision and sir satisfaction . \n this means that a transmitted signal from user @xmath4 will successfully be delivered to its respective receiver if a ) there is no collision in transmitting the signal and b ) the received signal at receiver @xmath5 satisfies the system sir threshold @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath16 since the collision process and sir satisfaction are independent at each d2d pair , we can rewrite the eq . \n ( 5 ) as @xmath17 now we aim to derive the closed form of the cdf for the experienced sir at the receiver of interest , @xmath5 , by employing stochastic geometry approach . \n the experienced sir at the receiver @xmath5 due to transmitted signal from user @xmath4 is @xmath18 where , @xmath19 is the standard path loss with exponent of @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the euclidean distance between transmitter @xmath4 and its respective receiver , @xmath5 . \n @xmath22 is total interference due to the transmitting nodes in set @xmath23 , which is the set of concurrent transmitting nodes . \n backslash in eq . \n ( 7 ) implies that the node @xmath4 is excluded from transmitters set . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fading power coefficients with exponential distribution of mean one , corresponding to the channel gain between transmitter @xmath4 and its respective receiver @xmath5 , and the interferer @xmath26 , respectively . \n we consider receiver @xmath5 at origin and transmitting node @xmath4 with a fixed distance of @xmath27 from @xmath5 , which is the nearest user to @xmath5 . \n hence , all the interferer are in the outside of the circle of radius @xmath27 . \n now , by denoting @xmath28 as the total interference , i.e. , @xmath29 , and using campbell s theorem @xcite , the laplace transform of the interference @xcite can be defined as : @xmath30 where , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the gamma function . \n now , the final expression for the cdf of sir at receiver @xmath5 can be defined as @xmath34 by substituting equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) in eq . \n ( 6 ) , the final expression for success probability can be derived . \n now , we define random variable @xmath35 denoting the number of successful transmissions in given @xmath36 time slots . \n the probability that there is at least one successful discovery signal is @xmath37 now , we define another system design parameter @xmath38 , as the minimum required success probability for requiring at least one time slot for a successful discovery message . \n we have : @xmath39 by substituting equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) in ( 6 ) and then eq . ( 6 ) in ( 10 ) and then ( 10 ) in ( 11 ) , \n respectively , and some simple manipulations , the maximum number of required time slots for the proposed d2d discovery mechanism can be defined as @xmath40 where , @xmath41 @xmath42 is the requirement of the stochastic geometry approach addressed in @xcite . \n in this section , we provide monte - carlo simulations to evaluate system performance . \n we focus on an isolated single cell of the voronoi tessellation network ( fig . 1 ) and neglect inter - cell interference . \n we assume standard microcell channel model by considering log - normal shadow fading effect . \n the rest of simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 . in the wireless d2d network , \n described in section ii , users initiate for d2d communication with the nearest neighbor in the vicinity . \n we choose potential d2d pairs , according to given distance threshold and label them by ids as @xmath43 . \n the key parameter in this system is collision detection in simultaneous transmissions by d2d pairs in the beginning of each time slot . as we analyzed in section iii , the optimal transmission probability in the beginning of each time slot \n is given by @xmath44 ( eq . \n since the channel access model is tdma , to simulate collision detection , at the beginning of each time slot , each user throws its dice to pick up a number between [ 1 @xmath6 ] , if the chosen number is equal to the respective d2d pair s i d , then , the d2d transmitter will be authorized to transmit its discovery signal to its respective receiver . and \n if the received signal in the receiver can satisfies system thresholds ( @xmath14 ) , d2d pair succeed in the collision process and will proceed to the next step of the discovery algorithm .    in what follows , \n we first describe the analytic results and possible tradeoffs in fig . 1 , 2 , and 3 and then describe the simulation results for delineated system model in section ii . \n 2 demonstrates the impact of @xmath46 on the cdf of sir for different system sir thresholds ( @xmath14 ) . as can be seen in this figure , by increasing the density of users ( @xmath46 ) within the cell area , which corresponds to more potential d2d pairs within the cell area , the probability of successful discovery messages transmissions with respect to system sir threshold , decreases , because , the experienced interference at d2d receivers increases . in other hand \n , increasing system sir thresholds which corresponds to guaranteeing higher d2d link quality , leads to decreasing the probability of successful discovery messages deliveries . \n therefore , there is a trade off between d2d link quality and successful discovery messages deliveries . \n i.e. , guaranteeing higher d2d link quality , the lower is the probability of successful delivery of discovery messages and guaranteeing the lower d2d link quality , the higher is the successful delivery of discovery message . \n 3 shows the impact of system sir threshold on the cdf of sir . \n similar explanations for fig . \n 2 are valid for fig . \n 3 .    fig . \n 4 demonstrates the main success probability defined in eq . \n ( 6 ) . in this figure \n , we consider limited number of d2d pairs ( @xmath6 ) with the impact of joint collision detection and sir satisfaction . \n as can be seen from this figure , collision detection has a major impact on the success probability , due to simultaneous transmission at the beginning of time slots . by increasing the number of d2d pairs in a given time slot , to transmit their desired discovery message , \n the impact of collision detection is more accented . \n 5 shows the cdf of the minimum required number of time slots for successful d2d discovery process . as expected , by increasing the number of potential d2d pairs in a specific @xmath47 and @xmath14 , the required time slots increases due to more collisions in channel access . in other hand , by increasing the density of the network , since d2d pairs are sharing uplink resources of the cellular users , there is high interference on d2d receivers , which leads to more fails in d2d discovery messages deliveries . \n 6 demonstrates the number of required time slots for different number of d2d pairs as derived in eq . \n similar explanations for fig . \n 5 are also valid for fig . \n in this paper , we proposed a novel scheme for d2d discovery by employing a centralized signaling algorithm for exchanging discovery messages between network entities . \n we used stochastic geometry to analyze and evaluate the realistic performance of the proposed scheme . for this system , proposing new efficient collision avoidance algorithms in tdma channel access can promises even high reliability to deliver d2d discovery messages . \n a. prasad , a. kunz , g. velev , k. samdanis , and j. song , `` energy -

 1500  v and the sc-01 has been operated at -  1500  v during the cosmic ray study it is seen from figure  [ mip1 ] that the most probable energy deposition in 1  cm thick plastic scintillator is @xmath10  1.4  mev . \n the cosmic ray spectra for these two scintillators have also been obtained varying the applied voltage and the mpvs are plotted as a function of the applied voltage in figure  [ mpv1 ] for sc-01 . \n similar plot has also been obtained for sc-02 . \n both the plots are fitted with the exponential function mpv = @xmath12 , where the parameters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 . \n @xmath14 for both the scintillators have been found to be @xmath10  0.004@xmath150.0008 . \n a simple and new technique has been developed for gamma ray and cosmic ray muon pulse height spectroscopy without using sca or mca . only scintillator detector , a leading edge discriminator and a nim scaler have been used in this technique . \n gamma ray spectrum has been obtained for co@xmath0 and cs@xmath1 sources . \n proportionality in energy and pulse height has been observed . \n the energy resolution for the detector has been found to be 9.3% and 7.6% for the co@xmath0 1.17  mev and 1.33  mev peak respectively and 10.2% for 662  kev peak of cs@xmath1 . \n cosmic ray muon pulse height spectrum has been obtained for two scintillators and fitted with landau distribution . \n the most probable energy deposition in 1  cm thick plastic material has been found to be @xmath10 1.4  mev . \n although the energy resolution is not so good but still using plastic scintillator detector gamma spectroscopy and cosmic ray muon pulse height spectroscopy can be done . \n main drawback of this technique is that this process is time consumable and may not be useful for real experiment ; however , this process is very useful and can be applied for laboratory measurement where mca or sca are not available . \n we acknowledge mr . subasha rout of utkal university , dr . \n sudakshina prusty , dr . gunda santosh babu , dr . lokesh kumar and mr . \n rudranarayan mohanty of niser for helping during this study . \n s. biswas acknowledges the support of dst -

{"ContextTokens": 2102, "GeneratedTokens": 71, "SynthesizedBody": "charged particle multiplicity densities near mid rapidity in high energy nuclear collisions depend strongly on collision centrality . in order to better understand this dependence and to disentangle pure nuclear effects , \n this density is often plotted as per nucleon participant pair  @xcite . \n participants are the nucleons that have encountered at least one inelastic collision . \n the number of participants at a given centrality is usually calculated in the glauber model either analytically or with the help of a monte - carlo algorithm . the charged particle density per participant increases with centrality . in the 5% most central au+au collisions it is about 20% larger than that in semi - peripheral collisions ( 5070% centrality region ) , and it is about 50% larger compared to @xmath0 collisions at the same energy . \n the reason for this increase in number of produced particles per participant at midrapidity is still not well understood . \n the most common explanation of the phenomena involves particle production in hard processes . \n hard processes have much smaller cross - sections than soft collisions and depend differently on collision centrality . \n they scale with the number of binary collisions ( the number of collisions the incident nucleon would experience if it were not altered at all while passing through the nucleus ) . \n the number of binary collisions increases with centrality faster than the number of participants ; this results in an increase of particle production per participant nucleon as centrality increases . in \n such approaches the particle density is often presented simply as  @xcite : + ( 1- ) , where the parameter @xmath1 is the relative fraction of particles produced in the soft collisions , and @xmath2 is the relative fraction produced in hard collisions . with proper parameters , \n this fits the data fairly well ; see ref . \n note , however , that in such models , the relative contribution of hard processes is expected to increase with the collision energy . \n the data seem inconsistent with such an energy dependence .    in the approach proposed in this paper , \n both nuclei and single nucleons are considered as a superposition of constituent quarks ( also often called as `` dressed '' quarks or valons ) ; there are three such dressed quarks per nucleon . \n the concept of the constituent quarks has been known for many years ( see refs . \n @xcite and references therein ) . \n the constituent quark approach is able to explain many features of hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions  @xcite . \n qcd calculations support the statement that inside a nucleon there are three objects of the size of 0.1  0.3  fm ( see ref . \n @xcite and references therein ) ; for some recent works using or discussing constituent quarks , see also refs . \n @xcite .    in the constituent quark picture , a @xmath3 collision looks like a collision of two light nuclei . \n most often only one @xmath4 pair interacts , with other quarks being _ \n spectators_. only part of the entire nucleon energy is spent for particle production at midrapidity ( as @xmath5 ) . \n the quark spectators form hadrons in the nucleon fragmentation region . in the case of @xmath6 collisions , more than one quark per nucleon interacts due to the large nucleus size and the possibility for quarks from the same projectile nucleon to interact with different target nucleons . \n the goal of this study is to find the number of produced particles per participant quark ( pair ) and to check for its centrality dependence . \n we calculate mean number of nucleon / quark participants using a monte - carlo based implementation  @xcite of the nuclear overlap model @xcite . \n we use woods - saxon nuclear density profile n_a(r)= , with parameters : @xmath7    in the nuclear overlap model , the mean number of participants in @xmath8 collision at impact parameter @xmath9 is given by & & n_part , ab= d^2s t_a()\\{1- [ 1-]^b } + & & + d^2s t_b()\\{1- [ 1-]^a } , where @xmath10 is the thickness function ; then @xmath11 is the probability for a nucleon to pass through the nucleus without any collision . \n we use the inelastic @xmath3 cross section @xmath12  mb at @xmath13  gev . \n the number of participating nucleons for a given centrality can be determined directly using the web interface  @xcite . in order to calculate the number of participating quarks we downloaded fortran code and modified it by increasing the density three times ( @xmath14 ) and changing @xmath15 to @xmath16 . for the quark - quark cross - section in our calculation , \n we use two values @xmath17  mb and a somewhat arbitrary value of @xmath18  mb ; the latter was used mostly to illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath16 . \n the choice of @xmath18  mb is not unreasonable since at rhic energies , approximately 1.2  1.3 quarks per nucleon can participate in a single @xmath3-collision  @xcite . in principle , @xmath16 could be probably as high as 8  mb based on the early estimates of @xmath19  @xcite .    fig .

[ \n fig : multpernpart ] . \n the results per nucleon participant pair are in the upper part of the figure and the results per quark participant pair are shown in the lower part . \n the original phobos results  @xcite on @xmath23 per nucleon participant pair ( calculated using hijing ) for @xmath13  gev and 200  gev are shown in solid symbols . in open symbols \n we also show the same results renormalized for the number of the nucleon participant pairs from our calculations using the nuclear overlap model . our main result  the centrality dependence of the charged particle pseudorapidity density per quark participant pair  is presented in the same plot . \n we observe no , or even slightly decreasing , dependence of @xmath24 on centrality , with the ratio being dependent only on the energy of the collision . the slight decrease in particle production at midrapidity with increasing centrality could be due either to low values of the constituent quark inelastic cross section used in our calculations or to parton saturation effects .     per nucleon and quark participant pair _ \n vs _ centrality . \n the results for quark participant pair are shown for @xmath21  mb ( solid symbols ) and @xmath18  mb ( open symbols ) . \n , height=283 ]    note that in the constituent quark picture , @xmath24 as a function of centrality depends very weakly on the collision energy , as the change in the inelastic cross section is probably less than 5% between @xmath13  gev and 200  gev . \n mb and lower to @xmath21  mb ) participants . , \n height=264 ]    hard processes scale with the number of binary collisions . \n although it was not necessary to include the contribution of hard processes into our calculation in order to describe the centrality dependence of the charged particle density at midrapidity , we have calculated the number of binary collisions as well : see fig . \n [ fig : nbin ] . \n note that the number of binary collisions per participant has a much weaker centrality dependence in the constituent quark approach than it has in the the nucleon participant model . \n we have shown that the particle multiplicity density near mid rapidity scales linearly with the number of constituent quark participant pairs . \n the experimentally observed increase of @xmath23 per nucleon participant pair with centrality in this picture is explained by the relative increase in the number of interacting constituent quarks in more central collisions . \n we thank d.  miskowiec for making his code available to us . \n this work was supported in part by u.s . \n doe grant no . \n de - fg02 - 92er40713 and wayne state university office of the provost , global education grant .", "StartTimeOffset": 197745933480, "RequestID": "5188b419674f8ab2aefa6901d1eec005ced52622", "TotalTokens": 2173}
{"ContextTokens": 3628, "GeneratedTokens": 85, "SynthesizedBody": "over the years experiments confirm that strong interaction is successfully described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . \n for very high energies one can calculate physical amplitudes analytically using the qcd lagrangian due to asymptotic freedom . on the other hand we have a lack of analytical tools to analyze the low energy sector . \n important properties of the infrared physics of the strong interaction such as confinement , mass gap and linear regge trajectories remains unexplained by qcd .    in @xmath0 t hooft \n proposed a duality between the large n ( number of colors ) limit of qcd and string theory @xcite . \n this represented the first dual representation of a gauge theory by a string model . in @xmath1 maldacena@xcite proposed a mapping between operators in conformal field theory ( cft ) and fields of a @xmath2 type iib string field theory in a ten - dimensional space - time @xmath3 . \n the most interesting fact of this duality is that the strong - coupling regime of large-@xmath4 gauge theories can be approximated ( in low - curvature regions ) by weakly coupled and hence analytically treatable classical gravities . \n the drawback is that cft is not qcd . \n consequently , the @xmath2 type iib string field in @xmath3 does not have many important properties of strong interactions as confinement and a mass gap .    a direct way for searching for a qcd dual is introducing d - branes in the theory . \n they are responsible for breaking in part supersymmetry and for the introduction of flavor . \n for example , the addition of @xmath5 d7 probe branes ( @xmath6 model@xcite ) can be interpreted as the introduction of flavor in the ads / cft . in the supergravity side \n it is a four - dimensional @xmath7 supersymmetric large - n gauge theory . \n although a type ii b @xmath7 has a running coupling constant , it does not has confinement . \n there is a vast literature addressing these topics and for a review see @xcite . in all those models \n ( top - down ) we obtain a one - dimensional differential equation in holographic coordinate to calculate the mass spectra and they do not lead to a regge spectrum for meson excitations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n this fact suggested an other way of searching for the corresponding qcd dual . \n we propose an effective 5d action that can reproduce basic properties of strong interaction and we explore the phenomenological aspects of this model in a bottom - up approach .    the first model with this idea \n was proposed by polchinski and strassler@xcite . \n this model ( hard - wall ) is a slice of ads with an ir boundary condition that introduces the qcd scale . \n it implements the counting rules which govern the scaling behavior of hard qcd scattering amplitudes by the conformal invariance of ads@xmath8 in the uv limit . in spite of reproducing a large amount of hadron phenomenology@xcite it does not have linear regge trajectories \n a soft - wall model@xcite was created to correct this problem , where the ads@xmath8 geometry is kept intact while an additional dilaton background field is introduced . \n this dilaton soft - wall model indeed generates linear regge trajectories @xmath9 for light - flavor mesons of spin @xmath10 and radial excitation level @xmath11 . \n ( regge behavior can alternatively be encoded via ir deformations of the ads@xmath8 metric @xcite . ) \n however , the resulting vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson loop in the dilaton soft wall model does not exhibit the area - law behavior in contrast to a linearly confining static quark - antiquark potential . \n it happens because the model uses an ads metric which is not of a confining type by the wilson loop analysis @xcite . \n in addition the soft - wall model background is not a solution of a dual gravity . \n csaki and reece @xcite analyzed the solutions of a 5d dilaton - gravity einstein equations ( see also@xcite ) using the superpotential formalism . \n they concluded that it would not be possible to solve those equations and obtain a linear confining background without introducing new ingredients . \n they suggested to analyze a tachyon - dilaton - graviton model , and this idea was successfully implemented in @xcite . \n we took an alternative route and we show@xcite that we can obtain a linear confining background as solution of the dilaton - gravity coupled equations . within our proposal of a self - consistent dilaton - gravity model , the mass spectrum of the high spin mesons stays close to a linear regge trajectory for the lower excitations , where experimental data exists , while an exact linear behavior is approached for high spin and mass excitations.(using similar approach in @xcite is proposed a different ads deformation in order to reproduce the qcd running coupling . ) \n the action for five - dimensional gravity coupled to a dilaton field is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the newton constant in @xmath14 dimensions and @xmath15 is the scalar field potential . \n we will be restricted to the metric family : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the minkowski one . minimizing the action , we obtain a coupled set of einstein equations for which the solutions satisfy the following relations : @xmath18 the @xmath14d action for a gauge field @xmath19 of spin @xmath10 in the background is given by@xcite @xmath20 as in @xcite and @xcite \n , we utilize the axial gauge . to this end \n , we introduce new spin fields @xmath21 . \n we also make the substitution @xmath22 and obtain a sturm - liouville equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n hence , for each metric @xmath26 and dilaton field @xmath27 consistent with the solutions of the einstein equations , we obtain a mass spectrum @xmath28 . due to the gauge / gravity duality this mass spectrum corresponds to the mesonic resonances in the @xmath29d space - time . \n now we will focus on scalar mesons ( also analyzed in @xcite ) . \n the action@xcite @xmath30 describes a scalar mode propagating in the dilaton - gravity background . factorizing the holographic \n coordinate dependence as @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and redefining the string amplitude as @xmath33 , we have a sturm - liouville equation @xmath34 \\psi _ { n}=m_{n}^{2}\\psi _ { n } ,   \\label{sleq}\\]]where the string - mode potential is @xmath35 with @xmath36 . \n ( note that @xmath37 for the spin nonzero states @xcite . ) \n the ads / cft correspondence states that the wave function should behave as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( conformal dimension minus spin ) is the twist dimension for the corresponding interpolating operator that creates a given quark - gluon configuration @xcite . \n the five - dimensional mass chosen as @xcite @xmath40 fixes the uv limit of the dual string amplitude with the twist dimension . \n our aim was to construct a metric ansatz that is ads in the uv and allows for confinement , mass gap and regge trajectories by tailoring its ir behavior . with these constraints we found the metric : @xmath41 for scalars @xmath42 . \n to distinguish the pion states in our model , the fifth dimensional mass was rescaled according to @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) . \n the model is constrained by the pion mass , the slope of the regge trajectory and the twist 2 from the operator @xmath44 . \n the results for the regge trajectories for @xmath45 and pion are shown in figure 1 . \n the pion modes are calculated with @xmath460.88 and @xmath47gev@xmath48 . for high spin mesons , \n see figure 2 , we have an equation to obtain the scale factor @xmath49 in order to keep the slope of the regge trajectories fixed . \n ( note that in our previous work@xcite we adopted a slightly different ansatz . ) \n the @xmath45 s partial decay width into @xmath50 are calculated from the overlap integral ( @xmath51 ) of the normalized string amplitudes ( sturm - liouville form ) in the holographic coordinate dual to the scalars @xmath52 and pion @xmath53 states , @xmath54 the constant @xmath13 has dimension @xmath55 fitted to the experimental value of the @xmath56 partial decay width . \n the sturm - liouville amplitudes of the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) modes are normalized just as a bound state wave function in quantum mechanics @xcite , which also corresponds to a normalization of the string amplitude . \n the overlap integral for the decay amplitude , @xmath51 , is the dual representation of the transition amplitude @xmath57 and therefore the decay width is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pion momentum in the meson rest frame . \n the known two - pion partial decay width for the @xmath45 s given in the particle listing of pdg@xcite , are calculated with eq . \n ( [ dwover ] ) and shown in table i. the width of @xmath60 is used as normalization . in particular for @xmath61 the model gives a width of about 500 mev , while its mass is 860 mev . \n the range of experimental values quoted in pdg for the sigma mass and width are quite large as depicted in table i. the analysis of the e791 experiment gives @xmath62 478@xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev @xcite . \n the width seems consistent with our model while the experimental mass appears somewhat smaller . \n the cleo collaboration @xcite quotes @xmath62 513@xmath65 mev and @xmath66 mev , and a recent analysis of the sigma pole in the @xmath50 scattering amplitude from ref.@xcite gives @xmath62 441@xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev . \n other analysis of the @xmath69-pole in the @xmath70 scattering amplitude present in the decay of heavy mesons indicates a mass around 500 mev @xcite . \n in this work we obtain a spectrum of high spin mesons , scalar and pseudoscalars in the light - flavor sector , in agreement to experimental data available using a dynamical ads / qcd model . \n in addition we calculate the decay amplitude of scalar mesons into two pions . \n we introduce a mixing angle for @xmath71 of @xmath72 , that corresponds to a composite nature by mixing , e.g. , @xmath73 with light non - strange quarks@xcite . \n an absolute value of the mixing angle between @xmath74 to @xmath75 fits @xmath76 within the experimental range . \n currently we are including the strange meson sector@xcite in the dynamical model . as a future challenge \n we also want to introduce finite temperature and calculate the meson spectrum , as done for glueballs within the soft- and hard - wall models @xcite . \n finally it could be compared to a large n analysis at finite temperature using lattice simulations recently delivered by panero@xcite . \n we acknowledge partial support from capes , fapesp and cnpq .    0 g. t hooft , nuclear physics * b 72 * ( 1974 ) 461 . \n j. maldacena , adv . \n * 2 * ( 1998 ) 231 . \n a. karch , e. katz , jhep 06 ( 2002 ) 043 . \n j. erdmenger , n. evans , i. kirsch and e. threlfall , eur . \n j. a * 35 * ( 2008 ) 81 . \n m. bianchi and w. de paula , arxiv:1003.2536 ( 2010 ) j. polchinsky and m. j. strassler , _ phys . \n * 88 * ( 2002 ) 031601 . \n h. boschi , n. braga and h. carrion , eur . \n j. * c 32 * ( 2004 ) 529 ; phys . rev . * \n d 73 * ( 2006 ) 047901 ; g. f. de tramond and s. j. brodsky , phys . \n . lett . * 94 * ( 2005 ) 0201601 . \n a. karch , e. katz , d.t . son and m.a . \n stephanov , _ phys . rev . _ * d 74 * ( 2006 ) 015005 . \n s. kuperstein and j. sonnenschein , jhep * 11 * ( 2004 ) 026 . \n h. forkel , m. beyer and t. frederico , jhep * 0707 * ( 2007 ) 077 . \n j. maldacena , phys . \n * 80 * ( 1998 ) 4859 . \n s.j.rey and j.t.yee , eur . \n j. c * 22 * ( 2001 ) 379 . \n c. csaki and m. reece , jhep * 05 * ( 2007 ) 062 . \n u. grsoy , e. kiritsis and f. nitti , jhep * 0802 * ( 2008 ) 019 . \n b. batell and t. gherghetta , phys . rev . \n * d 78 * ( 2008 ) 026002 . \n w. de paula , t. frederico , h. forkel and m. beyer , phys . \n d * * 79**v(2009 ) 075019 ; pos lc2008:046 ( 2008 ) . \n pirner and b. galow , phys.lett.b * 679 * ( 2009 ) 51 . \n e. katz , a. lewandowski and m.d . \n schwartz , phys . rev . * \n d 74 * ( 2006 ) 086004 . \n a. vega and i. schmidt , phys . \n d * 78 * ( 2008 ) 017703 . \n p. colangelo , f. de fazio , f. giannuzzi , f. jugeau , and s. nicotri , phys . \n d * 78 * ( 2008 ) 055009 . \n w. de paula and t. frederico , arxiv:0908.4282v1 ( 2009 ) . \n e. witten , adv . \n theor . math . \n * 2 * ( 1998 ) 253 . \n h. grigoryan and a. radyushkin , phys . \n d * 76 * ( 2007 ) 095007 . \n s. j. brodsky and g. f. de tramond , phys . \n d * 78 * ( 2008 ) 025032 . \n c. amsler et al . \n ( particle data group ) , phys . \n b * 667 * ( 2008 ) 1 . \n e. m. aitala et al . \n ( fermilab e791 ) , phys . \n * 86 * ( 2001 ) 770 \n . h. muramatsu et al . \n ( cleo ) , phys . \n * 89 * ( 2002 ) 251802 . \n i. caprini , g. colangelo and h. leutwyler , phys . \n * 96 * ( 2006 ) 132001 . \n d. v. bugg , eur . \n c * 47 * ( 2006 ) 57 . \n i. bediaga , f. navarra and m. nielsen , phys . \n b * 579 * ( 2004 ) 59 . \n guimares , w. de paula , i. bediaga , a.delfino , t. frederico , a.c.dos reis and l. tomio , in progress . \n miranda , c.a . \n ballon bayona , h. boschi -

7219 ( see plucinsky   2001 ) . \n fortunately , the spectrum of the bullet d is quite similar to that of 1e0102.2 - 7219 in that both have strong lines of o , ne , and mg with little or no fe . \n we focus on the spectrum of the brightest part of the bullet d feature described by the ellipse in figure  1 . \n the acis spectrum of this feature is shown in figure  2 . \n the dominant features are the oviii  @xmath3 line at 654  ev , the neix triplet at @xmath4  ev , and the mgxi triplet at @xmath5  kev . \n we fit these data with a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) model and derived a best - fit temperature of @xmath6  kev after fixing the to be @xmath7 ( see dubner   1998 ) . at this temperature \n , the cie model indicates that the o and ne abundances must be enhanced by several times over solar values . \n next we fit the data with a model of a simple continuum plus gaussians to represent the line emission . \n we used the ratios of ovii  triplet / oviii  @xmath3 and neix  triplet / nex  @xmath8 as non - equilibrium diagnostics . \n both diagnostics indicated that temperatures below log(t)=6.4 are not consistent with the data . \n both the o and ne line ratios are consistent with ionization timescales in the range @xmath9 . \n we can impose an upper limit on the ionization timescale of @xmath10 by assuming an age of 12,000  yr and a maximum ambient density of @xmath11 . \n we can then compare the emissivities of the oviii  @xmath3 , oviii  @xmath12 , neix  triplet , and nex  @xmath3 lines to the expected values . \n the measured emissivities are plotted against the expected emissivities as a function of temperature and ionization timescale in figures  3 and  4 . \n the measured ne emissivity is higher than the predicted emissivity for all values of the ionization timescale regardless of temperature , indicating that the abundance of ne must be higher than solar . in the preferred range of ionization timescales from @xmath13 , \n the ne abundance required to be consistent with the model predictions varies from 1.6 to @xmath14 solar . \n the situation with o is significantly different . in the range of preferred ionization timescales from @xmath15 , \n the measured emissivity is lower than the expected emissivity for a large range of ionization timescales . over this range , \n the o abundance required to be consistent with the model predictions varies from 0.5 to @xmath16 solar . \n the o and ne data are most consistent with each other for a temperature of log(t ) = 6.6 and an ionization timescale of @xmath17 . at these values \n the ne abundance is @xmath18 twice solar and the o abundance is @xmath18 solar . \n the morphology of the x - ray emission revealed by _ chandra _ is more consistent with a snr shock interacting with an inhomogeneous medium than with a discrete fragment of ejecta . \n spectra indicate that ne is enhanced above solar values , but at a rather modest level , and o is consistent with the solar value . \n we therefore conclude the _ chandra _ observations of the vela bullet d region are more consistent with a shock breakout hypothesis than with a bullet of ejecta hypothesis , although the _ chandra _ data can not rule out the bullet idea . \n we thank all of the engineers , technicians , and scientists who have made the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ such a success . \n ppp , rks , rje , tjg , and pos acknowledge support for this work from nasa contracts nas8 - 39703 and go0 - 1127 . \n lkt and psb acknowledge support for this work from nasa contract nas8 -

i4 , new sensor developments , mechanical structures based on a new type of high thermal conductivity carbon foam , and electro - mechanical integrated structures . \n the technology developments follow a road - map inspired by the requirements of a future high luminosity lhc upgrade , but has the generic goals of reducing mass and cost while increasing rate capacity and radiation tolerance . as individual technologies mature , they can be deploy as soon as the need or opportunity arises . the `` insertable b - layer '' ( ibl ) upgrade  @xcite will deploy in 2013 the fe - i4 integrated circuit , high thermal conductivity carbon foam , `` slim edge '' planar sensors , and 3d sensors . \n other near term upgrades are being considered that would also deploy the fe - i4 integrated circuit along with diamond sensors ( a beam luminosity monitor ) and 3d sensors ( a far forward pixel detector ) . together with further new technologies ( on - stave power conversion , high speed data transmission , etc . ) \n , all the technologies described in this paper would be available for deployment on a 2018 time scale and this possibility is under consideration . \n photograph of the fe - i4 readout chip ( left ) and fe - i3 ( right ) . \n the width and height as shown are 20.3 mm by 19.2 mm for fe - i4 and 7.4 mm by 11.0 mm for fe - i3,width=302 ]    the fe - i4 pixel readout integrated circuit has been developed with the generic goals of increasing rate capability and radiation tolerance and reducing system cost  @xcite . \n cost reduction is mainly achieved by making the integrated circuit area as large as possible , since flip chip bump bonding cost scales approximately with the number of chips processed rather than with area processed , and until now bump bonding has been the main cost driver . \n fe - i4 is therefore the largest pixel readout ic produced to date : fig  [ fig : chips ] shows a photograph of fe - i4 next to the present atlas pixel readout chip called fe - i3 . \n bump bonding cost reduction is not critical for the ibl project because the total active area is small ( 0.15m@xmath0 ) . \n however , the large format of fe - i4 is critical to fitting the tight radial envelope constraints of ibl . \n additionally , only 10% of the fe - i4 area is devoted to periphery ( compared to 30% for fe - i3 ) and this is again critical for the ibl geometry .    the small fe - i4 periphery is a secondary benefit of a new readout architecture  @xcite . \n the reduced periphery is achieved because all hit storage is within the pixel matrix itself . \n the primary purpose of this new architecture is to achieve much higher rate capability than previous chips . \n this is critical for ibl ( due to higher hit rate at smaller radius ) . \n the new readout stores hit charge and timing locally within a 4-pixel region until selected by an external trigger . \n this was possible by taking advantage of the high digital circuit density in the 130 nm feature size cmos process used . \n increased radiation tolerance is also achieved by the 130 nm process . \n each fe - i4 chip has 26,880 pixels 50@xmath1 m wide by 250@xmath1 m long . \n pixel sensor development has been ongoing in several large collaborations  @xcite . within atlas \n the ibl project provided a significant boost to pixel sensor prototyping and characterization . \n a planar n - in - n ibl sensor design is based on the sensors used in the present atlas pixel detector  @xcite , adapted to the ibl needs by reducing the pixel size to match fe - i4 granularity and the sensor wafer thickness to 200@xmath1 m . a new guard ring design maximizes the possible operation voltage and minimizes the inactive edge . \n the so - called``slim - edge '' design , uses 13 guard rings on the bias side of the sensor to manage the potential drop between bias contact and physical sensor edge . \n the distance from the last guard to the dicing edge is 100@xmath1 m . \n the edge pixels on the electrode side of the sensor overlap the guard ring area to collect charge from as close as possible to the physical edge . \n further details can be found in  @xcite . \n a `` double sided '' \n 3d sensor ibl design has the measuring and biasing electrodes etched into the p - type silicon bulk from opposite sides , penetrating most of the thickness , but not all the way through . \n this makes processing and bias connection simpler . \n the sensor bulk is laterally depleted between n@xmath2-type measuring electrodes and p@xmath2-type biasing electrodes . \n 3d sensors allow for high field strength and good charge collection after heavy irradiation with relatively low bias voltages . \n the ibl 3d design uses two n@xmath2 electrodes per pixel , surrounded by six p@xmath2 biasing electrodes , to provide good charge collection without excessive capacitance  @xcite . \n the sensors are 230@xmath1 m thick and have an inactive guard ring area 225@xmath1 m wide . \n two guard ring variants have been developed using combinations of n@xmath2 columns and p@xmath2 columns forming fences around the active area . \n thermal conductivity vs. density for new carbon foam . \n finite element calculates ( squares and triangles ) are compared with sample measurements ( circles).,width=302 ]    a new type of all - carbon thermally conductive foam has been developed for silicon pixel and strip mechanical supports  @xcite . \n the foam is readily machinable and has low radiation length , yet thermal conductivity two orders of magnitude higher than conventional foams of the same density . \n [ fig : foamk ] shows finite element analysis predicted foam conductivities compared to sample measurements . \n the foam is produced using a reticulated vitreous carbon ( rvc ) foam precursor and increasing the thermal conductivity through combination of chemical vapor deposition and heat treatment . \n a standard fabrication has been developed producing blocks 2.5 cm thick and @xmath3cm@xmath0 . \n a common basic concept uses a small coolant tube glued to foam , coupled with high stiffness carbon facings to form rigid , lightweight structures supporting modules and their electrical connections . due to the high foam conductivity , such structures efficiently couple heat for small tubes typical of co@xmath5 evaporative cooling \n this is the atlas baseline for all future pixel support structures ( including ibl ) and also a candidate for silicon strip supports . \n the reliability of such foam - based structures has been validated by extensive thermal cycling and repeated shock , before and after irradiation up to 1grad . \n three types of pixel structures have been prototyped , all based on evaporative co@xmath5 cooling in ti tubes coupled to the surfaces with thermally conductive carbon foam . \n these are the ibl stave , box beam stave , and `` i - beam '' coupled layer structures . \n box beams have been made up to 1.4 m long by 4 cm wide , including embedded electrical cables . \n also demonstrator bent sections have been made , which can be used to increase pseudorapidity coverage of barrel sections improving the transition to forward coverage . \n i - beam coupled layers have been made up to 1 m long . by radially coupling two measurements layers , \n a very stiff structure can be made , thereby saving mass in support frame structures- even long i - beams can be end - supported . \n [ fig : staves ] shows a 1.4 m long box beam prototype with embedded cables next to a 1 m long i - beam prototype fig . \n [ fig : iblstave ] shows detail views of one end of a 2 cm wide ibl stave . \n stave cable designs have been produced compatible with serial powering of all modules on a stave , using aluminum conductors . \n the fe - i4 chip contains so called `` shunt - ldo '' voltage regulators  @xcite designed to support serial power distribution . in ibl \n these regulators are used to permit safe operation with point - to - point power over resistive cables ( the voltage drop in the cables is comparable to the load ) . \n photograph of a 1.4 m long box beam stave prototype ( bottom ) and a 1 m long i -

i4 chips each . \n the ibl mass target in the active region is 1.5% of a radiation length at normal incidence . \n the additional high precision measurement , at smaller radius and with low mass translates into a significant improvement in the performance of he atlas detector : the purity of b - quark jets identified by the presence of a displaced vertex can be increased by nearly a factor of two  @xcite . \n the full detector is expected to degrade due to radiation damage , random failures , and inefficiency at high interaction rate . even after such degradation \n , simulations show that the presence of the radiation hard , high rate capable ibl translates into better performance than is achieved today , before degradation , but without ibl \n .     left : photograph of the present pixel detector as it is mounted around the beam pipe . \n three disks are in the foreground , with the end of the barrel leaving a roughly 1 cm gap to the beam pipe in the background . \n center : section view of the three barrel layers on approximately the same scale as the photograph , together with the ibl and new beam pipe section inside . \n right : detail showing only the inner layer of the present detector ( gray ) , and ibl and new beam pipe inside . the black line separating the ibl from the present inner layer is a carbon fiber tube that will support and guide insertion of the ibl.,width=302 ]    while ibl is a near term upgrade already in progress , eventually the full atlas tracker must be replaced to cope with a machine luminosity upgrade , and the technology development aims at this goal . \n however , if technology matures on a faster timescale than strictly needed for this ultimate replacement , it may be advantageous to advance the upgrade of certain elements . \n this early availability of new technology is precisely what has made the ibl upgrade possible on the 2013 time scale . \n atlas is now studying the potential advantages of upgrading the full pixel detector ( the part outside ibl ) before the lhc high luminosity upgrade . \n the new detector would have lower mass , higher granularity , bigger lever arm for track finding , and would already meet the rate and radiation requirements of the high luminosity lhc . \n the merits of such an upgrade will be assessed on two fronts : performance studies using monte carlo simulation to evaluate possible gains in physics reach , and projections of expected degradation of the existing detector , including random failures , radiation damage , and efficiency loss at high rate . \n [ fig : newpix ] compares the barrel section of the present detector with ibl to a possible upgrade layout keeping the same ibl . \n this new pixel layout is based on mechanical structures already prototyped ( box beam staves , bent sections , and i - beams ) and on modules made with 4 fe - i4 chips . \n such modules are presently under development . \n the new detector would contain approximately 250 million pixels in just over 3m@xmath0 of silicon , compared to 80 million pixels in under 2m@xmath0 for the present detector ( the pixels are smaller , but also the outer layer radius is larger ) . \n comparison of barrel cross sections for present detector with ibl and ( a ) potential replacement on 2018 timescale . \n ( b ) model view of replacement detector having barrel cross section ( a).,width=510 ] \n development of new technologies has been made a priority of atlas pixel r&d , with the result that several advances are ready today and will be deployed in the ibl upgrade ( 2013 ) . \n these include the new fe - i4 readout chip , new sensors , and low mass foam . \n further items are being developed and will be ready for 2018 deployment if needed . \n these include low mass i - beam and bent box beam stave structures with integrated services , lower cost per unit area ( large format of fe - i4 chip , sensors on 6 inch wafers , faster bump bonding ) , low mass cables , and on - stave power conversion . other items that will be ready for 2018 deployment , but were not covered include low mass multi ghz signal cables , high speed data transmission chips , and data acquisition . \n atlas is studying the benefits of a potential 2018 pixel upgrade taking advantage of the above new technologies . \n still further advances are in early stages of development and will likely not mature for deployment before 2020 . \n these include a further chip generation beyond fe -

{"ContextTokens": 3461, "GeneratedTokens": 196, "SynthesizedBody": "understanding the mechanisms of learning and maintenance of effective behavior in stochastic environments with complex hierarchy of goals is one of key issues in the study of neural processing and for the development of bio - inspired artificial intelligence . \n however , these mechanisms are better understood if history of their development is taken into account .    fields of machine learning and adaptive behavior have been rapidly developing in the recent decades . \n one of the most popular approaches in these areas is reinforcement learning ( rl ) @xcite and its modifications . it can be effectively used for learning of autonomous agents in many domains . \n however , problem spaces with multiple goals require execution of alternative behavioral strategies that are not possible for rl algorithms , since the behavior of the agent is determined by the single value function . \n also , it is not always possible to define appropriate value function _ a priori_. to address this issue approaches for the generation of reinforcement values using evolutionary algorithms are currently under development @xcite . \n other algorithms are also unable to produce effective solution for the environments with hierarchy of goals @xcite . \n the various methods designed for the generation of behavioral sequences @xcite in most cases can not effectively work in situations with a large number of goals present in the environment and when an agent has to autonomously explore them . \n neuroevolutionary approaches have been successfully used for the synthesis of autonomous agent s controllers in low - formalized tasks @xcite .    to solve the problem of alternative behaviors \n the algorithm should implement non - markov decision process in opposite to reinforcement learning @xcite . \n in other words for selection of different actions at the same state of the environment an agent should have memory of previous actions . \n short - term memory ( stm ) is extensively covered in the area of recurrent neural networks research in terms of the signal reverberation @xcite and serial order recall @xcite . \n theorists suggested reverberation phenomenon as significant mechanism for stm @xcite . nevertheless neural principles underlying generation of the behavior as a non - linear integration of the sensory information and internal state of the network are not yet discovered . as well \n the question of the role stm plays in the adaptive behavior with alternative actions is still underexplored .    in this paper \n we present a model of an agent situated in an environment with hierarchy of goals . \n the behavior of the agent is controlled by recurrent neural network . \n we simulated evolution of agents in the model world and studied emergence of short - term memory and its role in adaptive behavior . \n in the current study a state of an environment in which an autonomous agent `` lives '' is represented by binary vector :    @xmath0    at any discrete time step the agent may change a single bit of this vector to the opposite . \n thus , environmental structure is a @xmath1-dimensional hypercube . \n every dimension of this hypercube might be interpreted as some feature of the real environment , for instance temperature , pressure , etc . \n competing goals of different complexity are prespecified in the environment as an ordered set of single bit changes of the environmental state vector :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a number of target bit of the state vector , @xmath4 is target value of the bit , @xmath5 is a complexity of the goal \n . goals of varying complexity are defined in the environment , together forming a branched hierarchical structure . \n we have generated structure of the environment by , firstly , composing hierarchy of full goals and then each goal was divided into sequence of subgoals . \n to determine the complexity of a particular environment we introduce occupancy based on a probabilistic approach :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the number of goals in an environment , @xmath8 is the number of unique bits of the state vector , changed during the process of achieving a goal ( single bit can be changed several times ) . \n the value , which is opposite to the occupancy , we shall call the difficulty of the environment :    @xmath9    reward is associated with each goal in the environment and directly proportional to the complexity of corresponding goal . after the agent reached goal , level of accruing reward associated with this goal is reset and then linearly recovers to the original value over the time @xmath10 \n .    environment can be either deterministic or non - deterministic . in the later changes of the state vector \n occur not only when the agent performs actions , but also stochastically according with a fixed probability . \n agent s behavior in the environment is controlled by artificial neural network ( ann ) of arbitrary topology , which develops through the evolutionary process . \n ann is divided into input , output and number of hidden layers . \n the network consists of mcculloch - pitts neurons with nonnegative logistic activation function . \n signal passes through the synapse only when output value of a presynaptic neuron is above a certain activation threshold ( was set to 0.5 in all simulations ) . \n thus , we introduce two possible states for each neuron : active ( when output is above a threshold ) and inactive ( otherwise ) . \n the current state vector of the environment is directly fed to the neurons of input layer of the network . \n hidden layers allow existence of recurrent connections with delayed transmission . \n pair of the most active neurons of output layer encodes agent s action at the current time step . \n each pair stands for a particular bit of the state vector and target value . \n thereby transfers of a bit from 0 to 1 and vice versa are encoded by different pairs of the output neurons . \n the agent could produce ineffective actions , when attempts to change a state of a bit to one in which it already is . \n population of agents evolves in the hypercube environment described in previous section . \n every individual is separately placed in the environment to evaluate fitness . for a given time the agent operates in the environment , reaching goals and accumulating reward . \n value of accumulated reward is inaccessible to the agent and total reward affects its reproductive success .    to evolve agents anns we used neuroevolutionary algorithm based on duplication of neurons . \n this algorithm is similar to well - known neat @xcite as it makes possible evolution of neural network topology but in more natural way by duplicating neurons with attached connections . \n specifically we use _ \n neuron s duplication _ mutation when duplicated neuron inherits from parent the whole synaptic structure instead of _ add node _ mutation of neat . \n incoming connections of the descendant and parent neurons retain its previous weights , while weights of outgoing connections divided in half for both neurons . \n thus , two neurons in the aggregate perform the former function , but later in evolution the descendant neuron could diverge into a separate structure . to optimize evolution by \n dynamically reducing dimensionality of the search space we also introduced _ delete connection _ mutation , which performed in the same manner as _ add connection _ mutation . \n neurons that lost all their connections are being deleted from the network . \n we did not use any crossover algorithm , since preliminary results of comparison between two versions of evolutionary algorithm ( with crossover and without ) have not showed significantly difference . \n the structure of the agents networks in initial population consists of input and output layers and one additional interneuron , which will be an ancestor for all future interneurons . \n this initial interneuron is fully connected to input layer ( by incoming connections ) and to output layer , herewith there are no initial direct connections between input and output neurons . \n we used the following parameters of the artificial environment in all simulations : dimensionality of the hypercube environment @xmath1  8 bits ; agent lifetime duration @xmath11  250 time steps ; reward s recovery time @xmath10  30 time steps ; probability of random change of the state vector s bit @xmath12  0.0085 ( for each bit ) . \n evolutionary algorithm was running with parameters : population @xmath13  250 agents ; period of evolution @xmath14  5000 generations ; probability of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath15  0.6 ( for each synapse ) ; variance of the synaptic weight mutation @xmath16  0.08 ; probability of adding the synapse @xmath17  0.1 ( for whole network ) ; probability of deleting the synapse @xmath18  0.05 ( for whole network ) ; probability of neuron s duplication @xmath19  0.007 ( for whole network ) . \n as the first step we studied how occupancy of the environment affects efficiency of evolved behavior in deterministic and stochastic environments . \n as expected the simulation results show the growth of an average cumulative reward with increase of the occupancy , reflecting that a task is easier when the environment is more densely populated with goals ( fig . \n [ fig : statevolution ] ) . \n agents evolved in non - deterministic environments behave significantly more successfully ( fig . \n [ fig : statevolution ] ) in terms of average accumulated reward and in most cases have richer repertoires of behavior . \n such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that during the `` life '' in an environment which could suddenly change the agent with a wider spectrum of behavioral policies should be more successful . \n thus stochasticity of the environment contributes to the selection of agents with more flexible and robust behavior , allowing them to reach greater number of goals from different initial position . \n however , with increasing probability of random changes in the environment one can observe a sharp decline in the efficiency of the evolution ( data not shown ) due to the destabilization of all policies caused by excessively frequent changes in the environment . \n we then analyzed evolution of behavioral sequences of the agents in the environment of intermediate goal occupancy . \n typical evolved behavior usually consists of two phases : preliminary phase of converging to the main behavioral cycle and then residing on it . in a particular behavioral run \n both of these phases depend on the initial state of the environment , from which the agent has been started . \n we shall call the main behavioral cycle ( sequence of actions or attained goals ) a behavioral strategy \n .    results of simulations demonstrate that sharp increase in the average cumulative reward among the population usually coincides with emergence of a large number of new cycles and their dynamic competition . \n corresponding periods are the most interesting in the study of behavioral evolution . on the fig . \n [ fig : behevolution ] we give an example of such period . \n one can observe competition between different behavioral strategies during a very limited evolutionary period . \n herewith new strategies are appearing as an extension of previously evolved cycles . \n extension can be implemented not only as simple addition of a new part to an old one , but also as complex compilation of two strategies . \n eventually one of the strategies wins the competition and dominates in the behavior of the most of the population . \n then evolution occurs through increase in number of states , from which it could be implemented . \n the analysis of behavioral strategies emerging in the simulated evolution shows that the agents acquire ability to store short - term memory due to reverberation in the neural network by recurrent connections . \n the evidence for short - term memory comes from the fact that agents can implement policies based on alternative actions . \n agents usually can perform different actions from one state of the environment depending on the previous history of behavior . \n state transition diagram for the exemplar evolved behavior with three alternative actions is shown on the fig . \n [ fig : alternativebehavior ] . \n such phenomenon would not been possible in the case of reactivity work of the neural network . \n corresponding behavior is generated by a neural network consists of 30 neurons with only 15 interneurons and 611 synaptic connections . \n only a small number of neurons significantly change output and affect the decision making at states associated with alternative situations . \n this group of neurons is specialized on particular alternative actions . \n the majority of neurons remain at the same level of activity , while neurons which determine a behavior change their activity from zero to maximum level . \n based on the various behavioral policies the deepest short - term memory we found was at least 4 past states ( lower bound ) . \n such conclusion was made after considering situations in which alternative actions are performed with the same history of behavior and , thus , the lower bound can be determined as the first different action of the two behavioral sequences . \n the ability to use short - term memory makes possible implementation of much more complex behavior and accumulation of more reward during the agent s `` life '' . \n example of a behavioral strategy , based on the alternation of two cycles of actions , is shown on the fig . \n [ fig : behstrategy ] . \n since after the goal is reached it restores the reward for a fixed number of time steps , such a strategy allows goals that were reached on the first cycle to restore their value , while the agent passes the second cycle . \n behavior on the fig . \n [ fig : behstrategy ] can be implemented using short - term memory with depth of two states .    primitive alternative behavior in the model \n could also be supported by slow neurodynamical process ( fig . \n [ fig : slowprocess ] ) . in this case \n the `` memory '' , required to perform alternative actions , could be up to 30 previous states . \n the mechanism underling this type of behavior is oscillatory dynamic of the neuron s output . \n while output of a neuron is above threshold , and therefore transmitted by outgoing connections , agent performs the first part of behavior . at some point output falls below the transmission threshold and the neuron no longer inhibits the other neuron , which activity is essential for the second branch of behavior .        in the records of neural network activity ( fig . \n [ fig : rasterplot ] ) during the entire period of autonomous agent s behavior one can identify both neurons , that are active while performing most of the actions , and neurons , that are active only in a very limited number of states of the environment ( sometimes even in a single state ) . \n in our study we have explored possibility of evolutionary emergence of short - term memory in recurrent neural networks controlling agents behavior in multi - goal environments . on the first stage we analyzed overall dynamics of a model . as expected , performance of agents was worse when the number of goals in environment was smaller . on the other hand it turned out surprisingly that in stochastic environments agents with more flexible and stable behavioral policies evolve and able to accumulate more reward in comparison to agents in the same environment but without noise . \n this phenomenon is quite unusual for machine learning algorithms @xcite , since in the case of non - deterministic environment the performance is usually worse . \n detailed investigation of evolutionary dynamics revealed that the evolution of agents consisted of two stages : rapid emergence / development of new behavioral strategies and their propagation among the population . \n formation of new strategies was usually manifested as complex integration of few already existed .    on the level of individual behavior we found that evolution develops strategies , which are based on alternative actions . \n that happens due to acquisition of ability to operate with short - term memory and , therefore , to select actions taking into account previous history of behavior . \n evolution discovered two different neuronal mechanisms for implementation of alternative actions : first one is based on integration of sensory information and internal signal , which is reverberating through recurrent connections ; and the second is based on slow neurodynamical oscillatory processes . in fact , there is no need to recruit synaptic plasticity during the agent s `` life '' to have an effective use of short - term memory . \n it is important to notice that emergence of the ability to operate with short - term memory in our model occurs without any artificial prerequisites in the structure of an evolutionary algorithm . \n the next stage of presented study is introduction of learning during agent s `` life '' , since it makes significant contribution into development of adaptive behavior . \n the main mechanism of learning algorithm is detection on the neuronal level of problems for the whole organism situated in environment . \n possible approach to the construction of such algorithm is the use of research in the theoretical neuroscience @xcite . \n singh , s. , lewis , r. , barto , a.g . \n : where do rewards come from ? in : taatgen , \n n.a . , van rijn , h.

{"ContextTokens": 3453, "GeneratedTokens": 238, "SynthesizedBody": "synthetic adhesives are usually soft , essentially incompressible materials that do not flow . \n they are used in the form of thin films of typically 100 m m in thickness . \n their adhesive properties are often tested in a controlled test that mimics the typical situation of two solid bodies linked by an adhesive . in the so - called probe - tack geometry , introduced by zosel ( 1985 ) , a flat , solid punch , called the probe , \n is brought into contact with an adhesive film deposited on a rigid substratum . after a certain contact time , the force is recorded while the probe is being pulled away ( figure 1a ) . because the adhesive material is almost incompressible , pulling the solid bodies apart causes a strong convergent deformation and thus a strong resistance to separation , i.e. to good adhesion . \n furthermore , because the resistance of the adhesive is so important , the deformability of the entire system , and in particular the compliance of the machine itself may play a role . \n elastic energy is stored for some time , until the adhesive gives way and causes a sudden separation , as discussed in a specific geometry by francis et al . \n sudden separation is possible when instabilities develop in the bulk of the adhesive material so as to relieve much of the stress . \n such instabilities have been observed directly during separation in a modified version of the probe - tack test ( lakrout et al . , 1999 ) and shown to fall into two main categories , viz . \n fingering instabilities and cavitation . \n both types of instabilities are driven by the need for relieving the stress . \n when air fingers protrude from the edge of the sample towards the center , they bring atmospheric pressure well into the sample and thus relieve the negative pressure that has developed near the center due to the applied traction . in the case of purely viscous liquids , this is the well - known saffman- taylor instability ( saffman et al . , 1958 ) . \n cavitation also relieves stress since the growing bubbles provide some of the extra volume required by the plate separation . since \n adhesive materials are usually more elastic than viscous , they are most often subject to cavitation , which involves strong deformations on the scale of the sample thickness . \n they almost never undergo fingering , which would involve deformations on the scale of the entire sample . when a very viscous liquid is used in this geometry instead of proper adhesive material , fingering is observed at low separation rates while cavitation occurs at higher rates ( poivet et al . , unpublished observations ) , which further illustrates the fact that both mechanisms compete in relieving the applied tensile stress . \n both fingering and cavitation involve strong deformations in the sample during separation and thus cause a large energy dissipation , ranging typically from @xmath0 to @xmath1 j / m@xmath2 for good adhesives , which is much higher than typical surface energies in the @xmath3 j / m@xmath2 range . \n a number of properties are associated with an adhesive . \n it is usually a soft material that does not flow and made of polymers whose molecular architecture may vary ( cross - linked polymers , block - copolymers ) \n . it can accommodate large defor- mations in order to dissipate a large amount of energy , yet it is essentially incompressible . \n the need for relieving the applied stress is so strong in the thin film geometry that if the adhesive material is too resistant , e.g. if it is very elastic , fingering and cavitation from the edge of the sample may occur at the interface , as shown by ghatak ( 2000 ) and shull ( 2000 ) . \n this highlights the fact that not only the bulk of the adhesive film , but also its interfaces with the solid bodies set up during the bonding process , must resist separation efficiently . \n the quality of the contact between the adhesive and the substrata results from the interplay of inter- actions at different length scales . on the molecular scale \n , it results generically from van der waals interactions ( israelachvili , 1992 ) . \n surface chemical bonds ( gent et al . , 1972 ) , macromolecular interdigita- tion ( raphal et al . , 1992 ) or macromolecule elongation ( lake et al . , 1967 \n ) , however , may enhance significantly the strength of the interface for specific substratum - adhesive pairs . \n surface treatments and cleaning are also essential . on the micrometre scale , solid substrates usually display some degree of surface roughness ( greenwood et al . , 1966 ) that may reduce the degree of intimacy of the contact with the adhesive if the adhesive material is not very soft ( dahlquist , 1969 ; fuller et al . , 1975 ; creton et al . , 1996 ; crevoisier et al . , 1999 ) . for very soft adhesives , however , the surface roughness of the substratum may paradoxically enhance the strength of the interface , as small air bubbles trapped at the interface may generate suction effects upon traction ( gay & leibler , 1999b ) .    when seeking a bad adhesion even with good adhesives , the main strategy is to weaken the contact at the body surface , and in particular to use non - wetting surfaces , i.e. surfaces such that the gain in surface energy upon making contact with the adhesive is small . \n when spread on such surfaces , most liquids do not spread spontaneously but gather into droplets . on very weakly wetting surfaces , in particular on lotus leaves and on other plants and on some insect wings ( wagner et al . \n , 1996 ; barthlott et al . , 1997 ; neinhuis et al . , \n 1997 ) , millimetric drops are almost complete spheres and can easily roll . \n solid surfaces were successfully designed to mimic this `` lotus effect '' and the surface design , an array of micrometer - sized poles , enhances the weak wettability achieved through chemical treatment ( bico et al . , 1999 ) . \n the mechanisms described above , by which the adhesive material undergoes heterogeneous defor- mations upon traction , involve the bulk of the adhesive film . \n however , as seen from a distance , the adhesive joint appears to be the interface between both solid bodies , and its deformations due to traction can be seen as a fracture propagating at this interface . in this perspective \n , adhesion phenomena are connected to the field of fracture mechanics . \n a small notch cut on one side of an elastic band ( figure 2a ) illustrates a number of points . \n if the band is pulled gently , it stretches homogeneously except in the vicinity of the notch where it is less stretched ( figure 2b ) . \n in other words , elastic energy is stored in the material but the notch relieves some of this energy . if the band was cut further , the notch would be longer and relieve more stress . \n this will not happen spontaneously unless it is pulled more strongly . \n it will generally happen when the elastic energy released by the notch propagation is sufficient to break further bonds at the interface and propagate the fracture . \n this is a central concept in fracture mechanics , called griffith s criterion ( griffith , 1920 ) . \n since the energy stored depends on the elastic properties of the entire system , not only does the elasticity of the testing apparatus play a role if it is soft enough , but very non - intuitive behaviors may arise . \n the fracture may propagate within the adhesive film i.e. its cohesion affected , or it may take place at the interface with one of the substrates . more generally , when considering a stack of several layers from different materials ( figure 2c ) , the system may break upon traction or peeling . \n the system may choose between different fracture mechanisms ( interfacial or cohesive , with further choice in a layered system ) . \n at first , it usually chooses the weakest mechanism in terms of force since it triggers separation first and thereby relieves the stress on the other possible mechan- isms . in the long run , however , fracture propagation is driven by the elastic energy stored in the system under tension which must exceed the energy required by the fracture . \n the system thus tends to choose the separation mechanism that dissipates the smallest amount of energy per unit surface area since the fracture will then be able to propagate faster . \n but , when a sheet of paper is torn out of note - pad , depending on how exactly the paper is pulled and how the note - pad is held , the sheet may detach neatly or be torn . due to the mismatch in the elastic properties of the note - pad and the paper sheet , \n the fracture may propagate along a path that does not minimize the energy dissipation . \n more generally , in a layered system , the elastic properties of the various layers may prevent the fracture from migrating towards its energetically optimal location . \n as discussed above , separating both substrata in the probe - tack geometry is difficult because the lateral extension of the adhesive joint is much greater than its thickness ( thin geometry ) . \n it is also essential that both substrata are rigid ( figure 1a ) . indeed , when an adhesive tape is considered , the sticky side is the adhesive film , while the non - sticky side is the ( very flexible ) backing . \n thus , the backing plays the role of one of the substrata . but \n peeling a tape off a table is quite easy because the backing is flexible and only a restricted region of the adhesive is under tension at any given time during peeling ( figure 1c ) . \n peeling is , in general , so much easier that it is avoided as much as possible in practical situations . \n for instance , adhesive hooks for bathroom or kitchen utensiles are designed in such a way that the hook deformations induced by a hanging weight cause the adhesive layer to be locally compressed rather than peeled , otherwise the adhesive joint would soon be ruined ( figure 1e , f ) . \n although similar to peeling at first sight , detach- ment by tilting is difficult if both the substrata are rigid . indeed , tilting one object ( for instance , the probe in the probe - tack geometry ) involves com- pression of the adhesive film along the vicinity of one edge , and traction on the other edge and on most of the region of contact with the object ( figure 1b ) . \n hence , tilting the object is very similar to pulling it . \n tilting becomes similar to peeling only at the point where the adhesive joint is not longer thin , i.e. if its lateral dimensions are comparable to its thickness , it is then easy . \n this feature is used by tropical lizards ( geckoes ) , which can climb walls at considerable velocities . \n their adhesive feet consist of a hierarchy of structures . \n the smallest structure is the spatula ( 0.2 @xmath4 m in width ) . \n adherence to the wall is important , even if it is rough , because spatulae can achieve contact with it somewhat independently of one another . \n however , foot removal is obviously achievable without too much effort . because spatulae are independent \n , they can be tilted simultaneously and peeled away from the wall . due to their small lateral dimension , \n this can be done with little effort ( autumn et al . , 2000 ) . in short , geckos use peeling on the lowest scale to lift their feet . \n a round object can roll on a sticky surface , whereby a new contact with the adhesive is made at the front , while separation , similar to peeling , is achieved at the rear ( figure 1d ) . \n because the separation dissipates more energy than is provided by the contact , a sufficient sideward force must be applied for the object to move . \n experiments conducted on glass cylinders in contact with rubber ( charmet et al . , 1995 and references therein ) show that such rolling can occur also if the applied force has a normal component . \n for example , cylinders can roll both on and under an inclined rubber sheet . \n similarly , marine organisms attached to a boat s hull undergo a sideways force as well as a lift force ( because the flow is usually in the inertial rather than viscous regime ) \n . they may thus roll if the water velocity is moderate , and they may even detach if the lift component of the force is high . \n if the organisms are rigid , gregarious settlement behavior hinders flow - driven detachment , since when attached together , they constitute a solid with a large lateral extension , which turns easy rolling into more demanding tilting ( figure 3 ) . \n testing fouling release properties of coatings some- times involves real - size experiments on ships , but more usually laboratory scale characterization . \n hydrodynamic effects scale with dimension . in particular , \n boundary layers are much smaller in laboratory tests than under ship - operating con- ditions ( schultz et al . , 2003 ) , \n thus attached bodies should be scaled down accordingly ( figure 4a , b ) . \n the interpretation of laboratory tests therefore needs to combine information from different types of experiments . \n for example , small ` toy ' particles on small ships can be used in laboratory tests to mimic organisms to measure what lateral and normal drag forces and torques they undergo at various locations on the ship and at various equivalent ship speeds ( figure 4b ) . \n after proper upscaling of these forces and torques , the laboratory or small boat tests with live organisms should be performed under con- ditions where forces and torques can be reproduced ( figure 4d ) . \n these parameters can be measured if the organisms are located on small , instrumented patches inside larger panels ( figure 4e ) . \n alterna- tively , if the organism under study is rigid , the forces and torques can be applied to it mechanically , in the absence of any flow ( figure 4c ) . \n if the organism is much more rigid than the coating , or , more generally , if its mechanical properties are known , its detach- ment can be mimicked with more convenient real- size ` toy ' objects with an experimental set - up that controls the forces and torques . \n the mechanics of adhesion briefly described in the previous sections suggest the following direction for fouling release coatings . if an aggregate of rigid organisms on the surface is considered on a classical thin coating , the only detachment mode is tilting ( figure 3 ) . \n but , if the coating is flexible in some sense , then an easier detachment mode , similar to peeling , may appear . \n it is suggested that a coating consisting in an inextensible , flexible , very thin upper layer and a much softer lower layer , may provide enough local compliance to accompany a tilting object and peeling away from it , thus easing its detachment ( figure 5 ) . \n such a coating may be capable of easily releasing rigid organisms . \n synthetic adhesives are efficient because they involve several mechanisms for dissipating a large amount of energy upon detachment ( see reviews by kinloch , 1996 , gay & leibler , 1999a , and creton & fabre , 2002 ) . \n some of these mechanisms , and the associated mechanical aspects , have been reviewed and may enhance understanding of the settlement and release of fouling organisms and thereby lead to improvements in the design of fouling release and non - adhesive coatings . \n i acknowledge fruitful discussions and collabo- rations on adhesion phenomena over the past few years , with arnaud chiche , ioulia chikina , costantino creton , guillaume de crevoisier , pascale fabre , gwendal josse , ludwik leibler , frdric nallet , sylwia poivet , elie raphal , didier roux . \n i gratefully thank the organizers of the conference for the invitation to give a presentation . \n autumn k , chang w -

{"ContextTokens": 3382, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "remarkable detection capabilities appearing in animal hearing are essentially governed by both a passive mechanical and an active biophysical procedures in the cochlea  @xcite . \n the active amplification of the living cochlea was conjectured by gold in 1948  @xcite and is now qualitatively studied widely through the hopf equation in mathematical models  @xcite . in order to give a better understanding to the experimental observations , \n a more accurate model is required . \n furthermore the physical origin of the active oscillation remains still unclear . in mammals , the outer hair cells ( ohcs ) \n are known to be force generators for auditory sensitivity and frequency selectivity . proposed mechanisms of the force generation \n are contraction of the ohc itself  @xcite and an active motion of the hair bundle  @xcite . \n energy depot model can describe the active phenomena  @xcite , because the energy supplied by the depot can induce a negative dissipation . a similar mechanism for a negative stiffness in the bullfrog s hair bundle \n has been reported  @xcite . \n it is reasonable to consider the ohc as an energy depot since the ohcs play an important role in the active amplification of the cochlea even though we do not know the exact mechanism of the energy supply . in nature \n all living things have some mechanisms of protection for survival . \n we expect that there might be a similar mechanism to protect cochlea from damage by any external factors such as loud stimulation . \n hence , we propose a braking mechanism in the cochlea to prevent the basilar membrane ( bm ) from an excessive oscillation which could damage the cochlea . \n for this purpose , a critical velocity of the ohc oscillation will be introduced in our model .    in the following sections , we describe our model and reproduce the essential phenomena of the active cochlea observed in recent experiments such as the compressive nonlinearity , the dynamics of the bm response , nonlinear distortion and the spontaneous bm oscillation ( sbmo ) . \n it will also be pointed ut that our model naturally includes the hopf bifurcation model  @xcite in the case of weak stimulation . however , in the regime of strong stimulation , the present model is essentially different from the hopf bifurcation model . \n it shows that the response of the bm is non - linear and compressive at the cf . \n ( note that the slope of the solid line is less than one . ) otherwise , the response of the bm is a linear function of the stimulation yielding that the slopes are @xmath0 . \n these results agree with the experimental observations  @xcite . ] \n it is well known that a change of transmembrane potential in the ohc induces a somatic vibration . \n this implies that a part of the electric energy is converted into the mechanical energy . in this sense , we believe that the ohc functions as an energy depot for the bm . \n the ohc as the energy depot stores energy supplied and converts it into kinetic energy overcoming dissipation . \n this energetics can be described by the following energy balance equation  @xcite . \n @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy density of the energy depot , @xmath3 the rate of the energy pumping into the energy depot per unit area , @xmath4 the rate of the internal energy dissipation , @xmath5 the rate of the energy converting into the kinetic energy of the bm , and @xmath6 the velocity of the bm . considering that constant contribution of @xmath5 can be incooperated into @xmath4 and that conversion rate of the energy into the kinetic energy of the bm will not be sensitive to the sign of @xmath6 , we assume that @xmath5 is an even function of @xmath6 without a constant term . the energy depot model in which @xmath7 has been extensively discussed  @xcite . in this paper , we include the next higher contribution to @xmath5 and introduce a critical velocity of the bm to describe a braking mechanism  @xcite . \n hence the conversion rate @xmath5 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical velocity . \n for a finite @xmath9 the oscillation of the bm can be braked by the negative conversion rate into the kinetic motion of the bm . \n note that @xmath10 corresponds to a system without the braking mechanism . \n the critical velocity will be roughly estimated from the contraction of the ohc later for our numerical calculation . \n khz and the stimulation is @xmath11db . \n the onset time is much shorter than the offset time which is not shown in full scale . \n this result is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations  @xcite . \n @xmath12kgm@xmath13s@xmath14 , @xmath15m@xmath13s@xmath16 , and @xmath17 . \n the

velocity of the bm is ( not ) saturated when the stimulation is sufficiently large with ( without ) the braking mechanism . ] \n now it is worthwhile to compare our newly proposed model with the one previously introduced in ref .  @xcite . whereas we treat the energy density ( @xmath2 ) of the energy depot(ohc ) , in ref . \n @xcite the energy density ( @xmath28 ) of the propagating hydrodynamic wave is considered . \n the model in ref . \n @xcite describes the coupling of the active elements to the propagating wave , while the present model describes the coupling between the energy depot(ohc ) and the bm oscillation . \n the emphasis in this paper is on showing that the active and compressive response arises naturally from the generalized energy depot concept . \n an adiabatic approximation in which the adaptation of the energy depot is very fast  @xcite yields that @xmath29 it should bear in mind that @xmath2 is not constant . \n the oscillation of the bm is then governed by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density , @xmath32 the physical damping coefficient , @xmath33 the stiffness , and @xmath34 the displacement of the bm . \n @xmath35 includes the contributions of a sound wave ( external stimulation ) and a noise . \n the noise is assumed to be a gaussian white noise . \n @xmath36 is the active force density acting on the bm by the ohc , @xmath37 note that the langevin equation , eq . \n ( [ full ] ) , describes the passive and the active response in a unified and natural way . \n it should be noted that the active force , eq . \n ( [ active ] ) , can be either positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath6 . when @xmath38 is smaller than @xmath39 ( weak stimulation ) , a positive active force \n is provided on the bm ( active mechanism ) . on the other hand , when @xmath38 is larger than @xmath39 ( strong stimulation ) , a negative active force , hence an extra drag force , is exerted on the bm ( braking mechanism ) . \n the mass density of the bm is known to be about @xmath40kg / m@xmath16  @xcite and the reported damping coefficient , @xmath32 , of the bm has a large variation from @xmath41 to @xmath42 kg m@xmath13s@xmath14  @xcite depending on the models . for a numerical calculation \n , we set the damping in the range of @xmath43 kg m@xmath13s@xmath14 . \n it has been reported that the guinea pig ohcs are able to change its length up to @xmath44 when the transmembrane potential is varied . \n this corresponds to a displacement of @xmath45 m for the ohcs of @xmath46 m at the high - frequency end  @xcite . \n hence , in the regime of high frequency of @xmath47khz , the adjustable parameter @xmath9 is roughly estimated about @xmath48 m/s . by considering the ohc as a capacitor and using the observed membrane potential , membrane capacitance  @xcite , and the scale of the ohc  @xcite , we estimate the value of @xmath3 to be about @xmath48 kg s@xmath49 . \n the response of the bm to the sound wave can be then obtained straightforwardly using eqs . \n ( [ full ] ) and  ( [ active ] ) . in the following calculations , we set @xmath50 and the characteristic frequency ( cf ) , @xmath51 . it will be shown later that these relations arise from the conditions of the hopf bifurcation . in the present calculations , \n the noise width of the distribution is chosen to be zero db . \n the compressive and dynamical responses of the bm are obtained as shown in fig . \n [ compressive ] and fig . \n [ dyn ] , respectively . \n [ compressive ] demonstrates that the response of the bm is non - linear and compressive at the cf , while the response is linear at other frequencies . \n this compressive response of the bm agrees well with the observations  @xcite as expected . \n [ dyn ] shows the time course of the bm response , reproducing the experimental observation that the onset time of the response is shorter than the offset time , although the onset time is somewhat larger than the experimental values  @xcite . \n it is important to notice that the velocity of the bm increases continuously as long as the stimulation is being turned on if the braking mechanism is not included @xmath52 . \n hence , the braking mechanism introduced in our model is essential to explain the experimental observation at a sufficiently strong stimulation . \n a dependence of the bm velocity on @xmath9 is plotted in fig . \n the results clearly show that lower critical velocity produces smaller response at the same stimulation , thus producing a supercompressive behavior as observed in experiment  @xcite . \n this is the effect of the braking mechanism , which is significantly different from the hopf bifurcation model . \n note that the saturation of the bm response disappears if the braking mechanism is

oscillator is defined as the ratio of the displacement of the bm to the stimulation , @xmath61 using eq . \n ( [ full ] ) , we obtain the gain , which is a scaling function of the stimulation when the stimulation is not too large , @xmath62 . \n this result agrees well with the experiment  @xcite and the result of the hopf bifurcation model  @xcite , @xmath63 . \n indeed our model includes the hopf model naturally . to show this , we expand the active force , eq . \n ( [ active ] ) , up to the lowest nonlinear term when @xmath64 is small . \n ( [ full ] ) is then approximately written as @xmath65 in the fourier spectra space , this directly corresponds to the hopf equation  @xcite with the following bifurcation conditions , @xmath66 hence our energy depot model with a braking mechanism reduces to the hopf bifurcation model in the limit of weak stimulation . \n one of the most important results of our model is an amplification of the thermal noise itself in the absence of an external stimulation . at the bifurcation point or when @xmath67 , the thermal noise is well suppressed . \n however , when @xmath68 , so that too much of the internal energy is converted into the kinetic energy , the thermal noise can be largely amplified as shown in fig .  [ vc ] . here , we set the mean average of the noise at @xmath54pa and the width at @xmath54db . \n since it can be generally assumed that the oscillators are distributed in the vicinity of the bifurcation point , the noise may be amplified incoherently in the absence of the input signal . however , when a weak input signal with the same cf is introduced , it may phase - lock to the already existing amplified noise , thus enhancing the selectivity as discussed in ref .  @xcite . because it is believed that the sbmo is crucial for understanding the spontaneous otoacoustic emission  @xcite , our model may provide a clue to explore this interesting and important phenomenon . \n [ dist ] shows the nonlinear distortion of the response of the bm at the position where the cf is @xmath69khz . \n the stimulation contains two tunes , @xmath70khz and @xmath58khz . \n the strengths both are @xmath11db . \n our model shows clearly the distortions at @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the response of the bm . \n in this paper , we propose a theoretical scheme for the active and passive response of the bm based on a concept of the energy depot model with a braking mechanism . according to the experimental observations , \n the ohc is assumed to play a role of the energy depot by supplying an active force to the bm and also by reabsorbing an excessive kinetic energy like the regenerative - brake system in automobiles and electric vehicles  @xcite . \n it is shown that a single equation of motion , eq  ( [ full ] ) , can produce all the essential passive and active behaviors . moreover \n , our model shows that the brownian noise can be sufficiently amplified under a certain condition , thus leading to the sbmo . \n although we applied our model only to the mammalian cochlea , it is equally possible to be applied to the nonmammalian vertebrates  @xcite because the only required physical characteristics are a supply of the active force and a self - adaptation . in this sense \n , we believe that the concept of the energy depot model with a braking mechanism is quite universal and can be applied to any underdamped biological systems . \n this work is supported by the korea science and engineering foundation ( kosef ) ( r01 - 2006 - 000 - 10083 - 0 ) . \n furness and c.  m. hackney , _ the structure and composition of the stereociliary bundle of vertebrate hair cells _ , in _ vertebrate hair cells _ , \n r.  a. eatock , r.  r. fay and a.  n. popper ( springer , new york , 2006 ) , chapter .  3 , pp .", "StartTimeOffset": 245828719674, "RequestID": "34bc2bdebfafefac2a91ddd437dc7e6e0cfeefea", "TotalTokens": 3575}
{"ContextTokens": 3910, "GeneratedTokens": 184, "SynthesizedBody": "recent progress in the growth of chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) diamonds is challenging readout electronics developers . because of its large bandgap of 5.5 ev and very low boron and nitrogen impurity concentrations @xmath01 - 5 ppb  @xcite cvd diamond has a negligible intrinsic noise at room temperature . \n in fact , the mean leakage current of a typical device is less than 1 pa . combining this with a very high carrier mobility of about @xmath1c/(v/@xmath2 m ) , allowing for a complete charge collection in few ns ( 8 ns for 500 @xmath2 m thick device biased at 1 v/@xmath2 m ) , results in an intrinsic noise charge collected within the duration of the signal of the order of @xmath30.05 electrons . except for very slow , cryogenic , charge sensitive amplifiers , able to reduce the rms noise to a few electrons , \n such precision is out of reach of modern fast amplifiers . \n indeed , the best broadband amplifiers have input referred noise rms of @xmath4 electrons corresponding to the input referred noise of 10 @xmath2v ( 50 @xmath5 input impedance ) in 8 ns signal . even conventional charge amplifiers with 50 - 300 @xmath2s decay time have more than 200 electrons rms noise . therefore , for diamond detector applications \n the dominant ( by three - five orders of magnitude ) source of noise is the readout electronics .    in the present note we present a series of tests on various fast amplifiers aimed to identify the best solution for nuclear and particle physics applications . \n these applications demand a measurement of both the energy released in the bulk of the diamond by ionizing particles and the time . \n these tests were performed using various radioactive sources . \n we selected a 4.7 x 4.7mm2 , 500 um thick single crystal cvd diamond detector capacitance can be estimated according to the plain    we selected 4.7@xmath64.7 mm@xmath7 , 500 @xmath2 m thick single crystal cvd diamond detector produced by diamond detectors ltd  @xcite . \n the crystal has two electrodes deposited on its upper and lower major surfaces , made of few nm of dlc followed by 100 nm of gold . \n each contact is bonded via a gold microwire onto pcb and then to its sma connector in such a way that both contacts can be read out independently . \n detector capacitance can be estimated according to the plane capacitor equation ( neglecting eventual fringe field contribution ) : @xmath8 this result is in good agreement with the value measured by hp 4280a capacimeter . \n the diamond detector was polarized at 1 v/@xmath2 m by means of ortec 710 bias supply . \n this value remains below detector breakdown voltage ( at 1.4 v/@xmath2 m discharges , likely to be attributed to crystal defects or contact disuniformity , occur ) allowing for complete charge collection  @xcite .    in the present work , we used two types of readout : one - side readout , shown in fig . \n [ fig : setup_single ] and two - side readout , shown in fig . \n [ fig : setup_double ] . \n the one - side readout was used to characterize energy resolution of of various amplifiers . in this case \n the diamond was polarized by applying 1 v/@xmath2 m bias voltage from the readout side and the other contact was connected to ground . \n schematic drawing of the experimental setup in case of the one - side readout . ] \n schematic drawing of the experimental setup in case of the two - side readout . ] \n the two - side readout was used to study ideal timing resolution of the cvd diamond detector . \n indeed , the major contribution to both energy and timing resolutions come from the readout electronics and in particular from the first amplification stage . using the same diamond detector signal \n read out independently from opposite sides by two separate amplifiers allows to study the electronic contribution to the timing resolution using realistic signals .    for single amplifier characterization measurements \n the diamond detector was connected to the amplifier input through a 2.4 cm huber & suhner sma `` i '' connector , while the second sma connector of the detector was shorted to ground by sma tap . \n the overall capacitance of the system in front of the amplifier ( `` i '' connector , two sma connectors of detector case and sma tap ) was found to be 6.6 pf . \n the amplifier output was connected to the digitizer via 1.5 m huber & suhner sucoflex 104 cable . \n the amplified signal was read out by sis3305 digitizer with analog bandwidth of 2.2 ghz . \n the digitizer was operated in four - channel interleaved 5 gs / s mode . \n for timing response measurements with small signals an additional amplifier philips scientific 744 with bandwidth of 1.8 ghz and gain @xmath9 was inserted between primary amplifier output and digitizer input . \n the data measured by the digitizer was acquired through the vme bus by concurrent technologies vx 813/091 single board computer ( sbc ) which incorporates a tsi148 vme controller . \n a simple daq program was developed using dma transfer of digitizer memory to the sbc memory . \n the data were saved on the local compact flash disk and transferred to workstation for the off - line analysis . \n in order to measure coincidence events and to reduce accessible energy threshold the standard sis3305 digitizer firmware rev.1c.0b had to be modified . \n sis3305 digitizer features three xilinx fpgas on - board , two virtex 5 fpgas serve as interfaces for the two 2.5 gs / s adc cores , and one virtex 4 fpga manages the board vme interface . \n partially precompiled firmware of adc fpgas was acquired from the manufacturer for our purposes . \n this firmware version 1c.0b included only simple internal triggers : data acquisition is started when one adc sample goes above or below imposed threshold in one of digitizer channels . \n it also includes a schmidt trigger , which fires when one adc sample goes above ( below ) a first threshold and turns off when after another single adc sample is below ( above ) a second threshold . \n the trigger was modified using the xilinx ise design suite version 13.2 . \n first of all a trigger that fires when a configurable number of samples is above ( below ) a given threshold was implemented . for the initialization of this parameter for each channel we used bits 30 - 26 of the corresponding sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 and sis3305_trigger_gate_lt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 ( 0x2020 - 0x203c and 0x3020 - 0x303c ) registers  @xcite . \n this allows to select the number of consecutive samples above / below threshold in selected channel in the range from 1 to 32 ( 5-bit word ) corresponding to time interval from 0.8 ns to 25.6 ns . \n the 4.8 ns long channel s trigger - valid signal goes on when the number of consecutive samples above / below threshold in given channel reaches the configured value . in case of the 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes ( 2.5 gs / s and 5 gs / s , \n respectively ) an asynchronous and of the corresponding channel trigger - valid signals is taken and then synchronized with 250 mhz system clock to give the final adc core internal trigger . \n the acquisition mode is determined by the first three bits of sis3305_event_config_adc1_4 ( 0x2000 ) or sis3305_event_config_adc5_8 ( 0x3000 ) register . in this way \n the real number of samples above / below threshold in 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes is equal to the configured value multiplied by 2 or 4 , respectively . \n the adc core internal trigger signal can be extended from its natural length of 4 ns up to 128 ns by configuring bits 14 - 10 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 ( 0x2020 ) register . \n this 5-bit word allows to modify the coincidence time window with precision of 4 ns . \n it has to be mentioned that since many firmware blocks were provided in a precompiled form we had to follow its existing design . \n in particular , the data from each adc input channel acquired at 1.25 gs / s rate are split in adc - fpga in six parallel 208.3 mhz flows . \n this architecture limits the trigger selectivity in the 2 or 4 channel interleaved modes . \n indeed , the length of trigger - valid signal from each adc channel is 4.8 ns , therefore imposing only one sample above / below threshold in one of interleaved modes ( 2 or 4 channels ) there is a probability to trigger on accidental coincidence of background hits ( whose rate @xmath10 ) in selected channels within @xmath11 ns time window of @xmath12 ) . in order to prevent this possible background the continuity of trigger condition among interleaved channels \n can be activated by an additional configuration flag . \n setting bit-15 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 ( 0x2020 ) register the difference between indexes of trigger samples within 6-sample data blocks from interleaved adc channels is checked to be not larger than unity . \n the coincidence between two adc cores ( channels 1 - 4 and 5 - 8 ) is implemented in the vme - fpga by an asynchronous and between two adc core internal trigger signals , then synchronized with 125 mhz system clock and extended to 32 ns length . setting bit-20 of sis3305_trigger_out_select_reg ( 0x40 ) register allows to route the coincidence signal onto a lemo trigger out connector . thus connecting the latter to the lemo trigger in connector and enabling the external lemo trigger in bit in sis3305_control_status ( 0x0 ) \n register and external trigger bit in sis3305_event_config_adc1_4/5_8 ( 0x2000 and 0x3000 ) register allows to measure coincidence events only . \n the coincidence interval can be configured with 4 ns steps up to 128 ns as explained above . \n similarly , bit-21 of sis3305_trigger_out_select_reg ( 0x40 ) register allows to trigger on or of two adc core internal triggers . \n this feature permits to acquire both adcs when one of two adc cores had an internal trigger . \n it has to be noticed that in this modified firmware the schmidt trigger has been removed and therefore trigger - off setting in bits 25 - 16 of sis3305_trigger_gate_gt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 and sis3305_trigger_gate_lt_thresholds_adc1 - 8 registers ( 0x2020 - 0x203c and 0x3020 - 0x303c ) are not more significant . \n moreover , the internal trigger logic in the 2 channel interleaved mode ( 2.5 gs / s ) assumes that two pairs of channels are : 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 . \n this modified firmware is available at  @xcite . \n the noise level referred to the input was measured simultaneously with signal acquisition by comparing the voltages in the samples before the signal peak to the baseline voltage . \n this was done for the full digitizer sampling rate of 5 gs / s and summing four interleaved channel amplitudes to restrict the sampling rate to 1.25 gs / s ( sis3305 digitizer analog bandwidth is 2.2 ghz ) . \n the resulted distributions are shown in fig . \n [ fig : noise_distr ] and their rms values are indicated in fig . \n [ fig : noise_rms ] . \n noise distributions as referred to input for different amplifiers measured by sis3305 2.2 ghz bandwidth digitizer in 5 gs / s mode ( left ) and 1.25 gs / s mode ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   noise distributions as referred to input for different amplifiers measured by sis3305 2.2 ghz bandwidth digitizer in 5 gs / s mode ( left ) and 1.25 gs / s mode ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]     rms of noise as referred to input for different amplifiers . \n upper points are for 5 gs / s mode , while lower points are for 1.25 gs / s mode . ] \n .[table : noise_rms]noise rms values as referred to input for different amplifiers measured with 2.2 ghz bandwidth digitizer in 5 gs / s mode compared to values declared by the manufacturer . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ] \n in many experiments the amplifier can not be installed close to the detector . \n insertion of a cable between detector and the amplifier introduces noise and signal distortions , in particular when the impedance of the cable and amplifier is not well matched . \n this is particularly important for charge and transimpedance amplifiers . \n standard broadband amplifiers featuring 50 @xmath5 input impedance are almost insensitive to the insertion of the input cable . in our application \n the presence of a @xmath131.5 m long cable is mandatory . \n hence we tested transimpedance and charge amplifiers cividec c6 and cividec cx with four different cables : 150 cm of 50 @xmath5/87 pf / m sf105 ( indicated as rg58 ) , 150 cm of 75 @xmath5/67 pf / m rg59 , 166 cm of 93 @xmath5/44 pf / m rg62 , 616 cm of 185 @xmath5/22.3 pf / m rg114 . \n the comparison of signals produced by cividec c6 and cividec cx amplifiers connected to the detector via different cables is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cable_distortion ] . \n distortion of the signal from diamond detector introduced by insertion of various cables between detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   distortion of the signal from diamond detector introduced by insertion of various cables between detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    using the cividec c6 amplifier , the insertion of a cable leads to strong signal reflections , reducing for higher impedance cables and almost absent for 185 @xmath5 rg114 cable . from this \n we deduce that the amplifier input impedance is about 200 @xmath5 . \n using cividec cx amplifier cable insertion leads to signal suppression proportional to the overall capacitance of the cable . \n indeed , the rg62 cable with 44 pf / m capacitance shows smallest suppression , while rg114 with 22.3 pf / m capacitance exhibits larger suppression because its 4 times larger length . this can be better quantified by measuring peak amplitude of the output signals as shown in fig . \n [ fig : cable_reduction ] . \n reduction of the output signal amplitude introduced by the insertion of various cables between the detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   reduction of the output signal amplitude introduced by the insertion of various cables between the detector and cividec c6 transimpedance amplifier ( left ) and cividec cx charge amplifier ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the energy resolution variations due to insertion of different cables are different for two amplifiers as shown in fig . \n [ fig : cable_resolution ] . \n cividec c6 amplifier energy resolution changes by about 10% with rg114 and rg62 cables , while no effect is observed for other cables . for cividec cx amplifier insertion of any cable leads to 30 -

{"ContextTokens": 2664, "GeneratedTokens": 326, "SynthesizedBody": "3c129 and 3c129.1 are two radio galaxies in a nearby cluster of galaxies ( fig \n .  1 ) which lies close to the galactic plane . \n we proposed chandra x - ray observations in order to find signatures of hydrodynamic interactions between the hot intracluster gas and the radio lobes and tails and to estimate the non - thermal pressures within the radio structures by determining the external gas pressure and assuming pressure balance . \n it seemed likely that given the long tail of 3c129 ( @xmath0  0.5  mpc projected length ) , that most of the source was close to the plane of the sky and that projection effects would thus be minimal . \n since tailed radio galaxies are found only in clusters of galaxies , it also seemed likely that the projected distance between the cluster center and 3c129 was not significantly less than the actual distance : 3c129 was already known to lie close to the edge of the detected gas distribution ( leahy & yin , 2000 ) . \n for these reasons , we believed 3c129 was a good target for detecting the sort of depression in x - ray surface brightness caused by cavities in the hot gas coinciding with radio lobes ( e.g. cygnus a , carilli et al . \n 1994 ; and hydra a , mcnamara et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the reason we wanted to use pressure balance between thermal and non - thermal plasmas is that this procedure provides an estimate of the non - thermal pressure which can be compared to that obtained from the usual synchrotron formulae assuming equipartition between the energies in relativistic particles and the magnetic field . \n it is then possible to evaluate the likelihood for various values of the critical synchrotron parameters . to do this confidently \n , we require that unmeasurable ram pressures be negligible and that by defining various areas of the radio source , we can infer the emitting volumes . \n we use the redshift of 3c129.1 ( z=0.0208 , spinrad , 1975 ) as the distance indicator of the cluster , and with h@xmath1=65  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , one arcsec corresponds to 450  pc . \n the x - ray emission from the cluster gas is shown in fig . \n it is relatively smooth unlike the clumpy distribution seen for the gas around the radio galaxies hydra a ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) and m84 ( finoguenov & jones , 2001 ) . \n we performed a spectral deprojection analysis ( krawczynski 2002 ) and @xmath3 model fits to the radial distributions in two pie sections are shown in fig .  2 . \n from these data we can obtain the thermal pressure as a function of distance from the cluster center which was judged to lie @xmath4 sw of 3c129.1 . \n it seems likely that the cluster has suffered a recent merger because the gas distribution is significantly elliptical ( figs .  1 and 2 ) ; the cluster contains a radio galaxy with a long tail ; and we find no evidence for a cooling flow ( krawczynski , 2002 ) ; \n the calculation of minimum non - thermal pressure involves 4 components : the assumption of equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field ; the assumption that the filling factor is 1 ; the assumption that protons do not contribute significantly to the particle energy ; and the assumption that most of the relativistic electrons have been counted when the synchrotron luminosity is integrated over some frequency range . \n if any of these assumptions are violated , the total non - thermal pressure will be greater than the minimum value .    while the usual invocation of equipartition leads to the classical @xmath5 power for the pressure s dependence on the filling factor and the proton energy density \n , we should not forget that if we were to abandon equipartition and argue that we knew the average magnetic field strength from some other method ( e.g. detection of inverse compton emission from a known photon distribution ) , then the dependence is linear . \n compare the basic equation for the total pressure with the expression for the minimum non - thermal pressure . \n @xmath6    for the field which minimizes the total pressure , b@xmath7    @xmath8^{\\frac{4}{7}}\\ ] ]    where + @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11 is the filling factor for the emitting volume , v ; k is the ratio of particle energy densities ( protons to electrons ) , and @xmath12 is the amplitude of the radiation power law : @xmath13 . \n it is also the case that various conditions can be chosen instead of the classical equipartition ( particle energy density equals magnetic field energy density ) . \n we have chosen to use the magnetic field strength which minimizes the total pressure , b@xmath7 \n . other choices which can change the value of the field by factors of up to 1.48 include assuming the field is smooth or tangled and equalizing pressures instead of minimizing the total pressure , or equalizing the energy densities instead of minimizing the total energy ( see the appendix of harris et al . \n 1995 , for further details ) . \n we have chosen regions in 3c129.1 and 3c129 on the basis of minimizing uncertainties in converting rectangular areas to cylindrical volumes and circular areas to spherical volumes ( i.e. we chose regions for which the assumption that the depth dimension can be found from transverse dimensions is most likely valid ) . these regions are shown in fig .  3 . \n flux densities for these regions were measured at 0.33 , 1.4 , 5 , and 8 ghz . \n spectral indices were determined for single or broken power laws from these flux densities as well as from spectral index maps produced by scaled arrays ( 5 and 8 ghz , taylor et al . \n 2001 ) and from the similar uv coverage of our 0.33 and 1.4 ghz data .. details of this analysis can be found in krawczynski et al . \n ( 2003 ) . \n the results are shown in fig .  4 and given in table  1 and it is immediately clear that the minimum non - thermal pressures are almost always less than the thermal pressures , and that the difference for most regions is a factor of order 0.5 .    llcll number & region & p@xmath14 & p@xmath15 & p@xmath15 + & & 10@xmath16cgs & @xmath17  hz & @xmath18  hz + 1 & 129.1 : n rectangle & 6.0 & 5.37 & 2.15 + 2 & 129.1 : n inner & 21.2 & 1.60 & 1.20 + 3 & 129.1 : s inner & 24.3 & 1.46 & 0.80 + 4 & 129 : inner arm & 3.70 & 2.08 & 1.66 + 5 & 129 : w eye & 2.26 & 3.31 & 2.36 + 6 & 129 : e eye & 2.30 & 3.45 & 2.79 + 7 & 129 : 4 am & 0.48 & 18.0 & 13.5 + 8 & 129 : 8.9am & 0.74 & 4.45 & 2.16 + 9 & 129 : 10.5am & 0.59 & 5.25 & 2.08 + 10 & 129 : 12.7am & 0.92 & 3.27 & 0.76 +    notes to table    the thermal pressures at each location use the temperature from the spectral deprojection and the density from the deprojection ( weight 2 ) and @xmath3 model fit ( weight 1 ) . \n the non - thermal pressures were calculated by selecting the magnetic field strength which minimizes the total pressure , taking the filling factor , @xmath11=1 , negligible energy density from protons ( k=0 ) ; and integrating the synchrotron luminosity down to @xmath17 ( columns 3 & 4 ) or 10@xmath19  hz ( column 5 ) . \n given the uncertainties in calculating various pressures , we find it remarkable that the thermal and non - thermal pressures are so close to each other for most of the regions selected . extending the integration of the synchrotron spectrum down to 1 mhz ( and thereby including electrons with lorentz factors in the range @xmath20  =  100 to 500 ) increases the minimum non - thermal pressures to values only a factor of two less than the thermal estimates for most regions . \n this factor of two is easy to obtain for example by invoking a value of the filling factor , @xmath21 . \n taken at face value , the small factors between the thermal and non - thermal pressures indicate that we can not accommodate large values of k ( expected if relativistic protons are present ) ; significant departures from equipartition ( as hypothesized in a different context to facilitate explanations of excess euv emission as ic emission , bowyer , this volume ) ; anomalous numbers of low energy electrons ( i.e. an excess over the extrapolation to low energies from the electron spectra inferred from the radio data ) ;

however , one of the effects of baryonic dissipation is to make dm halos more spherical than their counterparts in dissipationless simulations ( e.g. , kazantzidis et al . \n one may inquire whether the alignment of satellites along the principal axes of host halos is as prevalent in dissipational simulations . \n one might expect differences between dissipational and dissipationless simulations to be small in this regard because both the major axis and the positions of satellites reflect the directions of recent accretion along filaments and because subhalos are biased toward large halo - centric distances compared to dm ( @xmath16 ) , where the change in shape is small . \n the right panel of figure  [ f1 ] is an explicit demonstration that dissipational processes do not significantly alter the alignment of halo and satellites . \n the figure shows an analysis of the eight cluster halos of kazantzidis et al . \n ( 2004 ) simulated once with dissipationless , adiabatic gas physics and a second time including radiative cooling and star formation . \n though the inner halos in the cooling simulations are significantly rounder , the alignment of host halo and satellites remains pronounced . \n , while the _ right _ panel shows the axis ratio @xmath17 . \n each panel is a scatter plot of the axis ratios of _ all _ dm in each host halo on the _ horizontal _ axis against the axis ratios of each of the subhalo populations on the _ vertical _ axis . \n the _ triangles _ show number - weighted subhalo axis ratios and the _ squares _ represent mass - weighted subhalo axis ratios . \n all subhalos with @xmath18 are included . \n , width=415 ]    it is interesting to quantify the relationship between the spatial distributions of the smooth , dm components of host halos and the subhalos that reside within them . \n do the subhalos simply follow the triaxial mass distribution ? \n there are several potential ways to address this issue , such as computing angular correlations etc . , and i discuss two intriguing quantifications in this section . one way to address the relationship of subhalos and dm is through the ratios of the principal axes of inertia denoted @xmath19 . for subhalos , \n the inertia tensor can be computed in two ways . in the first , \n each subhalo is counted equally and in the second method , each subhalo can be counted in proportion to its bound mass . \n the result is a `` number - weighted '' inertia tensor and a `` mass - weighted '' inertia tensor . \n figure  [ f2 ] shows a comparison between the axis ratios of host dm halos using , computed as specified above , and the mass- and number - weighted axis ratios of their subhalo populations . \n the sample consists of @xmath20 hosts with @xmath21 and their subhalos simulated with the art code ( kravtsov et al . \n the particle mass is @xmath22 , the spatial resolution is @xmath23 , and each host contains @xmath24 particles within its virial radius .    the number - weighted axis ratios in fig . \n [ f2 ] show that the full number - weighted satellite populations broadly trace the dm distributions of their host halos . \n however , notice that the mass - weighted axis ratios are systematically smaller than that of the dm in the host halo . \n more massive subhalos are more strongly biased toward a flattened distribution than small subhalos , a result consistent with the studies of z05 , l05 , and a05 . \n the robustness of this result has been checked by randomly re - assigning the weights ( masses in this case ) among the subhalo populations . \n the axis ratios based on these randomized weights are generally similar to the number - weighted axis ratios shown in figure  [ f2 ] . \n this angular bias for large subhalos is not entirely surprising . \n the smallest subhalos have generally been accreted over an extended period of time and interact gravitationally as dm particles , adopting a self - consistent configuration with the host potential . \n the largest subhalos have typically been accreted more recently so they more faithfully reflect the directions of recent infall , and they tend to be more strongly biased to form in overdense filaments .    as a second comparison between substructure and smooth mass , \n consider the 2d projected fraction of mass in substructure , @xmath1 . \n this quantity is constrained by measurements of flux ratio anomalies in multiply - imaged quasar systems ( e.g. , dalal & kochanek 2002 ) , and can be used as a probe of cosmological parameters that influence the growth of small - scale structure . \n zentner & bullock ( 2003 ) and mao et al . ( \n 2004 ) have made predictions for the mean projected substructure mass fractions , with the former considering a variety of primordial power spectra and dark matter properties . in what follows \n i show the projected substructure mass fraction as a function of projection angle @xmath10 , from the major axis of the host halo . following mao et al . \n ( 2004 ) , i have computed @xmath25 as a function of projection angle using all mass and substructures within @xmath7 virial radii of the center of each host , in order to include correlated material associated with each halo . \n i projected in cylinders of radius @xmath26 , comparable to the einstein radii of strong - lens systems . \n the result is shown in figure  [ f3 ] , along with the observed @xmath27% confidence region for @xmath1 measured in quadruply - imaged systems by dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) . \n the mean substructure mass fraction is approximately @xmath28% with a large scatter , consistent with mao et al . \n interestingly , @xmath29 is @xmath30 times higher for projections near the long axis of the host . \n if elliptical galaxies are well aligned with their host halos , this result may have important consequences for determinations of @xmath1 in multiply - imaged quasar systems and several other observed properties of strong lenses . \n measured from all @xmath20 host halos , using two projections for each host . \n the _ outer _ \n errorbars represent the scatter among projections and the _ inner _ errorbars represent the estimated error in the mean of @xmath1 . \n the shaded band represents the @xmath27% confidence region of @xmath1 from the measurement of dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) . \n , width=226 ]    i am grateful to my collaborators brandon allgood , oleg gnedin , anatoly klypin , andrey kravtsov , daisuke nagai , and eduardo rozo for their invaluable contributions to this research . \n i thank james bullock , neal dalal , stelios kazantzidis , chuck keeton , ben metcalf , and jeremy tinker for helpful discussions . \n arz is funded by the kavli institute for cosmological physics at the university of chicago and by the national science foundation under grant no . \n nsf phy 0114422 .", "StartTimeOffset": 298141621662, "RequestID": "e7f6584e675ad4febb066a0e53deaf3945d377d7", "TotalTokens": 2739}

@xmath36{\\frac{6v}{\\tan \\theta } } \\\\   h&=&\\frac{l}{2}\\tan \\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 . \n it follows @xmath38 this means that the fallen sand could be stacked in a square field @xmath39 km wide ( with an area of @xmath39km@xmath40 ) , making a @xmath41 m high pyramid . as a visual reference we note that the area of the emergent of huemul island , in bariloche is about @xmath42 ha ( @xmath43km@xmath40 ) , and its height certainly less than the @xmath41 m we obtained here .      to determine the mass of sand fall , we multiply the calculated volume by the measured density , to obtain @xmath44 i.e. about 100 million of metric tonnes .      the energy required to raise this mass of sand to @xmath45 m \n can be estimated from the potential energy acquired when it reaches its maximum height . \n we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the acceleration of gravity . \n thus we have @xmath48 that is more than one thousand kilotons of tnt equivalent . for comparison , we mention that the 2011 earthquake in japan had a magnitude of @xmath49 in the richter scale@xcite and released an energy@xcite of @xmath50j ( @xmath51kt of tnt equivalent ) . \n another reference point is given by the total energy produced in a country . \n for example , the installed electric power in argentina@xcite is @xmath52mw and so , the energy produced during a day is @xmath53j . \n thus the energy released by the first phase of the eruption is equivalent to that produced in the whole country in @xmath54days . \n the magma rises through the conduit of the volcano mixed with fumes of molten rock and water vapour , which results in a turbulent two phase flow . \n the velocity of the magma exiting the crater can be coarsely estimated from the energy conservation law , since the flow , at least for the denser components , is ballistic . \n the ashes reaching the top of the column probably ascend the last section by convection . for that reason we took an average altitude of @xmath45 m , a moderate value compared to the @xmath55 m or even @xmath24 m that have been reported . neglecting air friction \n , the kinetic energy of fluid at the crater must be equal to the potential energy reached in the final ascent , @xmath56 from this it follows that @xmath57 that is , nearly the speed of sound in air . \n this high speed of the outgoing material determines its rapid cooling , which explains the amorphous structure and the presence of micro crystals in the ejecta since production of larger crystals requires slow crystallisation .      assuming that the first eruption lasted @xmath58hours , i.e. @xmath20s , it is possible to estimate the power generated by the volcano , which turns out to be @xmath59 by comparing this result with the installed electric power in argentina mentioned above \n , the ratio obtained is @xmath60 the power developed by the volcano is @xmath61 times the installed power in argentina . \n we can also compare our result with the worldwide installed electrical power@xcite , which is @xmath62tw@xmath63w . \n a percentage comparison results in @xmath64 so the power developed by the puyehue volcano is equivalent to about 2% of the global electric power . \n in the problem of piano tuners , fermi could compare the estimated result with the answer obtained from a query in the telephone directory . \n the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that some tuners had no phone or were not listed as such in the directory , or to an error in the various estimates . \n but this last point is part of the game : the idea is not to obtain an accurate result , but to reach a reasonable approximation . as such \n we understand a discrepancy not exceeding a certain limit , say half an order of magnitude , or a factor of five .    in what follows we comment on each of the scenarios we used :    1 . \n area covered . \n + in the eruption of june 4 , 2011 ash and sand covered an area larger than the one assumed in this work . \n that could mean that we underestimate the energy and power of the volcano . \n we tried to compensate for material falling beyond the chosen zone , by assuming a uniform thickness of @xmath65 cm in the reference area . \n average thickness of the layer of sand and ash . \n + it is known that in the vicinity of the volcano on the chilean side and in villa la angostura the layer of sand and ash reached @xmath66 cm , while further east it did not exceeded @xmath58 cm . \n we believe that the figure of @xmath65 cm distributed uniformly over an area equal to three times the area of the nahuel huapi lake ( over @xmath67km@xmath9 ) is appropriate as an average estimate . \n 3 .   estimated time of activity . + \n the fall of sand and ashes in bariloche ceased at 00:30 utc ( 21:30 art ) , that is the first eruption lasted five hours . \n the thunder caused by electric shock lasted a total of approximately @xmath61hours indicating that volcanic activity continued until then . \n this does not affect the estimation of the energy developed in the first five hours . \n 4 .   height reached by the cloud . \n + reports on june 4 indicated a height of the column of up @xmath24 m above sea level . \n as the column included different density components , we believe our assumption @xmath23 m for the thicker components of the plume is a reasonable estimate for our purposes . \n density of the mixture of sand and ashes . \n + the density measurement was made with a sample collected within hours of the onset of the rash . \n samples taken a few days later gave higher density values , probably because rain water dissolved or dragged away part of the components and swept them away . \n 6 .   output speed . \n + we are not aware of measurements of the output speed of the magma in the volcano being made , but specialised authors have studied the supersonic flow of magma in volcanoes in some typical situations of the so - called explosive pyroclastic eruptions ( see for example @xcite ) , as the puyehue - cordn caulle eruption of june 4 , 2011 . \n an eruption of this type occur in the year 79 of the christian era at the vesuvian volcano , inducing the tragic disappearance of the city of pompeii . \n this eruption had two distinct phases : first a _ \n phase , where material was ejected in a tall column , spread in the atmosphere and fell to earth like rain ; followed by a _ pelan _ phase where material flowed down the sides of the volcano as fast - moving avalanches of gas and dust , called pyroclastic flow ( pyroclasts are rock fragments formed by a volcanic explosion or ejected from a volcanic vent ) . \n the solution of the present problem indicates that using knowledge normally available to high school students , and introducing a series of reasonable assumptions , it is possible to solve approximately a problem resulting from a natural event that affects everyday life . \n andrew w. woods and sally m. bower , _ the decompression of volcanic jets

{"ContextTokens": 3057, "GeneratedTokens": 233, "SynthesizedBody": "whether the first direct gravitational wave ( gw ) detection will be made during the forthcoming joint ligo - virgo @xcite run , or rather will be claimed by the next generation of interferometers , the intriguing era of gravitational wave astronomy is in any case expected to begin .    in this perspective , \n spherical resonant detectors , having the capability of locating on their own the gravitational wave source in the sky , may represent an important resource for this arising discipline . \n contrarily to an interferometer , a sphere is a multichannel detector capable in principle to determine all the four parameters characterizing a gw ( two angles for the arrival direction , and the amplitudes of the two polarizations ) ; in order to deal with this distinguishing feature , several data analysis issues must be however tackled ( see @xcite- @xcite for an incomplete but elucidating historical perspective ) .    in @xcite and \n @xcite a coherent burst search algorithm has been proposed , that fully exploits the multichannel capabilities of the sphere by transforming the detector s outputs into a five - dimensional time series corresponding to the spheroidal components of the gravitational wave . \n this time series is in turn processed by a coherent , wavelet - based module @xcite ( henceforth cws , as coherent waveburst for the sphere ) generating a list of candidate burst events endowed with all the relevant parameters ( arrival time , arrival direction , amplitude , etc ... ) and is also able , to some extent , to reject non - transverse excitations ( which are surely not due to gw s ) , thus reducing the false alarm rate by a factor of about 10 . \n the reason of using wavelets rather than the traditional matched filter(mf)-ing technique is two - fold . \n mf - based searches are computationally expensive , as they require the exploration of a parameter space which is made extremely large by the presence of several channels ( for example , the multichannel mf is direction dependent , differently from the traditional single channel one ) . \n moreover wavelet - based searches , contrarily to a mf one , do not require any detailed prior knowledge of a signal , a very welcome feature for an unmodeled burst search such as the one developed in @xcite . \n + on the other hand , as the use of the mf is known to give the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite , the wavelets flexibility has a cost in term of accuracy in the determination of the burst parameters .    to this respect , \n the present work can be considered as a natural evolution of @xcite in that it implements a multidimensional coherent mf as a follow - up of the method cited above . \n this hierarchical strategy is crucial in reducing the parameters space because for each trigger only a little region is explored around the values indicated by the cws module , thus making the whole procedure reasonably fast . \n the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ apip ] the whole pipeline is briefly described , showing in particular how the mf module is interfaced to the previous part of the analysis chain ; then in section [ resu ] the improved method is tested against the same mock data sets ( software injections of signals on a background endowed with both gaussian and non - gaussian noise , generated on the basis of a numerical simulation of the relevant components of the detector ) , thus showing the improvements obtained in the parameters estimation . \n finally , section [ conc ] contains our conclusions . \n the first part of the pipeline , which is exhaustively discussed in @xcite and @xcite , will be just briefly summarized here , leaving aside many technical details . \n the first step consists in converting the six transducers outputs @xmath4 into five channels corresponding to the 5 quadrupolar modes @xmath5 of the gw tensor @xmath6 : @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the components of the real spherical harmonics @xmath10 ( defined and normalized as in @xcite ) , @xmath11 denotes the cartesian component of the tensor spherical harmonics and @xmath12 is the versor of the arrival direction of the gw . \n this conversion allows to extract the information about the gw from the detector s outputs ( or , equivalently , to express its noisy content in term of its  gw - equivalent \" ) and is possible once a mathematical model for the detector is available . in the case at hand , \n the model consists of a set of coupled oscillators describing the dynamics of the relevant sphere vibrational modes , of the transducers , and of the electrical circuit that are at the core of the readout devices ( see @xcite for details ) . \n the next step is to combine the fourier transforms of the five @xmath5 channels into a single channel @xmath13 : @xmath14 this process is performed by extracting from the dataset the spectral density matrix , defined from @xmath15 and then by building the following quantity : @xmath16    this quantity is then fed into the cws algorithm , which is a modified version of the coherent waveburst algorithm developed for ligo ( @xcite-@xcite ) , that has been adapted to our computational needs ( a standard macpro machine with two 3ghz processors ) and to our detector configuration . \n this algorithm provides a list of triggers containing the various event features ( central time of events , amplitude , arrival direction , central spectral frequency and spectral frequency spread ) . \n the trigger list is finally further refined through an independent determination of the arrival direction ( the so - called determinant method ) , and a trigger is vetoed when the two reconstructed directions are not compatible . \n to summarize : @xmath17      if the time dependence , arrival direction and polarization of the gw signal were known , that is if the expression for the five functions @xmath18 were available , the optimal detection strategy would be to perform a multidimensional matched filter . as explained in @xcite , the multichannel mf consists in analyzing the following scalar channel : @xmath19 and is the strategy which gives the optimal snr @xmath20 for the given signal @xmath21 . \n the integrals are done on both positive and negative frequencies . however , in a real experimental situation @xmath21 is not known a priori and to employ efficiently a mf one should explore a huge number of points in a parameter space describing the temporal profile of the signal , as well as the arrival direction and polarization . thus the use of a mf in such a context is computationally very demanding .    the cws method exposed in the previous paragraph has been shown to find candidate events with a good efficiency / reliability ratio , without need to know the form of the signal . \n this allows to keep under control the computation time but of course it comes at a price for what concerns parameter estimation . \n the improvement we are introducing in this work consists in performing a multidimensional mf only in the time segments where candidates events have been selected by the cws , and to restrict the analysis to a small portion of parameter space centered around the parameters provided by the cws triggers .    specifically , we consider a two parameter family of sine - gaussian shapes to describe the time profile of the signal @xmath22 \n y_{m_n}^{(2)}(\\theta,\\phi)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] impinging from the generic direction characterized by polar angles @xmath23 . \n since we have verified that the unmodeled search alone already gives a good estimation of the frequency spread @xmath24 ( an estimation which is not improved by the mf procedure ) , we kept it as fixed , in such a way that , for each candidate event we are basically exploring a small portion of the 4-dimensional parameter space @xmath25 . \n such a space is explored through a maximum - seeking algorithm , which searches for the point characterized by the maximum snr . \n we maximized first on the arrival time , as the peak of the snr is very sharp against this parameter , then on the central frequency and finally over the two angles of the arrival direction together , keeping at each stage the other parameters fixed at the value indicated by the cws triggers . \n this is a simplified choice of course , with respect to building a full parameter template bank , for instance , but it allows to obtain good results while keeping a low computational burden \n .    once found , the maximum - snr point in the parameter space defines the improved parameters of the candidate event , and if they happen to be too much different from the ones given by the unmodeled search , the event is discarded as spurious . \n this means that the mf follow - up procedure , as well as improving the events parameters , acts as a further veto against non - gw triggers , i.e. against signals which are not compatible with the transverse - traceless nature of gw s . \n such false triggers can come from gaussian noise or from non - gaussian disturbancies . \n the cws method alone is already optimized to reduce the latter s , and we will show that the application of the mf follow - up improves the performance with respect to the rejection of false triggers due to gaussian noise . \n we have tested the mf method on the triggers obtained in @xcite , i.e. 50 gw - injections , ( 25 for each polarization ) for each of the four @xmath26 amplitudes : @xmath27 and also on an equal number of non - gw injections ( signals whose power has been distributed randomly among the five sphere channels ) with the same amplitude . \n the injected signals are sine - gaussian of the same type of the matching function given in ( [ singau ] ) , this allows us to assess the precision in parameter estimation irrespectively of a mismatch between the filter and the signal in the data . \n an eventual mismatch could of course worsen the estimations , but we do not investigate here on that .    for the sake of clarity , we have reported in table [ gwnongw ] the detection efficiency for both gw and non gw - injections obtained in @xcite ; these numbers , which show that the cws alone already reduces by a factor of 5 - 10 the number of non - gaussian false triggers , have not changed in the present analysis \n .    .detection efficiency for injected gw signals and non - gw disturbances . adapted from @xcite . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n matched filtering techniques are widely used in gravitational wave analysis . however \n they can have a high computational cost , because of the possibly large volume of parameter space required by a comprehensive search . \n the case of spherical detector is even worse as its multimode feature makes it highly sensitive to the arrival direction , adding the source position in the sky as further parameter . \n + here we have shown how , in the case of burst searches , combining an unmodeled search with a matched one can exploit the goodies of both while taming the baddies of both . \n the unmodeled makes no assumption on the type of signal , but gives a non - optimal estimation of the parameters of the burst events triggered . \n on the other hand the matched filtered search is optimal once the shape of the signal is known . here \n we use the output triggers of the unmodeled search to massively restrict the search in the parameter of the best matching template ; more specifically we used a 4-dimensional parameter space ( arrival time , central frequency and source angles in the sky ) to present an example of matched filtering search . \n our search is very much simplified with respect to a general one as the parameter space is not fully explored . \n + to make a comprehensive analysis one would need template banks and systematic scanning of the parameter space , but even with this primitive attempt we have shown how the first estimate made by the unmodeled search can be improved by a very light matched filter search . \n it is a pleasure to thank m. maggiore and m. pohl for useful discussions and encouragement . \n the work of fs is supported by the fond national suisse . \n 99        c.  z.  zhou and p.  f.  michelson , phys \n .  rev . \n d * 51 * ( 1995 ) 2517 . \n e.  coccia , j.  a.  lobo and j.  a.  ortega , phys . \n d * 52 * , 3735 ( 1995 ) . \n j.  a.  lobo and m.  a.  serrano , europhys . \n lett .   * 35 * , 253 ( 1996 ) . \n t.  r.  stevenson , phys . \n d * 56 * ( 1997 ) 564 . \n s.  m.  merkowitz and w.  w.  johnson , phys . \n d * 56 * ( 1997 ) 7513 [ arxiv : gr -

{"ContextTokens": 3447, "GeneratedTokens": 119, "SynthesizedBody": "results of the ceres experiment show a significantly higher dilepton yield in the invariant mass region between about 200 and 600 mev compared to that from a hadronic cocktail based on known reaction channels . after adding in the  expected  secondary @xmath0 yield the observed yield is still underestimated by a hadronic cocktail by a sensitivity factor of about 3 . while there is also an attempt to explain these observations in terms of standard classical hadronic sources @xcite by exploiting their experimental uncertainties , most theoretical explanations invoke a change of the properties of the vector meson masses and widths . \n some of these are based on classical collision broadening whereas others involve @xmath1 mixing as a precursor to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . however , all these attempts have in common that in a first step they determine the in - medium properties in hot and dense equilibrium and then use these locally either in transport calculations or in more simplified expansion scenarios . \n the latter procedure is obviously not a - priori correct for an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision which  at least in its early stages  proceeds far away from equilibrium . \n it is worthwhile to realize that even in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions with their high peak densities about 60 % of all dileptons are produced at densities below @xmath2 ( see fig .  7 in @xcite ) \n this is so because the observed yield inherently contains an integration over the whole reaction history and thus the late stages of the reaction with high pion densities contribute via @xmath3 a significant part to the total observed dilepton yield . \n it is , therefore , intriguing to ask if other reactions involving more elementary probes on nuclei that proceed closer to equilibrium can be used to investigate the question of in - medium changes of hadronic properties . while the density in such reactions obviously is always below @xmath4 , this disadvantage may be overcome by the cleaner and more stable environment in which dilepton production proceeds in such reactions .    in this talk \n i show that indeed pion- and photon - induced dilepton production on nuclei is as sensitive to possible in - medium changes as are heavy - ion reactions . \n i will also  in the last part of this talk  show how in - medium changes of vector mesons are expected to show up not only in dilepton spectra , but also in photo - absorption processes . \n such a connection , if it can be firmly established , clearly adds to the consistency of our picture of in - medium changes of hadrons . \n details to all the points i am going to discuss in this talk can be found in a number of recent publications @xcite and in particular in the phd thesis of martin effenberger @xcite . \n the calculations shown in this talk are all based on a new development in transport theory that allows one to also tranport broad resonances . \n while former calculations ( for a review see @xcite ) had to employ simplifiying assumptions the calculations of effenberger et al.@xcite , for the first time , implemented a transport - theoretical treatment of broad mesons and treated the widths of the vector mesons consistently . \n the theoretical breakthrough here was to transport not the phase - space density @xmath5 , but a spectral phase space density @xmath6 that contains also information about the spectral function of the resonance .    in @xcite \n ( see also @xcite ) we have discussed in detail that a consistent formulation of the scattering term , that takes the spectral function of the particles into account , puts automatically intrinsically broad , collision - broadened resonances ( such as , e.g.  the @xmath7 meson )  because of their frequent decay and reformation as they traverse the nucleus  back on their free spectral function when they leave the nucleus . \n a problem arises , however , when particles with intrinsically sharp spectral functions , such as the nucleon or the @xmath8 meson , get collision broadened . \n in such a case the repetitive decay and reformation is not frequent enough so that these particles would emerge from the collision still collision - broadened . in order to surpress this unphysical behavior we introduced an ad - hoc potential that drives all particles back on mass - shell when they leave the nucleus @xcite . \n it is amusing that this potential , that we intuitively guessed in ref . \n @xcite , can  for sharp resonances , where @xmath9  actually be derived from the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite . \n the results presented here are based on this method ( for more details see @xcite ) . \n the equation of motion for the spectral phase space distribution reads @xmath10 with the spectral phase - space - density @xmath11 the spectral function @xmath12 and the usual phase - space density @xmath13 . as stressed in particular by knoll \n @xcite it is essential to maintain the consistency condition that the total width appearing in the spectral function is related to the loss - term @xmath14 in the transport equation @xmath15 since this condition presents a major consistency problem it has been fulfilled in the calculations reported here only for the vector mesons . in @xcite it was shown that the two - body collisional width does not broaden the nucleon resonances significantly . \n for all further details i refer the reader to @xcite . \n with the availability of a @xmath16 beam at gsi and the detectorsystem hades @xcite it will be possible to explore dilepton production in pion - induced reactions on nuclei . \n we have , therefore , performed extensive studies of such reactions @xcite . \n input to these calculations are cross sections predicted by the manley coupled channel analysis of @xmath17 data @xcite on which our analysis is based . \n the transport calculations allow one to follow the collision history of all vector mesons produced . with realistic @xmath18 cross sections we obtain a collision width @xmath19 of up to 500 mev for the @xmath7 meson and 70 mev for the @xmath8 , both at normal nuclear matter density @xcite . \n the overall sensitivity to these effects is about a factor 2 , which is close to the expected systematic uncertainty of these transport calculations . \n however , this sensitivity can be enhanced by performing appropriate cuts on the dilepton cm momenta . \n [ picut ] shows that with a cut that selects only slow vector mesons the sensitivity to various in - medium scenarios , in particular for the @xmath8 meson , is clearly strong enough to be seen experimentally . \n pions have one possible disadvantage for such in - medium studies : they experience a strong initial - state interaction and thus a pion - beam illuminates only a part of the nucleus . \n this is visible in fig.[pi - gamma ill ] which shows in the two lower figures the location of the first collision of the pion with the nucleons of the target ( left ) and all meson - baryon collisions ( right ) . \n the upper two figures give the same information for a photon beam . \n the left part shows clearly how the photon illuminates the whole nuclear volume and not just the surface . \n subsequent collisions remember this initial state as shown in the right part of this figure . \n thus , we expect that photon - induced experiments will be even more sensitive to in - medium changes of hadronic properties than experiments with pions .    that the theory , with the proper , consistent treatment of in - medium broadening describes the normal photonuclear processes very well is shown in a comparison with data for photo - pion , photo-2pion and photon - eta production data at energies up to 800 mev @xcite . \n we are thus quite confident that we have these photonuclear processes well under control and can thus use these methods to predict and investigate the sensitivity of photonuclear dilepton production data to in - medium changes of vector meson properties . \n photon - induced dilepton data have the problem that they necessarily contain a big contribution from the so - called bethe - heitler process in which the incoming photon radiates already a dilepton pair before any coupling to the hadrons takes place \n . as is well known , however , this contribution can be surpressed by proper kinematical cuts @xcite , both for the incoherent and the coherent part @xcite . \n [ gamdilsens ] then shows the sensitivity of the dilepton spectra to various in - medium changes of the vector mesons . \n it is immediately apparent , that this sensitivity is just as large as for the ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in particular , again the @xmath8 properties \n are reflected quite clearly in the ( still to be measured ) dilepton spectra . as in the case of pions \n one can enrich the in - medium sensitivity by making a cut on the dilepton cm momentum . \n all the in - medium effects on vector meson spectral functions are connected with a significant broadening and corresponding shift of strength to lower masses . \n this has an interesting consequence for the decay of the n(1520 ) resonance that i have already pointed out in @xcite in 1997 . according to the particle data group listing , which is based on manley s analysis @xcite in this respect , this @xmath20 resonance decays on resonance with a probability of 15 - 25 % into @xmath21 and this , even though this decay is energetically closed if one works with the pole mass of the ( broad ) @xmath7 . \n thus the decay can proceed only through the low - mass tails of the @xmath7-meson spectral function ; the rather large partial decay width in turn indicates a large coupling constant for the vertex @xmath22 . \n if the @xmath7 meson s spectral function in nuclear matter indeed gains strength at low masses then the partial @xmath7 decay width of the @xmath23 resonance would increase dramatically . \n this effect may already have been experimentally seen . the data for photoabsorption on nuclei exhibit a universal behavior that  beginning with rather small mass numbers @xmath24  scales with @xmath24 . \n this universal cross section exhibits the @xmath25 resonance  though somewhat broadened  , but the second and third resonance regions around 1500 and 1650 mev , respectively , that are well seen in photoabsorption on the nucleon , have disappeared in nuclei @xcite . \n fermi - motion alone is the more effective in smearing out resonance strength the higher the energy of the resonance is . \n this alone explains the absence of the third resonance region @xcite . \n the second resonance region , around 1500 mev , however , survives the effects of fermi - smearing . \n we have shown in @xcite that this finds a natural explanation in the opening of the @xmath7-decay channel of the @xmath23 resonance . with @xmath7 strength moving in medium down to lower masses \n the formerly nearly closed decay opens up dramatically thus leading to a very large ( several hundred mev ) total width of this resonance . \n crucial for this argument is the high partial decay width of the @xmath20 resonance into the @xmath21 channel . \n this has so far , not been directly verified by experiment ; the cited large partial decay width is based only on a theoretical coupled channel analysis @xcite . \n although it is gratisfying to see that a similar result also emerges now from the cc calculations of friman , lutz and wolf @xcite , a direct experimental verification of this decay branch would necessitate a detailed partial - wave analysis of ( @xmath26 ) reactions on the nucleon which so far does not exist . \n it is , however , encouraging , that the daphne collaboration @xcite and the taps collaboration @xcite , both at mami , have found experimental evidence for pion invariant mass spectra in such reactions that show clear deviations from phase - space . \n in this talk i have shown that pion- and photon - induced reactions show a sensitivity to in - medium changes of hadrons that is as large as that observed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . \n this result was originally unexpected because of the much lower baryon densities probed in such elementary reactions on nuclei ( @xmath27 ) , compared with those obtained in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( @xmath28 ) . \n it finds its explanation in the fact that all experimentally observed dilepton spectra contain an integration over the whole reaction history , which , in the case of heavy - ions , runs from @xmath29 to more than @xmath30 and then back down again to nearly @xmath31 while the pion- or photon - induced reaction on nuclei always proceeds close to @xmath4 , i.e.  much closer to equilibrium .    in my opinion , an unequivocal identification of the origins of changes of hadronic spectral functions observed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions \n will not be possible as long as the more elementary reactions on nuclei have not been studied as well . \n it is obvious that hadronic in - medium effects , if they are observed in such reactions at or below @xmath4 , have nothing to do with any transition to the qgp and even a possible connection with chiral symmetry restoration , a very popular keyword in this field , will be hard to establish ( of course , duality arguments can always be used to keep this connection alive ! ) . \n what we can learn , however , are interaction rates of hadrons with baryons , also for unstable hadrons , and this alone will be an exciting prospect . experiments with hades using the pion beam at gsi and experiments with photon beams , starting now with taps at mami , will help us to clarify the issue of in - medium changes of hadrons . \n for example , a close comparison of dilepton spectra obtained in pion - induced reactions with those obtained with photons should allow one to sample quite different density regions and thus in - medium effects , in particular for the @xmath8 meson . \n this is illustrated without further words in fig . \n [ spacedist ] . \n 99 v. koch , these proceedings , and references therein r. rapp , these proceedings , and references therein w. cassing , e.l . \n bratkovskaya and s. juchem , nucl -

{"ContextTokens": 3228, "GeneratedTokens": 96, "SynthesizedBody": "glassformers are dynamically heterogeneous . \n neighboring regions , nanometers in size , can have local relaxation times which differ by several orders of magnitude @xcite . \n experimental measures of heterogeneous dynamics often probe rotational degrees of freedom . \n for example , deschenes and vandenbout @xcite have measured the rotation of single probe molecules in a polymer film near the glass transition . here \n , we investigate a kinetically constrained lattice gas model with translational and rotational degrees of freedom which captures many of the essential features seen in these experiments such as stretched exponential decay of rotational autocorrelation functions as temperature is decreased and heterogeneous distributions of exchange times .    in section [ models ] \n , we present the model and the computational methods used . \n section [ hetero ] demonstrates the existence of heterogeneous dynamics . \n we also present ensemble measurements which display a precipitous dynamical slowdown and breakdown of mean field dynamical relations . \n section [ dist ] measures distributions of persistence and exchange times . \n finally , section [ exp ] compares these distributions to those observed recently in single molecule studies . \n one route to understanding dynamical heterogeneity relies on the presence of local steric constraints on the movement of particles which make themselves felt to an increasing degree as temperature is lowered ( or density is increased ) . \n the kinetically constrained lattice gas models @xcite are simple caricatures of glassformers which employ local steric constraints as their sole means to glassiness in the absence of any non - trivial static correlations between particles . \n it has been shown that , despite their apparent simplicity , these models exhibit surprisingly many of the hallmarks of glassy behavior that have been the focus of recent experimental and theoretical efforts @xcite . \n the model we study consists of hard core particles on a triangular lattice with no static interactions other than those that prohibit multiple occupancy of a single site . to each particle \n is associated a vector which can point along the six directions bisecting the triangular lattice . in other words , the vectors point toward the interstitial sites of the lattice @xcite . \n translation of particles obeys the kinetic constraints of the two vacancy assisted triangular lattice gas , or the ( 2)-tlg @xcite : a particle at site @xmath0 is allowed to move to a nearest neighbor site , @xmath1 , if ( 1 ) @xmath1 is not occupied and ( 2 ) the two mutual nearest neighbor sites of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also empty . \n these rules coincide with a physical interpretation of steric constraints on the movement of hard core particles in a dense fluid @xcite . \n rotation of particles obeys a similarly physically motivated kinetic constraint if one imagines that the particles have small hard protrusions along the direction of their orientation vector @xcite : a particle , @xmath2 , with a unit vector @xmath3 , can rotate either 60 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise provided the two neighboring lattice sites along the direction between the initial and final orientations of @xmath3 are empty . \n translations preserve the direction of @xmath3 . \n we refer to this model as the rotational tlg @xcite . due to the absence of non - trivial static interactions \n , there are no static correlations between particles . \n however , constraints on the kinetics allow non - trivial dynamic correlations to emerge in trajectory space .    in the computer simulations , we investigated particle densities , @xmath4 , between 0.10 and 0.81 on a lattice with edge length @xmath5 = 128 ( @xmath5 = 256 for @xmath4 = 0.81 ) . \n the density @xmath4 = 1 corresponds to the completely full lattice . at densities up to and including 0.77 , over 60 independent trajectories of lengths 10 - 100 times @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the time for the self - intermediate scattering function at @xmath7 @xcite to reach @xmath8 of its initial value ( see below ) , were run . at densities \n 0.79 , 0.80 and 0.81 , four to sixteen trajectories were run . \n these trajectories were stored logarithmically for later analysis ( i.e. configurations were saved after 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , etc . \n time was measured in monte carlo sweeps . during each sweep , \n particles were chosen randomly and translational and orientational moves were attempted with equal probability . for the higher density runs , \n a continuous time algorithm was used for greater efficiency @xcite . \n this algorithm involved making and updating a list of only those particles which have the possibility of either moving or rotating and choosing from among those exclusively during every move . \n the time was then incremented as one over the number of possible moves . due to the lack of static correlations , initial configurations could be generated by random occupation of empty lattice sites by particles with random orientations until the desired density was reached . \n despite the lack of static correlations between rotational and translational degrees of freedom , dynamic coupling exists via the kinetic constraints @xcite . \n a particle which can not rotate because it is sterically blocked by neighboring particles must wait for those particles to translate away before it is allowed to rotate again . in this sense \n , we expect rotational dynamics to be a good indicator of local structural relaxation in this model , as they are in experiment . \n [ probes ] shows rotational trajectories of six particles at low and high densities . \n the particles at low density ( fig . \n [ probes]a ) rotate freely , performing a random walk through all angles . at higher densities , \n the particles perform random walks punctuated by periods of little to no rotation . \n in contrast to the trajectories at low density , dynamics at high density are clearly heterogeneous : at any given time , some particles are rotating quickly while others are essentially frozen . \n similar behavior has been observed for translational motion of a probe molecule immersed in spin - facilitated models @xcite and in poilymer films @xcite . \n a useful ensemble measure of slow dynamics is the rotational autocorrelation function , @xmath9 , which indicates the time it takes for a particle to lose memory of its initial spin orientation @xcite . here , the angled brackets denote an average over all particles and times , @xmath10 . a plot of @xmath11 is shown in fig . \n [ corr]a . at low densities \n , relaxation shows a simple exponential profile . as density increases , \n the curves become more and more stretched exponential indicative of averaging over multiple relaxation timescales . \n this stretched exponential decay is what one would expect qualitatively from rotational trajectories such as those depicted in fig . \n [ probes]b . \n an important quantity that can be extracted from @xmath11 is the rotational correlation time , @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 . \n the inverse of this timescale is the rotational diffusion constant , @xmath14 . \n translational relaxation is often studied via the self - intermediate scattering function , @xmath15 = @xmath16 . here \n , @xmath17 denotes the position of particle @xmath2 at time @xmath10 . \n the decay of the scattering function to @xmath8 at wavevector @xmath18 is typically defined to be a structural relaxation time , @xmath6 , as it gives a sense of how density fluctuations relax at relatively short lengthscales . \n dynamic behavior at large lengthscales is studied via the self - diffusion constant , @xmath19 , extracted from the mean - squared displacement , @xmath20 = @xmath21 . \n the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath19 , is defined as @xmath22 . \n we omit further discussion of these quantities as they have been presented at length elsewhere for this @xcite and other models @xcite . \n an important ramification of heterogeneous dynamics is the breakdown of mean - field dynamical relations such as the much studied stokes - einstein ( se ) relation @xcite . in a system with homogeneous dynamics such as a normal liquid \n , we expect relaxation behavior to be similar at all but the smallest lengthscales . in a glass \n , the presence of dynamic heterogeneity implies that such mean - field relations can be violated . in fig . \n [ corr]b , we plot the rotational diffusion constant , @xmath23 , and the self - diffusion constant , @xmath19 , versus the translational structural relaxation time , @xmath6 . \n rotational diffusion tracks structural relaxation whereas self - diffusion does not . \n that is , @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 . \n the same trend has been seen in experiment @xcite . \n the scaling of @xmath23 with @xmath6 can be rationalized qualitatively from the idea mentioned above that the ability to rotate is intimately tied to local structure . \n = 0.50 , 0.60 , 0.65 , 0.70 and 0.75 . \n the inset to ( a ) shows the exchange time distributions as a function of linear time , @xmath10 , as opposed to logarithmic time to emphasize the emergence of broader long time tails as density is increased . \n the two distributions are related via @xmath26 . \n the solid lines in ( b ) are the distributions of persistence times calculated from the distributions of exchange times via eqn . \n [ jungeq ] and the open circles are results of direct calculations.,width=480 ] \n direct measures of heterogeneous dynamics in glassy systems are distribution functions of persistence , @xmath27 , and exchange , @xmath28 , times @xcite . \n persistence times measure the first instance of a change in state given an initial configuration . \n exchange times measure the duration of particular states . \n for example , the distribution of rotational persistence times , @xmath29 , in this model is the distribution of times , given an initial configuration , when a particle changes its rotational state for the first time . \n the distribution of rotational exchange times , @xmath30 , is the length of time a particle remains in a particular rotational state . \n these distributions are multi - point functions because they depend not only on two points in time , but on all intervening points as well . \n [ trans]a and fig . \n [ rot]a show the distribution of exchange times for translational and rotational motion , respectively . \n distributions of exchange times are important for understanding the origin of dynamical decoupling phenomenon @xcite ( see fig .  [ corr]b ) . \n , except for rotational times.,width=480 ]    the distribution of exchange times for translations and rotations are very similar . \n there is very little change in short time structure as @xmath4 increases . \n evidence of broadly distributed dynamics occurs in the long time tails . \n the distributions of persistence times for translation and rotation are also qualitatively similar and display the same features noted in previous studies @xcite . \n differences in structure between rotational and translational persistence can be attributed to the differing kinetic constraints . \n a particle can have the ability to rotate while being constrained translationally and vice versa . \n recently , it has been shown that the distributions of exchange and persistence times are related via the equation @xcite : @xmath31 the constant of proportionality is fixed by normalization . \n this should be a general relation independent of the model or observable studied . \n the solid lines in fig . \n [ trans]b and fig . \n [ rot]b show the distribution of persistence times calculated via equation ( [ jungeq ] ) . \n the open circles are the results of direct calculations . \n we see that equation ( [ jungeq ] ) is well - satisfied . \n recent single molecule experiments determined distributions of rotational exchange times by following the dipole of embedded dye molecules @xcite . near the glass transition temperature , \n the absolute value of the rate of angular change , @xmath32 , showed abrupt changes between different dynamical environments . \n we can anticipate from fig . \n [ probes]b that the same quantity in the rotational tlg will show similar behavior . from this quantity , \n deschenes and vandenbout extracted a distribution of exchange times using a standard deviation criterion @xcite . here , we examine to what extent the distribution of times measured in this way corresponds to the distribution of rotational exchange times defined in section [ dist ] .    in fig . \n [ experiment]a , we plot @xmath33 where @xmath34 for the rotational tlg at high density . \n deschenes and vandenbout assigned an exchange event whenever the average angle jump changed by more than two standard deviations from the previous average angle jump . \n due to the coarse grained nature of the rotational tlg , @xmath35 changes by discrete jumps . \n therefore , exchange events can be unambiguously assigned whenever such a jump occurs . \n [ experiment]a plots @xmath36 in increments of ten sweeps during a portion of a single molecule trajectory . \n the fastest exchange event measurable at this time resolution is 10 sweeps . with infinite time resolution , however , we see that the definition of exchange times used in section [ dist ] would correspond precisely with the deschenes - vandenbout procedure . \n we verify this in fig . \n [ experiment]b . here , \n the distribution of times obtained via the deschenes - vandenbout procedure outlined above ( open circles ) @xcite are compared to the distribution of rotational exchange times calculated in section [ dist ] ( solid line ) . \n the comparison is very good for about ten orders of magnitude . \n this method overestimates the distribution at early times for the reasons of time resolution mentioned in the previous paragraph . \n the inset shows a comparison of the distribution of rotational persistence times . \n the open circles are obtained from the open circles in the main panel of fig . \n [ experiment]b via equation ( [ jungeq ] ) . \n once again , the agreement is very good . in particular , the data obtained via the procedure of deschenes and vandenbout captures the structure and location of the main peak . \n single molecule experiments also measured the mean rotational exchange times , @xmath37 ( i.e. the first moment of @xmath30 , fig . \n [ rot]a , inset ) , as a function of temperature . \n it was found that @xmath37 scaled with temperature in the same way as @xmath12 , the rotational correlation time , and that @xmath37 was 10 - 20 times larger than @xmath12 at a given temperature @xcite . \n our calculations indicate that @xmath38 or , using the definition that @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 . \n the rotational correlation time , @xmath12 , scales like the structural relaxation time : @xmath41 @xcite . \n that is , @xmath37 exhibits a much weaker dependence on temperature than @xmath42 similar to what is found in spin - facilitated models @xcite . \n we also find that @xmath37 is as much as six orders of magnitude times smaller than @xmath12 at the highest densities . \n this difference with experimental findings is most likely due to the issue of time resolution mentioned earlier and also discussed in @xcite which biases experimental measures of @xmath43 to longer times . \n the author would like to acknowledge david chandler , juan garrahan and younjoon jung for valuable discussions and the us national science foundation and department of energy ( grant no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3406, "GeneratedTokens": 239, "SynthesizedBody": "after more than a half - century of study , the basic physical processes that are responsible for heating the million - degree corona and accelerating the supersonic solar wind are now beginning to be pinned down . \n different mechanisms are probably dominant for different regions ( see reviews by * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n for example , it seems increasingly clear that bright euv and x - ray loops are heated by small - scale , intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by the continual stressing of their magnetic footpoints @xcite .    for the open - field regions that link the corona and the solar wind , \n there is still disagreement about the relative contributions of different processes ( see   4 below ) . \n however , we are rapidly approaching a time when these processes can be included in self - consistent models that can make testable predictions . \n this paper attempts to summarize some recent work that is helping us to bring observations and theoretical models to the point of straightforward comparison and testing . because the coronal magnetic field varies so substantially both as a function of position ( on the sun at any one time ) and as a function of time ( over the solar cycle ) , there is always a broad range of solar wind source regions available for comparison with model predictions . in some ways , \n these variations give us something approaching the turnable `` parameter knobs '' of a laboratory experiment . \n this paper emphasizes the example of differences between the previous solar minimum ( 19961997 ) and the present minimum ( 20072009 ) . \n the most definitive link between a particular type of coronal structure ( measured via remote sensing ) and a specific type of quasi - steady solar wind flow ( measured _ in situ _ ) is the connection between large coronal holes and high - speed streams @xcite . \n coronal holes are generally interpreted as bundles of open flux tubes that flare out superradially with increasing distance . \n observations from the uvcs instrument on _ soho _ suggest that the range of heights over which the wind s acceleration occurs in coronal holes can vary greatly , even when the wind at 1 au is identically fast @xcite . \n the denser slow - speed solar wind appears to come from many different coronal sources . \n two regions that are often cited as sources of slow wind are : ( 1 ) boundaries between coronal holes and streamers , and ( 2 ) narrow plasma `` stalks '' that extend out from the tops of streamer cusps ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n however , during active phases of the solar cycle there is evidence that slow wind also originates in small coronal holes and active regions @xcite . \n the remainder of this paper will discuss the fast solar wind that emerges from polar coronal holes at solar minimum @xcite . \n however , as the soho23 meeting has demonstrated , not all solar minima are created equal . \n the morphology of the coronal magnetic field exhibited some interesting differences from the previous minimum to the present minimum . \n polar coronal holes on the disk in 20072009 are smaller in area ( by about 15% ) in comparison to those from 19961997 , and their mean photospheric magnetic fields are lower by about 40% as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) . the magnetic field measured at 1 \n au is also lower , but by only about 20% @xcite . \n the streamer belt observed in the extended corona has a broader latitudinal extent than it did in 19961997 @xcite . \n it is likely that this is the result of two contributing factors . \n ( 1 ) the weaker polar field does not exert as much transverse pressure , which acts to confine the streamer belt to low latitudes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n ( 2 ) there are more small and transient coronal holes at low latitudes during the present minimum ; these can also deform the streamer belt . \n some likely consequences of the above differences in the coronal magnetic field are discussed below . \n low - density coronal holes exhibit a complex array of plasma parameters due to their nearly collisionless nature . as a result \n , every particle species evolves towards having its own unique temperature , its own type of departure from a maxwellian velocity distribution , and its own outflow speed . \n remote - sensing measurements of the low corona ( i.e. , @xmath01.3 @xmath1 ) and the extended corona ( @xmath2 to 10 @xmath1 ) , as well as _ in situ _ particle and field detection in the heliosphere ( @xmath3 ) , can be combined to follow this evolution . \n the extended corona is particularly important to study in this regard , since it is not only where most of the wind s acceleration occurs , but it is also where many plasma species undergo their transition from collisional to collisionless dynamics ( see * ? ? ? \n as an example of how different types of measurements can help paint a more complete picture , figure 1 shows temperature measurements in polar coronal holes from the last solar minimum in 19961997 . \n the one - fluid temperatures shown at the lowest heights come from semi - empirical ( * ? ? ? \n * dashed curve ) and theoretical ( * ? ? ? \n * solid curve ) models of the photosphere , chromosphere , and low corona . \n electron temperatures in the low corona were measured by sumer/_soho _ and reported by ( * ? ? ? \n * black bars ) and ( * ? ? ? \n * gray bars ) . \n uvcs - derived proton temperatures in the extended corona are also shown ( * ? ? ? \n * triangles ) with an attempt to remove the model - dependent alfvn wave broadening . \n perpendicular temperatures of a representative minor ion ( o@xmath4 ) are shown from sumer measurements at low heights ( * ? ? ? \n * open circles ) and uvcs measurements in the extended corona ( * ? ? ? \n * filled circles ) . _ in situ _ electron and proton temperatures in the fast wind ( dotted and dot - dashed curves , respectively ) are taken from @xcite . \n the detailed radial dependences of minor ion temperatures have not yet been precisely measured _ in situ , _ but the gray region above shows a likely range of values for the abundant o@xmath5 ion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n coronal holes tend to exhibit preferential ion heating ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) that primarily occurs in the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) . \n because of these departures from thermal equilibrium , the fast solar wind is an optimal `` proving ground '' for studies of collisionless kinetic processes that many believe are the ultimate dissipation mechanisms of coronal heating . \n it was noticed several decades ago that the damping of ion cyclotron resonant alfvn waves could naturally give rise to the observed plasma properties ( see reviews by * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n however , many other dissipation processes have been proposed as well , and they often involve multiple steps of energy conversion between waves , reconnection structures , and other nonlinear plasma features . \n taking all of the above complexities into account and producing a self - consistent model of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration ( for all particle species ) has still not been accomplished . however , if an assumption is made to consider only the _ total _ energy content of the plasma  and not its `` partitioning '' into protons , electrons , and other ions  then the problem becomes more tractable . at this level of detail , \n there are two general types of physics - based model that attempt to explain the overall flows of energy :    1 . \n there are _ wave / turbulence - driven _ ( wtd ) models in which open magnetic flux tubes rooted to the photosphere are jostled by convection , leading to waves that propagate up into the corona . \n these waves ( usually alfvn waves ) are often proposed to partially reflect back down toward the sun , develop into strong mhd turbulence , and dissipate over a range of heights . \n these models also tend to explain the differences between fast and slow solar wind _ not _ by any major differences in the lower boundary conditions , but instead as an outcome of different rates of lateral flux - tube expansion over several solar radii @xcite . \n 2 .   there are _ reconnection / loop - opening _ ( rlo ) models in which the flux tubes feeding the solar wind are influenced by impulsive bursts of mass , momentum , and energy addition . \n there is often assumed to be strong coupling between closed , loop - like magnetic flux systems ( that are in the process of emerging , fragmenting , and diffusing across the surface ) and the open flux tubes that connect to the solar wind . \n these models tend to explain the differences between fast and slow solar wind as a result of qualitatively different rates of flux emergence , reconnection , and coronal heating at the basal footpoints of different regions on the sun @xcite . \n @xcite presented a set of wtd models in which the one - fluid equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation were solved simultaneously with transport equations for alfvnic and acoustic wave energy . \n the coronal heating rate was computed self - consistently from a phenomenological description of turbulent dissipation of partially reflected alfvn waves ( see also * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n it is important to note that these models were run with lower boundary conditions in the optically thick solar photosphere , and _ not _ in the transition region ( tr ) or low corona . \n thus , the properties of the chromosphere , the height of the tr , and the mass flux of plasma entering the solar wind were all computed robustly and consistently in these models . \n the @xcite models of polar coronal holes produced conditions at 1 au that appeared consistent with fast solar wind measurements at the 19961997 solar minimum . \n more recently , we computed a new set of wtd models that were designed to correspond to the 20072009 solar minimum \n . the _ only change _ made to the models was in the radial dependence of the imposed magnetic field strength . \n the @xcite magnetic field profile was multiplied by a smooth function constructed to produce the following effects : ( 1 ) no change to the @xmath81 kg field strength in the intergranular flux tubes in the photosphere ; ( 2 ) a 40% reduction in the field strength at the base of the corona ( @xmath9 ) to account for the lower polar field strengths measured by low - resolution magnetograms ; and ( 3 ) an 18% reduction in the field strength in interplanetary space from one minimum to the next ( see , e.g. , * ?

which kinds of fluctuation modes ( i.e. , linear or nonlinear ; alfvn , fast , or slow ; high @xmath17 or high @xmath18 ) are most important ? what frequencies dominate the radially evolving power spectrum ? what fraction of the interplanetary solar wind comes from filamentary structures such as coronal reconnection events and/or plumes and jets ?    answering the above questions involves moving forward in both the theoretical and observational directions . a key step to making further progress \n is the ability to include both the wtd and rlo processes in existing 3d numerical simulations of the sun - heliosphere system . \n some recent progress in producing computationally efficient approximations to the rates of wtd wave reflection has been reported by @xcite and @xcite . \n studies of the connection between the evolving `` magnetic carpet '' and the open flux tubes that feed the solar wind are also ongoing . \n the plasma parameters of both the major species ( protons , electrons , and he@xmath19 ) and minor ions are not yet known in coronal holes to the accuracy required to determine the relative contributions of the proposed physical processes . \n as figure 1 shows , even quantities as basic as the ratio @xmath20 are not yet known with sufficient accuracy because measurements of the proton and electron temperatures have not yet been made over the same ranges of heights . \n minor ion measurements need to be extended to a larger number of ions ( i.e. , a wider range of ion cyclotron frequencies ) so that the ultimate kinetic damping mechanisms of waves and turbulence can be determined ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n also , we do not yet have a good enough observational `` lower boundary condition '' on the energetics of waves and turbulence in the photosphere . \n existing measurements of the sun s convective granulation with sub - arcsecond spatial resolution need to be matched by sub - second _ time resolution , _ so that the power spectrum of the motions of small - scale magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. , g - band bright points ) can be extended to higher frequencies .", "StartTimeOffset": 339570856932, "RequestID": "44d7ad406955cf28b6c68a02e0f9feb00104f71c", "TotalTokens": 3645}

mass late - type donor transferring mass onto a neutron star at a rather high rate . \n the modulation arises from x - ray heating of the donor star , which also manifests as narrow emission lines of niii and ciii moving in phase with the donor star @xcite . \n @xcite obtained the period of @xmath0days quite remarkably by examining archival photographic plates from 1889 to 1974 . \n a sinusoidal modulation of full amplitude around 0.20.3mag was found in several independent datasets , with considerable scatter around the mean curve @xcite . \n while the long baseline of photographic observations defined the period to incredible precision , the sparse sampling left a plethora of aliases , and @xcite identified strong signals at one - day , one - month , and one - year aliases of their favored period . \n of these , the one - year alias has been by far the hardest to reject . \n several subsequent photometric studies reproduced the modulation , but none improved the ephemeris , or resolved the one - year alias issue @xcite    spectroscopic confirmation of this period was suggested by @xcite and @xcite , and demonstrated conclusively by @xcite , who found a period of @xmath1days , and again by @xcite . \n both of these works performed a period search on the data , but in both cases the frequency resolution was limited by only observing over a baseline of a week . \n other spectroscopic analyses of these and other data have also found variations at this period , @xcite , but no other groups have performed a rigorous independent period search . \n several groups also searched for the orbital period in x - ray data , with initially no success @xcite . \n the only positive detection of an orbital period in x - rays came from @xcite based on a multi - year _ \n rxte_/asm dataset . \n they did not find exactly the @xcite period , but instead the one - year alias ( 0.78893days ) with a modulation around 1% . \n given the intensive multi - year coverage of _ rxte _ this is surprising , since this dataset should not be susceptible to the one - year alias problem . \n @xcite therefore claimed that their period was the true orbital period and that @xcite had misidentified the alias . \n while this result was tantalizing , @xcite could not reproduce this period using a larger _ rxte _ dataset . \n they did , however , not use as sophisticated an analysis as @xcite , leaving open the possibility that the x - ray period could be real . \n surprisingly , then , fifty years after discovery of the prototypical lmxb sco  x-1 , there remain doubts about its most fundamental parameter , the orbital period . \n while the original optical ephemeris of @xcite has remained the standard reference for the 37years since its publication , it remains to be resolved whether this , or the x - ray period of @xcite , is the true orbital period . to attempt to resolve these questions , and update the ephemeris of sco  x-1 with modern data , we examine here archival photometry from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) \n this nine year dataset has both the long baseline to determine a precise period , and coverage of a large enough fraction of a year to finally break the one - year alias problem using optical data . \n the all sky automated survey ( asas ) monitored sco  x-1 from 2001 to 2009 @xcite . we note that while sco  x-1 was not included in the asas catalog of variable stars ( acvs ) its photometry is in the asas-3 photometric @xmath2 band catalog in two datasets , 1619551538.4 and 1619551538.5 . \n the sco x-1 datasets include 640 observations from 2001 january 22 to 2009 october 5 . with multiyear coverage spanning typically about 270days of the year , it is ideally suited for obtaining an updated ephemeris and breaking the one - year alias . \n we performed our analysis for a range of choices of data grades and apertures to optimize our filter criteria . for final analysis , we retained the 567 grade a or b observations , and used the smallest asas aperture . \n inclusion of grade c or worse data , or use of larger aperture data , significantly reduced the quality of the fits . \n to determine the orbital period we performed a sinuoidal fit to the data points . since the scatter around the model is dominated by intrinsic flickering rather than photometric uncertainties , we assigned a mean uncertainty of 0.30mag to each point to represent the flickering . \n this was chosen to produce a minimum @xmath3 equal to the number of degrees of freedom . \n we then evaluated sinusoidal fits over a range of trial periods . for each period the best - fitting mean magnitude , amplitude , and phasing were determined using the downhill simplex algorithm @xcite . \n we show the results in the vicinity of the disputed periods in fig . \n [ periodfig ] .     as a function of trial period for sinusoidal fits to asas data . \n we show the @xcite period of 0.787313days and the @xcite period of 0.78893days for comparison . \n we also show calculated one - year aliases of the preferred period at 0.78562 and 0.78901days . \n the @xcite period is strongly favored by the asas data . while some signal is seen at the alternative periods , all are rejected at greater than 5-@xmath4 confidence.,width=336 ]    we see that the @xcite period is reproduced exactly to within the limits of our frequency resolution . our formal best period is @xmath5days . \n the uncertainty quoted is a formal 1-@xmath4 error determined from the @xmath6 confidence range in period . \n we verified the uncertainty using the bootstrap method with 30 resamplings of the data . \n this gave a consistent 1-@xmath4 uncertainty ( @xmath7 ) . \n we also show the period of @xcite , and the one - year aliases with which they associated it . \n we find that none of these alternatives are consistent with the asas data , and all can be rejected at better than 5-@xmath4 confidence . \n we therefore can not directly improve on the period of @xcite using the asas data , which is not surprising as that used data drawn from nearly a hundred year baseline . \n we can , however , overcome the limitation of that dataset in its vulnerability to one - year aliases , as the asas data has much wider coverage within a year . \n using the same @xmath3 approach , we determine a mean time of minimum of @xmath8 . \n this corresponds to an offset of very close to 17057 cycles from the time of minimum of @xcite . \n if we project their time of minimum forwards we predict @xmath9 , with equal contributions to the uncertainty from their time of minimum ( quoted as 0.022 cycles ) and their period ( @xmath10days ) . \n our time of minimum is completely consistent with theirs ( a remarkable testament to the accuracy of their historical ephemeris ) , but at this point our modern measurement of the time is somewhat better constrained for use with modern data .    finally , we show in figure  [ lightcurvefig ] the asas lightcurve folded on our derived ephemeris , together with the best fitting sine wave . \n the mean @xmath2 band brightness is 12.63 , and the full - amplitude is 0.26mag , comparable to that found by @xcite and @xcite . \n we have established that in optical photometry the 0.787313day period produces a stable modulation over 120years of observation . \n the ephemeris of @xcite reliably and precisely predicts the time of minimum in the asas data , over 17,000 intervening cycles . \n it is hard to imagine any clock other than the orbital period providing this stability . \n this has to be the true orbital period . \n the question then arises as to what , if anything , @xcite detected . \n we of course should allow that it was a spurious detection , until it can be reproduced with data from the remainder of the _ rxte _ mission . \n @xcite failed to reproduce it , but also did not use all the techniques that @xcite used . associating it with an alias of the true orbital period seems unlikely , as _ \n rxte_/asm data on sco  x-1 are rather well sampled through the year ( just as asas data are ) \n .    one possible explanation might be if the x - ray signal came at the beat frequency between the orbital period and a superorbital period of around a year . \n many x - ray binaries have indeed shown super - orbital periods of tens to hundreds of days ( see e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) , although typically all are shorter than a year . \n the only claim of such a long period in sco  x-1 , came from early _ \n rxte_/asm data , from which @xcite suggested a 37day period . \n this detection has not been sustained in subsequent data , and no super - orbital period was found by @xcite in _ swift_/bat data . on longer timescales , @xcite and @xcite both independently suggested a @xmath11year x - ray modulation is present in _ rxte_/asm data , although this is too long to account for the @xcite period . \n this explanation therefore seems unlikely , and it remains to be seen if the x - ray period can be reproduced from the full _ rxte _ mission - long dataset . \n we have analyzed asas data of sco  x-1 spanning nine years . \n we can confirm the period of @xcite , while rejecting its one - year aliases , and also the putative x - ray period of @xcite . \n our updated ephemeris is @xmath12 .", "StartTimeOffset": 367141062342, "RequestID": "8fad4b38c7d81dedba738744b6cd2b980d5881b5", "TotalTokens": 2385}

perturbatve part of our calculations . \n hence we use the low energy dy data in the region where the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is much smaller than its invariant mass q. the reason is that the css formalism describes the production of dy pairs better in the central rapidity region @xcite . \n the e288 data from the @xmath86 process at @xmath87 @xmath2 with @xmath88 is a good case with those properties . by accessing to the tmdpdfs we are able to calculate the related cross section in dy process . using the e288 experimental data , \n we do the fitting and obtain the values of the non -

mass boson at the nlo approximation . \n the goodness fitting with @xmath91 and finding for @xmath0 a value within the acceptable range indicates that the blny parametrization is suitable to describe low energy events . \n we use the obtained numerical results for the unknown parameters and plot the related dy cross section . \n we then compare the result with the available experimental data and depict them in fig.2 for @xmath86 reaction at @xmath87 @xmath2 with @xmath88 . as can be seen a good consistency \n is existing between them . \n we considered the evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function for up quark in css formalism up to nnlo approximation which can be easily extended to obtain the tmd pdf for other quarks by similar calculations . \n in particular , we have used the tmd evolution kernel at nnlo approximation which to our knowledge , has not been done before . \n we also indicated that one can directly relate qcd observables to the underlying dimensional transmutation parameter of the theory , @xmath0 . \n we extracted the @xmath0 within the appropriate range of perturbative qcd and showed that the tmd formalism is a powerful tool to analyze perturbative and non - perturbative effects in cross section spectra of dy process . \n the result of global fit showed that the blny parametrization is a good one for the non - perturbative part of cross section and the css formalism can formulate and describe properly the e288 experimental data ( for low energy drell - yan process ) . \n the calculations for dy cross section can be extended to the nnlo approximation which we hope to report them in our further research activity . \n employing the experimental data for dy cross section at high energy scales is also a valuable task to increase the precision of our fitting which can be done in future . \n r.t and a.m acknowledge andria signore which provided us the package of pdf collinear and thanks s.atashbar tehrani for useful discussions .    99 p. j. mulders and r. d. tangerman , nucl . \n b 461 ( 1996 ) 197 [ erratum -

{"ContextTokens": 3362, "GeneratedTokens": 178, "SynthesizedBody": "at high density , normal hadron matter has been predicted a deconfined transition , where quark - gluon plasma is formed . \n this could have important consequences for compact stars , with central densities several times the nuclear saturation density . \n ever since strange quark matter(sqm ) , a conglomerate of up , down and strange quarks , has been suggested as a possible absolutely stable or metastable phase of nuclear matter@xcite , it has been speculated that strange stars might exist in the universe@xcite . \n the studies that quark interactions within lowest order perturbative qcd were considered in the mit bag model also predicted that sufficiently heavy strangelets might be absolutely stable@xcite . \n if the sqm hypothesis is correct then some ( perhaps all ) pulsars may be strange stars@xcite . \n thus it would have obvious implications for our understanding of pulsars if strange stars could exist . \n it is an important subject that probing possible observational evidences of the existence of strange stars by astrophysical investigations . \n since self - bound of sqm due to strong interaction is very important , the mass - radius relation of the assumed strange stars has been uncovered to be different from that of neutron stars . however , for the canonical mass of @xmath0 , gravity dominates the strong interaction which leads to strange stars and neutrons being similar in size@xcite . \n therefore , the attempt to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars for given observed masses and radii of pulsars seems to have encountered with great difficulties . \n strange stars could indicate the distinguishable signal from neutron stars by their cooling properties , but the difference in the cooling behavior of strange stars and neutron stars will disappears if the direct urca process is operating in the core of an neutron star , which is done either by the proton fraction rising above @xmath1 @xcite or by hyperons being present in the core of a neutron star@xcite . \n this would make it difficult to identify a strange star from cooling data . \n ever since andersson realized that the r - modes are unstable at all rates of rotation in perfect fluid stars@xcite , a series of papers have investigated the many implications for gravitational radiation detection and the evolution of pulsar@xcite . in recent years \n , several crucial issues regarding the astrophysical relevance of the r - mode instability have been investigated . \n key results concern the interaction between oscillations in core fluid and the crust@xcite , the role of the magnetic field@xcite superfluidity@xcite and the effect of exotic particles that are thought to exist in the deep neutron star core@xcite . \n meanwhile , @xcite has pointed out that the r - mode instability may provide the means to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars . \n the main reason for this is that the viscosity coefficients are rather different in these two cases . \n while the shear viscosity of a strange star is comparable to that of a neutron star , the bulk viscosity would be many orders of magnitude stronger than its neutron star counterpart . \n this has interesting effects on the r - mode instability . \n based on the characteristic r - mode instability window of strange stars , which is related to the gravitational wave emission and the viscosity , a few mechanisms have been discussed to explain the clustering of spin - frequencies of lmxbs@xcite . \n however , the bulk viscosity coefficient in madsen s studies takes the one for the case of non - interacting quark gas in mit bag@xcite . \n in fact , if the interaction among quarks is considered , the bulk viscosity increases , which is calculated by @xcite . as we will show in the following , the r - mode instability window for strange stars will be significantly modified , when the improved bulk viscosity is adopted .    as demonstrated blow \n , we find the r - mode instability window is evidently narrowed due to the inclusion of medium effect(interactions among constituent particles ) . \n the medium effect makes the lowest critical spin frequency rise to 558hz from about 300 - 400hz(for the case of free quark gas ) . \n the limiting period of 1.78msec corresponding 558hz is closer to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known ( with the periods of 1.56msec and 1.61msec ) than the periods of 2.5msec and 3msec given by madsen . \n in addition , if it could be established that rapidly spinning pulsar are strange stars , the pulsar data would put certain constraints on the model parameter , namely the current mass of strange quark mass @xmath2 . as we can see in madsen s article@xcite , in the normal and especially in the 2-flavor color superconducting phase ( 2sc ) case , \n the theoretical results is not consistent with the pulsar data when @xmath3mev . \n however , when we taking the medium effects into account , the constraints to @xmath2 from pulsar data appears to be deeply relaxed , and we will show that @xmath2 can be taken as 100mev in this article . \n this paper is organized as the following . in section 2 \n , we recall the bulk viscosity of interacting quark matter and compute the damping time scale on r - modes . in section 3 , we give the improved critical curve(spin frequency ) in spin frequency(@xmath4)-temperature(@xmath5 ) plane . in section 4 , we give a summary . \n ever since @xcite pointed out that strange quark matter is characterized by a huge bulk viscosity relative to nuclear matter , some investigations have tried to calculate the relevant viscosity coefficient of sqm@xcite . in a mit bag model \n , it is thought that the exact solution had been obtained by madsen@xcite . however , he ignored the coupling among quarks in the bag , which had been considered in the study of the equation of state of sqm@xcite . soon before , we found the coupling s effect on the bulk viscosity leads to an increase of the viscosity over an order of magnitude although the medium modifications of the equation of state of strange quark matter was proven to be small@xcite . \n to very good approximation , the relevant bulk viscosity coefficient still takes the form formulated by @xcite : @xmath6 but here @xmath7 and @xmath8 were given by @xcite , which are extremely differing from madsen s and strongly depending on the coupling constant of strong interactions among quarks . \n we expressed them as @xmath9 @xmath10 ^{2}{\\rm ( s}^{-2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 was given in the references@xcite . \n the bulk viscosity is expected to be the dominated internal fluid mechanism in hot compact stars . \n the timescales for the bulk viscosity damping of r - modes need to be estimated . since the coupling of the r - modes to bulk viscosity vanishes in the lowest - order expression , the derived timescales must be based on the fully self - consistent second - order calculation of this coupling . \n the earlier estimates ca nt gain this end@xcite . \n but it has been completed by @xcite . \n we substitute our viscosity for the given low - t limit(@xmath13 ) into the formula(6.2)given by @xcite , and find the only difference comparing to the early calculation is the change of the viscosity coefficient . \n thus , we can immediately obtain the timescale by a simple comparison instead of the repeat of the complicated calculations @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote temperature in units of @xmath18 k and the current mass of strange quark in units of 100 mev , and @xmath19 is the mean density of the star . \n evidently , @xmath20 is determined with the chemical potential @xmath21 , which can be obtained by solving the equations related to chemical equilibrium , electric charge neutrality and conservation of baryon number for given @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 here , @xmath27 denotes the baryon number density , and @xmath28 is the particle number density . \n @xmath29 is the energy per baryon and we approximately take it as the mass of a neutron in our calculation .    the coupling @xmath30 will extremely influences the solutions of the above equations . \n following @xcite , @xmath30 is taken as a free parameter ranging from 0 to 5 and the equations(6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8) are solved numerically . \n figure 1 shows @xmath20 as a function of @xmath22 for different @xmath30 and @xmath31mev . \n the time scales depend on @xmath30 remarkably while they are nearly independent of @xmath22 . \n the time scale for @xmath32 arrives at tens of times shorter than the case of @xmath33 . for a strange star with mass @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km \n , we find @xmath20 ranges from 4.24@xmath36s@xmath37 to 1.53@xmath38s@xmath39 . \n this is of great interest because this will significantly increases the critical rotation angular velocity for the onset of r - mode instability . \n the r - mode unstable ( or stable ) regime of the relativistic stars , neutron stars as well as strange stars , depends on the competition between the gravitational radiation and various dissipation mechanisms . to plot the instability window of r - mode or gain the critical rotation frequency for a given stellar model as a function of temperature , we need to acquire the characteristic timescales , damping and growing timescales of r - mode instability . due to \n the emission of gravitational waves , the r - mode grows on a timescale @xmath40 where @xmath41 is @xmath42s for @xmath43 polytropic eos , which was respectively studied by @xcite and @xcite . for the viscous damping timescales , we shall also consider the shear viscosity besides bulk viscosity discussed in the last section . in strange stars , the time scale for the shear viscous damping \n is given @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is @xmath46s corresponding to @xmath43 , @xmath47 is the strong coupling and we take @xmath48 in following calculation@xcite \n .    we can now evaluate the critical spin frequency as a function of temperature from the equation @xmath49    figure 2 shows the regions of r - mode ( in)stability in spin frequency - temperature(@xmath50)plane for a strange star with mass @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km . \n the shading between the two curves displays the effect of the medium modification of quark masses on critical rotation frequencies . \n the medium effect narrows the r - mode instability window . \n the dotted curve corresponds to @xmath33 , reduced to the madsen s result@xcite , and @xmath32 is assumed in the upper contour(the solid curve ) . \n the upper contour has a lowest limiting frequency denoted by @xmath51 as 558hz(the corresponding period is 1.78msec ) , which is more close to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known , with frequencies of 642hz and 622hz ( the periods are 1.56 and 1.61msec ) , than the period of 2.5msec . \n this implies a strange star would slow down by gravitational wave emission when it reaches the instability window and spin around in 1.78msec instead of the 2.5@xmath523msec expected by madsen . \n figure 3 shows the results for 2sc stars . \n similar to figure 1 , the medium effect also increases the critical rotation frequency of 2sc stars , but it should be stressed that the medium effect leaves the most rapidly stars away from the instability window . \n figure 4 depicts the instability windows where the current mass of strange quark takes 100 mev . \n if the rapidly rotation pulsars could be regarded as strange stars , the medium effect would relax the stringent constraint on the choice of qcd parameters in contrast to the non - interacting medium case , for example , the 2sc stars for smaller current mass @xmath53 can safely exist due to the medium effect(see the upper dashed curve in figure 4 ) . \n we apply the bulk viscous coefficient including medium effect to reevaluate and discuss the viscous damping time . \n the time greatly depends on the strong coupling @xmath30 . \n we find the time scale @xmath20 , rather than non - interacting perfect fluid where @xmath20 is constant(the fact is that @xmath20 versus @xmath19 slowly increases for non - vanishing @xmath53 as shown in figure 1 ) , weakly decreases with increasing mass density of stars for the given larger @xmath30 . \n therefore , the medium effect due to strong interactions among quarks adds the viscous dissipation of instability modes . for a star with @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km \n , we numerically calculate the critical spin frequency as a function of temperature . \n the medium effect lead to a significant lift of the critical frequencies . \n we find that the largest critical period is reduced to 1.78msec from 2.5msec , appearing to be more close to the two most rapidly spinning pulsars known . \n we also study the 2sc stars and give our improved scenario . \n the current mass of strange quark in the model have a broader range taking the medium effects into account . \n finally , it should be mentioned that we here only consider weak coupling of strong interactions among quarks in mit bag . \n the long range unperturbation interactions are contained in the usual bag constant . \n although the mit bag constant is able to contribute to eos of sqm , the long range effects on dynamical quantities , such as viscous coefficient etc . \n , seem to be ignored due to the hiding of the microscopic processes into the bag constant . \n if the processes can be taken into account , we may conjecture that the limiting spin of strange stars would shift further upward . \n this is our future work . \n we would like to thank the partial support by national natural science foundation of china under grant no . \n 10175026 and natural science foundation of ccnu .    99 alcock c. , farli e. and olinto r. , 1986 , , 310 , 261 . \n andersson n. , 1998 , , 502 , 708 andersson n. , kokkotas k.d . and \n schutz b.f . , 1999 , , 510 , 846 andersson n. , kokkotas k.d . and stergioulas n. , 1999 , , 516 , 307 . \n andersson n. , jones d.i . \n , kokkotas k.d . and stergioulas n. , 2000 , , 534 , l75 . \n andersson n. and comer g.l . , 2001 , , 328 , 1129 . \n andersson n. , jones d.i . and kokkotas k.d . \n [ astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3499, "GeneratedTokens": 256, "SynthesizedBody": "the efficiency of transport systems has been of interest in various fields , including physics , biology and engineering . in transport processes , \n the item being transported usually follows the steepest descent of the underlying surface , e.g. , water flowing down the slopes of a mountain . \n flow in networks has been modeled by toroczkai et al . \n @xcite by the introduction of local gradients on a substrate network \n . the gradient network defined on this network has provided significant insights into the dominant structures that provide transport efficiency . \n they have considered a fixed network of @xmath0 nodes with a scalar potential , @xmath1 at each node @xmath2 . \n the gradient @xmath3 of the potential at each node @xmath2 is a directed edge which points from @xmath2 to the neighbor with the minimum potential among all the neighbors of @xmath2 . \n toroczkai et al have shown several properties of gradient networks which we briefly summarize . \n an interesting topological property of the gradient network is that its in - degree distribution is scale - free for both scale - free ( sf ) and erds - rnyi ( er ) substrate networks  @xcite . \n a gradient network with a non - degenerate potential distribution , is a group of trees , hence no loops exist in this network other than self - loops . \n only this property makes the gradient networks very common in seemingly unrelated problems , i.e. , synchronization in oscillatory networks @xcite . \n the relationship between network topology and congestion has also been investigated @xcite by introducing a measure of congestion , the jamming coefficient . \n this measure involves the ratio of the number of nodes that receive at least one gradient link , @xmath4 and the number of nodes that send a link . by definition \n , every node sends one out link , therefore the number of senders in the network , @xmath5 . \n the jamming coefficient is    @xmath6    the operations @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the statistical averaging over local potentials and networks respectively . \n maximal congestion occurs at @xmath9 , and no congestion occurs when every link receives a gradient link , corresponding to @xmath10 . \n it was also found that @xmath11 is independent of number of nodes @xmath0 for scale free substrate network , and these networks are not prone to maximal jamming . \n the jamming coefficient was extensively studied by park et al . \n @xcite where they compared it for er and sf networks with the same average degree , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 . with randomly assigned potentials on each node , below @xmath14 \n , they found that er networks are less congested than sf networks .    here \n we introduce a monte carlo optimization scheme that reduces jamming significantly and introduces structural correlations into the system that are not built in . \n the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : opt ] we introduce the algorithm for optimizing jamming coefficient that is initially calculated from randomly assigned scalar values at each node . \n we compare the optimized jamming values of a scale - free network and an erds - rnyi network for various values of average degrees . in section  [ sec : structure ] \n we investigate the structure of the optimal gradient network . \n in particular we study the degree distribution and the correlations between the degree and the potential of each node . finally in section  [ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications and the possible extensions of optimal gradient networks . \n previous work  @xcite has focused on random gradient networks where the potential on each node has a randomly assigned value . \n more generally , the potentials can be a dynamic quantity evolving in time due to perturbations , sources and sinks internal and external to the system of interest . \n alternatively , the potentials can evolve to become correlated to the network properties such as its degree distribution . \n for example , consider the networks of routers where every router has a capacity . \n if a router is central and highly connected , it usually has a higher capacity in order to handle the traffic en - route effectively . \n recently , a congestion aware routing algorithm has been introduced where the transport on the network of routers is driven by congestion - gradients @xcite .    here \n we develop a monte carlo algorithm to achieve two goals : reduce jamming in the network , and observe the emerging optimal correlation between in - degree and potential of each node . for a given network and potential distribution , we redefine j in eq . \n [ eq : jam ] as @xmath15 where @xmath16 by definition . \n the initial potential distribution is chosen from a gaussian distribution , and at each iteration the potential of a random node is modified such that global congestion is reduced . \n we use a metropolis algorithm @xcite with the following steps :    1 .   pick a node , @xmath2 at random . \n 2 .   vary @xmath1 by @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath17 is a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath19 . \n 3 .   recalculate @xmath11 with @xmath20 . \n 4 .   accept @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 . \n go to step 1 , and repeat . \n the fictitious temperature , @xmath23 is chosen to adjust the acceptance ratio to about 40% . \n we perform the optimization procedure until @xmath24 equilibrates , i.e. , at large @xmath25 the time autocorrelation function of @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath26 } { [ \\langle j^2 \\rangle - \\langle j \\rangle^2]},\\ ] ] goes to zero .    using the described optimization algorithm \n , we can significantly reduce the jamming coefficient in both sf and er networks . following previous work @xcite we choose as the sf network a barabsi - albert model  @xcite . for this network \n the average connectivity is @xmath27 where each node has at minimum @xmath28 links . \n the network size throughout the paper is chosen to be @xmath29 . \n for the er networks , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability of having a link between any pair of nodes . \n we use the same @xmath12 when comparing the two types of network by adjusting @xmath28 and @xmath31 . \n the evolution of jamming coefficient during optimization is shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] as a function of algorithmic time in units of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) for @xmath32 . at @xmath33 \n ( see also inset of fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] ) , the sf network has a higher jamming coefficient , but after roughly 50000 mcs , the sf network becomes less congested compared to the er network . \n the initial and final jamming coefficients for the two networks are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . \n , as a function of time in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) for sf ( @xmath38 ) and er ( @xmath39 ) networks with the same average degree , @xmath40 and @xmath29 . \n as shown in the inset , sf network with random potential distribution has a higher jamming coefficient at @xmath33 compared to the er network . \n after optimization is completed , however , optimal sf network has a lower jamming coefficient.,width=321 ]    we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the difference in jamming between sf and er networks for random and optimal networks respectively . for a given network with @xmath12 , @xmath41 \n is calculated initially at @xmath33 and @xmath42 at @xmath43 after optimization is completed , for @xmath44 . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , @xmath45 for @xmath46 whereas @xmath47 indicating that sf networks have a lower jamming coefficient after optimization , a result significantly different than those for random gradient networks @xcite .     for various @xmath48 for random ( @xmath39 ) and optimal ( @xmath38 ) gradient networks . \n @xmath49 for all simulated @xmath50 indicating that optimal sf networks have a lower jamming coefficient than optimal er networks.[fig : fig2],width=321 ] \n as shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] congestion can be reduced in gradient networks by varying the potentials at each node . \n it is reasonable to expect that the obtained optimal potentials may also alter the structure of the gradient network . \n next , we analyze the structural properties of optimal gradient networks such as the degree distribution . previously , the random gradient network of an er substrate network was shown numerically and analytically @xcite to have an in - degree distribution of @xmath51 . \n however , the sf substrate network with degree distribution @xmath52 , was shown to have a gradient degree distribution of @xmath53 . \n the degree distribution of the random and optimal er and sf networks are shown for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) respectively in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] along with the expected scaling exponents for the random gradient networks of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n the statistical averaging is obtained over 100 networks . for er networks \n , the scaling region extends with higher average connectivity , however we chose to use a small @xmath55 for which optimization is more efficient . \n the optimization is performed for 1 million monte carlo steps . \n the jamming values initially are 0.62 , 0.71 and after optimization reduce to 0.36 , 0.60 for sf and er respectively . \n the in - degree distribution , @xmath60 , for the sf network varies significantly with the optimization . \n the cut - off degree is reduced an order of magnitude ( from roughly 100 to 10 ) compared to the random one , and the scaling is now steeper . on the other hand , the er network does not show a major change in the degree distribution .    , for gradient networks of ( a ) sf and ( b ) er networks with @xmath56 and @xmath54 respectively before ( @xmath39 ) and after ( @xmath38 ) optimization of jamming . \n the dashed lined indicates the scaling of @xmath61 from ref . \n @xcite , where @xmath62 and @xmath58 for random sf and er networks respectively . \n the scaling exponent @xmath63 is not a good fit for optimal sf data but a good fit for optimal er network . \n [ fig : fig3],width=321 ]    next , we analyze the probability distribution of potentials for nodes in the substrate networks with degree @xmath64 , before and after the optimization to observe any degree - potential correlations . the results are shown in fig .  [ \n fig : fig4 ] for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) . to reduce noise in the data especially for large values of @xmath64 , \n the degrees are binned into four groups : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . before optimization with initial random gaussian potentials within range [ -4 , 4 ] \n , each set has the same probability distribution @xmath69 as shown in the inset of fig  [ fig : fig4 ] . \n this behavior is expected as no correlation was built in between the degree of a node and its potential . after the optimization \n however , the range of the potentials has broadened significantly , and the nodes with high degree have accumulated very large potentials .     for sf network with @xmath70 before ( inset ) and after optimization . \n the degrees are binned to indicate the correlation between degree of a node and its potential : @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath39 ) . before the optimization @xmath69 \n do not show any correlations with @xmath64 , however after the optimization , nodes with high degree , get the large values of potential which facilitates reduced jamming . \n [ fig : fig4],width=321 ]    with the improved jamming coefficient , it is natural to expect some correlation to emerge between the potential of the node and its degree \n . if the node has a large degree and a small potential , this node will be preferred by most of its neighbors for sending an out link , and thus this will contribute to higher jamming . \n however if the potential is large , the neighboring nodes will not prefer this highly connected node and thus not increase the jamming . \n this intuitive observation implies the possibility of obtaining a reduced congestion by starting with potentials that are inversely correlated with the degree of each node on the substrate network . \n we tested this case for the sf network ( @xmath56 ) with a correlated potential distribution , @xmath75 at node @xmath2 with degree @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a random number chosen from a uniform distribution . \n this assignment with correlations built - in did not make the jamming coefficient lower . on the contrary it was higher , @xmath78 , than the value without degree correlation , @xmath79 . \n an interesting observation that fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] provides is that nodes with small degree carry potentials distributed over a large range @xmath80 $ ] . \n for example , nodes with degrees , @xmath81 have a roughly gaussian potential distribution . \n for higher @xmath64 , the distribution narrows down and shifts toward larger values . for nodes with @xmath82 , \n all nodes have large potentials , within range @xmath83 $ ] . \n this observation might explain why in the test case the jamming was actually higher when the degree was correlated with the potential . \n in that case , we only assigned low potentials to low degree nodes which still yields congestion much higher than the optimal one . an analytical formulation that distributes the potentials according to its degree mimicking the transitive behavior in fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] seems possible , but is beyond the scope of this paper . \n we have introduced a monte carlo method to optimize congestion in random gradient networks . previously the potentials have been assigned randomly and was shown that er networks had lower jamming coefficient below @xmath55 than sf networks with the same connectivity @xcite . \n this was puzzling as the connectivity commonly observed in natural and man - made networks  @xcite is usually in this range , but tends to be scale - free , and in scale - free networks jamming is independent of @xmath0 . with the monte carlo based optimization scheme we optimized jamming by varying the potentials so that optimal congestion was achieved . \n we found that optimal sf networks have lower congestion factor for @xmath46 . \n this reduced congestion is the result of a complex correlation between the degree and the potential of a node . \n we found that nodes with large degrees in the substrate network get large positive values whereas nodes with small degrees get a gaussian like distribution of potentials .    throughout the paper \n we have used the definition of jamming introduced in ref . \n @xcite for a substrate network with unweighted links . \n a natural extension of this work for generality is to assign weights to links and redefine the jamming coefficient accordingly . \n a possible definition is @xmath84 \\big ) / \\sum_i c_i$ ] where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the number of neighboring links node @xmath2 has , @xmath87 is the capacity of node @xmath2 , @xmath88 is the weight of the incoming link from j to i , and the operation @xmath89 = 0 $ ] if @xmath90 . \n if the weights and capacity of all nodes are 1 , then this definition of @xmath11 reduces to the one in eq . \n [ eq : jam ] without the averaging . with this definition and the optimization method introduced in the paper , it is possible to study real world networks and get insights to the dominant structures of transport for these systems . \n the author thanks adilson e. motter for useful discussions and suggestions , gregory johnson and frank alexander for the careful reading of the manuscript . \n this work was carried out under the auspices of the national nuclear security administration of the u.s . \n department of energy at los alamos national laboratory under contract no.de-ac52-06na25396 and supported by the doe office of science ascr program in applied mathematics research .", "StartTimeOffset": 393360375996, "RequestID": "97ac24ec81a27a27c5f368e77442c3387da49db3", "TotalTokens": 3755}

ion scattering was theoretically investigated as early as 1905 when langevin calculated the drift velocity of ions in a buffer gas . \n the langevin model is based on classical mechanics and the predicted cross section is @xmath29 , leading to an energy independent collision rate constant . \n langevin - type collisions occur in close encounters between an atom and ion when the impact parameter is below a critical value @xmath30 @xcite and exhibit a large momentum transfer between the atom and ion . \n going beyond the langevin model , the quantum mechanical description of scattering yields the angular dependence of the differential cross section in more detail . in the energy range under consideration , elastic scattering from the polarization potential \n involves several partial waves since the s - wave scattering regime of atom - ion collisions is only at sub - microkelvin temperatures @xcite . \n the semi - classical approximation of the full quantum mechanical elastic scattering cross section for a collision energy @xmath31 is @xmath32 @xcite ( @xmath14 denotes the reduced mass ) . \n this includes in particular a large contribution towards forward scattering under very small angles @xcite , mainly from the centrifugal barrier .    to study collisions between the ion and atoms in a bose - einstein condensate \n we first produce a bose - einstein condensate inside the ion trap . to this end \n we load the neutral atoms into an optical dipole trap formed by two crossed laser beams operating at 935 nm wavelength centred onto the ideal position of the ion while the ion is displaced by 140@xmath14 m along the x - direction . \n each of the beams is focused to a waist of approximately 70@xmath14 m and powered by up to a few hundred milliwatts . in the dipole trap \n we perform evaporative cooling by lowering the laser intensity to reach bose - einstein condensates of @xmath33 atoms . \n the final trap frequencies of the optical trap are @xmath34hz , @xmath35hz , @xmath36hz . \n we apply a homogeneous bias magnetic field of less than 1 g to prevent depolarization of the neutral atomic sample .     for neutral atom loss . each data point \n is averaged over approximately 40 realizations and the statistical error is given . the bare atom loss rate without the ion present has been subtracted . \n data taken from reference @xcite . ]    [ figurecooling ]    in order to observe interactions between an ion and a bose - einstein condensate we quickly move the pre - cooled ion over a distance of @xmath37 m into the center of the bose - einstein condensate . \n the potential depth of the optical dipole trap is 1@xmath14k which is less than the vibrational level spacing of the ion trap potential . \n therefore , every collision will result in a neutral atom loss . \n we monitor this loss as a function of the interaction time . \n the data are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] . from the decay of the atom number we estimate the cross section for atom loss to be @xmath38m@xmath39 . \n we have time - resolved the dynamics of the immersion cooling process by immersing a hot ion directly into the bose - einstein condensate . \n for this measurement we partially suppress precooling of the ion in the neutral thermal atom cloud by displacing the ion along the diagonal ( * x+y*)-direction . as a result , \n the initial temperature of the ion is approximately 4k . \n then we quickly move the ion into the bose - einstein condensate , wait for a variable interaction time , release the neutral atoms , and measure the ion s temperature using a fluorescence method @xcite ( see figure [ figurecooling ] ) . \n the fluorescence method , even though limited in its temperature resolution , is a reliable and independent method in this temperature range . \n we observe sympathetic cooling of the ion in a bose - einstein condensate on a time scale of a few tens of milliseconds . \n after 60ms the ion has reached a temperature of @xmath40k , corresponding to a temperature as low as our resolution limit . \n charge exchange is one of the most fundamental reaction processes in atom - ion scattering . \n most recently , with the progress into the regime of cold collisions , theory @xcite and experiments @xcite on charge exchange have regained significant attention . in our case , \n the rb ( @xmath41 ) atom in the hyperfine ground state @xmath42 and the yb@xmath7 ( @xmath43 ) ion in the electronic ground state @xmath44 collide in the excited a@xmath45 singlet or the a@xmath46 triplet state of the ( rbyb)@xmath7 molecular potential . \n the electronic ground state @xmath47 , which asymptotically corresponds to rb@xmath7 ( @xmath48 ) and neutral yb ( @xmath49 ) , lies 2.08ev below . \n the most striking experimental observation of a charge exchange process is the disappearance of the yb@xmath7 fluorescence which we detect after the interaction with the neutral atoms . \n we have performed an energy - resolved study of the charge exchange reaction rate by tuning the kinetic energy of the ion @xcite . to this end \n we apply a homogeneous electric offset field @xmath50 to the ion trap and induce excess micromotion of the ion with an energy @xmath51 . \n we have calibrated this energy using the same laser fluorescence technique that we employed to monitor the ion s temperature during sympathetic cooling . for two different isotopes , @xmath52yb and @xmath6yb \n , we find the rate constant to be independent of the collision energy , as predicted @xcite ( see figure [ chargeexchange ] ) . \n the average rate constants of @xmath53m@xmath54/s and @xmath55m@xmath54/s are five orders of magnitude smaller than in the homonuclear case @xcite and of the same order of magnitude as predicted for the similarly asymmetric system ( naca)@xmath7 @xcite . because of an additional systematic error between the measurements for the two isotopes of 15@xmath56 , due to uncertainty of the density determination of the thermal cloud , the difference of the rates for the two different isotopes is statistically not significant .    measured ion loss probability as a function of offset electric field . each data point \n is averaged over approximately 100 repetitions of the experiment . \n the dashed lines show the average of the data . \n data taken from reference @xcite . ] \n charge exchange can occur by emission of a photon ( radiative charge exchange ) or as a nonadiabatic transition between molecular levels . for low temperatures , \n radiative charge exchange has been predicted to be the dominating process for ( naca)@xmath7 @xcite . in order to investigate the reaction products of the charge exchange process we perform mass spectrometry . to this end , we load two yb@xmath7 ions into the ion trap and overlap them with the neutral cloud . in the cases in which only one of the two ions undergoes a reaction , the other ion serves to identify the reaction product by measuring a common vibrational mode in the ion trap @xcite . \n we excite the axial secular motion of yb@xmath7 by applying intensity modulated light at 370 nm at an angle of 60@xmath57 relative to the symmetry axis of the paul trap and monitor the fluorescence . \n the frequency of the intensity modulation is swept linearly from 30khz to 55khz in 2.5s . \n when the intensity modulation coincides with a collective resonance of the secular motion , the ions are heated and the fluorescence reduces ( see fig . \n [ massspectrometry ] ) . \n the collective mode for a rb@xmath7 and a yb@xmath7 ion in the trap is @xmath58 above the bare yb@xmath7 mode at 42khz , whereas the mode of ( rbyb)@xmath7 and yb@xmath7 would be @xmath59 lower in frequency . in the 486 cases in which one yb@xmath7 ion is lost , we find approximately 30@xmath56 probability for the production of cold rb@xmath7 and @xmath60 for a complete loss . \n if the reaction products take up 2ev as kinetic energy in a non - radiative charge exchange they would be lost due to the finite depth ( @xmath61mev ) of our ion trap . \n we have not observed the formation of a charged molecule in this process . \n * a ) * ion crystal of two yb@xmath7 ions . \n * b ) * a dark ion has been created . \n * c ) * mass spectrometry signal together with dashed lines indicating the expected frequencies . \n the black trace corresponds to two yb@xmath7 ions . for one rb@xmath7 ion and one yb@xmath7 ion ( red curve ) \n the collective mode frequency is higher . \n no signals at the resonance for yb@xmath7 and ( rbyb)@xmath7 were obtained . \n mass spectrometry data taken from reference @xcite . ] \n in conclusion , we have demonstrated the successful realization of a hybrid system of a single trapped ion and a quantum degenerate atomic gas . we have observed elastic collisions between the atoms and the ion leading to sympathetic cooling of the ion in an ultracold neutral environment . \n moreover , we have observed charge exchange reactions between a single ion and ultracold atoms and analyzed the reaction products . \n our results provide an excellent starting point for future experiments targeting local probing of atomic quantum fluids with a single particle and the full quantum control of chemical reactions at the single particle level . \n we thank epsrc ( ep / f016379/1 , ep / h005676/1 ) , erc ( grant number 240335 ) , and the herchel smith fund ( c.s . ) for support . \n 10 url # 1#1urlprefix[2][]#2 yarmchuk e  j , gordon m  j  v and packard r  e 1979 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 43 * 214                                        epstein r  j , seidelin s , leibfried d , wesenberg j  h , bollinger j  j , amini j  m , blakestad r  b , britton j , home j  p , itano w  m , jost j  d , knill e , langer c , ozeri r , shiga n and wineland d  j 2007 _ phys . \n a _ * 76 * 033411", "StartTimeOffset": 415508824230, "RequestID": "b70ef8d4cb3a31f60071ac18737fabbd10b1fe02", "TotalTokens": 4165}
{"ContextTokens": 3836, "GeneratedTokens": 357, "SynthesizedBody": "the most intriguing question regarding the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) at present would be how massive is the black hole in each ulx .    known to be very bright extragalactic x - ray sources ( @xmath12 ) , brighter than the ever - known galactic x - ray sources , ulxs are good candidate to prove the existence of the hypothetical new class of black holes , the intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , whose masses range over @xmath13  @xmath14 @xmath15 ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; @xcite ) . \n if we simply assume @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath18 for @xmath19 erg s@xmath20 . \n this provides strong support to the imbh hypothesis . \n the success in fitting the spectra of several ulxs with a multicolor disk blackbody ( dbb ) and a power - law ( pl ) model further supports the idea of imbhs for the ulxs , since the cool inner disk temperatures and the large innermost radii , obtained through model fitting , suggest a black hole mass within the imbh range ( miller et al . \n 2003,2004 ; @xcite , @xcite ) . \n moreover , the explanation behind the imbh notion for ulxs is based on the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , a well - established model for high - energy release mechanism through gas accretion flows around a compact object .    on the other hand \n , some attempts have been made to challenge the imbh interpretation of ulxs ( king et al . \n several models have been proposed to allow stellar - mass black holes to power ulxs . \n in fact , such attempts are very reasonable since the existence of stellar - mass black holes is well founded while imbh formation has not been well understood ( e.g. madhusudhan et al . \n 2006 ) .    amongst several models proposed , \n a model of super - critical accretion flow onto a stellar - mass black hole has been quite favorable recently ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n one attractive model supporting a super - critical accretion flow onto a stellar - mass black hole is the slim disk model ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) introduced in the late 1980s by the warsaw and the kyoto groups ( @xcite , 1989 , see @xcite for a review ) . \n its application to some galactic black holes was investigated by watarai et al . \n ( 2000 ) in their attempts to explain the nature of some bright x - ray source binaries . \n later on , watarai et al . \n ( 2001 ) also proposed the slim disk model for ulxs . \n the black - hole mass mentioned above was estimated from an x - ray spectral fitting in which the innermost radius , @xmath21 , was assumed to coincide with that of the last stable circular orbit , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for a non - rotating black hole , where @xmath7 [ @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius ) . \n this assumption has been proven to be good for the cases of galactic black hole binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n however , numerical calculations have shown that as mass accretion rate increases , the flow inside @xmath25 might produce significant emission ( @xcite ) . \n the heat generated near @xmath25 is trapped by the inward material flows , and is emitted inside @xmath25 . \n some amount of the trapped radiation going closer to the black hole is swallowed . \n therefore , since the situation is more complicated in high mass accretion rate systems , we can not simply relate the innermost radius from the fitting with the last stable circular orbit . \n indeed , watarai and mineshige ( 2003a ) have stressed that the observed value of the inner edge of the disk is more like a radiation edge , outside of which substantial emission is produced . in this work \n , we investigated the assumption @xmath26 for the super - critical accretion flows around a non - rotating black hole and calculate corrections to make more accurate black - hole mass estimations . \n the plan of this paper is as follows :    we describe the disk structure and spectrum calculations in the first two subsections in section 2 , and the fitting model , together with the conventional method to derive black hole mass from the fitting in the remaining subsection .    in section 3 \n , we present our fitting analysis and results , while focusing on some sets of parameters . \n section 4 is devoted to a discussion , and finally section 5 concludes the paper . \n to avoid confusion , we will first describe the overall picture of our methodology which is also summarized in table 1 . \n the detail steps in the fitting are explained in another section ( section 3 ) . \n the main steps of our methodology are as follows : we first calculate the disk structure for various values of black - hole mass , @xmath3 , and the mass - accretion rate , @xmath4 ( subsection 2.1 ) . \n next , we use the outputs from the disk structure calculation to obtain the spectra ( subsection 2.2 ) . \n we follow the calculation by watarai et al . \n ( 2005 ) for both steps . \n we then fit those spectra with the extended dbb model and derive the black hole mass , @xmath5 from value of @xmath21 obtained from the fitting ( subsection 2.3 ) . \n that is , we assume @xmath26 as that of the dbb model . finally , we obtain the correction factor , @xmath8 , the ratio of the actual black hole mass to the derived black hole mass ( subsection 3.2 ) . \n .the overall picture of our methodology . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n we have analyzed the assumption @xmath26 for black hole mass estimation for the case of super - critical accretion disk . \n we fitted the slim disk spectra for various parameter combinations ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) , with the extended disk blackbody model . \n we fixed @xmath30 in the disk structure calculation , and chose @xmath31 for the spectrum calculation . to estimate the black hole mass , we adopt @xmath32 . \n as expected from a theoretical point of view , we obtained @xmath2-values that deviate from 0.75 , the value expected for the standard disk model . \n moreover , we found that by adopting , the assumption @xmath26 for a slim disk , the estimated black hole mass should be corrected . \n the correction factors are 1.2  1.3 and 1.3  1.6 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . \n since the corrections are small , we can safely conclude that the black holes in ulxs which vierdayanti et al . \n ( 2006 ) analyzed are stellar - mass black holes with mass @xmath11 . \n we gratefully thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions concerning the first manuscript of this paper . \n this work was supported in part by the grants - in - aid of the ministry of education , science , culture , and sport ( 14079205 , 16340057 s.m . ;

induced splitting kernels . in the framework of @xmath0 we present all splitting kernels keeping the full emitted parton energy fraction @xmath1 dependence , which is consistent with the power counting of our effective theory . \n the momentum of the @xmath2channel gluon mode that mediates the elastic scattering of jets off of the qgp quasiparticles can vary from @xmath3 for static source to @xmath4 for soft source @xcite . \n we refer to gluons with momentum scaling of both of these modes as glauber gluons , even though traditionally under this name the former mode is understood . \n both modes are off - shell and from effective theory point of view the role of these modes is to provide interaction with the potential created by the source . \n thus , the appropriate treatment for such interaction would be a term in the lagrangian coupled with background vector potential . \n this has been done in ref . \n @xcite for a collinear quark field and extended in ref . \n @xcite for a collinear gluon field interacting with external vector potential . \n the details of this extra term in the lagrangian that needs to be added to scet depend on the gauge fixing condition and the underlying assumption on the momentum scaling of the source field that produces the elastic scattering . \n different gauges and different choices of scaling for the source have been considered in ref . \n @xcite . assuming static quark center with momentum scaling of hqet field , i.e. @xmath5 for the source and a particularly simple gauge choice , where glauber gluons are quantized in the covariant gauge and collinear gluons are quantized in the light - cone gauge , which we call the hybrid gauge , \n we get the following effective lagrangian of @xmath0@xcite : @xmath6 the first term in the second line describes elastic scattering of a collinear quark field off of the scattering center and the second term describes elastic scattering of a collinear gluon field off of the scattering center in the medium . \n note that different collinear sectors with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 separated in the transverse direction are coupled through this term . \n with the effective lagrangian of @xmath0 at hand , it is a straightforward task to calculate the medium - induced splitting kernels . \n we consider an initial quark or gluon with momentum @xmath9 splitting into two partons with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath10 , where the splitting energy fraction is defined as @xmath11 . \n we use the following momentum assignment to partons in the splitting : @xmath12 , i.e. for example when we refer to @xmath13 splitting we have in mind that a quark with momentum @xmath9 splits into a quark with momentum @xmath7 and a gluon with momentum @xmath10 . \n we thus have four possible splittings : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n the final partons are taken to be on - shell : @xmath17 . \n the light - cone vector @xmath18 is aligned with the initial parton , so that by definition @xmath19 and thus @xmath20 . \n the diagrams in the medium that need to be evaluated are presented in figure [ fig1 ] . \n the result of applying the feynman rules of @xmath0 and evaluating single and double born diagrams along with longitudinal integrals can be expressed through four transverse momenta which we define as : @xmath21 after a straightforward though lengthy calculation we obtain the following result for arbitrary medium - induced splitting@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the elastic scattering cross section of the parton in the medium and as suggested by notation the phases @xmath24 are independent of the splittings . \n they are equal to :    [ fig2 ]    @xmath25    the coefficients @xmath26 and the scattering lengths @xmath27 in fact depend on the splitting . \n the scattering lengths are equal to the gluon scattering length @xmath28 for splittings @xmath13 and @xmath29 and the quark scattering length @xmath30 for the splittings @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n the coefficients @xmath31 for the @xmath13 splitting are equal to : @xmath32 and for three remaining splittings they all have been calculated and can easily be extracted from ref . \n the vacuum splitting functions @xmath33 are well known @xcite and we do not present them here for brevity . \n the numerical evaluation of splitting intensity @xmath34 for the splitting @xmath13 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . for details on implementation of nuclear recoil and phase space cuts \n @xcite .    in the process of deriving the medium - induced splitting kernels in ref . \n @xcite we have shown explicitly that they are gauge invariant and that they factorize from the hard scattering process that creates the jet . \n this is described in detail in ref . \n @xcite for @xmath13 splitting and works similarly for the remaining splittings . \n using @xmath0 , several theoretical advances were achieved , relevant for jet quenching phenomenology . \n we proved the gauge invariance and factorization of the medium - induced splitting kernels . on the quantitative level we calculated the medium - splitting kernels beyond the small@xmath35 approximation which is inherent to energy loss calculations . with these improved results for @xmath13 and @xmath14 splittings , as well as \n two additional splittings @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which only appear at finite @xmath1 order , we have all ingredients to present improved theoretical predictions for jet production at rhic and lhc @xcite . \n these results will be presented elsewhere . \n 00    m.  gyulassy , i.  vitev , x.  -n . \n wang and b.  -w . \n zhang , in * hwa , r.c . \n et al . : quark gluon plasma * 123 -

{"ContextTokens": 3262, "GeneratedTokens": 172, "SynthesizedBody": "none of the previous analysis of the x - ray data of rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( henceforward rxj1856 ) revealed any significant periodicity @xcite . on the contrary a recent xmm - newton observation of rxj1856 has discovered that this isolated neutron star pulsates with a period of @xmath3 s @xcite . \n this object has a completely featureless x - ray and optical spectra . \n the lack of any significant spectral features in the x - ray spectrum argues against a heavy element atmosphere @xcite , whereas single temperature hydrogen atmosphere fits over - predict the optical flux by a large factor @xcite . as the soft x - ray spectrum \n is well fitted by the planckian spectrum with a temperature @xmath4ev @xcite . \n it has been proposed that the star has no atmosphere , but a condensed matter surface @xcite . \n such a surface might emit a featureless , likely a blackbody spectrum , at a temperature close to that of the surface , as suggested by @xcite . \n the overall spectra of this source has often been described by a two - temperature blackbody models @xcite , because the parameters derived from x - rays do not fit the optical data , which shows the rayleigh - jeans slope with an intensity a factor of 6 larger than that of a x - ray emission . \n alternatively a recent paper by @xcite explains the observed featureless spectra of this object assuming that the star has a thin magnetic , partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere on top of a condensed surface . \n though , one of important uncertainties for this model appears to be a creation of thin hydrogen atmospheres . \n however , to make these models work , the ns has to have a condensed matter surface , which requires the specific conditions @xcite . \n also , it remains to be seen weather a detailed analysis of magnetically condensed matter confirms the required non - uniform distribution of the surface temperature ( two - component blackbody model ) . \n so we must conclude that existing models , based on an assumption that the emission of rxj1856 has a thermal nature face numerous problems .    in the present paper \n we propose our explanation of the detected pulsations in the x - ray emission of rxj1856 , which is naturally possible based on emission model developed by @xcite . in this paper \n it is assumed that the emission of this object is generated by the synchrotron radiation , which is created as the result of appearance of pitch angles during the quasi - linear stage of the cyclotron instability . \n we suppose that the model proposed by @xcite works , which assumes the case of a nearly aligned rotator , whereas the periodic variations of the observed emission may be caused by the presence of a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves in the pulsar magnetosphere . \n these waves propagate across the magnetic field and encircle the open field line region of the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . \n they are not directly observable but only cause the periodic change of the direction of the pulsar emission @xcite .    in this paper , we give a description of the emission mechanism in section 2 . \n the mechanism of change of the pulsar radiation direction is described in section 3 , our model is presented in section 4 and conclusions are done in section 5 . \n as it is known the pulsar magnetosphere is filled by a dense relativistic electron - positron plasma . \n the ( e@xmath5e@xmath6 ) pairs are generated as a consequence of the avalanche process ( first described by @xcite ) and flow along the open magnetic field lines . \n the plasma is multi - component , with a one - dimensional distribution function ( see fig.1 from @xcite ) and consists of the following components : the bulk of plasma with an average lorentz - factor @xmath7 ; a tail on the distribution function with @xmath8 and the primary beam with @xmath9 . \n the main mechanism of wave generation in plasmas of the pulsar magnetosphere is the cyclotron instability . \n generation of waves is possible if the condition of the cyclotron resonance if fulfilled @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle velocity along the magnetic field , @xmath12 is the lorentz - factor for the resonant particles and @xmath13 is the drift velocity of the particles due to curvature of the field lines ( @xmath14 is the radius of curvature of the field lines and @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency ) . here \n cylindrical coordinate system is chosen , with the @xmath16-axis directed transversely to the plane of field line , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial and azimuthal coordinates . during the quasi - linear stage of the instability \n a diffusion of particles arises as along , also across the magnetic field lines . \n therefore , plasma particles acquire transverse momenta and begin to rotate along the larmor orbits . \n the synchrotron emission is generated as a result of the appearance of pitch angles . \n in @xcite it has been assumed that the emission of rxj1856 is generated by the synchrotron mechanism , which is created as the result of the cyclotron instability . \n though , the original waves excited during the cyclotron resonance come in the radio domain , the radio emission is not observed from rxj1856 . \n this waves as well as the x - ray and optical emission propagate along the local magnetic field lines . \n one of the possible explanations why the radio emission is not detected from this object is that it is generated at lower altitudes in contrast to the x - ray and optical emission and might miss our line of sight . \n another explanation is that the radio emission covers a large distance in the pulsar magnetosphere ( since the model of the aligned rotator is used ) . \n so there is a high probability for it , to come in the cyclotron damping range @xmath19 @xcite . in this case \n the radio emission will not reach an observer . \n * - rotation , * k * - emission and * a * - observers axes . angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are oscillating with time.,width=5 ] \n considered distribution function should generate various wave - modes in certain conditions . \n particularly it has been shown @xcite that a very low frequency , nearly transverse drift waves can be excited . \n they propagate across the magnetic field , so that the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 . in other words , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 . \n the period of the drift waves @xmath29 can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pulsar spin period , @xmath32 is the lorentz - factor of the relativistic particles and @xmath33 is the magnetic field in the wave excitement region ( @xmath34 is the magnetic field at the pulsar surface and @xmath35 is the radius of the neutron star ) . \n it appears that the period of the drift waves can vary in a broad range . \n the magnetic field of drift wave adds with the pulsar magnetic field as @xmath17 component and causes changing of the curvature of field line . \n even a small change of @xmath36 causes significant change of @xmath37 . \n variation of the field line curvature can be estimated as : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a longitudinal component of wave vector and @xmath17 is distance to the center of the pulsar . \n it follows that even the drift wave with a modest amplitude @xmath40 alters the field line curvature substantially @xmath41 .    since the pulsar emission propagates along the local magnetic field lines \n , curvature variation causes change of the emission direction , with the period of the drift waves . \n there is unequivocal correspondence between the observable intensity and @xmath42 ( the angle between the line of sight of an observer and the emission direction , see fig . \n [ fig1 ] ) . \n maximum of intensity corresponds to the minimum of @xmath43 . \n the period of pulsar is the time interval between neighboring maxima of observable intensity i.e. minima of @xmath43 . according to this fact \n , we can say that the observable period depends on time behavior of @xmath43 and as it appears below it might differ from the real spin period of the pulsar .    from pulsar geometry \n it follows that @xmath23 can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the pulsar , @xmath46 is the angle between the rotation and the observer s axes , @xmath47 is the angle between the rotation and emission axes ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and @xmath48 is the amplitude of changing of @xmath22 .    in the absence of the drift wave @xmath49 and consequently the period of @xmath43 \n equals to @xmath50 . on the other hand , if the angle between the rotation and emission axes is too small i.e. @xmath51 , then the period of @xmath23 equals to @xmath52 . in this case \n the observable period @xmath53 does not represent the real spin period of the pulsar , but equals to the period of the drift wave , which we suppose to be 7.055 s. when the real spin period of this object has been estimated by @xcite to be @xmath54 . \n hence , for some values of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath21 it is possible to explain the 7 s pulsations of rxj1856 . \n if we consider this object in the framework of our model its angular parameters will get the values shown in table 1 . \n simulated lightcurve for rxj1856 is presented on fig . \n [ fig2 ] , which well expresses the value of the pulsed fraction of only @xmath2 ( the smallest ever seen in the isolated x - ray pulsars ) , obtained from observations @xcite . \n in the present paper we propose our explanation of recently discovered 7 s pulsations in the isolated neutron star rxj1856 , based on model drawn by @xcite . \n the main feature of this work is that the spin period of pulsar might differ from the observable one , which is the consequence of existence of very low frequency drift waves in the region of excitement of the pulsar emission . \n these particular waves are not detected but only result in a periodical change of curvature of the magnetic field lines , which in turn cause the change of observed radiation with a period of the drift wave . \n drift wave driven model is very convenient , since it makes able to explain almost every feature of known extraordinary pulsars such as : extremely long period radio pulsars @xcite , rotation radio transients @xcite , anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters @xcite . \n we suppose that treatment of the real period of rxj1856 can be achieved by more detailed observations . in the case of nonzero @xmath20 , which is most likely , \n variations with different time - scale should be appeared with value of the pulsar spin period , see fig . \n if this is confirmed , it will benefit to our model . \n we are grateful to george machabeli for valuable discussions . \n this work was partially supported by georgian nsf grant st06/4 - 096 . \n arons , j. 1981 , in : proc . \n varenna summer school and workshop on plasma astrophysics , esa , p.273 burwitz , v. , zavlin , v. e. , neuhuser , r. , predehl , p. , trmper , j. brinkman , a. c. , 2001 , a&a , 379 , l35 burwitz , v. , haberl , f. neuhuser , r. , predehl , p. , trmper , j. zavlin , v. e. , 2003 , a&a , 399 , 1109 chkheidze , n. , machabeli , g. , 2007 , a&a , submitted ( arxiv:0705.1628v1 [ astro - ph ] ) drake , j. j. , marshall , h. l. , dreizler , s. , freeman , p. e. , fruscione , a. , et al . \n 2002 , apj , 572 , 996 ho , w. c. g. , kaplan , d. l. , chang , p. , adelsberg , m. , potekhin , a. y. , 2007 , mnras 375 , 281h kazbegi a. z. , machabeli g. z. , melikidze g. i. , 1991 , mnras , 253 , 377 kazbegi a. z. , machabeli g. z. , melikidze g. i. , shukre c. , 1996 , a&a , 309 , 515 khechinashvili , d. g. , melikidze , g. i. , 1997 , a&a , 320 , l45 lai , d. , salpeter , e. e. , 1997 , apj , 491 , 270 lai , d. , 2001 , rev . of mod . \n 73 , 629 lomiashvili d. , machabeli g. , & malov i. , 2006 , apj , 637 , 1010 lomiashvili d. , machabeli g. , & malov i. , 2007 , mnras , submitted malov , i. f. , machabeli , g. z. , 2007 , ap&ss , 29 m pavlov , g. g. , zavlin , v. e. , trmper , j. , neuhuser , r. , 1996 , apj , 472 , l33 pavlov , g. g. , 2000 , talk at the itp / ucsb workshop `` spin and magnetism of young neutron stars '' pavlov , g , g. , zavlin , v. e. , sanwal , d. , in neutron stars and supernova remnants . \n w. becher , h. lesch , & j. trmper , 2002 , mpe report 278 , 273 pons , j. a. , walter , f. m. , lattimer , j. m. , prakash , m. , neuhauser , r. , an , p. , 2002 , \n apj , 564 , 981 ransom , s. m. , gaensler , b. m. , slane , p.o . \n 2002 , apj , 570 , l75 sturrock p. a. , 1971 , apj , 164 , 529 tiengo , a. , mereghetti , s. , 2007 , apj , 657 , l101 turolla , r. , zane , s. drake , j. j. , 2004 , apj , 603 , 265", "StartTimeOffset": 433458761064, "RequestID": "707cba442db7fbb1ab9de9915751416a81eaf529", "TotalTokens": 3434}
{"ContextTokens": 2931, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "the natural flux of people s changing social ties and interests generates a dynamic social network . \n this invisible network can be observed by capturing daily or weekly snapshots of user activities on social media platforms and massively multiplayer online games ( mmogs ) . \n it is informative to study changes in the network at the _ community level _ , as well as the individual level . \n communities are emergent groups that are created as people form highly connected subnetworks with their families , co - workers , and friends . often communities are formed by participants with the same goals , interests , or a geographic location . \n for instance , in mmogs , network communities may emerge from guilds of players with common economic interests or alliances who share strategic goals . as the network changes , user groups can grow , shrink , or disappear , causing drastic changes in the total number of network communities . \n community detection can help us understand the hidden social structure of the user populations , but the dynamic aspect of networks can pose problems for standard algorithms \n . our method uses stochastic optimization to find the best community structure , assuming that the nodes are modeled as rational players who seek to maximize their personal utility while playing a _ community membership game _ with neighboring nodes . in this game , the active agent decides to join or leave different communities ; agents receive benefits from being part of the same community as their network neighbors but are penalized for joining too many communities . \n the nash equilibrium of the current game corresponds to the community structure of the current snapshot . as the network evolves \n , agents usually find it advantageous to modify their community membership strategy . \n this article examines the performance of varying the amount of information propagated from prior snapshots . \n even in dynamic networks , there are many nodes that retain the same community membership or rejoin their former communities . thus propagating information from previous snapshots \n can provide more favorable initialization conditions for the stochastic optimization procedure . \n much of the power of the d - gt framework ( originally introduced in @xcite ) lies in its potential for customization ; however , without guidance end users can be overwhelmed by myriad choices . \n our aim in this article is to present a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm s performance in common scenarios ; while retaining the same basic game - theoretic model , we evaluate different variations of our procedure . \n first , we examine the performance of different utility functions , a similarity - based utility function  @xcite vs.  the use of a personalized modularity function  @xcite . \n then we compare different initialization approaches in which the following information is propagated : 1 ) no information ( * d - gts * ) ; 2 ) the union of the community membership information over all snapshots ( * d - gt * ) ; 3 ) community membership information from the previous snapshot ( * d - gtp * ) ; 4 ) ground truth information for a small seed set ( * d - gtg * ) . our game - theoretic model is robust to minor changes in the procedure and most variants outperform the benchmarks . \n our experiments were conducted on networks created from different dynamic processes : internet routers ( as - oregon graph , the as - internet routers graph ) , shifting organization structure ( enron email dataset ) , citation graphs from arxiv ( hep - ph ) , and player interactions in massively multiplayer online games ( travian messages , travian trades ) . \n results were compared against five other methods : labelrankt , ilcd , oslom , infomap and louvain in terms of normalized mutual information ( nmi ) , modularity , and the number of detected communities . \n the next section presents an over - view of related work on community detection in dynamic networks . \n section  [ sec : method ] describes our problem formulation and our proposed method ( * * d**ynamic * * g**ame * * t**heoretic community detection ) . experimental results are provided in section  [ sec : results ] , before we conclude the article ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) . \n the problem of community detection has been widely studied in the literature compared to the other research areas in the social networks  @xcite . in particular , in static networks \n , community detection has appeared in multiple disciplines including sociology and computer science . \n this has yielded a diverse set of approaches ranging from traditional network structure based algorithms  @xcite , optimization techniques  @xcite , label propagation  @xcite , propinquity  @xcite and information diffusion  @xcite . detecting community structure in dynamic networks , on the other hand , \n has attracted less research attention due to the complexity of the problem and dearth of good datasets . \n there are some community detection algorithms originally design - ed for static networks that continue to perform well in dynamic datasets . \n for instance , lancichinetti et al.s oslom ( order statistics local optimization method ) works on single snapshots but also benefits from information from previous network partitions . like d - gt , oslom s optimization procedure can be initialized with the partition from the previous snapshot ; it aims to optimize cluster significance with respect to a global null model  @xcite . \n we use this method as one of our benchmarks , along with two other static community detection algorithms , louvain @xcite and infomap  @xcite . \n these algorithms perform well on many static community detection problems and have the benefit of being fast to compute on a single network snapshot . \n other network properties have also been used to perform dynamic community detection ; for instance hui et al . \n @xcite proposed a distributed method for community detection in which modularity was used as a measure instead of the objective function . \n qca ( quick community adaptation ) is a modularity - based approach that focuses explicitly on the changes in the network structure , rather than recomputing community structure from scratch at each time step  @xcite . in this article , \n we evaluate the use of personal modularity as an alternative gain function to neighborhood similarity . \n some studies have focused on studying the evolution of communities over time . \n for instance , @xcite identified subsets of nodes ,  natural communities \" , that were stable to small perturbations of the input data . \n communities detected in later snapshots were matched to earlier snapshots using the natural community tree structure . \n palla et al . \n @xcite proposed an innovative method for detecting communities in dynamic networks based on the k - clique percolation technique ; in their approach , communities are defined as adjacent k - cliques , that share @xmath0 nodes .    machine learning has also been employed to model changes in community structure ; for instance , @xcite predict transitions in community structure by learning supervised machine learning classifiers . \n this requires data on past transitions to train the classifiers , which limits its applicability to certain datasets . @xcite \n adopt a data mining approach to detect clusters on time - evolving graphs ; community discovery and change detection are performed using the minimum description length ( mdl ) paradigm .    rather than independently detecting communities at each snapshot and matching them , another option is to make a local decision to add nodes to existing communities when new edges appear in the network . \n one of our benchmarks , ilcd ( intrinsic longitudinal community detection )  @xcite , updates the community structure of the network based on time - stamped sets of edges . \n nodes are added to communities if its mean number of second neighbors and robust second neighbors exceeds the current average for the community . however , \n this model is limited to certain types of network changes , and can not handle interconnected pairs of nodes being simultaneously added or the removal of edges . \n optimization can be used to identify minimum cost community assignments in dynamic graphs . \n facetnet @xcite is a framework for analyzing communities in dynamic networks based on an optimization of snapshot costs . \n it is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution ; however , its convergence speed is slow , and it needs to be initialized with the number of communities which is usually unknown in practice . @xcite modeled dynamic community detection as a multi - objective optimization problem . \n their approach is parameter free and uses evolutionary clustering to optimize a dual objective function . \n the first objective selects for highly modular structures at the current time step , and the second minimizes the differences between community structures in the current and previous time steps . \n d - gt also uses a stochastic optimization procedure , but all of the agents individually optimize their utilities based on local network information . \n the markov cluster algorithm ( mcl )  @xcite identifies graph clusters by computing the probabilities of random walks through the graph ; flow simulations are performed by alternating expansion ( matrix squaring ) with inflation operations ( hadamard powers ) . due to its mathematical simplicity , \n it is popular for community detection in many domains but is slow and often overestimates the number of communities in the dataset . \n regularized - mcl  @xcite is a variant of mcl that prevents overfitting by taking into account neighbor flows . \n it can also be used within a multi - level framework ( multi - level regularized mcl ) to speed up computation by executing a sequence of coarsening operations on the graph before executing r - mcl . \n labelrankt  @xcite , shares some similarities with the mcl techniques described above while improving upon them in several ways ; it is a label propagation approach in which the inflation operation is applied to the label distribution matrix rather than to the adjacency matrix . \n each node requires only local information during propagation making it more scalable than mcl and amenable to parallelization . \n due to labelrankt s strong performance and good implementation , it was selected as the best label propagation benchmark for our work .    our proposed method ( d - gt ) attempts to simulate the decision - making process of the individuals creating the communities , rather than focusing on statistical correlations between labels of neighboring nodes . \n we believe that exploiting game theory for dynamic community detection yields more realistic , fine - grained communities since intrinsically game theory is a good representation for expressing the behavior of individuals and strategic interactions among them  @xcite .    in previous work \n , we have demonstrated the success of game - theoretic approaches in static community detection across several domains , including detecting guilds in massively multiplayer online games  @xcite and predicting trust between users on e - commerce sites @xcite . \n many of these domains featured overlapping communities in static networks  @xcite ; however in this article the datasets are dynamic , but not overlapping . \n d - gt makes a hard assignment at the termination of the stochastic optimization procedure by selecting the community assignment with the highest utility function . in this article \n , we investigate the performance of different gain functions and initialization procedures , on a variety of evaluation metrics ( modularity , nmi , number of detected communities ) . \n the strength of the d - gt framework is its versatility ;

det - crosstalk](b ) , the cross talk between adjacent channels is asymmetric with more cherenkov photons detected in channels left of the one on which the beam is centered . \n ( 10.0 , 4.30 ) ( -0.1,-0.2 ) ( 7.0 , 4.8 ) ( 0.1 , 4.4 ) ( a ) ( 6.5 , 4.4 ) ( b )    further tests included a setup where some of the original photodetectors were exchanged for newer types , especially three multianode photomultipliers and also a new silicon - based photomultiplier . \n however , results from these measurements are not discussed here . \n a component test stand is used to study different types of photodetectors . \n they are set up in a light - tight box and read out via a high resolution double range 12-bit vme charge - to - digital converter ( qdc ) , with either 200  fc or 25  fc per lsb ( least significant bit ) . \n a blue led ( @xmath7472  nm ) connected to a function generator is used to generate the light detected by the pd . before testing the linearity of the pds themselves , \n the differential and integral non - linearity ( dnl , inl ) of the qdc has also been measured . a ramp ( \n @xmath810  hz ) is used as input signal while the qdc is triggered by a short random gate of 50  ns duration . the probability for each transition to occur at a certain qdc code bin is measured and compared to an ideal distribution . if the qdc was ideal , a uniform distibution of code bins would be expected . the ratio between the measured and the ideal distribution is the code bin width , from which the dnl can be calculated as the deviation of the ideal code bin width of 1  lsb . the inl for a certain qdc code bin is then given by the sum of dnls up to this bin . \n both distributions are rather flat and a fit to the mid range of codes , from 200 to 800 qdc bins , gives an inl from 1 to 2 lsbs , corresponding to 0.1 - 0.2% of the full scale range . \n the most extensive linearity studies have been performed on 2x2 multianode photomultipliers ( mapm , hamamatsu r5900u - m4 ) . \n the spectrum of qdc counts is fitted by a modified poisson function to determine the number of incident photoelectrons . \n the ` true ' number of photoelectrons expected for a certain amount of light can not be determined since the relation between light yield and led bias voltage is not calibrated . \n however , the method used to measure the pd s inl is independent of the absolute scale of the led and only depends on the length of a rectangular pulse lighting the led . varying this pulse length ensures a linear variation of the amount of light on the photocathode of the pd . \n the pulse length is varied between 30  ns and 150  ns in steps of 5  ns . \n figure  [ fig : pd - linearity ] shows the results of several measurement series . \n ( 14.0 , 9.08 ) ( 0.00 , 4.50 ) ( 7.10 , 4.50 ) ( 0.00,-0.35 ) ( 7.10,-0.35 ) ( 0.95 , 5.20 ) ( a ) ( 8.05 , 5.20 ) ( b ) ( 0.95 , 0.35 ) ( c ) ( 8.05 , 0.35 ) ( d ) ( 1.00 , 8.00 ) 1@xmath9 measurement ( 1.45 , 7.60 ) @xmath10 reference ( 8.10 , 8.00 ) 3@xmath11 & 4@xmath12 series similar ( 8.10 , 7.60 ) corr . \n successful : nl@xmath130.1% ( 1.00 , 3.55 ) 2@xmath14 series ( 1.00 , 3.15 ) corr . fails : nl@xmath150.25% ( 8.10 , 3.80 ) time ordering    as can be seen in fig . \n [ fig : pd - linearity](b ) , the correction is highly successful for the 3@xmath11 and 4@xmath12 measurement series with a resulting inl of less than 0.1% , but fails for the 2@xmath14 measurement ( fig . \n [ fig : pd - linearity](c ) ) , where the inl is only about 0.25% . \n however , these results show that the pd non - linearity can be measured and thus controlled to a precision of 0.1% . a second method relying on optical filters \n will be used to cross check these results . \n another two methods were developed to measure the dnl : one measures the difference between the pd s response to the initial ( variable ) pulse @xmath16 and its response to the pulse @xmath17 with @xmath18 being a very small fix pulse . \n for the second method , a 4-hole mask is applied to the pd so that the ratio of the sum of single pulses through each hole and one pulse through all four holes simultaneously gives the dnl . \n a smaller prototype has been simulated and constructed to study the entire cherenkov detector design . \n this simplified version of the envisioned detector consists of only two u - shaped aluminum channels with a cross section of 8.5  mm@xmath19 embedded in a box flooded with the cherenkov gas c@xmath20f@xmath21 . \n the gas is non - flammable and was chosen mainly because of its high cherenkov threshold of about 10  mev . \n the electron beam will pass through the basis of the u - shaped channels , entering and exiting through thin aluminum windows , and produce cherenkov photons which are then reflected towards a photodetector mounted on the hind u - leg . \n the front u - leg is solely for calibration purposes with two leds mounted there , one per channel .    for the design of the prototype detector and also for the interpretation of future testbeam data , \n an optical simulation based on ` geant4 ` has been created . \n however , the pd response , i.e. mainly the pd s quantum efficiency is simulated separately using simple root macros . figure  [ fig : illu -

sld - testbox](a ) is avoided with the new design ( fig . \n [ fig : illu - sld - testbox](b ) ) , where only a slight inhomogeneity in the light intensity is seen . \n the reduction of cross talk and the avoidance of geometry - based asymmetries was the main reason to choose the peculiar u - shaped geometry for the prototype detector . \n an illumination scan with 4@xmath224 points per channel and 10,000 electrons per shot leads to fig . \n [ fig : illu -

'' \n @xcite the arduino can be connected to a computer through the usb port and programmed using a language similar to c++ . \n the program is uploaded into the microcontroller using an integrated development environment ( ide ) . in the arduino world , programs are known as _ \n we connected an array of ten @xmath8 leds to the digital pins of the microcontroller using @xmath7 resistors ( or @xmath9 for dimmer leds ) . \n we also used a solderless breadboard to hook up all the electric components to the microcontroller . \n listing  [ list01 ] shows a simple program ( sketch ) used to operate the microcontroller , and _ visualize _ the logistic map by looking at the array of blinking leds . \n a glowing led represents an iteration of the one - dimensional map , and it is linked with a value in the interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n arduino programs require two mandatory functions : ` setup ( ) ` and ` loop ( ) ` . \n any variable or constant defined outside these two functions is considered to be _ \n global_. in the ` setup ( ) ` function , we tell the microcontroller that there are 10 leds connected to the digital pins and that they are intended to be turned on and off . in the ` loop ( ) ` function , the logistic map is iterated , and the visualization process takes place as we observe the leds turning on and off , one after another , following the evolution of the nonlinear system .    using the ` if ( ) ` and ` else ` control structures , we divide the interval @xmath0 $ ] in ten identical segments and associate an led to each one of them . \n for example , the first led from the left represents the first interval segment @xmath10 , the second led represents the segment @xmath11 , and so on . \n the last led represents the final segment @xmath12 $ ] . \n when the microcontroller iterates the logistic map , a value belonging to one of these ten intervals is returned , and the corresponding led turns on for 500 milliseconds . \n this process is repeated infinitely , so we can observe the _ orbit _ followed by the logistic map by watching at the blinking leds sequence . \n cobweb diagrams for the logistic map for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath13 . \n the @xmath14 line , @xmath15 , is used to find the fixed points and follow the iteration process . \n plots ( a ) and ( b ) show the presence of attractors at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . \n plot ( c ) displays a period doubling bifurcation , and ( d ) the onset of chaos . ] \n the initial conditions for the logistic map can be changed anytime and uploaded again into the microcontroller . \n thus , we can explore the behavior of the chaotic map when different values of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath13 are chosen . \n it is amusing to study the bifurcations of the logistic map by looking at the blinking sequence of leds . \n we start with the parameter values @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . \n the led associated with the interval @xmath21 turns on first . \n as the iterations of the logistic map take place , we observe that the sequence of blinking leds moves toward the very first led , which is associated with the segment @xmath10 . \n the sequence ends up with this first led left on indefinitely . \n this evolution is shown in fig . \n [ fig03](a ) , the cobweb diagram of the logistic map for that selection of parameters . for this case \n , @xmath16 is an _ attractor _ , and the domain @xmath0 $ ] forms a _ basin of attraction_.    another example of an attractor happens when @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . \n we see that , after few iterations and blinking leds , there is only one led that remains on indefinitely . \n this led corresponds to the interval @xmath25 . in this case \n , we have a _ fixed point \n _ occurring at @xmath17 . as it is shown in fig . \n [ fig03](b ) , the orbit of the map follows a square spiral that converges into that fixed point . \n now , if @xmath26 and @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) , we can observe a 2-_period cycle _ ; the value of @xmath6 oscillates between 0.558 and 0.765 , and the two corresponding leds turn on and off intermittently . here , the fixed point @xmath28 becomes a _ \n repeller_. figure  [ fig03](c ) shows the periodic behavior of the logistic map for this set of parameters . \n unfortunately , higher periodicity ( like 4-period , 8-period cycles , or higher ) can not be observed clearly with this device because of the way the leds are mapped into the @xmath0 $ ] interval . \n more leds are required to improve the `` resolution '' of the device \n . however , the microcontroller has a limit of 13 digital pins , and other electric components ( like an extra microchip ) need to be incorporated into the circuit if we want more leds controlled by the device .    finally , when @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , chaos onsets.@xcite an `` apparently '' randomness of blinking leds is observed . \n after many iterations , there is no single led that remains on indefinitely , and no single led that has not been turned on at least once . \n the orbit of the logistic map covers all the domain of the interval @xmath0 $ ] . \n figure  [ fig03](d ) shows all points visited by the logistic map orbit after @xmath32 iterations .    .... \n // blinking logistic map      // \n choose the pin for each led    const int nbrleds   = 10 ;

the gluon mass is @xmath19  @xcite , while the charm and the bottom mass are , respectively , @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev . \n path - length distribution , parton production , fragmentation functions and decays , which are used in the numerical calculations , are specified above . \n to get an insight of what results we expect at 5.1 tev collisions at the lhc , we will first provide a simple analytic estimate for heavy flavor suppression at this collision energy . \n for that purpose , note that radiative energy loss is widely considered to be a dominant energy loss mechanism in qgp , so we will use only the radiative contribution for the estimate . \n since it is also widely assumed that radiative energy loss is proportional to @xmath22 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , one can estimate that the energy loss at 5.1 tev should be @xmath23 higher than at 2.76 tev . \n based on this , and if we assume that initial distributions can be approximated by power low distributions , i.e. @xmath24 , we can make an estimate on how much larger / smaller suppression one would expect at 5.1 tev compared to the already observed results at 2.76 tev . \n it was previously shown that , for radiative energy loss and power low initial distributions , suppression can be roughly estimated by using the following simple formula  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional energy loss . \n if we assume that , at 2.76 tev , typical fractional energy loss for charm is @xmath0 and for bottom @xmath27 , and that charm and bottom distributions do not notably change between these two collision energies , with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for charm ( bottom ) , the above estimate will straightforwardly lead to the expectation of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) larger suppression for charm ( bottom ) at 5.1 tev compared to 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc . \n contrary to these expectations , figure  [ suppfig1 ] shows that our suppression calculations - obtained from the energy loss formalism outlined in the previous section - provide substantially different predictions . from this figure \n , we actually do not observe any suppression increase between 2.76 to 5.1 tev collisions at the lhc . \n that is , we obtain the same suppression patterns for both charm and bottom probes ( d mesons and non - prompt @xmath8 ) at these two collision energies . \n this then leads to the question of , why the increase in the collision energy by almost a factor of 2 , leads to the same predicted suppression patterns between the two collisional energies , despite the estimated significant ( i.e. @xmath0 for charm , see above ) increase in the suppression ?    to address this question , in fig . \n [ ptdist ] we first compare charm and bottom initial distributions between these two collision energies . from this figure \n , we see that the distributions at 5.1 tev are slightly flatter than at 2.76 tev , for both charm and bottom , which will have the tendency to somewhat lower the suppression at 5.1 tev compared to 2.76 tev . \n note that only the shape of the distributions contributes to the suppression predictions , and from fig . \n [ ptdist ] , one can observe that the differences in the shape of the distributions are not large . \n still , this difference in the distributions has a notable ( though again not large , i.e. @xmath32 ) effect on the suppression predictions , as can be seen in the left panel of fig . \n [ decreaseincrease ] ; therefore , it should be taken into account in the suppression calculations . \n however , what we further see from the right panel of fig . \n [ decreaseincrease ] is that the effect on the suppression coming from the energy loss increase between 2.76 and 5.1 tev ( due to the increase in average temperature ) is also notable but not large , i.e. it corresponds to @xmath33 and @xmath34 . \n that is , the energy loss effect on the suppression has about the same magnitude , but an opposite direction , compared to the effect of different distributions between these two collision energies . \n the first question that we want to address is why the effect of the energy loss increase on jet suppression is not larger between these two collision energies , at least not for charm quark . \n that is , based on the common @xmath22 assumption , we have estimated that the energy loss increase should be on the order of @xmath35 , which should , therefore , have a more prominent ( estimated  30% ) effect on the suppression .    regarding the @xmath22 estimate for the radiative energy loss , note that , while widely used , this estimate does not have to be justified . \n that is , from eq . \n ( 10 ) in @xcite , which shows the radiative energy loss expression in a finite size dynamical qcd medium , it can be straightforwardly observed that the expression nontrivially depends on t. that is , while one can recover a part with explicit dependence on @xmath22 in this expression , the rest of the expression also depends on t , where this extra term considerably modifies the temperature dependence . \n additionally , the collisional energy loss effect , while smaller compared to the radiative , is still important , and this effect also has to be taken into account in the suppression calculations . note that , for the collisional energy loss , it is commonly assumed that it has a quadratic ( @xmath36 ) dependence on the temperature . \n however , similarly to the above discussion for the radiative energy loss , eq . \n ( 14 ) from @xcite shows a nontrivial temperature dependence , so we will below also test whether this simple ( @xmath36 ) assumption is justified .    with these goals , in fig . \n [ elossratiodifftemp ] , we plot the relative heavy flavor energy loss increase between 2.76 and 5.1 collision energies at the lhc . figures also contain dashed horizontal lines , which represent what would be the energy loss increase , if it would indeed have @xmath36 or @xmath22 dependence . for radiative energy loss , we see that , contrary to the common expectations , energy loss increase is far from @xmath22 dependence ; i.e. it is between linear ( for low jet energy regions ) and quadratic ( which can be reached for asymptotically high jet energies ) . \n consequently , for the high momentum heavy flavor hadrons that will be studied at these two collision energies at the lhc , the expected energy loss increase is notably smaller than quadratic , i.e. it is in the region between @xmath37 ( note that the average temperature increase between these two collision energies is @xmath12 ) . for the collisional energy loss , we also see that energy loss increase is far from quadratic , i.e. the increase of @xmath38 is constant with momentum and it has slightly larger than linear dependence on temperature . \n consequently , contrary to the common expectation , the total energy loss has also a modest temperature dependence , which is close to linear , i.e. between 6 and 10% depending on the jet momentum . \n this modest energy loss increase between these two collisional energies consequently leads to a modest increase in the suppression which we observe in the right panel of fig . \n [ decreaseincrease ] .    finally , in fig . \n [ suppression ] , we study the combined effect of the differences in the distributions and the energy loss on jet suppression . on the two left panels , we see the effect of the difference in the distributions on the jet suppression , while the energy loss is kept fixed . on the two central panels , we keep the same distribution , but change the energy loss , while in the two right panels both the distributions and the energy loss are changed between the two collision energies . from the panels , \n we see that , while the change in the distribution has the tendency to reduce the suppression , the energy loss increase increases the suppression for about the same amount , so that the resultant suppression at 5.1 tev collision energy is almost the same as at 2.76 tev . \n the above obtained numerical result can also be directly estimated from eq . \n [ suppsimpolified ] . for this purpose \n , we will take that the energy loss between 2.76 and 5.1 tev collision energy increases by factor @xmath39 , where from fig . \n [ elossratiodifftemp ] , we see that @xmath40 for both charm and bottom . \n additionally , we will take that the power factor in the initial parton distributions decrease by @xmath41 ; by fitting the power low to the ratio of the momentum distributions in fig . \n [ ptdist ] , we obtain @xmath42 . by applying these factors into eq . \n [ suppsimpolified ] , one can straightforwardly obtain @xmath43 where for @xmath41 and @xmath39 estimated above the second additive in the above becomes close to zero . \n consequently , this estimate also recovers the conclusion of the same heavy flavor suppression at 2.76 and 5.1 tev pb+pb collision energies at the lhc . \n in this paper , we provided heavy flavor suppression predictions for the upcoming 5.1 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc . based on our energy loss formalism \n , we predict the same heavy flavor suppression patterns for 2.76 and 5.1 tev collision energies . \n this result is surprising since , based on the commonly used assumption , a notable increase of the suppression is expected at the higher collision energy . \n we showed that the same suppression is a consequence of the interplay between the following two effects : _ i _ ) a decrease in the suppression due to flattening of the initial momentum distributions , and _ ii _ ) an increase in the suppression - though more moderate than expected - due to higher energy loss . \n consequently , this unexpected , but simple , suppression prediction provides a direct ( both quantitative and qualitative ) test of our understanding of the medium interactions in qcd medium created in these collisions .    _ \n acknowledgments : _ this work is supported by marie curie international reintegration grant within the @xmath44 european community framework programme pirg08-ga-2010 - 276913 and by the ministry of science and technological development of the republic of serbia , under projects no . \n on171004 and on173052 . \n bjorken , fermilab - pub-82 - 059-thy ( 1982 ) 287 - 292 . \n n. brambilla et al . , eur . \n phys . j. c * 74 * ( 2014 ) 2981 . \n m. gyulassy , lect . \n notes phys . \n * 583 * ( 2002 ) 37 . \n d. denterria and b. betz , lect . \n notes phys . \n * 785 * ( 2010 ) 285 . \n m. djordjevic , phys . \n c * 80 * ( 2009 ) 064909 . \n m. djordjevic and u. heinz , phys . \n * 101 * ( 2008 ) \n 022302 . m. djordjevic , phys . \n c * 74 * ( 2006 ) 064907 . \n m. djordjevic and m. djordjevic , phys . lett . \n b * 709 * ( 2012 ) 229 . \n m. djordjevic and m. djordjevic , phys . \n b * 734 * ( 2014 ) 286 . \n m. djordjevic and m. djordjevic , phys . \n c * 90 * ( 2014 ) 034910 . \n m. djordjevic , phys . \n * 112 * ( 2014 ) 4 , 042302 . \n m. djordjevic , m. djordjevic and b. blagojevic , phys . lett . \n b * 737 * ( 2014 ) 298 . \n d. molnar and d. sun , nucl . \n a * 932 * ( 2014 ) 140 ;

such a spring deforms under its own weight in a force field . \n here we investigate this problem for two different force fields . \n first in constant gravity , then in the centrifugal force field due to rotation of the reference frame with constant angular velocity . \n we also investigate two different models for the finite mass springs . \n first a discrete model where the spring is assumed to consist of point masses connected by weightless springs \n . then the continuum limit of this model is considered . \n it is pointed out that the deformation in this limit should be given by the function that minimizes the potential energy . \n results are then easily obtained from the variational principle . \n various authors have considered similar problems involving springs of finite mass . \n statics of a slinky has been studied by mak @xcite . \n several authors have been interested in the effects on dynamics of the finite spring mass . \n rotating springs with @xcite and without @xcite finite mass , have also attracted attention . \n the approach and most results presented here are , however , either new or , at least hard to find in the literature . \n the discrete model could be taught at the elementary level . \n the continuum model should be useful in the teaching of variational principles as simple examples of their use . \n consider a light ( negligible mass ) spring of natural length @xmath3 and stiffness @xmath0 with one end fixed . \n a particle of mass @xmath1 hangs at the free end . \n the equation for static equilibrium is , @xmath4 along the spring in the downwards direction . here \n @xmath5 is the extension of the spring . \n the length of the loaded spring is thus , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the relative extension of the spring , @xmath8 a dimensionless quantity . \n assume now that the same light spring instead is rotating , in a smooth horizontal plane , with the fixed end on the rotation axis . \n a particle of mass @xmath1 at the other end will remain at a fixed distance from the rotation axis if , @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the constant angular velocity of the rotation and @xmath5 is the extension of the spring . \n the term on the left hand side is mass times centripetal acceleration . \n if it is moved to the other side it plays the role of the centrifugal force in the rotating system in which the spring and mass are at rest .    for the dimensionless relative extension of the spring , defined by @xmath11 , we find , @xmath12 in the rotating case . to compare this with the gravitational result we chose the angular velocity , @xmath13 , so that the centripetal acceleration at the end of the unloaded spring is @xmath14 . \n one then finds that , @xmath15 the relative extension is longer than in the gravitational case since the centrifugal force grows with distance from the rotation axis . \n below we will compare these elementary results for a light spring with the corresponding results for a heavy spring . \n consider a chain of @xmath16 particles , each of mass @xmath17 , connected by @xmath16 light springs of natural ( neutral , unloaded , uncompressed ) length @xmath18 , and stiffness ( spring constant ) @xmath19 , see fig . \n we must first establish the properties of the resulting finite mass spring of natural length @xmath20 and total mass @xmath21 . \n the stiffness or spring constant @xmath0 must be determined by the formula for the effective spring constant of springs in series . \n this means that , @xmath22 is the stiffness of the full chain . \n the first spring has a free end and we attach this end to a fixed point and let the chain hang vertically from this point . introduce a downward directed @xmath23-axis along the chain with origin at the point of suspension . \n the equilibrium equations for the @xmath16 particles are then , @xmath24 we see that the upward force on the @xmath16th particle is the same as the downward spring force on the @xmath25th particle . in this way \n one can easily work one self upwards and find that this system is equivalent to the set of equations , @xmath26 here we have introduced @xmath27 , the extension of the last spring in the chain . \n this , perhaps obvious , result says that each spring will carry the weight of all the particles below it , including the particle at its lower end . \n solving this system of equations

perform the sums indicated by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series . \n the position of the last ( @xmath16th ) particle will give the length of the hanging massive chain . \n the result is , @xmath35 here we can use @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , to get @xmath40.\\ ] ] for a real coil spring with continuously distributed mass we must let @xmath41 . comparing to ( [ q.ext.g ] ) \n we then find that a heavy spring of mass @xmath1 and stiffness @xmath0 is extended half as much ( @xmath42 ) as the corresponding light spring with a weight of mass @xmath1 at the end . \n to find how gravity deforms a spring with continuously distributed mass we will now use that potential energy minimization determines the static equilibrium . to pass to the continuum one can follow a procedure by goldstein @xcite ( it can also be found in sakurai @xcite ) . \n he derives the wave equation for longitudinal waves along a one dimensional elastic continuum by first considering the discrete case of a horizontal chain of masses and springs . in the limit of infinitely many particles \n the sum which is the lagrangian for the discrete case is replaced by an integral of a lagrangian density . \n the euler - lagrange equation of the corresponding action is the wave equation . \n here we adapt to the static hanging case by skipping the kinetic energy and instead including the gravitational potential energy . \n the potential energy of the discrete system of the previous section is given by , @xmath43 where we assume @xmath44 . \n we rewrite this in the form , @xmath45 put @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and note that @xmath48 , to get , @xmath49,\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is young s modulus , that goes under this name in the theory of elasticity @xcite . ] and @xmath51 the linear mass density of the un - deformed spring . \n we can now pass to the continuum by the identifications : @xmath52 here @xmath53 represents the @xmath23-coordinate of points on the un - deformed spring , and @xmath54 is the @xmath23-coordinate of the same point on the spring deformed by gravity under its own weight .    for the continuum case \n the potential energy is now a functional of the function @xmath54 which is the limit of the sum ( [ eq.pot.energy.discrete3 ] ) as @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . \n the potential energy functional is thus , @xmath57 = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}x\\ , v(\\xi,\\xi ' ) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}x \\left [ \\frac{y}{2 }   \\left ( \\frac{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}\\xi}{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}x } - 1 \\right)^2 - \\lambda g\\ , \\xi(x ) \\right],\\ ] ] where it is assumed that @xmath58 . here , \n @xmath59 , is a potential energy per unit length . \n variation of the functional ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) in the usual way @xcite gives , @xmath60 assuming that the functional is stationary . \n then one notes that @xmath61 is a derivative and takes advantage of integration by parts to get rid of this derivative . \n after this step one has , @xmath62_0^{\\ell}= 0 , \\ ] ] for the variation of @xmath63 . at this point one usually invokes the requirement that @xmath64 and thus arrive at the usual euler - lagrange equation . \n here we must have @xmath65 since the top end of the spring is fixed . at the lower end , however , this is not obvious . \n the variation @xmath66 therefore results in the equation , @xmath67 since both the function @xmath68 and its value at @xmath69 are arbitrary , apart from the condition @xmath65 , the only way to satisfy this equation is to have both the euler - lagrange equation , @xmath70 and the boundary condition , @xmath71 satisfied .    using the explicit form for @xmath72 of equation ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) we get , the simple equation , @xmath73 from the euler - lagrange equation . here the constant on the right hand side \n can also be written @xmath74 using the definitions above eq . \n ( [ eq.pot.energy.discrete3 ] ) . \n the boundary condition gives , @xmath75 since @xmath76 corresponds to an un - deformed spring this result has the simple physical interpretation that the spring is not stretched ( deformed ) at its lower end where there is no mass below that pulls on it . \n the solution of ( [ eq.eul.lgr.grav1 ] ) is trivial to find once the boundary conditions , @xmath58 and @xmath77 , are taken into account . \n one finds that the new @xmath23-coordinates of the particles of the spring are given in terms of the unloaded @xmath23-coordinates by , @xmath78 the total length of the hanging spring is then given by , @xmath79 in agreement with the discrete result ( [ eq.length.masive.chain.in.grav.1 ] ) when @xmath41 . \n we first consider the discrete case and assume that the first spring of the chain is attached to a fixed point and that the spring rotates , with angular velocity @xmath10 around this point , on a smooth horizontal plane . \n we choose @xmath80-axis in the rotating system to be parallel to the spring with origin at the fixed point . \n the fictitious centrifugal force on a particle of the spring is then @xmath81 . \n the equilibrium equations corresponding to the eqs . \n ( [ eqs.grav.equil ] ) in the gravitational case are then , @xmath82 where we have introduced @xmath83 . the trick used in the gravitational case to solve for @xmath84 does not work here . \n instead one might note that the typical equation of this sequence is the recursive relation , @xmath85 this is a so called difference equation that can be treated by standard methods , but here we chose to proceed directly to the continuum case . \n recalling that the potential energy of the centrifugal force is @xmath86 , we can take the result ( [ eq.pot.energy.cont ] ) for the gravitational case and get , @xmath87 = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}z\\ , v(\\zeta,\\zeta ' ) = \\int_{0}^{\\ell } { \\mbox{\\rm d}}z \\left [ \\frac{y}{2 }   \\left ( \\frac{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}\\zeta}{{\\mbox{\\rm d}}z } - 1 \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\omega^2\\ , \\zeta^2(z ) \\right],\\ ] ] for the centrifugal case . \n the euler - lagrange differential equation is now , @xmath88 if we introduce the notation @xmath89 , the solution obeying the boundary conditions , @xmath90 , is easily found to be , @xmath91 this function and the corresponding one for gravity ( [ eq.sol.grav ] ) are plotted and compared in fig . \n [ fig1 ] . \n the length of the spring in the centrifugal force field is , @xmath92.\\ ] ] for small angular velocity @xmath10 we get the approximate result , @xmath93 a light rotating spring with a mass @xmath1 at the end becomes longer by the amount given in eq . \n ( [ q.ext.omega ] ) , which gives , @xmath94 for small angular velocity @xmath10 . \n ( [ eq.zeta.length.approx ] ) shows that if the mass instead is distributed along the spring the extra relative length is reduced to @xmath95 , to first order in @xmath10 . \n this concludes our study of the rotating heavy spring . \n the study of the deformation of springs under their own weight presented above provides nice illustrations of some general principles of statics . \n the most important of these is the fact that static equilibrium often is given simply by minimizing potential energy . \n the most well known non - trivial example of this principle found in the literature is the catenary , which usually is presented , together with the brachistochrone , as a basic application of the variational calculus @xcite . \n unfortunately these classical examples yield quite difficult differential equations who s solution require considerable mathematical skill . \n the examples here , giving the deformation of heavy springs , provide simple but interesting , non - trivial , and easily understood results .",

up tank has not been addressed yet in the literature . \n the only maintenance operation considered here is the complete replacement of all the failed components and the system restarts in its initial equilibrium state . \n partial repairs are not allowed . \n mathematically , this problem of preventive maintenance corresponds to a stochastic optimal stopping problem as explained by example in the book of aven and jensen @xcite . \n it is a difficult problem because of the closed loop interactions between the state of the components and the liquid level and temperature . \n a classical approach consists in using condition - based maintenance ( cbm ) to act on the system based on its current state and before its failure . \n one can for example calculate the remaining useful life ( rul ) of the system and the preventive replacement is carried out when the deterioration level exceeds a certain threshold or enters in a certain state @xcite . \n our approach also takes into account the current state of the process , but our decision rule is not based on damage accumulation nor does it correspond to hitting some threshold . \n instead , it involves a performance function that reflects that the longer the system is in a functioning state the better . \n the dynamics of the heated hold - up tank can be modeled by a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) , see @xcite . \n therefore , our maintenance problem boils down to an optimal stopping problem for pdmp s . \n pdmp s are a class of stochastic hybrid processes that has been introduced by davis @xcite in the 80 s . \n these processes have two components : a euclidean component that represents the physical system ( e.g. temperature , pressure ,  ) and a discrete component that describes its regime of operation and/or its environment . \n starting from a state @xmath0 and mode @xmath1 at the initial time , the process follows a deterministic trajectory given by the laws of physics until a jump time that can be either random ( e.g. it corresponds to a component failure or a change of environment ) or deterministic ( when a magnitude reaches a certain physical threshold , for example the pressure reaches a critical value that triggers a valve ) . \n the process restarts from a new state and a new mode of operation , and so on . \n this defines a markov process . \n such processes can naturally take into account the dynamic and uncertain aspects of the evolution of the system . \n a subclass of these processes has been introduced by devooght @xcite for an application in the nuclear field . \n the general model has been introduced in dynamic reliability by dutuit and dufour @xcite . \n the objective and originality of this paper is twofold . \n first , we propose an optimization procedure for a well - known benchmark in the dynamic reliability literature . \n the tank model was first introduced by @xcite where only one continuous variable ( liquid level ) is taken into account , and then in @xcite and @xcite where the second variable ( temperature ) is introduced . \n they have tested various monte carlo approaches to simulate the process to compute reliability and safety indices . in @xcite , \n the authors have used the same system to present continuous cell - to - cell mapping markovian approach ( cccmt ) still to simulate the process . \n the simulation of the holdup tank example has been and is still widely studied in the literature ( not exhaustive ) @xcite . here \n we go one step further and not only propose to simulate the tank process but also we optimize it . \n second , even though pdmp s have been recognized as a powerful modeling tool for dynamic reliability problems @xcite , there are very few numerical tools adapted to these processes . \n our aim is to further demonstrate the high practical power of the theoretical methodology described in @xcite , by applying it to the tank benchmark . in @xcite , \n the authors have proposed a numerical algorithm to optimize pdmp s and have studied its theoretical properties . \n this optimization procedure was first applied to an example of maintenance of a metallic structure subject to corrosion , without closed loop interactions or deterministic jumps . \n in addition , the system has only one continuous variable and the cost function is simple and does not depend on time , see @xcite . in this paper , we adapt the numerical procedure proposed in @xcite to the more challenging heated hold - up tank problem with two continuous variables , deterministic jumps when these variables hit some given boundaries and closed loop interactions between continuous and discrete variables . \n furthermore , we consider a cost function that depends on both continuous variables as well as on the running time . \n the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : \n model ] , the dynamics of the heated hold - up tank is presented with more details as well as the framework of pdmp s . in section [ section : opti ] the formulation of the optimal stopping problem for pdmp s and its theoretical solution are briefly recalled and the four main steps of the algorithm are detailed . in section [ section \n : res ] the numerical results obtained on the example of the tank are presented and discussed . finally , in section [ section : conclusion ] a conclusion and perspectives are presented . \n we are interested in the maintenance of a heated hold - up tank . \n the dynamics of the tank can be modeled by a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) . \n we first describe with more details the dynamics of the tank , then we recall the definition and some basic properties of pdmp s . \n the tank model is a well known benchmark in dynamic reliability . \n it was first introduced by @xcite where only one continuous variable ( liquid level ) is taken into account , and then in @xcite and @xcite where the second variable ( temperature ) is introduced . \n we have kept the values of the parameters defined in those papers . \n the system is represented on figure [ fig1 ] . \n it consists of a tank containing a fluid whose level is controlled by three components : two inlet pumps ( units 1 and 2 ) and one outlet valve ( unit 3 ) . \n a thermal power source heats up the fluid . \n the variables of interest are the liquid level @xmath2 , the liquid temperature @xmath3 and the state of the three components and the controller . \n each component has four states : on , off , stuck on or stuck off . once a unit is stuck ( either on or off ) it can not change state . \n the possible transitions between these four states are given in figure [ fig2 ] . \n thus , by a random transition a working unit can only become stuck ( either on or off ) . \n the initial state of the components is on for units 1 and 3 and off for unit 2 .    , \n width=226 ]    the intensity of jumps @xmath4 for unit @xmath5 depends on the temperature through the equation @xmath6 with @xmath7 given in eq . \n ( [ eq : a ] ) , see @xcite @xmath8    function @xmath7 is represented on figure [ fig3 ] and the various parameters come from the literature , see @xcite , and are given in table [ tab1 ] . \n the special form of the failure rate @xmath4 as a product of a constant depending on @xmath5 and a function of the temperature allows for all three units to have failure rates with the same dependence on the temperature , but different scaling parameters . \n indeed , at the reference temperature of @xmath9 , the mean time to failure of unit @xmath10 is @xmath11 , for unit @xmath12 , it is @xmath13 and for unit @xmath14 it is @xmath15 . \n in addition , the shape for function @xmath7 was chosen in the original benchmark so that there is a very high failure rate when the temperature is high . \n more specifically , the parameters are chosen such that @xmath7 is lowest ( equal to @xmath10 ) when the temperature is equal to a reference temperature of @xmath9 , it equals @xmath16 when the temperature is @xmath17 and it is highest ( equal to @xmath18 ) when the temperature equals the critical temperature of @xmath19 . \n the exponential functions are chosen in order to enable this very high dependence with the temperature . \n roughly speaking , the units fail @xmath18 times more often when the temperate is @xmath19 than when it is @xmath9 .     as a function of @xmath3,width=188 ]    in addition \n , control laws are used to modify the state of the components to keep the liquid within two acceptable limits : @xmath20 meters and @xmath21 meters . \n if the liquid level drops under @xmath22 , the components 1 , 2 , 3 are put respectively in state on , on and off ( provided they are not stuck ) . \n if the liquid level rises above @xmath23 , the components are put respectively in the state off , off and on ( provided they are not stuck ) . unlike the classical model presented in @xcite , we also allow the control unit to fail . at each solicitation \n , the control may succeed with probability @xmath24 independently from previous successes . \n once it has failed , it will never succeed again . \n therefore the control unit has two possible states : working @xmath10 or failed @xmath25 . \n .parameters for the tank dynamics [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the numerical method described in @xcite has been applied to a well known test case of dynamic reliability to approximate the value function of the optimal stopping problem and an @xmath26-optimal stopping time for a piecewise - deterministic markov process , that is the maintenance date for the tank . \n the quantization method proposed can sometimes be costly in computing time , but has a very interesting property : it can be calculated off - line . \n moreover it depends only on the dynamics of the model , and not on the cost function chosen , or the actual trajectory of the specific process one wants to monitor . \n the calculation of the optimal maintenance time is done in real time , making our procedure applicable in practice . \n the optimal maintenance time is updated at the changes of mode and has a conditional threshold form , which allows scheduling maintenance services in advance . \n if one only changes the reward function @xmath27 without changing the dynamics of the tank , one just has to run the optimization part of the algorithm , and not the quantization grids . \n this can be done in real time . if one wants to change the dynamics of the system , or add some components , one has to rewrite the simulation code for the system , and with this new code re - run the quantization grids , which can be quite long . \n however , the general methodology is valid for a wide class of piecewise deterministic markov processes and not at all specific to the tank . \n the method has been implemented on the heated hold - up tank . \n the main characteristic of this system is that it can be modeled by a stochastic hybrid process , where the discrete and continuous parts interact in a closed loop . \n the optimization problem under study has no analytic solution . \n however , our method is based on a rigorous mathematical construction with proof of convergence . \n in addition , simple comparisons between no motoring and our policy also prove its practical validity with a significant improvement of the performance of the system ( the mean performance is increased by @xmath28 and the top events are almost always avoided ) . \n our next project is to extend this research in two main directions . \n first , we could allow only partial repair of the system . \n the problem will then be to find simultaneously the optimal times of maintenance and optimal repair levels . \n mathematically , it is an impulse control problem , which complexity exceeds widely that of the optimal stopping . \n second , our method requires a perfect observation of the state process at the jump times . \n it would be interesting to extend our results to a noisy observation of the process , as often happens in real life . \n this work was partially funded by the french national research , anr grant fautocoes , program arpege , anr-09-segi-004 . \n the authors also thank pr . \n franois dufour for initial discussions on how to define an interesting optimal stopping problem for the test -

{"ContextTokens": 2823, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "the importance of water in many areas of science has motivated a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations of the liquid . \n however , it is only recently that x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements have come to an overall agreement for properties such as the structure of water at ambient conditions @xcite . \n in addition , several details of the water structure remain the subject of debate , and many dynamical properties of the liquid are not yet well understood . \n theoretical models have played an important role in the interpretation of experimental measurements and in understanding the physical properties of water @xcite . over the last thirty years , rather accurate empirical force fields \n have been developed , which can reproduce not only the structure but also many dynamical properties of the liquid @xcite . \n although empirical models work well for pure water under ambient conditions , they are usually difficult to generalize to complex solutions or thermodynamic states far from ambient conditions . for example , the majority of empirical water models that are in current use employ potentials that do not change depending on the environment .    in recent years , it has become possible to simulate the properties of a liquid entirely from first principles , without having to resort to fitted potentials . \n this is due in large part to the development of the car - parrinello ( cp ) method @xcite along with the continual increase in high performance computing resources . \n although rather accurate and with the potential of being a truly predictive tool , cp simulations are much more computationally intensive than classical simulations . \n the case of water is particularly demanding for cp simulations . \n the ionic vibrational spectrum of the liquid exhibits high frequency modes , i.e. o - h stretch ( 3200 to 3600 @xmath0 ) and h - o - h bending modes ( @xmath11600 @xmath0 ) . \n therefore , in order to avoid a coupling between the ionic and electronic degrees of freedom , which could cause severe inaccuracies in a cp simulation , a relatively small fictitious electronic mass ( @xmath2 400 a.u . for protonated water ) needs to be used @xcite . in turn , the use of small values of @xmath3 , together with the high kinetic energy cutoff required to describe the oxygen pseudopotential in a plane wave description , necessitates the use of small integration time steps . the time step may need to be as small as 0.08 fs , which is approximately ten times smaller than what is often used in classical md simulations with empirical inter - atomic potentials . \n this poses a severe restriction on the time scales that can be accessed in cp simulations of water . \n we note that when using born - oppenheimer ( bo ) dynamics ( where the total energy of the system is minimized at each ionic step ) , one can use larger time steps than in cp simulations , since electronic degrees of freedom are not propagated at the same time as ionic coordinates . \n however , the accuracy required to reduce systematic errors on the ionic forces so as to have conservative dynamics is such that large number of iterations are usually necessary to minimize the kohn - sham energy at each ionic step . \n therefore , the gain in efficiency obtained with a large time step is more than counter - balanced by the computational time requirement for total energy minimizations . \n it is interesting to note that the problem of integrating fast vibrational modes in simulations of liquid water has also been encountered in classical md simulations , where the most common approach has been to completely eliminate the high - frequency intra - molecular motion by using bond length and angle constraints @xcite . \n based on this approach , a variety of classical water potentials , e.g. the tip series @xcite , are capable of accurately reproducing many of the interesting properties of water . in particular , results obtained with the rigid water tip5p potential are in very good agreement with a variety of experimental measurements such as the structure , the temperature of maximum density , diffusion , as well as dielectric properties @xcite .    with the aim of investigating how to increase the integration time step in cp simulations of water and thus access larger time scales , we have carried out calculations using a rigid water approximation . in this paper , we present the results of these simulations and compare them to those obtained with flexible water molecules ( i.e. without imposing any constraints on the geometry of the molecules in the liquid ) , and we discuss the effect of a rigid model on the structural properties of water at ambient and high pressure conditions . \n our results show that an _ ab initio _ rigid water model yields faster diffusion and radial distribution functions which are less structured than those found with a flexible model . \n overall , the properties computed with the rigid model are in better agreement with experiment than those determined with a flexible model . possible reasons for this improved agreement are discussed . \n in addition , we present a localized orbital analysis of the trajectories obtained with both a rigid and flexible water model , and we demonstrate that the large dipole moment changes in going from the gas to the liquid phase are not significantly altered by the rigid water approximation . \n the use of a rigid water model in _ ab initio _ simulations opens the way to much longer simulations of solutions where chemical reactions and dissociation effects do not occur . \n in order to examine how the structural and dynamical properties of water are altered by a rigid water approximation , we have performed a series of first principle molecular dynamics simulations @xcite of water with and without intramolecular bond and angle constraints under ambient and high pressure and temperature conditions . \n the simulations consist of 54 water molecules in a periodically repeated cubic cell with a lateral dimension of either 11.74   or 10.10  , which correspond to densities of 1.00 g / cc and 1.57 g / cc , respectively . at each density , we have compared simulations where the intra - molecular geometry of the water molecules are rigid to those where the geometries of the water molecules are fully flexible . \n .details of the simulations . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ diffusion ]    in addition to possible changes in structure and dynamics , we have examined how the rigid molecule approximation changes the electronic properties of water . in order to do this \n we have performed a localized orbital analysis by computing the mlwfs for a series of well - separated snapshots from the rigid water simulation b and the flexible water simulation c. within the pseudopotential approximation , there are four doubly occupied mlwfs around each of the water molecules in the simulations . \n two of the mlwfs are localized on the oxygen - hydrogen covalent bonds , and the other two are localized on the lone - pair locations of the oxygen atoms . given the large amount of data that the mlwfs represent , in the following , we only consider the centers of the mlwfs rather than the orbitals themselves . in fig . \n [ gow ] , the oxygen - mlwf center rdfs for simulations b and c are shown . \n the rdfs consist of two distinct distributions centered at r@xmath10.33   and r@xmath10.49  , which correspond to lone - pair and covalent bond locations , respectively . for comparison , the dashed vertical lines in fig \n .  [ gow ] represent the locations of the mlwf centers around the oxygen atom of an isolated gas phase water molecule . \n surprisingly , the rigid water approximation does not significantly alter the large changes in the mlwf centers that are expected when going from an isolated water molecule to the liquid state . as can be seen in fig . \n [ gow ] , the lone pair distributions are shifted away from the oxygen atoms by @xmath10.03  , and the covalent bond distributions are shifted toward the oxygen atoms by @xmath10.04  .    as proposed by silvestrelli \n _ et al . _ \n @xcite , an approximate dipole moment for each water molecule in the liquid can be defined by assigning the total charge of each mlwf to a point charge located at its corresponding center . because the mlwf on neighboring water molecules in the liquid do not significantly overlap , this provides a less ambiguous definition of the molecular dipole moments than arbitrarily assigning electron density to individual water molecules . as pointed out in ref . \n , dipole moments computed in this manner from static configurations may not be representative of the experimentally measured dipole moments in the fluid . \n however , the mlwf dipole moments are useful for examining qualitative differences in the polarization of water as a function of different approximations or of solutes present in the liquid .    in fig . \n [ dipole ] , the probability distributions of molecular dipole moments for rigid and flexible water systems calculated from the mlwf centers are shown . \n [ dipole ] indicates that the rigid water approximation has a rather small effect on distribution of dipole moments in the liquid . \n in particular , the average moment in simulation b is shifted to 3.08 debye as compared to 3.20 debye in simulation c. apparently , an explicit description of high frequency o - h stretch and h - o - h bending modes is not necessary to reproduce the broad range of moments that are characteristic of the liquid . \n it is also interesting to note that the latest experimental estimate based on an analysis of the x - ray structure factor of water indicates that the dipole moment of water in the liquid is 2.9 debye @xcite , which is in closer agreement with the rigid water model than the flexible simulation . \n the decrease in the average dipole moment obtained from the rigid water approximation offers another explanation for the observed softening of the liquid structure . \n in addition to mimicking quantum effects , it is possible that the rigid water approximation to some extent corrects for the general tendency of simple gga - based functionals to overestimate the polarizability of molecules @xcite . \n for example , the static isotropic polarizability of an isolated water molecule is 10.74 au with the pbe functional as compared to the experimental value of 9.64 au @xcite . \n it is interesting to note that hybrid dft functionals , which include some amount of hartree - fock exchange , appear to significantly improve on the polarizability of water . \n in particular , the average polarizability of the water molecule is 9.78 au with hybrid pbe0 functional @xcite .    in addition to water under ambient conditions \n , we have also examined how the rigid water approximation affects the properties of water under extreme temperatures and pressures . in particular , we have performed a simulation of rigid water ( simulation d ) and of flexible water ( simulation e ) at a density of 1.57 g / cc and an average temperature of @xmath1600 k. these high density and temperature conditions correspond to a regime where molecular dissociation is still considered a rare event @xcite . \n however , the pressure ( @xmath110 gpa ) is high enough to cause a large increase in the nearest neighbor coordination of each water from 4.5 at ambient conditions to nearly 13 at high pressure @xcite . \n the oxygen - oxygen , oxygen - hydrogen and hydrogen - hydrogen rdfs for simulations d and e are compared in figs . \n [ goo - hp ] to [ ghh - hp ] . \n except for the expected intramolecular differences due to the constraints , the rdfs obtained from simulations d and e are remarkably similar . \n in particular , both the large increase in the number of nearest neighbors as well as the stiffness of the first peak in g@xmath4(r ) as a function of compression are reproduced by the rigid water model @xcite . \n as higher densities and temperatures are considered , intramolecular dissociation will become an common event in flexible water simulations @xcite and the rigid water approximation is expected to be inappropriate for the description of the liquid . \n in summary , we have used a series of car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations to examine how the rigid water approximation affects the computed properties of water in the liquid state at ambient conditions . in agreement with previous observations based on empirical interaction potentials @xcite \n , the rigid water approximation is found to cause an overall decrease in structure and an increase in diffusion of the liquid . \n these changes result in properties that are in better agreement with experimental measurements than the corresponding first principles simulations with flexible water molecules . at higher temperatures and densities in a regime where intramolecular dissociation is still a rare event , the differences between simulations where water molecules are either rigid or flexible become negligible . \n in addition to an improved structural and dynamical description of water , the rigid water model enables the use of time steps as large as 0.24 fs within the car - parrinello scheme ( i.e. @xmath13 times larger than in a flexible water simulation ) . \n a similar conclusion was reached in ref .   for first - principle simulations of a cytosine molecule in the gas phase . \n this represents an important advantage for first - principle simulations of aqueous solutions where chemical reactions do not occur , and opens up the possibility of investigating phenomena that take place on a long timescale . \n for example , understanding how water orients around a hydrophobic solute may require simulations of the order of 100 to 200 ps . \n the rigid water approximation presented here may prove to be an accurate and efficient approach for describing the interaction between a hydrophobic solute and water within a first - principles context . \n + the authors would like to thank j.  c.  grossman for many useful discussions . \n this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s . \n dept .  of energy at the university of california / lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no .  w-7405-eng-48 .", "StartTimeOffset": 515684299062, "RequestID": "fd7d525ef45aef9c853a13fd5e8e45dc0968e572", "TotalTokens": 3000}

pilot studies ) . \n the left panel shows the @xmath9-z  relation found for these galaxies , with color code indicating the integrated sfr for each galaxy . \n it is appreciated that the stronger gradient in sfr is along the stellar mass , as expected for star - forming galaxies . \n once subtracted the best fitted function to the @xmath9-z  relation , the residual of the abundance do not present any evident secondary relation with the sfr ( as it is seen in the right panel ) . \n thus , the results presented in @xcite are confirmed with a sample of galaxies enlarged by almost a factor two . \n we also confirmed the local -z  relation unveiled by @xcite , with a larger statistical sample of  regions ( @xmath75000 ) . \n this nebular gas -z  relation is flatter than the one derived for the average stellar populations @xcite , but both of them agree for the younger stars , as expected if the most recent stars are born from the chmical enriched ism . in @xcite , we confirmed that the abundance gradients present a common slope up to @xmath72 effective radii , with a distribution compatible with being produced by random fluctuations , for all galaxies when normalized to the disk effective radius of @xmath100.1 dex/@xmath6 . \n finally , in @xcite , we found evidence that  regions keep a memory of their past , by analysing the correspondance between the properties of these ionized regiones with that of their underlying stellar populations . \n in summary the results from the califa survey present a coherent picture of the mass - growth and chemical enrichment of galaxies . \n all the results indicate that the bulk of the galaxy population presents an inside - out growth ( at the mass range covered by the survey ) , with a chemical enrichment dominated by local processes , and limited effects by processes like outflows or radial mixing .", "StartTimeOffset": 534216803088, "RequestID": "390dc83e0cd288f1f0cea5a95ffc795e16270138", "TotalTokens": 2679}

{"ContextTokens": 2226, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "sometimes , when carrying out a preliminary computation in order to be sure that well understood llimits of a problem are handled correctly , results which are interesting in their own right emerge . \n i will now discuss one such result which i have obtained as part of such a preliminary study of the hubbard model .    the hubbard model at half - filling is equivalent to a heisenberg anti - ferromagnet ( haf ) and it is important to show that core treats this limiit correctly . \n this was shown to be the case for the spin-1/2 haf in ref.@xcite . \n what that paper did not address was the subtle question of how the physics of the one - dimensional anti - ferromagnet changes when the spin-1/2 on each lattice site is replaced by spin @xmath1 . in 1983 \n it was argued by f.d.m . \n haldane , ref.@xcite that when @xmath1 is a half - integer , then the spectrum has no mass - gap , but when @xmath1 is an integer , a mass - gap develops . in this talk \n i describe a core computation for the spin-1/2 and spin-1 anti - ferromagnet which not only supports haldane s conjecture , but shows how the spin-1 case leads to an understanding of a more general class of theories defined by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 about which , until now , very little was known . . \n the core method consists of two parts . \n first , a theorem which defines the hamiltonian analogue of wilson s exact renormalization group transformation ; second , a set of approximation procedures which render the calculation of the _ renormalized hamiltonian _ doable . \n core replaces the lagrangian notion of integrating out degrees of freedom by that of throwing away hilbert space states ; i.e. , defining a ojection operator , @xmath3 , which acts on the original hilbert space , @xmath4 to create the space of _ retained states _ @xmath5 . \n the central feature of this approach is a formula which relates the original hamiltonian , @xmath6 , to a _ \n renormalized hamiltonian _ , @xmath7 , which acts on @xmath8 and which has , in a sense which was made precise in ref.@xcite , exactly the same low energy physics as @xmath6 . \n this formula is @xmath9 } [ [ t(t ) h t(t ) ] ] \\sqrt{[[t(t)^2 ] ] }   \\label{basicform}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and where we have defined @xmath11= p o p$ ] for any operator @xmath12 which acts on @xmath4 . \n it was explained in ref.@xcite that @xmath13 is an extensive operator and can be written as a sum of finite - range connected operators ; i.e. , @xmath14 where each @xmath15 can be computed on a finite sublattice of the original infinite lattice . \n although this formula involves an infinite number of terms examples have shown that a highly accurate approximation to @xmath13 only requires computing a few terms in the cluster expansion , typically range-2 and/or range-3 terms are adequate . \n to obtain the hamiltonian for a general heisenberg anti - ferromagnet set @xmath16 in eq.[betaham ] . \n the complete discusion of a range-2 calculation for the spin-1/2 haf appears in ref.@xcite and only a brief review of the results will be discussed here . \n all core computations begin with a choice of a thinning procedure and the procedure used in ref.@xcite was based upon dividing the lattice into three site blocks @xmath17 , and solving the corresponding block - hamiltonian ( obtained by restricting the full hamiltonian to those terms which are completely contained in block @xmath17 ) , keeping a small set of low - lying eigenstates . since the haf hamiltonian has an @xmath18 symmetry its eigenstates fall into degenerate multiplets and to guarantee that the renormalized hamiltonian has the same symmetry as the original it is necessary to keep full multiplets . \n three - site blocks were chosen for the spin-1/2 haf because that is the smallest size block for which a non - trivial core computation can be done . \n this is because the eigenstates of the two - site block - hamiltonian fall into spin-0 and spin-1 multiplets , with the spin-0 state having the lowest energy and keeping only the lowest lying multiplet would amount to keeping a single state , a trivial renormalization group transformation . \n going to three sites avoids this problem since the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian fall into two spin-1/2 multiplets and one spin-3/2 multiplet . in this case one of the spin-1/2 multiplets has the lowest energy and so truncating to the space generated by keeping only these two - states per block leads to a renormalized hamiltonian for which the operator @xmath19 is a multiple of the unit matrix and @xmath20 is , up to a multiplicative constant which is less than unity , exactly the same starting hamiltonian ; i.e. , the spin-1/2 haf hamiltonian is at a fixed point of the core transformation . \n iterating this calculation shows the spin-1/2 haf is massless , in agreement with what is known about this system . \n the same calculation produces a ground - state energy density which is within one - percent of the exact answer .      applying the same three site blocking to the spin-1 haf yields a different result . in this case \n the eigenstates of the block hamiltonian fall into a spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 multiplet , with the spin-1 multiplet having the lowest energy . \n truncating to the space generated by keeping only the spin-1 multiplet per block gives , as in the spin-1/2 case , @xmath19 proportional to the unit matrix , but now @xmath20 takes the more general form @xmath21 thus , after one three site blocking the core analysis of the spn-1 haf turns into the study of renormalization group flows for the theory defined by @xmath22 where i have ignored the term proportional to the identiy operator . except for the special values @xmath23 \n very little is known about the hamiltonian eq.[genham ] . the case @xmath24 is special , in that it can be solved for the groundstate , which is a valence - bond solid with a non - vanishing mass gap . moreover , when @xmath25 the theory can be solved by means of the bethe - ansatz and is massless . \n finally , when @xmath26 the theory becomes @xmath27 symmetric and it is conjectured that the mass gap vanishes at this point too , although no exact result is known for this case .    unlike the spin-1/2 case sensible core computations can be done for the spin-1 system defined by eq.[genham ] using either two or three - site blocking . \n if two - site blocks are used , then the states of the block hamiltonian fall into a spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 representation and keeping the spin-0 and spin-1 states defines a non - trivial renormalization group transformation . \n the determination that the spin-0 and spin-1 multiplets are the ones to keep is made by studying the @xmath28 dependence of their energies . \n this shows that one of these representations always lies lowest in energy and that they become degenerate and then cros at @xmath24 . \n similarly , the eigenstates of the three - site hamiltonian divide into one spin-3 , two spin-2 , three spin-1 and one spin-0 representations of @xmath18 and a study of the @xmath28 dependence of the eigenenergies shows that the lowest lying spin-0 and spin-1 states are the ones to keep because one or the other of these multiplets always lies lowest in energy and they become degenerate and cross at @xmath24 . since either two or three site blocking leads to the same truncation algorithm i study the two - site blocking procedure because it is easier to carry out . \n the approximate , range-2 , two - site blocking core computation of the mass gap for @xmath29 is shown in the figure . \n several points should be made about this plot . \n first , the core computation solves the @xmath24 case exactly . \n analysis of the flow at this point shows that at each renormalized hamiltonian is isomorphic to a dimerized spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnet and the fixed point is the place where one of the two nearest neighbor couplings vanish . \n furthermore , all of the hamiltonians defined by eq.[genham ] flow to the same massive fixed point for the range of @xmath28 shown in the graph . \n the general picture which emerges from this calculation is that there are three fixed points to the flow in this region , an attractive , massive fixed point at @xmath24 ( the valence - bond solid ) and two repulsive massles fixed points near @xmath30 . \n the fact that the mass gap does nt vanish for @xmath31 but for a value of @xmath28 which is 10% further from the valence bond solid point is typical of what occurs in range-2 approximations . \n going to range-3 or better should reduce this error by an order of magnitude . \n the reason i cut off the plot at @xmath32 , before the massgap goes to zero , is that at this point the theory becomes @xmath27 symmetric ( a fact which is obvious from the core computation ) and so the spin-0 and spin-2 representations become degenerate . because the program i wrote to do this calculation just grabbed the four lowest lying states the calculation destroys the manifest @xmath18 symmetry.a clearly a more careful programming job has to be done to go beyond this pont keeping the symmetry intact . \n note , the calculated mass gap is shown by the solid curve , the dotted curve is just included to heuristically remind the reader of what might be expected in an exact calculation . \n note , the spin-1 haf at @xmath16 lies quite close to the @xmath24 point where the core computation is exact and is well within in the basin of attraction of the massive theory , thus providing the advertised support for the haldane conjecture .", "StartTimeOffset": 570254717046, "RequestID": "0a66a2a62bf508c6b9f0387f10f3e6b85c8f61f0", "TotalTokens": 2368}

negligible contribution to the ` underlying event structure ' even at the collider energies . \n the primary partons are grouped together to form a massive beam cluster with its four - momentum given by the sum of the parton momenta and its position given by the 3-vector mean of the partons positions . \n \\5 ) the decay probability density of each parton cluster into final state hadrons including hadronic resonances is chosen to be a hagedorn density state . \n the appropriate spin , flavor , and phase - space factors are also taken into account . in the decay of parton \n / beam cluster , higher hadronic resonance states up to mass of 2gev can be produced in our model . \n to summarize , the main different points from original version are 1 ) baryonic cluster formation . \n 2 ) inclusion of higher hadronic resonance up to mass of 2gev . \n 3 ) exact conservation of flavor , i.e. ( baryon number , charge , etc ) . \n 4 ) reasonable total momentum conservation : total momentum is conserved within 10% at rhic energy for central au+au collision . \n since our version of parton cascade code differs from original version of vni , we have to check the model parameters . \n first , particle spectra from @xmath1 collisions at @xmath24gev calculated by the modified version of vni are studied to see the model parameter dependence . here \n we see the @xmath0-factor dependence as mentioned in ref .  @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig : pp_exp ] , experimental data on pseudorapidity distributions ( left panel ) and the invariant cross sections ( right panel ) are compared to the calculation of the parton cascade model with different parameters on the treatment of so - called @xmath0-factor . \n the calculations ( upper three figures ) are done by adding the constant factor to the reading - order pqcd cross sections : @xmath25 with values @xmath26 . while bottom figure corresponds to the calculation changing the @xmath27 scale in the running coupling constant @xmath28 as @xmath29 with the value @xmath30 . \n we also plot the contribution from parton cluster decay in the left panel with dotted lines . \n the contribution of parton cluster decay which is come from interacted parton coalescence changes according to the choice of the correction scheme . \n we can fit the @xmath1 data of pseudorapidity distributions with different correction schemes as seen in fig . \n [ fig : pp_exp ] by changing the parameter ( in actual code , parv(91 ) ) which controls the multiplicity from beam cluster . \n we have to check the model with various elementary data including incident energy dependence in order to fix model parameters . \n next we will present some results on nuclear collisions with those parameters . \n the baryon stopping problem is one of the important element in nucleus - nucleus collisions . \n original version of vni implicitly assumed baryon free region at midrapidity , because baryonic parton cluster formation is not included . \n baryons only come from beam cluster , not parton cluster formation in the original version of vni . \n we can now discuss the baryon stopping problem with our modified version of vni . \n we have calculated the net proton distribution at sps energy to show the reliability of the modeling of beam cluster formation in the parton cascade model . \n [ fig : pbpb_rap ] compares the parton cascade calculation for pb+pb collision at the laboratory energy of @xmath31 agev with the @xmath0-factor 1.0 ( original version uses @xmath32 ) of net protons with the data  @xcite . \n it is seen that contribution from parton cluster is neglibigly small , thus baryon stopping behavior is fully explained by soft physics ( in this case , beam cluster decay ) when we chose the @xmath0-factor 1.0 at sps energies . it should be noted that there is no microscopic dynamics in the modeling of the beam cluster formation in the parton cascade model , but it is a simple fit to the data of @xmath4 collisions . \n the @xmath0-factor dependence of both net proton and charged particle rapidity distribution are studied in fig . \n [ fig : rap ] in terms of net proton distribution , there is no strong @xmath0-factor dependence . \n we can see that parton cluster formation and its decay predict almost baryon free at mid - rapidity region regardless of the choice of @xmath0-factor , though there are lots of protons and antiprotons at mid - rapidity . \n we conclude that hard parton scattering plays no rule for the baryon stopping within a parton cascade model . \n however , note that string based model like hijing / b  @xcite predicts proton rapidity density of 10 and urqmd predicts  @xcite 12.5 at mid - rapidity . however , as pointed out in ref . \n @xcite , charged hadron multiplicity is strongly depend on how to chose the leading order correction scheme . \n [ fig : rap_netq ] displays the net baryon number distributions as a function of rapidity obtained by parton distribution from parton cascade before hadronization with the @xmath0-factor of 1 ( left ) and 2.5 ( right ) . \n net baryon number of time - like partons are distributed around mid rapidity region but its contribution are small as consistent with the net proton distribution in fig . \n [ fig : rap ] . \n in summary , first , we have checked that different treatments for the inclusion of higher - order pqcd corrections in parton cascade model can fit the elementary @xmath1 collisions . \n we have to check other elementary processes to fix the model parameters . \n we show the net proton rapidity distribution at sps energies to demonstrate that the beam cluster treats underlying soft physics in the parton cascade model reasonably well for nucleus nucleus collisions . \n then , we have calculated the net proton rapidity distribution at rhic energy as well as charged particle distributions using modified version of parton cascade code vni in which we newly introduced baryonic parton cluster formation and higher hadronic resonance states from decay of parton and beam cluster . within a framework of perturbative parton cascading and dynamical hadronization scheme , we predict almost baryon free plasma at rhic energy . \n the charged particle rapidity distributions are also studied with the parameter set which are fitted by @xmath1 collisions . \n strong @xmath0-factor dependence on the hadron multiplicity is seen as previously being found by ref . \n we can not fix the @xmath0-factor from only rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for @xmath33 collisions .    in this work , \n we consider only two or three parton coalescence , but in dense parton matter produced in heavy ion collisions , this assumption might be broken down . \n inverse processes like hadron conversion to parton such as @xmath34 are also ignored which might become important at higher colliding energies . \n this work should have been collaborated with klaus geiger if he had not had perished in the air crash . \n i would like to thank dr . \n s. a. bass and prof . \n r. s. longacre for careful reading of this paper and useful comments . \n i am indebted to s. ohta for encouragements and useful comments . \n s. jeon and j. kapusta , . \n k. werner , ; . \n h. sorge , . \n s. e. vance , m. gyulassy and x. n. wang , . \n s. e. vance and m. gyulassy , ; e -

{"ContextTokens": 4009, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "perfect crystal neutron interferometry was first demonstrated in 1974 at the @xmath3kw triga mark - ii reactor in vienna @xcite . \n ever since neutron optical experiments , based on interference of matter waves , have provided a power full means of demonstrating effects related to fundamental aspects of quantum physics @xcite , such as measuring the @xmath4-periodicity of fermions @xcite , gravitational effects on the neutron @xcite , spin superposition @xcite and topological phases @xcite . \n entanglement between different degrees of freedom like the neutron s spin , energy and path have been accomplished @xcite and used for testing bell s inequality @xcite or measuring the influence of geometric phases @xcite . \n such entanglement is achieved within single particles . \n further demonstrations of the contextual nature of quantum mechanics ( qm ) have been performed successfully using neutron interferometry @xcite . \n the violation of the bell inequality can only be shown with high interference contrast and high spin polarisation . in the first experiment @xcite \n a mu - metal sheet was used as a spin turner , which induced dephasing due to small angle scattering and thereby reduced the interference contrast . the next setup \n @xcite solved the problem of dephasing but the degree of polarisation became problematic .    in this paper we report a significantly improved experimental setup . \n we designed new dc spin - turners and larmor - accelerators which allow for very high contrast of the interference fringes and high temperature stability during long measurements . \n they also enable high degrees of polarisation and high efficiency spin manipulation . \n this setup allows a large variety of state preparations and therefore provides capability for many future experiments @xcite . \n we performed a test of bell s inequality using this new setup . \n the results reveal the substantial improvements achieved by the newly designed setup . \n in our setup high degrees of polarisation , thermal stability , efficient spin - manipulation and spin - analysis are required . \n former setups had drawbacks that degrade the quality of the measurement results . \n these setups used conventional dc spin - turners or rf - flippers inside the ifm . \n such setups were used for spin - superposition , geometric phase and entanglement measurements @xcite . for earlier bell - measurement using single - neutron interferometry two different setups \n were realized @xcite . in both setups \n the spin manipulation in the interferometer ( ifm ) was problematic : the contrast and the degree of polarisation were reduced . \n these two setups are shown in figure [ fig : old_setup ] . \n scheme [ fig : old_setup]a ) shows the ifm with inserted soft magnetic mu - metal foil as a spin turner . \n this is achieved by a magnetic field induced into the mu - metal by a dc - coil outside of the ifm . \n the mu - metal foil considerably reduced the contrast of the ifm due to dephasing . to overcome this problem another setup \n was designed , which does not need any material in the neutron beam in the ifm @xcite , shown in figure [ fig : old_setup]b ) . in one path of the ifm \n the beam passes a tube of mu - metal which reduces the strength of the magnetic guide field and thereby induces a relative spin rotation by different larmor precession in the two ifm paths . since the guide field leaks into the cylinder at its open ends , the field homogeneity is compromised which causes depolarisation of the neutron beam \n this setup also requires a spin turner in front of the ifm which additionally reduces the degree of polarisation as described below .    a schematic view of the new setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] . \n the beam is monochromatised to have a mean wave length of @xmath5  by a silicon channel - cut perfect - crystal monochromator . \n the incoming neutron beam is polarized by two birefringent magnetic prisms which deflect beams of up- and down - spin neutrons in different directions . \n the angle between these two beams is @xmath6 rad . \n since the acceptance width of the interferometer crystal for laue diffraction is even smaller , we can select one of the spin components ( spin - up ) by adjusting the rotation angle of the ifm accordingly . \n neutrons with spin - down pass the ifm without being reflected and are blocked by a beam stopper afterwards . to avoid depolarisation of the beam a guide field is applied over the entire setup . in front of the ifm \n the spin is rotated by a dc spin - turner into the xy - plane . within this plane we can adjust the spin by utilizing larmor precession without putting any material into the beam . \n this is important to avoid loss of interference contrast due to dephasing . \n a sapphire phase shifter of @xmath7 mm thickness between second and third plate of the ifm tunes the relative phase @xmath8 between the beams in path i and path ii . behind the ifm \n the spin analysis is carried out using a dc - coil on a translation stage together with a co - ti super - mirror array . \n the neutrons are detected in @xmath9he counters with more than 99% efficiency @xcite . \n the @xmath11-spin rotator is placed between the magnetic prisms and the ifm . \n due to the small separation of spin - up- and spin - down -beam by the magnetic prisms and the fact that the selection of the peak takes place at the first plate of the ifm , wider peaks of the imf s rocking curves degrade the degree of polarization of the neutron beam . \n the peak width at the first ifm plate is determined by the monochromator and the properties of the @xmath11-spin rotator regarding small - angle scattering . \n in contrast to earlier experiments where a single reflecting monochromator was used , we used a three - fold channel - cut monochromator . \n a comparison of rocking curves by using one- and three - fold reflection is shown in figure [ fig : crystal ] . \n the full width at half maximum @xmath12 ( fwhm ) of the rocking peak of the single reflecting crystal has a fwhm@xmath13 rad , whereas the triple reflecting crystal has a fwhm@xmath14 rad : the former is 70% wider than the triple reflecting crystal .    .rocking curve comparison with spin turning coils made of different materials , normalised to the empty setup . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : coilcompaire ]    the peak broadening was measured for different coils made of copper ribbon ( @xmath15mm@xmath16 and @xmath17mm@xmath16 in profile ) , aluminium ribbon ( @xmath18mm@xmath16 in profile ) , and aluminium wire ( 0.5 mm in diameter ) . in figure \n [ fig : dc_coils ] the aluminium ribbon coil and the copper ribbon coil are shown next to an empty coil frame . \n figure [ fig : peakcomp ] shows the rocking curves for different coils in comparison to the empty . in table [ tab : coilcompaire ] the peak height and the width of the rocking curves for different coils are given in respect to the empty beam line . \n one can see that despite the small absorption and scattering cross - section of aluminium , the wire coil enlarges the width of peak and lowers the peak intensity because of small - angular scattering , whereas within the error there is no evident difference between the three ribbon coils . \n the rectangular profiled ribbons do not produce significant small - angle scattering and therefore more neutrons fulfill bragg s law . for our measurements we used @xmath19 mm wide copper ribbon for both dc spin - turners . in figure \n [ fig : double_peak ] one can see the separation of the up - spin peak and the down - spin peak with the @xmath11-spin rotator in the beam line . between the two main peaks \n one can see a small peak produced by neutrons that fulfil higher orders of the bragg condition . \n applying the two - flipper method by tuning two spin rotators before and after the ifm the degree of polarisation was measured to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 for the efficiency of the first coil and @xmath21 for the efficiency of the second coil . \n the efficiency of the @xmath11-spin rotators is reduced by the stray fields of the magnetic prisms in front of the ifm and of the super - mirror spin analyser behind it respectively . \n therefore the coils were placed as far from super mirror and magnetic prisms as possible . \n the state preparation requires two larmor accelerator coils placed in the ifm as shown in figure [ fig : setup ] . \n these coils in helmholtz geometry apply an additional parallel or anti - parallel field to the guide field in z - direction locally and thereby change the spin precession in the xy - plane . since the rotation angle is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the magnetic moment of the neutron \n , @xmath24 is the length of the coils and @xmath25 is the velocity of the neutrons , a magnetic field of about @xmath26 mt is required for a spin rotation of @xmath10 . for the fabricated coil a current of about @xmath27a \n is required for a spin rotation of @xmath10 . \n since the coils produce heat and due to the high sensitivity of the ifm to thermal influences , the coils need to be cooled down . \n to obtain constant temperature up to @xmath28@xmath29c the coils are placed in small boxes which are completely flooded with temperature controlled water . \n the coil wire is in direct contact with the water , insulated only by lacquer . \n the boxes are made of acrylic glass , which is a thermal and electrical insulator . \n length , width and height of the boxes amount to 22 , 26 and 26 mm respectively . \n figure [ fig : fotos_box]a ) shows a schematic view of a box . \n the boxes have a straight passage for the neutron beam ( green arrows ) , so that the beam does nt pass any material and therefore no dephasing occurs . \n the figure also shows the magnetic field in z - direction ( red arrow ) applied by the coils in helmholtz configuration ( yellow ) . \n the flux of the cooling water is depicted by blue arrows . \n figures [ fig : fotos_box]b ) and [ fig : fotos_box]c ) show the box without top and finished with the connectors for the water cooling respectively . in figure \n [ fig : fotos_box]d ) one can see the boxes placed in the ifm . in this picture \n the mountings for beam stoppers between second and third plate of the ifm are depicted . \n the beam stoppers are used to calibrate the larmor accelerators one at a time by blocking the other path respectively . \n the beam stoppers used here are @xmath30 mm thick cadmium plates . \n quantum mechanics ( qm ) is one of the most successful physical theories and its predictions have been proven accurately in many experiments using various kinds of systems . \n einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite argued that qm is not a complete theory since it only gives probabilistic predictions and that there must be an underlying deterministic theory to qm . in 1964 bell \n @xcite showed that local hidden variable theories satisfy some inequalities that are violated by qm . shortly after bell \n published his well known paper clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( cshs ) reformulated bell s inequalities suitable for the first experimental test of quantum non - locality @xcite . in the case of neutrons \n not two particles are entangled but two different degrees of freedom within one particle @xcite . non contextual hidden variables theories ( nchvt ) \n states that the outcome of a measurement is independent of previous or simultaneous measurements on any set of commuting observables .      in our single neutron interferometer \n we entangle two different degrees of freedom ( spatial and spin ) of a single neutron @xcite . \n the neutron is described by a tensor product hilbert space @xmath31 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the spatial wave function and @xmath33 to the spinor wave function . since observables of the spacial part commute with those of the spinor part \n one can derive a bell - like state . \n the normalized wave function is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to up- and down - spin and @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the two paths in the ifm . \n the expectation value of the joint spin and path measurement can be written as @xmath39 \\times [ \\hat{p}^p _ { \\chi ; 1 } - \\hat{p}^p _ { \\chi ; -1 } ] \\ket \\psi.\\ ] ] the observables for spin @xmath40 and path @xmath41 can be decomposed by projection operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which project onto orthogonal spin states @xmath44 and orthogonal path states @xmath45 , respectively . the expectation value given in equation [ eq : expdeff ] and \n the projection operators correspond to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the conventional epr argument @xcite . in the experiment \n the parameter @xmath49 can be varied by polarisation measurement of the bell - like state , @xmath8 is tuned by an auxiliary phase shifter . \n for single - neutron interferometry a bell - like inequality can be expressed using the expectation values @xmath50 as @xmath51 , with @xmath52 in our experiment the expectation values @xmath53 are determined by a combination of count rates @xmath54 of a single detector donated to appropriated settings of @xmath49 and @xmath8 . \n this gives : @xmath55 the count rates @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 $ ] according to quantum mechanical predictions . \n this leads to a sinusoidal behaviour of the expectation values @xmath58 . \n bell s inequality are violated for various set of polarisation analysis @xmath59 and phase shifts @xmath60 , but the largest violation is expected for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which gives the value @xmath65 . by measuring @xmath66 one can test whether or not nchvts can describe nature correctly .      for optimization of a measurement every part of the setup should be adjusted in a systematic way . \n first of all the point of highest interference contrast on the ifm , i.e. the sweet spot is looked for . \n the interferometer crystal is mapped by moving an aperture vertically and horizontally in the xz - plane in front of the ifm and measuring the contrast on each position . \n the result of such a raster scan is shown in figure [ fig : rasterscan ] . \n this scan is performed with a beam cross - section of @xmath67mm@xmath16 and a step increment of @xmath30 mm . \n one can see that only a small part of the ifm provides highest contrast , which reaches at @xmath68 . \n the contrast of the ifm is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations . \n even temperature changes by @xmath28@xmath69c destroy the interference pattern . since the guide field and \n the larmor - accelerators produce heat , both elements are water cooled . \n this is done by two temperature stabilized water pumps . to optimize the temperature of the cooling water for the guide field and the boxes , \n temperature scans are performed . in figure \n [ fig : cvst ] the contrast of the ifm is plotted for different temperatures of the cooling water in the boxes . for @xmath70@xmath71c an average contrast of @xmath72 \n is achieved . \n after stabilisation contrast up to @xmath73 can be observed as seen in figure [ fig : high_contrast ] . when the temperature is raised up to @xmath74@xmath75c the contrast drops to @xmath76 . \n a raise by @xmath30@xmath75c in temperature results in a decrease in contrast of @xmath77 . \n thermal stability is important for another crucial point , since not only loss in contrast but also considerable phase drifts occur . a temperature change of @xmath30@xmath75c in the boxes results in @xmath78rad phase shift . \n figure [ fig : phase_vs_t ] shows this situation . \n the large error bars at high temperatures arises from the low contrast obtained at this temperatures as seen in figure [ fig : cvst ] . \n both the loss in contrast as well as the phase shift resulting from thermal instability degrade the quality of measurement results . to increase the stability of the setup the ifm and the larmor accelerators \n are placed in a box to avoid air convection and therefore temperature fluctuations over long periods of time .    to determine the expectation values @xmath53 occurring in the bell - inequalities four spin - directions @xmath61 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and four phase - shifts @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 \n need to be measured . \n the spin - directions are selected by the dc spin - turner behind the ifm , while the phase shifts are tuned by the sapphire phase shifter inside the ifm . \n a set of this measurements is shown in figure [ fig : bell_complete ] . \n the data is fitted to a sinusoidal function using least squares fit method . \n the error results from statistical fluctuations in count rate and systematic errors due to imperfect spin manipulation and phase instabilities during the measurement . \n we repeated the measurements twice , in order to reduce statistical errors . by evaluating the bell inequality the s - value in equality ( [ eq : svalue ] ) \n is calculated to be @xmath86 which implies a violation by more than @xmath87 . \n we have presented a new design of the neutron - interferometer setup and new devices for spin manipulation , which considerably improve the abilities of the polarized neutron ifm . using a new coil design for the dc spin - turners and a channel - cut monochromator the degree of polarisation of the incoming beam of @xmath20 \n is achieved . \n new larmor accelerators allow the reduction of thermal disturbances on the ifm and dephasing since no material is put in the beam path inside the ifm . \n this enables high contrasts up to @xmath73 . \n the newly designed spin manipulators allow easy and precise manipulation of the neutron s spin and enable various applications for future experiments . with this setup we obtained the value of @xmath88 for bell - like inequality measurements , which is @xmath87 above the boarder of 2 and as a consequence disproves nchvt clearly . \n this work has been supported by the austrian science fund ( fwf ) , project . \n p25795 -n02 and p24973-n20 .", "StartTimeOffset": 584205987786, "RequestID": "30ace1d055067540ee7fa5a2c5be116567db1bf8", "TotalTokens": 4159}

scale of the interaction , from initial hard scattering to final state interactions by simultaneous measurement of a wide range of probes in the same detector .    here , the results on neutral pion production in the @xmath3  gev / c transverse momentum range are presented . \n high @xmath4 hadrons are produced primarily by initial hard scattering of partons , and their rate of production in @xmath5 collisions can be calculated in perturbative qcd , which simply scales to nuclear collisions by the relative number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . however , in the case of colliding nuclei , there are several nuclear effects that can modify the spectra of hadrons even in the ordinary nuclear medium , such as shadowing and @xmath4 broadening . in addition , there are predictions  @xcite that if the medium becomes very dense , the scattered partons may lose considerable energy via gluon bremsstrahlung or `` jet quenching '' . according to those predictions , this effect would cause a significant depletion of the spectra at high @xmath4 . \n the phenix detector consists of an axial - field magnet surrounded by two central arms ( called east and west ) , each one subtending @xmath6 in azimuth and @xmath7 units of pseudorapidity . \n two spectrometers at forward angles ( @xmath8 ) around the beam axis serve to identify and track muons . during the year 2000 \n data taking run , only a subset of the detectors of the central arm were read out and analyzed . \n trigger and basic event characterization was provided by two sets of beam - beam counters ( bbc ) covering @xmath9 in azimuth and @xmath10 , as well as by two zero - degree calorimeters located @xmath11 m from the collision point and covering @xmath12  @xcite . \n the primary interaction trigger is generated by the coincidence between the beam - beam counters which detect @xmath13% of the nuclear interaction cross section of @xmath14 barns . \n another trigger is generated by a coincidence between the two zero - degree calorimeters which are sensitive to unbound spectator neutrons from the nuclear interactions or from coulomb dissociation . \n the correlation between the bbc and zdc signals are used to determine the centrality of the collision . \n they are also used to establish the number of participant nucleons ( @xmath15 ) and binary collisions ( @xmath16 ) using a glauber - model calculation  @xcite . \n the central arm spectrometers consist of a multiplicity vertex detector ( mvd ) , drift chambers ( dc ) , two layers of pad chambers ( pc ) , a gas - filled ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) , a time expansion chamber ( tec ) , and a high granularity electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) consisting of eight sectors , each covering @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n six of the calorimeter sectors are lead - scintillator sampling calorimeters ( pbsc ) , while two sectors consist of lead glass calorimeters ( pbgl ) . \n the data presented here are obtained from two pbsc sectors in the west arm spectrometer , which have @xmath19 energy resolution and @xmath20  mm position resolution for electromagnetic showers in a low multiplicity environment . \n the energy calibration was established using minimum ionizing particles , maintained with a laser monitoring system , and verified from the data using @xmath21 matching for identified electrons in low multiplicity events , as well as with the mass of the @xmath0 . \n the systematic error on the overall energy scale is less than 1.5%  @xcite . \n only events taken at full magnetic field and satisfying the primary interaction trigger , as explained above , are analyzed . \n additional cuts include the measured event vertex position ( @xmath22  cm ) , consistency between the zdc and bbc interaction time measurement . \n altogether , 1.17 million events passed these cuts and form the sample referred to as `` minimum bias '' . based upon the correlation of the measured bbc charge and zdc energy , centrality classes were established as fractions of the total nuclear cross section . in this analysis \n `` central '' refers to the 0 - 10% most central collisions , while `` peripheral '' means the upper 60 - 80% range of @xmath23 . as `` peripheral '' . \n this is now replaced by the upper 60 - 80% of @xmath23 where the sample is much cleaner and the results are less biased by the inefficiencies of the trigger in the most peripheral collisions . \n the centrality selection for the `` central '' spectra is the same ( 0 - 10% most central ) , but the points and the systematic errors have been revised . ] \n neutral pions have been measured using their @xmath24 decay mode . in this measurement \n , the invariant mass of the photon pairs has to be within a narrow ( @xmath25 ) window around the observed @xmath0 mass , thus allowing for less stringent photon identification cuts , which reduces the systematic errors on efficiency losses due to these cuts . \n each cluster found in the calorimeter is subject to a timing cut : it has to arrive within 2.5 ns with respect to the expected time - of - flight of a photon coming from the event vertex ( tof cut ) . \n this cut eliminates slow hadrons , in particular anti - neutrons which are a major source of neutral clusters in the 1 - 2 gev energy range . \n in addition , the shape of each cluster is compared to the known and parametrized shape of electromagnetic showers , and the @xmath26 of the difference between the observed and predicted shower shape is calculated @xcite . \n a @xmath27 cut is then applied to the showers . \n both cuts are designed to keep the photon efficiency as high as possible . \n therefore the accepted clusters have a significant contribution for other particles which is removed by the backround subtraction method described below . \n furthermore , the efficiency of both cuts depends on the event multiplicity . \n this was verified from the data by comparing @xmath0 peak contents at a given @xmath4 extracted with different photon identification cuts , as well as by studying the effect of the cuts on well identified electrons . \n the @xmath28 invariant mass is calculated from all pairs of clusters in an event passing the photon identification cuts . \n the combinatorial background is estimated using an event mixing method , which after proper normalization , is subtracted from the invariant mass distribution . \n the @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency is calculated by the following procedure . \n first , the effect of a second particle contributing to the same cluster is investigated ( overlaps ) . \n simulated single electromagnetic showers are merged both in real and simulated events . for different single shower energies and event centralities , the distributions of the ratios of the measured and original energies are stored ( referred to as photon energy and event centrality - dependent @xmath29 `` smearing '' functions ) . \n these functions are then used in a fast monte carlo simulation as follows . \n neutral pions are generated with the expected @xmath4 distribution and allowed to decay . \n for those cases , when both decay photons reach the calorimeter , their respective energies are randomized with the appropriate @xmath29 smearing function , and the invariant mass is calculated using the randomized energies . \n the resulting simulated line - shapes are compared to line - shapes obtained from the data after mixed event subtraction . \n they agree very well , and the same cuts are applied to the data and the simulations to establish the efficiency . \n simulations are also used to determine the background from particles striking the pole - tips and structural elements of detectors in front of the calorimeter . \n an additional source of background arises from those @xmath0 s produced close to ( but not at ) the collision vertex which reconstruct in the calorimeter with the proper invariant mass , increasing the true @xmath0 yield . \n this background is also estimated using simulations ( hijing 1.35  @xcite ) . \n the calculated contribution of non - vertex but properly reconstructed @xmath0 is @xmath30 at @xmath31 and gradually decreases to @xmath32 at @xmath33 . \n this yield has been subtracted from the measured @xmath0 yield . \n the semi - inclusive transverse momentum distribution of @xmath0 in peripheral ( upper 60 - 80% of @xmath23 ) and 10% most central au+au collisions is shown in figure  [ fig : plot_pt_ua1 ] . at high \n @xmath34 the peripheral spectrum is limited by statistics . \n error bars include both statistical and systematics errors . \n both spectra are compared to @xmath4 spectra derived from nucleon - nucleon data . since there is no measurement of @xmath0 production in @xmath5 at @xmath2  gev , this reference spectrum \n is derived from ua1  @xcite and cdf  @xcite charged hadron spectra . \n first , the available data are fitted with a function @xmath35 , then the fit parameters @xmath36 are interpolated to rhic energy . \n the result is divided by @xmath37 mb for the yield and by 1.6 to obtain the pion content from the unidentified charged spectra . \n ( the actual parameter values are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . ) \n this parametrized curve is then multiplied by the estimated mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 in peripheral and central collision , respectively ) . \n the systematic error on the number of collisions is indicated by the two bands .    in peripheral collisions \n the scaled @xmath5 parametrization describes the results very well , but it significantly overpredicts the measured spectrum in central collisions , particularly at higher @xmath4 . the observed deficit in the @xmath0 yield is even more surprising if one takes into account that at 3 - 4 gev / c a cronin - type enhancement due to @xmath34 broadening above the scaled @xmath5 distribution would be expected . \n the same deficit can be seen in figure  [ fig : ratio_centperiph2 ] without referring to parametrized @xmath5 results . \n both the central and the peripheral spectra are normalized by the respective number of binary collisions , then divided point - by - point . \n the central / peripheral ratios are shown as triangles , and the error bars are statistical . \n the solid line gives the upper limit on the ratio if the systematic errors of the @xmath0 spectra are added in quadrature . \n the dashed line adds ( in quadrature ) the systematic error on the number of collisions ( @xmath16 ) . \n the central / peripheral ratio , normalized by @xmath16 , is expected to be one in the case of simple scaling with @xmath16 . \n however , the measured ratio is much smaller . \n the expected range of the central / peripheral ratio with a cronin - effect included is also shown . \n figure  [ fig : ptdist_wang_cent10 ] shows the results for both the peripheral and central collisions compared to three theoretical calculations  @xcite ( curves ) . \n the solid lines are a straightforward pqcd calculation for @xmath5 , with simple scaling to au - au collisions by the mean number of binary collisions @xcite . \n the dotted lines are a calculation where effects of nuclear shadowing and @xmath4 broadening are added , and result in a change of slope , suppressing the soft part of the spectrum and enhancing the hard scattering part ( cronin effect ) . \n the calculation plotted with dashed lines adds a constant @xmath43 parton energy loss to the shadowing and @xmath4 broadening . \n the peripheral data are consistent with all three scenarios \n . however , the central data are well below the first and second ( pqcd and shadowing / cronin ) curve , but they are not inconsistent with the third scenario that includes a parton energy loss . \n transverse momentum spectra for neutral pions in central and peripheral @xmath2 gev au+au collisions have been presented . \n the peripheral spectrum is consistent with the simple scaling of @xmath5 collisions with the mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . in the central spectra , \n a significant deficit with respect to this point - like scaling is observed at high transverse momenta .    9 x.n . \n wang , phys . \n c , ( 61 ) 064910 ( 2000 ) p. levai , g. papp , g. fai , m. gyulassy , nucl -

{"ContextTokens": 3273, "GeneratedTokens": 229, "SynthesizedBody": "a neutron star , born with a non - degenerate companion , initially spins down because of the drag of the magnetic dipole torque . \n a wind from the hot surface of the companion disperses the pulsed signal and it is radio silent . \n later in the companion s evolution when it overflows the roche lobe , mass transfer commences to spin up the neutron star . \n it has begun what is believed to be its evolution from an old star with long period and fairly high magnetic field to a millisecond ( ms ) pulsar with low field @xcite . during the intermediate stage it emits x - rays because the surface and accretion ring are heated to high temperature . \n accreting canonical neutron stars would take only @xmath0 y at an accretion rate of @xmath1/y to attain a period of 2 ms ( = 500 hz ) and any asymmetry in the accretion pattern would cause millisecond variability in x - ray emission as was foreseen many years ago @xcite . \n this expectation has been realized in the last several years in numerous discoveries made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) . \n ( see van der klis for a critical review and discussion @xcite . ) \n one of the big surprises is that most of the frequencies observed in these objects , generally interpreted as spin frequencies , seem to be clustered in a small band , or spike at @xmath2 hz . \n several suggestions as to the origin of frequency clustering and much relevant research has been published . in one scenario , \n a small quadrupole distortion provided by a thermally induced density asymmetry creates gravitational waves whose torque balances that applied by accreting matter at the observed critical frequencies @xcite . \n alternately , rossby waves may be excited in the crust of the neutron star which trigger a thermal runaway of the r - mode , reducing the spin below the excitation frequency , at which time accretion may again spin up the star . \n this cycle may be repeated several times before the donor star is consumed @xcite . \n we propose yet another mechanism \n a natural extension of our earlier work  that could _ temporarily _ stall spinup for an epoch of @xmath3 y and therefore lead to a frequency clustering in the population , while allowing a further evolution to the ms pulsar stage @xcite . \n the density in the interior of neutron stars is a few times nuclear density . at such densities \n it is quite plausible that quarks lose their association with particular hadrons \n the more compressible deconfined quark matter phase replaces the normal phase in the core of the star . \n such a quark matter core does not endow the hybrid star itself with any remarkable property aside from reducing the limiting mass , generally to values @xmath4small compared to models of neutron stars that are made purely of neutrons  but quite in agreement with observed masses @xcite . \n moreover , there are grounds to believe that neutron star masses do in fact fall in a very small interval , bounded from below by the chandrasekhar limit on the iron core mass in the pre - supernova star , and above by the neutron star mass which is limited by any one of three possible phase transitions , hyperonization , kaon condensation and quark deconfinement @xcite . \n we shall assume therefore that canonical pulsars  like the crab and more slowly rotating ones  have a quark matter core essentially from birth and that neutron stars fall in a narrow mass range .    by comparison , \n millisecond pulsars are centrifugally flattened in the equatorial plane and the density is diluted in the interior . \n we shall suppose that the critical phase transition density lies between the diluted density of ms pulsars and the density at the center of canonical pulsars . \n then as a ms pulsar spins down , or as a canonical neutron star at some stage begins accreting matter from a companion and is spun up , a change in density distribution paced by the changing centrifugal force will , in some critical frequency range , cause a change of phase of matter in an expanding region of the core . in the case of spindown of an isolated ms pulsar , self - gravity and the weight of the surrounding part of \n the star will squeeze the more compressible high - density phase that is forming in the interior . \n conversely , an accreting neutron star that is being spun up , will , over time , spin out the already present quark phase . in either case , the moment of inertia will progressively alter with the change of phase of matter and therefore the star s spin rate will adjust to conserve angular momentum that is not being carried off by radiation or supplied by accreted matter fast enough . \n for this reason , a spin anomaly should occur in both types of objects , ms pulsars and x - ray neutron stars in binaries , if it occurs in either . \n the phase change manifests itself as a temporary governer on spin causing changes in rotational frequency to stall in about the same range in the two types of objects . \n the population of x - ray accreters should exhibit more objects in the critical frequency range than in neighboring ones . \n this appears to be the meaning of recent discoveries made with the rxte @xcite . \n the effect of a phase transition on the population of ms pulsars is less direct since it involves a convolution of our results for x - ray accreters . \n previously , it was found for ms pulsars that the mixed phase in a model star converts to pure quark matter , first at the center and then in an expanding region , paced by the slow loss of angular momentum to radiation @xcite . \n the consequent decrease in the moment of inertia could even introduce an era of _ spinup _ lasting for @xmath5 years or @xmath6 of the spindown time @xcite . \n the anomalous spinup of our model star occurred in a small frequency band around 220 hz @xcite . \n such a response of the moment of inertia to a change of phase occasioned by changing spin is very like the so - called `` backbending '' in rotating nuclei caused by coriolis quenching of bcs nucleon spin pairing predicted by mottelson and valatin @xcite and discovered in the 1970s @xcite . \n ( compare figs . \n [ nucleusf ] and [ oif ] . ) \n it is clear from the foregoing discussion that in our model , the particular details of the accretion process do not determine in what range the spinup stalls for a time . \n we therefore use a simple schematic model of accretion in which the spin - up torque of the accreting matter causes a change in the star s angular momentum @xmath7 according to the relation @xcite @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ( @xmath10 ) . \n the first term represents the torque applied by the accreting matter and the second by the magnetic field of the neutron star and the viscosity of matter in the accretion ring . \n the star s magnetic moment is denoted by @xmath11 , the co -

[ \n fig : nue ] . in both figs . \n [ fig : it ] and [ fig : nue ] we assume that @xmath36 is accreted . \n otherwise the maximum frequency attained is less . \n we compute a frequency distribution of x - ray stars in low - mass binaries ( lmxbs ) from fig . \n [ fig : nue ] , for _ one _ accretion rate , by assuming that neutron stars begin their accretion evolution at the average rate of one per million years . \n a different rate will only shift some neutron stars from one bin to an adjacent one . \n the donor masses in the binaries are believed to range between @xmath37 and we assume a uniform distribution in this range . \n the resulting frequency distribution of x - ray neutron stars is shown in fig . \n [ fig : bin ] ; it is striking . \n spinout of the quark matter core as the neutron star spins up is signalled by a spike in the distribution which would be absent if there were no phase transition in our model of the neutron star . \n the position of the spike depends only on the stellar model . \n but the weight of the spike as compared to the high frequency tail depends sensitively on the weight with which the donor masses are assigned , the initial mass function of the accreting neutron stars ( for which we have taken only one mass ) , and to a minor degree on the accretion rate . a donor of mass @xmath38 contributes only to the spike , while all greater masses contribute to the spike and to higher frequency x - ray stars . \n objects above about 400 hz are unstable to collapse to very high - spin black holes \n . accretors of lower initial mass than we assume would contribute to the long high - frequency tail as well , possibly , to the spike . \n theoretically , a phase transition can ( but not necessarily does ) cause a distinct clustering in frequency of x - ray accreters , which is independent of details of accretion , such as rate , mass accreted so long as it exceeds a small minimum value ( @xmath39 ) , or indeed to the particular description of accretion mechanism that we employ . as emphasized , the position of the peak is an intrinsic property of our model star . \n but the transition can also occur unheralded by any remarkable signal @xcite . \n the apparent frequency clustering of x - ray neutron stars is about 100 hz higher than calculated . \n this discrepancy should not be surprising in view of our ignorance of the equation of state  above saturation density of nuclear matter and the necessarily crude representation of hadronic matter in the two phases in the absence of relevant solutions to the fundamental qcd theory of strong interactions . \n but however crude any model of hadronic matter may be , the physics underlying the effect of a phase transition on spin rate is robust , although not inevitable . \n we have cited an analogous phenomenon discovered in rotating nuclei @xcite .    the data in fig . \n [ fig : bin ] is gathered from tables 24 of the review article of van der klis concerning discoveries made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite . \n the interpretation of millisecond oscillations in the x - ray emission , either that found in bursts or of the difference between twin quasi - periodic oscillations in x - ray brightness , is ambiguous in some cases . \n for example , some of the burst data near 600 hz may actually represent twice the rotational frequency of the star . \n for this and other caveats , see the review article @xcite . \n nevertheless , the basic feature will probably survive  a clustering of x - ray neutron stars at moderate spin and a high spin tail . \n certainly there are high spin _ \n pulsars_. a histogram of _ ms pulsar _ \n frequencies shows a concentration around 200 hz , and a tail extending to @xmath40 hz as shown in fig . \n [ fig : princeton ] . \n so both the ( sparse ) data on x - ray objects and on ms pulsars seem to agree on a peak in the number of stars at moderate spin and on attenuation at high spin . for ms pulsars \n the attenuation may be partly a selection effect due to interstellar dispersion of the radio signal .    to summarize , we suggest that the apparent clustering in rotation frequency of accreting x - ray neutron stars in low - mass binaries may be caused by the progressive conversion of quark matter in the core to confined hadronic matter , paced by the slow spinup due to mass accretion . when conversion is completed , normal accretion driven spinup resumes . to distinguish this conjecture from others \n , one would have to discover the inverse phenomenon  a spin anomaly near the same frequency in an isolated ms pulsar @xcite . if such a discovery were made , and the apparent clustering of x - ray accreters is confirmed , we would have some degree of confidence in the hypothesis that a phase of matter such as existed in the very early universe , is reformed in a cold state during the birth of neutron stars . + \n this work was supported by the director , office of energy research , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of nuclear physics , of the u.s . \n department of energy under contract de - ac03 - 76sf00098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 590728756914, "RequestID": "55432e5752ab2c3ea3b8aba9991c931c926fbecb", "TotalTokens": 3502}

hughes et al . \n 2001 ) . this new deep \n _ chandra _ \n observation is an essential part of our multi - wavelength campaign on g292.0 + 1.8 , including new observations in the radio , infrared , optical , and x - ray bands . \n here we report on first results from the new _ chandra _ images : a large - scale overview of the snr in   2 and new insights into the nature of the pwn in \n a description of the observations , data reduction , and results from extensive spectral and imaging analyses of detailed substructures of the snr and pwn will be presented elsewhere . \n figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows an x - ray color image of g292.0 + 1.8 created from our deep _ \n chandra _ data . \n the outer boundary of the radio snr is overlaid with a white contour . \n the energy bands displayed in each color were chosen to emphasize major atomic line emission that illustrates the distribution of electron temperatures and ionization states across the snr ( table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) . \n we note that line and underlying continuum emission is included in each subband ; e.g. , the bright blue emission near the snr s center is dominated by synchrotron emission from the pwn ( see the inset in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ; hughes et al . \n our deep acis - i exposure comprehensively images the entire snr to its faint outermost edge , which matches well the extent of the radio remnant ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) and traces the location of the blast wave . \n ejecta knots ( park et al .  2004 , gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ) appear brightly colored  yellow , green or blue  in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . \n they extend closest to the rim in the west and south and are furthest away in the se quadrant . due to their red - orange color in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] and \n positional coincidence with [ o iii ] ejecta @xcite , the southernmost x - ray knots are likely to be o - rich as well . \n the snr s full diameter is @xmath89@xmath96 ( n - s ) and @xmath88@xmath94 ( e - w ) , corresponding to physical sizes of @xmath814.7@xmath016.7 @xmath10 pc , where @xmath10 is the distance to g292.0 + 1.8 in units of 6 kpc , the distance we assume throughout @xcite . \n our new image of g292.0 + 1.8 shows little evidence for the featureless , spectrally - hard , and geometrically - thin x - ray filaments that trace sites of efficient particle acceleration in other young snrs , such as cas a , tycho , and sn 1006 . \n instead the snr s rim is defined by spectrally - soft emission that is faint and diffuse in places ( e.g. , the se rim ) and filamentary elsewhere . \n particle acceleration is evidently occurring under rather different conditions in g292.0 + 1.8 than other young galactic snrs . \n the snr interior contains a complex network of knots and filaments with a variety of colors and morphologies . \n the overall color distribution of these features is highly asymmetric ; red - orange emission is dominant in the s - se , while the w - nw regions are bright in emission appearing green - blue in color . \n we are confident that these variations largely reflect differences in the underlying distributions of gas temperature and ionization in the metal - rich ejecta , rather than variable foreground absorption . \n this is supported by the relative spatial distributions of the ne he@xmath11 and ly@xmath11 lines . because these lines are separated in energy by only @xmath80.1 kev \n , their flux ratio is insensitive to absorption variations . \n the equivalent width maps show that ne he@xmath11 emission is relatively enhanced in the s - se , while ne ly@xmath11 emission is enhanced in the w - nw @xcite . \n the metal abundance variation is also unlikely a significant contributor for the observed large - scale color variation based on our hardness ratio ( hr ) analysis ( see below ) . \n we constructed a hr map ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) to investigate further the variation in the thermodynamic state of the ejecta across g292.0 + 1.8 . \n ( for technical reasons we added the continuum component [ @xmath12 @xmath13 1.25 kev ] to the soft band line emission to enhance the hard band lines and suppress the strong hard continuum emission from the pwn . ) \n there are prominent enhancements in figure  [ fig : fig2]a near the w and nw boundary of the snr that generally trace `` fingers '' of hot ejecta protruding out to the very boundary of the snr ( green - blue filaments in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . \n there is also an overall large - scale variation from hr values @xmath82.4 in the hard `` nw '' region to @xmath81.1 in the soft `` se '' region ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) . \n example spectra extracted from small regions within the larger `` nw '' and `` se '' regions clearly show the distinctive line ratios responsible for the observed hr variation ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) . \n we can draw on our previous work fitting the spectra of individual knots to relate hr values to plasma temperatures . \n spectral region 3 from park et al . \n ( 2004 ) lies in the hard `` nw '' region , and spectral analysis yields a best - fit @xmath14 kev , corresponding to hr @xmath8 2.5 . \n we find that this hr value strongly traces the electron temperature rather than on individual elemental abundances . \n although we did not study knots in the soft `` se '' region previously , our preliminary spectral modeling of the se regions favors significantly lower temperatures ( @xmath15 @xmath8 0.7 kev ) , corresponding to hr values @xmath8 1.0 . \n thus , the observed hr distribution reveals a large - scale spatial variation of thermal condition of metal - rich ejecta , which could not be detected by previous low - resolution data @xcite ; i.e. , a significantly higher temperature of the hot gas ( @xmath15 @xmath8 5 kev ) is implied in the n - w regions , while a relatively lower - temperature plasma ( @xmath15 @xmath16 1 kev ) prevails in the s - e regions of the snr . \n there is also a very similar and highly significant gradient in the optical properties of g292.0 + 1.8 . \n the region with the lowest hr values is coincident with the bulk of the optical [ o iii ] emission indicated by `` se '' region in figure  [ fig : fig2]a @xcite . across the projected middle of the snr ( within an @xmath83@xmath6 wide region \n aligned roughly n - s ) , there are dozens of isolated optical knots ( generally uncorrelated with x - ray knots ) , while on the western edge no optical emission appears at all . \n this high degree of correlation between the optical and x - ray properties suggests the possibility that radiative cooling in the ejecta is responsible for the se - nw gradient in observed properties . in this picture \n , the se ejecta would be undergoing significant , perhaps catastrophic cooling . across the projected middle of the snr \n , cooling is probably just beginning to occur in isolated knots that happen to have the appropriate thermodynamic conditions , while the emission toward the nw remains fully nonradiative . \n variation in the ambient density surrounding g292.0 + 1.8 could provide an explanation for the observed asymmetry in the ejecta properties . however , there is no evidence for a higher density in the se regions @xcite as would be expected . \n in fact , 60 @xmath17 m images are unlikely to be real because of the highly processed nature of both images . \n the _ iso _ \n image was constructed from a rastor scan of many pointings using a @xmath18 pixel ( @xmath845@xmath19 per pixel ) ir array that , unfortunately , did not fully cover the se rim of the snr . \n the _ iras _ image , which did cover the entire snr , was the result of an image reconstruction process intended to improve the angular resolution from the native value of several arcminutes to the level of 1@xmath20@xmath02@xmath20 . given these significant differences , the overall general agreement between the images , specifically , the brightness of the sw rim and the faintness toward the se , seems reasonable to us . ] \n ( see upper right and upper left insets to figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) show that around the rim of the snr the se region is a minimum in flux , while the sw is a maximum . \n thus , albeit somewhat speculative at the current stage of the analysis , we raise the possibility that the ejecta asymmetry has its origin in some intrinsic asymmetry of the sn explosion itself , such as a variation in the density or velocity distribution from se to nw . \n further work including detailed x - ray spectral analysis of ejecta and hydrodynamic studies appropriate for g292.0 + 1.8 are required to test this asymmetric explosion scenario . \n previous _ chandra _ observations of g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite revealed a point source , now known to be the pulsar j1124@xmath05916 @xcite , powering an extended synchrotron nebula @xcite ( see the lower left inset to figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . \n the emission from the pulsar itself was observed to be surrounded by a compact elliptical structure roughly 1@xmath218 @xmath7 1@xmath19 in size . \n our deep acis - i observation confirms this structure , and reveals additional faint emission suggestive of a jet / torus structure ( @xmath22 in jet length and torus radius , repectively ; see the lower right inset to figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) similar to those observed to form just outside the pulsar wind termination shock region in a number of other young pwne ( e.g. , gaensler & slane 2006 and references therein ) . \n our preliminary spectral analysis indicates that these features show a power law spectrum with photon index @xmath23 @xmath8 1.5@xmath01.8 , supporting the idea that they are synchrotron emission associated with the pwn . \n the ratio between the n - s and e - w sizes of the torus implies an inclination of the axis of the torus ( with respect to the line of sight ) of @xmath820@xmath24 . \n physical sizes are then @xmath80.4 @xmath10 pc for the jet and a radius of @xmath80.15 @xmath10 pc for the torus . \n this is similar to the size of the jet / torus structure observed in 3c  58 @xcite , although we note that there is large variation in the size and relative brightness of such structures from system to system . \n since the e - w `` belt '' of the snr @xcite appears to be a relic feature of the progenitor star s equatorial winds @xcite , the pulsar spin - axis defined by the n - s orientation of the jet is generally aligned with the progenitor s rotation axis , at least in projection . if the pulsar position offset to the se of the radio center of the snr represents the direction of the pulsar velocity , a misalignment of @xmath25 @xmath8 70@xmath24 between the projected velocity and spin - axis vectors \n is implied . \n this is in contrast to the strong tendency toward spin - kick alignment claimed by ng & romani ( 2007 ) , although it is important to note that many of their estimated velocity vectors are , like ours , based on pulsar offsets from the geometric centers of their host snrs  a technique that is quite sensitive to the ambient density since the snrs will expand more rapidly in the direction of lower density , thus creating a shell that is not centered on the explosion point . without a proper motion measurement , \n our results for j1124@xmath05916 are thus not conclusive , although the density distribution inferred from the 60 @xmath17 m data , which is enhanced in the nw - w - sw direction , is difficult to reconcile with the current pulsar position if the observed spin axis is aligned with the velocity vector . \n finally , we note that our results are even consistent with possible orthogonality between the spin and kick directions , as might be suggested for some pulsars based on polarization measurements @xcite . \n our deep _ chandra _ observation of snr g292.0 + 1.8 detects the entire outer boundary of the blast wave and reveals metal - rich ejecta knots reaching the shock front . \n we find no evidence for strong particle acceleration sites in x - rays . \n the initial large - scale analysis reveals a highly non - uniform distribution of x - ray emitting hot gas . \n this overall structure is caused by an asymmetric distribution of the gas temperatures , rather than variable foreground absorption . \n the expected properties of the ambient medium required to explain this asymmetry are inconsistent with observations , which leads us to the supposition that the supernova explosion itself was asymmetric . \n a detailed x - ray spectral analysis of the metal - rich ejecta and hydrodynamical simulations will be required to test this scenario . \n proper motion measurements of the blast wave using the new radio data and detailed ir / optical studies of thermal states of cooling ejecta will also be important tests . \n we discover a torus and a jet associated with the pwn of the embedded pulsar j1124@xmath05916 , similar to a growing number of such structures observed in other young pulsar - driven systems . assuming that the pulsar s birthplace was at the geometric center of the radio snr and that the jet defines the direction of the pulsar spin axis \n , we find a large misalignment of @xmath26 between the spin and kick velocity directions , in apparent contrast to suggestions of spin - kick alignments in other systems . \n the authors thank the _ chandra _ education and public outreach group for their help to generate the x - ray color image . \n this work was supported in part by smithsonian astrophysical observatory under _ chandra _ grant go6 - 7049a ( penn state ) , go6 - 7049b ( johns hopkins ) , and go6 - 7049c ( rutgers ) . \n was also supported by _ \n hubble space telescope _ grant hst - go-10916.06-a . \n cccccc 0.40@xmath00.50 & continuum & - & 1.16@xmath01.25 & continuum & - + 0.58@xmath00.71 & o ly@xmath11 & red & 1.28@xmath01.43 & mg he@xmath11 & green + 0.75@xmath00.84 & continuum & - & 1.81@xmath02.05 & si he@xmath11 & blue + 0.88@xmath00.95 & ne he@xmath11 & red & 2.40@xmath02.62 & s he@xmath11 & blue + 0.98@xmath01.10 & ne ly@xmath11 & orange & - & - & -", "StartTimeOffset": 599204491932, "RequestID": "768d2a5fd3a8fe01df0c9694fa161487af890a66", "TotalTokens": 3928}

[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in the @xmath37 composite ( figure 2a , b ) the [ ] @xmath385007/@xmath384959 ratio of @xmath39 and the [ ] @xmath386583/@xmath386548 ratio of @xmath40 are both consistent with their theoretical values , which depend only on atomic physics for the conditions pertaining in pn , suggesting the spectrum provides useful diagnostic information ( although new spectra of the high surface brightness features are needed ) . \n h@xmath11 , which is clearly present in individual spectra with the strongest emission line fluxes , is barely detectable in the @xmath37 composite spectrum . \n the h@xmath4/h@xmath11 ratio of @xmath41 indicates some reddening ( formally a@xmath42 @xmath43 0.9@xmath44 ) . \n relatively weak underlying absorption in the balmer lines would help explain the low h@xmath11 flux while making little difference to the strength of h@xmath4 \n . the nearly reddening independent ratios of [ ]  @xmath386583/h@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath45 and [ ]  @xmath386583/ [ ]  @xmath386716 @xmath43 @xmath46 are both within the ranges observed in nitrogen - rich pn . \n the [ ] @xmath385007/h@xmath11 ratio of @xmath47 is very high , although not unprecedented in pns ( and is biased high by the selection process ) . \n further support for the classification as a pn comes from the detection of [ ]  3869 . \n the absence of detectable emission from lines of and is consistent with normal abundances and the s / n of the composite spectrum . in summary , \n the emission line properties of both composite and individual spectra are consistent with the properties of a pn with a relatively hot central star . \n indeed , the images in the atlas of ancient pns ( tweedy & kwitter 1996 ) contain some strikingly similar structures . \n the centrally concentrated morphology evident in the distribution of [ ]  4959,5007 emission is common and large variations in emission line ratio , including strong [ ] and [ ] towards the outer edges of old pns , due to interactions between the ejecta and the ambient interstellar medium , are often seen . \n the most unusual property of the structure reported here is the angular size , which , at @xmath48 diameter exceeds that of sh 2216 , also long considered the closest pn , with an angular size of @xmath49 ( fesen , blair , & gull 1981 ; tweedy & napiwotzki 1992 ) . \n since there was no plausible ionizing source in the sdss photometric catalogue , the apm sky survey catalogues were used for further investigation of potential ionizing sources of radiation . in a @xmath50 region centered on @xmath51 @xmath52 one bright candidate ionizing source stood out at @xmath53 @xmath54 j2000 ( epoch 1982 ) , with ukst plate magnitudes and colors of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see figure 4 ) . using the ukst plate as a reference frame the refined apm poss1 ( epoch 1952 ) position of this source is @xmath57 @xmath58 j2000 , giving a high proper motion of @xmath59 , @xmath60 . \n the color , magnitude and proper motion suggested the object was probably a hot wd at around @xmath61100 pc and a search , utilizing simbad , reveals the source is pg  1034 + 001 , a bright , @xmath62 ( landolt 1992 ) , do white dwarf . a very crude kinematic age of @xmath63yr , can be derived from the radius of the pn , @xmath64 at a distance of @xmath65150pc , and a typical expansion velocity of pn , @xmath66 . \n the wd is currently close to the center of the region over which detectable emission is present in the sdss spectra . \n the wd is also in close proximity , @xmath6115 , to the region showing the strongest [ ]  4959,5007 emission , however , the proper motion vector for the wd indicates a position for the wd to the east of the present location at the time the pn was formed . \n if the arc  like feature visible in figure 3 represents a shock , or a boundary , associated with material ejected at the time the pn was formed then a lower limit to the kinematic age for the pn can be estimated by extrapolating the motion of the white dwarf back to the origin of the radius of curvature of the arc . \n the resulting limit on the age , @xmath67yr is plausible but an understanding of the nature of the arc  like feature is necessary to validate the argument . \n an age of @xmath61100,000yr is consistent with all the evidence but measurement of the expansion velocity and a more complete mapping of the morphology of the emission will provide a much improved estimate . \n given that all observations are consistent with a pn nature for the newly discovered nebulosity , we designate it hewett  1 . the proximity of the do white dwarf pg  1034 + 001 ( wesemael , green , & liebert 1985 ) makes it probable that pg  1034 + 001 is responsible for the ionizing radiation . \n werner , dreizler , & wolff ( 1995 ) derived a spectroscopic distance for pg  1034 + 001 of @xmath68pc and confirmation of the association would make hewett  1 one of the closest pns known ( napiwotzki 2001 ) , the @xmath69 diameter corresponding to a physical size of @xmath70pc for the likely distance range of @xmath71pc . \n again , sh 2216 provides the current benchmark , with a trigonometric distance of @xmath72pc ( harris et al . \n 1997 ) and a physical size of @xmath73pc . \n a parallax determination for pg  1034 + 001 would establish whether hewett  1 is even closer .    notwithstanding targeted searches ( werner et al . \n 1997 ) , very few pns are known to be associated with non  da ( hydrogen poor ) white dwarfs . \n hewett  1 may be the first pn to be discovered associated with a do white dwarf , although pg  0108 + 101 ( reynolds et al . \n 1987 ) and pg  0109 + 111 ( werner et al . \n 1997 ) have candidate nebulae , neither detection is regarded as secure . since do white dwarfs are thought to evolve from pg  1159 stars ( see dreizler & werner 1996 , and references therein ) , it will be of interest to compare the properties of hewett  1 both to the pns associated with pg  1159 stars ( napiwotzki 1999 ) and theoretical models ( g ' orny & tylenda 2000 ) . the derivation of a reliable age for the pn associated with pg  1034 + 001 will be of particular interest for constraining the time scales associated with the late  stages of evolution of post - asymptotic giant branch stars and the origin of pg  1159 stars and helium  rich wds . \n eds is grateful for the hospitality of the ioa during his sabbatical visit and we thank alan mcconnachie for assisting with the int imaging observations . \n we are grateful to the anonymous referee who provided a detailed review of the original manuscript . \n this paper includes observations made with the isaac newton telescope , operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias . \n funding for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s . \n department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society . \n the sdss web site is http://www.sdss.org/.", "StartTimeOffset": 607135059180, "RequestID": "4846932e0b4c0e35a1202ac9a7df86504e1cead4", "TotalTokens": 3524}
{"ContextTokens": 3326, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "the interest to electric dipole moments ( edm ) of elementary particles and more complex systems like nuclei and atoms exists since 1950 , when it was first suggested that there was no experimental evidence for symmetry of nuclear forces under parity transformation  @xcite . \n the interest was renewed after 1964 when it was discovered that the invariance under cp transformation , which combines charge conjugation with parity , is violated in @xmath2-meson decays . \n this provided a new incentive for edm searches . since the combined cpt transformation is expected to leave a system invariant , breakdown of cp invariance should be accompanied by t violation . \n thus , there is a reason to expect that p and t violating edms should exist at some level .    the experimental upper limit on the neutron edm is @xcite @xmath3 the measured value for the proton edm is @xcite @xmath4 and is compatible with zero . \n this corresponds to an upper limit which is three order of magnitude weaker than the one for the neutron . \n the best upper limit on edm ever obtained was in an atomic experiment with @xmath0hg  @xcite . \n the result for the dipole moment of this atom is @xmath5 unfortunately , the implications of this result are somewhat less impressive , due to the electrostatic screening of the nuclear edm in this essentially coulomb system . \n the point is that in a stationary state of such a system , the total electric field acting on each particle must vanish . \n thus , an internal rearrangement of the system s constituents gives rise to an internal field @xmath6 that exactly cancels @xmath7 at each charged particle ; the external field is effectively switched off , and an edm feels nothing @xcite . \n still , some p and t odd component of the electrostatic potential survives due to final nuclear size . \n it is created by the next moment in the nuclear electric dipole density distribution . \n this is the schiff moment defined as @xcite @xmath8 the schiff moment generates a p and t odd electrostatic potential in the form @xmath9 interaction of atomic electrons with the potential given by eq . \n ( [ 2 ] ) produces an atomic dipole moment @xmath10 because of the contact origin of the potential , only the electrons in @xmath11 and @xmath12 atomic orbitals contribute to the dipole moment given by eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) . \n the eq.([1 ] ) is valid for any system of point - like charges @xmath13 . \n let us split the sum in eq.([1 ] ) into the sum over coordinates of nucleons and the sum over coordinates of charges inside the nucleons : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a nucleon position and @xmath16 is the position of the @xmath17th charge inside the nucleon . \n combining the terms of the zeroth and first order in @xmath18 and using @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we obtain an expression for the schiff moment as a sum of two terms . \n the first of them is similar to ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 for a proton and zero for a neutron . \n the mean value of this operator is nonzero only in the presence of the parity- and time - invariance violating nucleon - nucleon interaction    the second term in the operator ( [ 1.1 ] ) is related to the internal dipole moments of the nucleons @xmath24    the previous calculations of the schiff moment of a heavy nucleus @xcite were performed in a simplified manner , without taking into account the residual interaction between a valence nucleon and the core nucleons . \n only recently more microscopic studies of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg @xcite and @xmath25ra @xcite appeared where effects of the core polarization with the effective forces for @xmath0hg and the octupole deformation for @xmath25ra based on skyrm - hartree - fock method were discussed . in this work \n we would like to concentrate on the nucleon edm contribution to the schiff moment of the @xmath0hg nucleus . in the picture of independent particle model only an edm of a valence nucleon \n contributes to the schiff moment . in case of @xmath0hg \n it is a neutron edm . \n however , when a residual quasiparticle interaction between the valence neutron and the protons in the core is taken into consideration , the proton edm contribution to the nuclear schiff moment becomes nonzero . \n we calculated this contribution using a random phase appriximation with effective forces . from the relation between the schiff moment and the electric dipole moment of the hg atom @xcite \n the new upper limit on the proton edm was obtained . \n in our calculations we used full single - particle spectrum including continuum . \n the single - particle basis was obtained using partially self - consistent mean - field potential of @xcite . \n the potential includes four terms . \n the isoscalar term is the standard woods - saxon potential @xmath26 with the parameters @xmath27 mev , @xmath28 fm , and @xmath29 fm . \n two other terms @xmath30 , and @xmath31 were obtained in a self - consistent way using two - body landau - migdal - type interaction of @xcite for the spin - orbit and isovector parts of the potential . \n the last term is the coulomb potential of a uniformly charged sphere with @xmath32 fm . \n the mean field potential obtained in this way produces a good fit for single particle energies and r.m.s . \n radii for nuclei in the region around @xmath33pb . \n the effects of the core polarization for a single particle operator can be treated by introducing a renormalized operator @xmath34 satisfying the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bare schiff moment operator given by ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 1a ] ) or ( [ 1b ] ) . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are single particle occupation numbers and energies . for static moments the external frequency @xmath39 . \n the value of the schiff moment is given by the diagonal matrix element of the z - component of the renormalized operator ( [ 11 ] ) between mean field states of the last unpaired nucleon with a maximal angular momentum projection . \n @xmath40    for the residual interaction @xmath41 we use the phenomenological landau - migdal interaction that has the form @xmath42\\delta({\\bf \n r}_1-{\\bf r}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath43 300 mev @xmath44 . \n the values of the empirical interaction constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are crucial for our calculations . \n the proton contribution is proportional to the proton - neutron interaction @xmath47 . \n the constant @xmath46 is determined from magnetic properties of nuclei and positions of gamow - teller resonances . \n its adopted value varies between @xmath48@xmath49 depending on details of the mean field potential used @xcite . \n the constant @xmath45 is not so well defined . \n the magnetic moments and m1 transitions are to large extent isovector and they do not fix @xmath45 . \n an attempt to fix it from the structure of high spin states in @xmath33pb has been done in @xcite . \n they found that @xmath50 had to be used in order to reproduce the excitation energies of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states . \n another value @xmath53 was quoted in the review paper @xcite . \n the schiff moment operator can be presented in coordinate space in the form @xmath54 where we have introduced the set of linear independent tensor operators @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vector spherical harmonic . \n for @xmath57 we have @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . \n for a spherical nucleus we can separate the angular variables and solve the obtained equations in coordinate space . \n the equations are @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the radial part of the schiff moment operator ( [ 1b ] ) multiplied by @xmath63 . \n the kernel of the integral equation @xmath64 was calculated by means of the green functions of the radial schrdinger equation . \n @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the radial wave functions , and @xmath69 are the occupation numbers .    the solutions of eq . \n ( [ 11 ] ) for @xmath70 are shown in fig.1 and 2 .    ; the dashed curve is the bare operator @xmath71.,width=302 ]    ; the dashed curve is @xmath72.,width=302 ]    figure 1 demonstrates the magnitude of the core polarization effects . \n repulsive residual interaction ( [ 15 ] ) leads to not very significant decrease of the mean value of the schiff moment . \n figure 2 shows the radial dependence of the proton contributions induced by the core polarization . \n note 1 order of magnitude difference in the scales in fig . 1 and 2 . the full curve in fig . \n 2 is the radial dependence at the first operator @xmath73 and the dashed curve is the radial dependence at the second operator @xmath74 . \n @xmath75 changes sign inside the nucleus , therefore its mean value is smaller than the mean value of @xmath72 which is mostly negative inside the nucleus . \n the value of the schiff moment of @xmath0hg can be presented as a sum of proton and neutron contributions @xmath76 in table i we list the values @xmath77 and @xmath78 calculated for different combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .       from table [ tabr ] \n one can see that the uncertainties in @xmath77 and @xmath78 due to uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath79 the main contribution to @xmath77 and @xmath78 comes from the second term in eq . \n ( [ 1b ] ) . \n the contribution of the first term is only -0.7 @xmath80 in @xmath78 and 0.006 @xmath80 in @xmath77 . \n the constraint for the schiff moment of mercury nucleus from the experiment @xcite can be obtained using the results of ref . \n they calculated edm of an atom created by the nuclear schiff moment . \n for @xmath0hg they found @xmath81.\\ ] ] from eq.([exp ] ) we obtain the following upper bound for the schiff moment @xmath82 from eq . \n ( [ sm ] ) we can give the following constraints for edm of nucleons : @xmath83 the constraint for the neutron edm is worse than the existing result @xmath84 @xcite , therefore , we shall not discuss it below . for proton edm the estimate ( [ an1 ] ) \n is 1 order of magnitude lower than the existing experiment @xmath85 e cm @xcite . in these circumstances \n the question about a real theoretical accuracy of our approach becomes important . \n it is clear that the value @xmath86 cited in eq.([spsn ] ) does not reflects the real accuracy of the theory . \n it just came from the difference in adopted values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n the theoretical uncertainty appears from two sources . \n first , it is an uncertainty in the atomic calculations that couple the nuclear schiff moment and edm of an atom . \n we shall not discuss it here referring to the work @xcite . \n second , it is an uncertainty in calculations of the core polarization effects using rpa with effective forces . \n the latter can be estimated from the following considerations . using rpa with the effective forces we can fit different nuclear moments in one nucleus . \n then , in neighbor nuclei the calculated moments will differ from the data . \n this difference can be regarded as an uncertainty in the theory . in our experience \n this difference is of the order of 20% on the average , reaching sometimes the value of 30% @xcite . to be safe , \n we can adopt a conservative 30% uncertainty in calculations of @xmath77 . \n therefore , instead of ( [ spsn ] ) we would prefer to write for @xmath77 @xmath87 since the error in ( [ sp ] ) is not statistical , we can not give a probability distribution for @xmath77 . \n if one takes @xmath88 as a minimal value of @xmath77 , then it gives the following value for the proton edm upper bound @xmath89    in summary , we calculated the contributions of the proton and neutron edm to the schiff moment of @xmath0hg . \n the effects of core polarization were accounted for in the scope of rpa with the effective residual forces . \n a new upper bound of the proton edm has been obtained from the upper bound on the atomic edm

{"ContextTokens": 3409, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "in general the problem of causality is closely connected with basic philosophical problems . \n the main philosophical problem concerns a relation between matter and spirit . \n there are two extreme points of view on this problem :    matter is primary and spirit is secondary ;    spirit is primary and matter is secondary . in connection with this topic \n we should remember the discussion between einstein and tagore . in this discussion \n einstein upheld a materialistic view ( 1 . ) and tagore upheld an idealistic one ( 2 . ) . \n i think that in some sense these extremes can meet or some medium point of view is possible . \n but at first i determine some characteristic features of these extreme views as i understand them :    a materialistic view    there is a common or physical or objective time and space ( space - time ) ,    there is a unified ( physical ) law ,    there are a theoretical predictability for space - time events and a world order ,    a person ( human ) is a part of material world , he has no a free will ;    an idealistic view    an individual spirit is free from time and space ,    any spaces and laws can be formed by consciousness ( or consensus ) ,    an individual spirit is unpredictable ,    a person ( human ) is an incarnation of an individual spirit which has a free will .    a materialistic view ( 1 . \n ) is confirmed by advances of natural science . an idealistic view ( 2 . ) \n can be confirmed by demonstrations of parapsychology phenomena . \n my opinion is that there are space - time with a unified law and the world order . \n being `` normal '' an individual acts in the framework of the world order but may be he ( his spirit ) can also escape ( in a certain sense , sometimes or often ) from the material world and space - time . \n thus i think that intermediate states also are possible .    in any case \n a knowledge of a unified law gives significant advantages for the civilization , in creation of new technical devices . \n thus the object of my present investigation is a unified law of matter . \n the quantum mechanics description can not pretend to this role because it gives probabilistic predictions in principle . \n ( in the known expression by einstein `` god does not play dice '' just a unified law is considered as god . )    in this connection i consider a unified local field theory . \n the whole history of pre - quantum physics naturally led to the idea of unified field theory for description of matter . \n all particles of matter and its apparent mutual influence must be represented by some solution of an appropriate field model which must be nonlinear . \n also this model must be local , i.e. it is represented by some purely differential system of equations . \n this is an essence of the ideas which was inspiring for many scientists in their working . \n let us mention just a few : a.  einstein , l.  de broglie , h.  weil , a.  eddington , g.  mie , e.  schrdinger , m.  born , l.  infeld , j.  plebansky , etc . \n but on the other hand the impressive success of quantum mechanics has eclipsed the idea of unified field theory which was in the air . \n the quantum mechanics is essentially a linear theory which is much more simple for investigation than nonlinear one . \n but the quantum mechanics gives the probabilistic predictions only . \n einstein , podolsky , and rosen in their famous article @xcite had advanced the arguments for the standpoint that quantum mechanical description of reality is incomplete . \n bohm and aharonov had proposed an example ( see also my article @xcite ) for demonstration the epr paradox in which two spin particles scatter in opposite directions . according to the quantum mechanical description for this experiment , a spin states of the individual particles are indeterminate until a measurement event . \n but as soon as we have measured a spin state for one particle then a spin state for another particle becomes determinate immediately . \n this resulting situation is connected with the conservation law of full angular momentum for the system of two particles . \n this situation looks as though there was an instantaneous interaction between space separate particles . \n it contradicts with the thesis for locality of interactions . \n thus quantum mechanics predicts nonlocal correlations between the events . \n well known aspect experiment @xcite for testing of also well known bell inequalities @xcite determines that there are the nonlocal correlations .    at first glance \n the existence of this nonlocal correlations rejects a possibility for description of matter by an unified local field theory . \n however , actually , this is not the fact . in the following i \n show that nonlocal correlations between events must exist in the framework of a unified local field theory of matter . \n actually the concept of unified local field theory for the material world is similar to the concept of ether , if we understand it in the broad sense but not a narrow mechanical one . \n this concept supposes only two basic properties : continuity and locality . \n mathematically these properties are expressed in the fact that we consider some purely differential field model or some system of equations with partial derivatives . to describe naturally the interactions between material objects , this system of equations must be nonlinear . \n we believe also that there is a model solution which is determinate in space - time . \n thus , according to this concept , we can consider some cauchy problem or the problem with initial condition for obtaining the world evolution .    within the framework of such theory a single elementary particle \n is represented by some space - localized solution . moreover , because , as we know , elementary particles have wave properties , this solution must have an appropriate wave part . \n the wave part is considered here in the sense of time fourier expansion for the solution in own coordinate system of the particle , where this part has the form of a standing wave . \n there is a simplest example for such standing wave even for the customary linear wave equation . \n these well known solutions of the wave equation in a spherical coordinate system include spherical harmonics . \n for the spherically symmetric case we have the standing wave @xmath0 which is formed by the sum of divergent and convergent spherical waves . \n with the help of lorentz transformation we can obtain the appropriate solution in the form of moving nondeliquescent wave packet \n . then own frequency @xmath1 transforms to wave vector @xmath2 such that @xmath3 using the linear relation between the wave vector and a vector of momentum we obtain @xmath4    a single elementary particle solution of a nonlinear field model may be called also as _ \n solitron_. this term has a similar sense that `` solitary wave '' or `` soliton '' . \n but usually the term `` soliton '' is used in mathematical context for some special solutions . \n it is significant , the concept of unified field theory supposes that all variety and evolution of the material world are represented by some space - time field configuration which is an exact solution of the nonlinear field model . \n it is evident that this solution is very very complicated but it is determinate on space - time by the field model with initial and boundary conditions . in the vicinity of a separate elementary particle \n this world solution is close to the appropriate single elementary particle solution , but each elementary particle behaves as the part of the world solution . \n thus the behavior of each elementary particle is connected with the whole space - time field configuration of the world solution .    for certain conditions it is possible to consider the world solution part connecting with a separate elementary particle as the appropriate solitron solution with slowly variable velocity . \n ( for the case of nonlinear electrodynamics see , for example , my article @xcite . ) \n this level for investigation of the world solution relates to the classical ( not quantum ) physics . \n it is evident that although the model is local , the world solution is nonlocal in character because it is determined on a whole space - time applicable domain . \n this means , in particular , that there are undoubtedly nonlocal correlations between space separate parts of the common world solution . \n this sentence may be explained with the help of the following simplest example . \n 0.35 mm    ( 104.67,90.00 ) ( 10,10)(0,1)80 ( 30,10)(0,1)80 ( 50,10)(0,1)80 ( 70,10)(0,1)80 ( 90,10)(0,1)80 ( 57,50.00)(1,0)40 ( 10.00,50.00 ) ( 10.00,25.00 ) ( 40.00,50.00 ) ( 6,47.00)(0,0)[rc]@xmath5 ( 6,24.67)(0,0)[rc]@xmath6 ( 40.00,44.50)(0,0)[ct]@xmath7 ( 10.00,5.00)(1,0)90 ( 104,5.00)(0,0)[lc]@xmath8 ( 10,5)(0,-1)2 ( 40,5)(0,-1)2 ( 40.00,1.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath9 ( 10.00,1.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath10    let us consider a customary plane wave travelling on axis @xmath8 with a fixed wave - length @xmath11 ( see fig . \n 1 ) such that @xmath12 \\quad . \\ ] ] this wave is the solution of the customary linear wave equation . \n at the points @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 the field evolution has the forms @xmath13 \\quad , \\\\ \n \\nonumber & & p:\\ ; f=\\sin [ ( 2\\pi/\\lambda)\\,x^0 ] \\quad , \\\\ \n \\nonumber & & q:\\ ; f=\\sin [ ( 2\\pi/\\lambda)\\,(x^0 { } - { } q ) ] \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus here there are the nonlocal correlations between the field evolution at the points @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 . \n totality of such nonlocal correlations is , in fact , the solution in space - time for the local field model . \n the possible world solution ( which is extremely more complicated than a plane wave ) is also the continuous set of nonlocal correlations for the field evolution at the points of three - dimensional space .    of course \n , if we make some excitation for field at the point @xmath5 then a propagation of this excitation from this point will have a finite speed . \n but in the scope of the world solution we do not be able to make this excitation or to modify arbitrarily this world solution . \n any excitations of the field at the point @xmath5 belong to the world solution which is a single whole . \n that is , in this case we must consider also all excitations coming to this point and we will have some standing wave near it . thus the world solution is rather a very complicated system of standing waves than progressing ones . \n the initial condition is a common cause of all field excitations and after a long evolution the different correlations may exist , even the strange ones . \n it can only be said quite positively that the world solution can be represented by fourier integral ( or series ) on orthogonal space - time harmonics which are essentially nonlocal . \n ( here we must remember how a dominant role is played by orthogonal functions in quantum approach . ) \n the key to understanding the appearance of momentary distant interaction in the experiment , which is considered in section [ sec2 ] , is contained in a concept of chance choice \n . within the framework of the world solution a chance choice is absent , but both experimenter and experimental apparatus are a part of this world solution . \n that is the orientation of particle spin detectors in the experiment under consideration is predetermined by the world solution . \n we speak about a chance choice because we do not know the world solution .    as experimentalists \n , we think that we establish the initial conditions for the process under investigation but may be this is too conceitedly and the veritable initial condition was established earlier . but as theorists , we can already calculate many correlations between space - time events . \n thus we can suppose that the quantum mechanical description is the level for investigation of the world solution . \n this level take into consideration , in particular , the global or nonlocal aspects of this solution . \n nonlocality was founded in quantum mechanics from the outset . in schrdinger \n s picture a free elementary particle ( which have a determinate momentum ) is related with a plane wave having a constant amplitude on the whole space . in this case \n the quantum mechanical description does not determine a position of the particle . \n that is we have the representation of a free elementary particle by a non space - localized wave that accentuates just nonlocal aspect of matter .    as we see , there is nonlocality also in the framework of unified local field theory . \n but such theory supposes a solitron model for free elementary particle that is intuitively more preferable . \n furthermore according to this concept there is a deterministic description of matter .    thus having a unified mathematical model for matter \n we must also take into consideration the whole of the material world evolution from a start point when the initial condition was determined . and \n we can say that there is the global causality in the space - time universe . \n as we see the unified field theory approach can give a strong determinancy of events in material world . \n but my opinion is that we must also take into consideration some things which are outside from the space - time framework of the physical world . \n suppose here by definition that these things include spirits . \n because a spirit is outside from the material world or a world solution , he may have an influence on initial and boundary conditions . \n suppose that a spirit can partially modify the world solution , which is possible with the help of some dynamical boundary conditions . \n but these modifications must be again nonlocal in general . \n thus the world solution is determinate in general and a possible intervention of spirit must be unexpected and unusual in character . \n this spirit intervention also realizes a global space - time causality in a sense , but this causality is not explained by physical laws . \n i think that this is a reasonable way for introduction a concept of will to the picture of material world stated above . \n thus i believe that in the material world we have a partial nonlocal determinancy which however agree with a unified local field theory of matter .    in connection with the fact that i touch on philosophical problems in this article , i would like also refer to schrdinger s book @xcite including considerations which i accept in general . \n at present we consider a single atom and even a single electron as objects of technology . \n there is a concept of a single electron transistor @xcite and we can seriously consider prospects for building an avogadro - scale computer acting on bits @xcite . in such computer using the nuclear magnetic resonance one nuclear spin must store one bit of information \n .    traditional computation can do many useful things and this ability can become very much stronger with the possible avogadro - scale technology . but the traditional computation needs a determinate controlling . \n such controlling is possible if we have a unified field theory of matter in the sense that was stated above . \n this is one of the possible applications of the approach under review . \n but , of course , a realization for the paradigm of unified field theory will discover abilities which we do not know at the present time .    in connection with the approach of unified field theory \n i propose to consider the nonlinear electrodynamics model of born - infeld type with singularities @xcite . \n in particular , in the framework of this model the two fundamental long - range interactions ( electromagnetism and gravitation ) may be unified ( see my articles ) . \n einstein , a. , podolsky , b. , and rosen , n.

* ? ? ? \n * ( bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997;christlein & zaritsky 2008 ) ) , for a number of reasons : 1 ) most importantly , the spatial resolution  an order of magnitude better than even the highest - quality interferometric hi maps  allows us to clearly separate gas in the warps from gas in the plane of the galaxy . \n this , in turn , allows us to access galaxies with smaller angular diameters at larger redshifts , greatly increasing the number of suitable targets . \n 2 ) sporadic local star formation or illumination of gas in the warps by escaping uv flux from the inner star - forming disk guarantee low - level h@xmath3 flux from the outer disk far beyond what is usually perceived as the star formation threshold . \n it has been demonstrated ( * ? ? ? \n * ;

the kinematics of the extraplanar feature are disk - like . \n * * mcg -01 - 10 - 035 * ( fig . \n [ fig_mcg101 ] ) is a small ( @xmath9 ) sc - type galaxy at cz = 3788 km / s . \n our acquisition images reveal a very extended tail of low surface brightness extending as far as @xmath10 and then curving back . \n its appearance is very suggestive of a tidal feature . \n while the other side of the galaxy does not exhibit an equivalently striking feature , the outer isophotes appear bent on both sides . \n + the major axis spectrum samples far into this low - surface brightness tail and extends to 1.6 r@xmath1 on that side , and @xmath11 on the other . \n remarkably , at the onset of this feature , around r@xmath1 , we see a sudden break in the rotation curve _ along the major axis _ in the sense of a jump to lower rotational velocities by @xmath12 km / s . on the other side , \n no such strong break is discernible , but there is h@xmath3 emission at velocities distinctly below the extrapolated rotation velocity , going as far down as the systemic velocity of the galaxy itself . + \n our offset spectrum intercepts the tail at its largest extent . \n while we do not see a continuous h@xmath3 signal beyond r@xmath1 , there are individual h@xmath3-bright regions extending as far as @xmath13 on both sides of the galaxy . \n the rotation curve fitted to this spectrum shows no breaks in the velocity ;

it reaches r@xmath1 on the side of the stronger warp , and only 0.7 r@xmath1 on the other side , with the exception of one small h@xmath3-emitting region at 1.4 r@xmath1 . \n there are no signs for any kinematic anomalies in this rotation curve . * \n * ngc 259 * ( fig . \n [ fig_ngc259 ] ) is among the brighter galaxies in this sample ( @xmath15 ) , an sbc - type at cz=4045 km / s . \n it is also the least inclined among our targets . \n the acquisition images show that the supposed warp feature is in fact more suggestive of a continuation of a spiral arm . \n the major axis spectrum samples its kinematics out to 1.2 r@xmath1 , but shows no kinematic disturbance . \n the offset spectrum only extends to @xmath16 . \n +    +    * * eso 473-g025 * ( fig . \n [ fig_eso473 ] ) , the brightest object in our sample ( @xmath17 ) , is an sb - type galaxy at cz=7110 km / s . \n acquisition images show what is at most a very subtle warp . \n the major axis spectrum extends a little beyond r@xmath1 . \n the kink visible in the rotation curve in fig.[fig_eso473 ] corresponds to a region where two components of the h@xmath3 line are visible at the same position in projection along the slit . however , there are no signs of kinematic anomalies towards the edge of the disk . \n the offset rotation curve is much less extended . \n a single emission region around 1.4 r@xmath1 coincides with what appears to be a small satellite galaxy on the acquisition image . * * eso 340-g026 * ( fig . \n [ fig_eso340 ] ) is an sc - type galaxy at cz=5483 km / s with @xmath18 . \n there are low - surface - brightness tails at the edge of the disk , but they show no significant warp . \n we exposed in two different offset positions , but obtained sufficient data for an analysis in only one case . \n the major axis spectrum , in any case , extends to 1.3 r@xmath1 and thus far enough to sample the kinematics of the outlying features . \n the rotation curve , again , shows no signs of kinematic anomalies . \n in an effort to measure the kinematics of gas in the warps in the outer disks of galaxies with high spatial resolution , we have targetted seven edge - on galaxies , most of them with known optical warps , using multi - hour long slit spectroscopy .    * in at least three of seven cases , we have observed more extended h@xmath3 emission if the slit was aligned along the warp rather than along the major axis . \n this shows that we have been successful at detecting gas in the warps , and that we have thus attained our observational goal . counting the single emission region detected in ugc 12423 , \n this ratio is four out of seven . * in three of these four cases , there are no signs of kinematic anomalies in the rotation curve associated with the onset of the warp . * in one of these four cases , there is a sharp break in the rotational velocity roughly at the onset of the warp . in this case , the optical appearance of the `` warp '' is highly suggestive of a tidal feature . \n however , the break occurs in the major axis rotation curve . * in the remaining objects , the outer - disk features are sampled by the major - axis spectrum , but there is no evidence for kinematic anomalies in these regions .    based on a small data set ( four kinematic detections of extraplanar outer disk gas likely to be associated with a warp ) \n , we find evidence for kinematic anomalies only in the one case whose optical appearance strongly suggests a tidal feature . in other cases , \n the kinematics of the presumed warp gas are consistent with the extrapolation of the inner disk rotation curve . \n this sample is therefore not in support of the hypothesis that the outer , warped disks are in direct contact and exchanging angular momentum with material being newly accreted ; however , the possibility can not be ruled out yet that the real point of contact between the galaxy disk and accreted material lies at larger radii , and that the gas that we see at the onset of the optical warp has already settled into disk - like kinematics . \n we propose to explore three avenues for further investigation : ( i ) gas at larger radii , substantially beyond the optical warps , should be targetted ; ideally , targets should thus be selected on the basis of hi maps where available . \n ( ii ) the sample should be increased in size from the present three clear detections . \n ( iii ) additional indicators that might constrain the origin of the warp gas , in particular , metallicity , should be included in the analysis .", "StartTimeOffset": 630990251802, "RequestID": "691104eaac510a685e4e70f37df534e1d6183ed6", "TotalTokens": 3875}

diagonal entries . \n in such a case , there are again no gluino and neutralino contributions to flavour - changing one - loop transitions involving only external down - type quarks and leptons . \n however , additional chargino contributions show up , due to non - diagonal entries of @xmath27 . \n * scenario ( c ) : * + @xmath27 is diagonal but not proportional to the unit matrix , which gives rise to off - diagonal entries in @xmath33 . \n accordingly , gluino and neutralino exchange diagrams ( in addition to those involving @xmath34 , charged and neutral higgs bosons ) contribute to flavour - changing transitions at one - loop level that involve external down - type quarks . \n the common feature of all these scenarios is that the ckm matrix is the only source of flavour violation . \n the effective hamiltonian responsible for the processes @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in the presence of non - standard interactions is given by [ heff ] h_eff = - v_tb^v_tq^ * _ i=10,s , p[c_i()_i()+c_i()_i ( ) ] , with the short - distance coefficients @xmath38 and the local operators [ operator : basis ] _ \n 10=(|q ^ p_l b ) ( |l _ _ 5 l),_s= m_b ( |q p_r b ) ( |ll),_p= m_b ( |q p_r b)(|l _ 5 l ) , where @xmath39 . the primed operators can be obtained by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . \n it turns out that the primed wilson coefficients are negligibly small , and hence can be safely neglected .    at high \n @xmath8 the scalar and pseudoscalar operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 become important in addition to the so called sm - operator @xmath44 . in this region of the parameter space an expansion according to @xmath8 is possible and a general expression for @xmath45 looks like c_i o_i = _ \n n a_n ^n+1 ( ) ^n + _ \n n b_n ^n ( ) ^n +  , where we call the first term leading and the second term subleading . \n @xmath46 denotes lepton and light quark masses while @xmath47 stands for masses of particles that have been integrated out . \n explicit expressions for the wilson - coefficients can be found in . \n the experimental bounds used in this numerical analysis as well as the ranges of the mssm parameters can be found in ref . \n @xcite .      recall that in scenario ( a ) the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath33 are equal and proportional to the unit matrix . \n therefore , the gluinos and neutralinos do not contribute at one - loop level . \n the scan over the parameter region shows that the ratio @xmath6 is approximately constant and close to @xmath48 .    in scenario ( b ) \n , the matrix @xmath33 is diagonal , @xmath49 , with at least two different entries . \n hence , there are no gluino and neutralino contributions at one - loop level . \n employing the relation in , the matrix @xmath50 becomes non - diagonal . \n these off - diagonal flavour - changing entries are constrained by experimental data on @xmath51@xmath52 , @xmath53@xmath54 , @xmath55@xmath56 oscillations , and the @xmath57 decay @xcite . \n it is important to note that the bounds on these flavour - changing entries@xcite severely constrain the additional chargino contributions in scenario ( b ) , hence we end up with a result similar to scenario ( a ) . \n @xmath6 varies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . neglecting the constraints we could have found @xmath6 in the range @xmath60 .      in this case \n , the matrix @xmath27 is diagonal , @xmath61 , with at least two different entries . according to the relation in , \n this implies that @xmath33 has non - diagonal entries , so that gluinos and neutralinos contribute to the @xmath62 transition already at one - loop level . as before , we take the constraints of on these off - diagonal elements .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     an interesting subset of parameter points was considered in ( for details see ) interestingly , in the left ( right ) plot , the ratio @xmath6 ranges between @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , while the magnitude of the individual branching fractions decreases drastically with increasing charged higgs boson mass , @xmath65 . note that for small @xmath65 and @xmath8 close to @xmath21 both branching ratios are in a region that can be probed experimentally , in run ii of the fermilab tevatron , babar and belle . \n the neutralino wilson coefficients are numerically smaller than those coming from the chargino and gluino contributions . \n however , we have found that in certain regions of the mssm parameter space cancellations between the chargino and gluino coefficients occur , in which case the neutralino contributions become important . as a matter of fact , for the susy parameter sets examined \n , we found that a large value of @xmath1 always involves such a cancellation . \n we have defined @xmath4 using symmetry arguments and have shown that @xmath4 is less restrictive than mfv , while the ckm matrix remains the only source of flavour violation . within the mssm \n we have investigated three scenarios that are possible within the context of @xmath4 . \n in particular , we have studied the case where the chargino exchange diagrams @xcite as well as the gluino and neutralino exchange diagrams @xcite contribute besides @xmath66 [ scenario ( c ) ] .    including current experimental data on rare @xmath16 decays , as well as on @xmath67 meson mixing \n , we found that in certain regions of the susy parameter space the branching ratios @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be up to the order of @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . \n specifically , we showed that there exist regions in which the branching fractions of both decay modes are comparable in size , and may well be accessible to run ii of the fermilab tevatron as well as @xmath6 can deviate from @xmath72 by orders of magnitude . \n we wish to stress that a measurement of the branching ratios @xmath0 , or equivalently , a ratio @xmath6 of @xmath7 , does not necessarily imply the existence of new flavour violation outside the ckm matrix . \n nevertheless , any observation of these decay modes in ongoing and forthcoming experiments would be an unambiguous signal of new physics . \n i would like to thank christoph bobeth , andrzej j.  buras , thorsten ewerth , frank krger and michael spira for useful discussions and comments on the manuscript . \n this work was supported in part by the german ` bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ' under contract 05ht1woa3 and by the ` deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ' ( dfg ) under contract        c.  bobeth , t.  ewerth , f.  krger , and j.  urban , . \n a.  j.  buras , in _ flavour dynamics : cp violation and rare decays _ , lectures given at international school of subnuclear physics , erice , italy , 2000 , hep - ph/0101336 . \n belle collaboration , report no . \n belle - conf-0127 ( unpublished ) ; cdf collaboration , f.  abe , . \n a.  j.  buras , p.  h.  chankowski , j.  rosiek and  . \n sawianowska , .            c.  bobeth , a.  j.  buras , f.  krger , and j.  urban , . m.  misiak , s.  pokorski , and j.  rosiek , in _ heavy flavours ii _ , edited by a.  j.  buras and m.  lindner ( world scientific , singapore , 1998 ) , p.  795 \n , hep - ph/9703442 . t.  besmer , c.  greub , and t.  hurth , . \n see also f.  gabbiani , e.  gabrielli , a.  masiero , and l.  silvestrini , ; d.  chang , w.  f.  chang , w.  y.  keung , n.  sinha , and r.  sinha , .", "StartTimeOffset": 649994861808, "RequestID": "46dc17251613e26d9335b9130c79c6eaa7913e68", "TotalTokens": 3527}
{"ContextTokens": 3722, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "graphics programs in high energy physics experiments are necessary to visualize the detectors geometry and display physics events . \n they help in the commissionning phase of the experiment in debugging and understanding the systems . \n they must provide an interactive access to the event data and their reconstruction through online and offline algorithms . \n as such they play an important role in the search and discovery of new physics . \n persint ( perspectively interacting ) is an interactive visualization program  @xcite which is developed primely for the atlas collaboration  @xcite . \n the display of objects and the interactivity between the user and objects or applications is realized through the use of the higz package  @xcite . \n facilities dedicated to the spatial navigation and the definition of the visualization properties are provided , in order to interactively set the viewing and viewed points , so as obtain the desired perspective . in \n parallel , applications may be launched through the use of dedicated interfaces , such as the interactive reconstruction and display of physics events . \n persint was originally developed as a tool for debugging and optimizing the atlas muon pattern and track reconstruction algorithm muonbox  @xcite . \n it was early realized that traditional event displays based on simple projections were not fit to the task of visualizing events in the toroidal , inhomogeneous field of the muon spectrometer . \n only a three - dimensional interactive tool with navigation capabilities is well suited for such a task . \n the program is now routinely used for event display of hits and reconstruction objects of complex monte carlo events and in testbeam applications , both online and offline . \n persint is used for the visualization of detector geometries : as such it is interfaced to amdb ( the atlas muon database ) and the agdd - xml atlas generic detector description . \n other applications include the visualization of the magnetic field , the level-1 muon trigger logic , the interactive generation of tracks , and the display of xml event hits . \n the program offers the following features  :    * 3-dimensional representation of objects in full volumes or wire frames * computation of hidden faces * highlight of volumes edges * lighting intensity effects on volume facets * detection of clashing volumes and highlight of intersections * boolean volume operations ( addition , subtraction , intersection ) * spatial navigation with real - time displacements * focal length adjustable at will ( from isometry to wide - angle ) * interfaces and access to applications * save to postscript * documentation      the core of the program is written in fortran90 . \n dynamic data objects are extensively exploited in order to minimize the memory usage which can become important when a large numbers of volume are displayed , a situation typical to modern hep experiments , both with respect to the detector description and the event data themselves . \n persint uses the following features of f90 :    * usage of modules , with procedure interfaces * polymorphism * recursive functions * dynamic arrays * allocate , for local memory management * pointers * string operations * array manipulations * free source forms    the graphics interface is higz  @xcite and in general the program makes extensive use of the cernlib  @xcite . \n it is built on 26000 lines on code and is part of the saclay muon software suite . as such it is interfaced directly to the geometrical database amdbsimrec ( 13000 lines ) , the magnetic field database bfielddtb ( 3500 lines ) and the track reconstruction algorithm muonbox ( 58000 lines )  @xcite . \n the code is highly modular , organized in patches . \n the xml section is such an example of a patch . \n it contains everything needed to parse , store transiently and generates volumes from standardized xml files . \n the computation of volumes with hidden faces is based on the analytical computation of facets edges in space . \n this computation also provides the detection of clashes and the highlights of the volumes intersections , and supports boolean volume operations . \n the program is designed to operate in standalone mode , keeping the possibility of integration in frameworks . \n it was for example successfully used in the context of the online software framework of the atlas testbeams . \n the program is released officially at cern on afs in a public directory   since version 2.00 for three platforms : linux , sun - solaris unix and compaq / alpha unix . \n this repository contains the source and executable files together with documentation and useful input databases , and for developers , the tools necessary to build , compile and load the code . \n the latest released version is 3.00 . \n the documentation can be found in the persint manual located in the public repository or on the dedicated persint web page  . \n this page provides updates on the releases . \n the program is designed around the command window and the higz display window . a typical view obtained with the display window \n is shown in figure  [ layout ] . \n the command window is used essentially to load files and type commands interpreted by the code and documented in the persint manual . \n the display window however is organized in such a way to provide maximum interactivity to avoid typing commands as much as possible . \n the display window is dedicated to the colour display of both the objects computed by the program for visualization and the graphical interfaces . \n the primary interface is the navigator . \n the navigator supports the navigation facilities necessary to survey the entire detector space and gives access to the various graphics applications provided by persint . \n its layout is shown in figure  [ nav ] . \n it consists in an ensemble of push buttons and gauges which can be clicked , so as to modify the visualization properties or access lower level interfaces .      the spatial navigation , as well as the modification of the visualization properties , \n are realized through the use of gauges which define the amplitudes of the movements of the viewing and viewed points and of the change in focal length of the observer eye , such as to obtain the desired perspective . \n each action is validated with the  * go * \" push button . \n alternatively , the navigation can be performed through real time displacements of the observer point . \n continuous displacements are obtained by dragging the cursor over the display itself , thus bypassing the use of the navigator . \n persint offers the possibility to modify interactively the visualization focal length . in the navigator \n , a sectioned gauge may be used to select the normal view , equivalent to a focal length of 35 mm , the isometric view , equivalent to an infinite focal length , or to increase or decrease the focal length at will . \n moreover , x , y , z , or @xmath0 projections of the volumes on display may be obtained by clicking dedicated push buttons ( see figure  [ nav ] ) . in the case of x , y , and z projections , the observing point position ( e.g. x@xmath1 or x@xmath2 ) can be modified by clicking the  displace viewing point \" 2d gauge on the corresponding half . in the case of @xmath0 projection , this same gauge can be used to define the value of @xmath0 \n . examples of visualization of the same volumes with different perspectives are presented in figure  [ expers ] . \n the interactive reconstruction and event display ( evd ) application of persint is dedicated to the reading of event hit files , the visualization of these hits , and the reconstruction of the event through coupling to the muonbox program  @xcite . \n the three - dimensional view of complex events is used to understand complex events and debug the reconstruction algorithms . \n figure  [ evd ] shows a display of a monte carlo event in the atlas muon spectrometer in the context of a high background environment . \n such events are generated with the geant3-based dice simulation  @xcite . \n all hits and activated muon chambers are displayed . \n the reconstructed track is displayed in blue . \n visual inspection confirms the efficiency of the reconstruction algorithm in terms of pattern recognition and fitting . \n the projective views allows to further examine the events , though it is necessary to restrict the investigation to a limited region of the apparatus . zooming on detectors \n is performed to very carefully check the event properties and reconstruction consistency , as illustrated in figure  [ evddcbil ] .        in figure \n [ evd ] one notes the interactive reconstruction and event display interface opened on top of the navigator . \n this interface is equipped with an ensemble of push - buttons to set the visual properties of the displayed event and to activate the reconstruction . \n a separate embedded window is used to display the statistics of the event . \n the statistics consist essentially in the number of hits of the event , the number of hits taken into account in the candidate tracks , the reconstructed momentum , and if required from the datacards in case of physics channels analysis , the reconstructed invariant mass . \n the interfacing between persint and muonbox makes it possible to act interactively on the event characteristics to understand which role they play . \n for instance , a hit tube or a strip can be removed interactively from the event . \n then , when re - running the reconstruction algorithms , this removed tube will not be taken into account . \n the persint evd was used in the design and optimization phase of the muon spectrometer , participating in the performance studies of the apparatus and reconstruction software  @xcite . \n it then contributed in refining the performances of this software on complex monte carlo physics channels  @xcite . \n the program is used in the context of muon testbeams to display events on either online of offline mode  @xcite . \n event displays are useful to testbeams in order to validate the commissioning of the entire chain of detectors and data acquisition . \n when data is recorded in a routine mode , the evd participate in the online monitoring and the quality control of the dataflow . \n an example of testbeam event is shown in figure  [ tb ] . \n it consists in a staight muon track reconstructed in the barrel stand of the h8 2002 muon system tests  @xcite . \n chambers misalignment is corrected using conditions alignment data . \n powerful graphics tool are necessary to develop and debug the geometrical descriptions of the complex hep detectors . \n not only 3d viewers and projective capabilities must be used , but also the possibility to automatically detect geometrical conflicts . \n an essential feature of geometry visualization programs is to be able to delineate precisely the volume edges . \n this is of primary importance in order to clearly identify the volumes boundaries in space and their possible interferences . \n such visual property offers a much better understanding and comprehension of the detector geometry to the end user . \n modern geometrical description in hep makes extensive use of boolean volume operations , which greatly simplifies the task of describing complicated geometries . \n visualization tools must therefore support such technology . \n the persint program is interfaced to the two detector description used for the atlas muon spectrometer : agdd - xml and amdb . \n the atlas generic detector description is based on standardized xml files . \n such a description is used to describe the muon spectrometer geometry  @xcite . \n this description is implemented in the reconstruction algorithm . \n the persint program benefits from an xml parser to interpret the corresponding geometrical description . \n the working of the interface to agdd is based on the representation of a fully clickable tree - like structure allowing selection of the desired volumes for display . \n an operating example is given in figure  [ xml ] , showing both the xml structure and the corresponding volumes , in this case one of the atlas endcap toroid . \n the interface offers the representation of the volume tree in its full depth . \n the user can deploy or hide sub - structures by clicking volume tree pointers appearing as arrows . \n conveniently , geometries can be visualized in parallel as they are being developped . after a possible modification , clicking on a a dedicated push button of the navigator \n ( see figure  [ nav ] ) results in the reloading of the database . \n the atlas muon database is an object - oriented database for simulation and reconstruction  . \n it is extensively used in the detectors and physics performance studies conducted since the origin of atlas  @xcite . in particular , it is used synchroneously by the dice geant3 simulation of the experiment  @xcite and the muon reconstruction program muonbox  @xcite . \n this database is heavily used to study the ongoing changes to the spectrometer layout  @xcite . \n such changes are caused by the need to take into account integration and access constraints . \n also , the possible staging of atlas will lead to multiple geometrical configuration , to be optimized by simulation . in this context of evolving geometries \n , persint provides a tool to carefully scrutinize and validate the geometrical databases . \n one of the important capabilities of persint is to detect and highlight intersecting or clashing volumes . \n an illustration is given in figure  [ clash ] , where a conflict between a muon chamber and the feet of the detector is observed . \n persint offers the rare feature of being able to compute fully and display volumes resulting from boolean operations . \n being given two initial supervolumes ( a supervolume is an ensemble of volumes ) , the program is able to perform the three basic operations ( addition , subtraction , intersection ) to generate a new supervolume . \n this facility is independent of the complexity of the initial objects . \n an example is shown in figure  [ labelvouss ] , which illustrates how the program can generate the voussoirs of the barrel toroid .        using this feature of persint , it is possible to generate complex - shaped volumes from very basic objects . \n the program provides , through the command mode , a set of instructions allowing to generate basic volumes and to perform boolean operations . \n the persint program is interfaced to a variety of application . \n they are all accessed through the navigator ( see figure  [ nav ] ) . \n the level 1 interface is the application allowing the interactive access to the level-1 muon trigger configuration datafiles and the visual representation of the variety of objects involved in the trigger decision chain . \n this interface is extensively described in  @xcite . \n the magnetic field interface provides a fully interactive 3d visualization of the magnetic field and the magnet elements . \n this application is coupled to the bfielddtb set of subroutines that read the field database and compute the field at any given point  . \n the field is visualized by means of arrows located at a series of lattice points . \n an example is shown in figure  [ magfield ] . \n the direction and length of the arrow correspond to the direction and magnitude of the b - field . \n the lattice , either 2d or 3d , is customized by the user in terms of mesh and spatial limits , allowing to build the vector field either in very localized regions or over large distances . \n the muon tracks interface is used to generate and compute tracks of muons throughout the entire detector system . \n it is coupled to muonbox , to the detector description and the magnetic field database , in order to compute the track s trajectory , taking into account the deflections in the field , the multiple scattering , and the energy loss in matter . \n performances are difficult to estimate , as the visualization programs have too face many possible situations in terms of user demand , and number of volumes to display . \n a test is performed here as follows : the display and navigation capability is estimated on a 2.8 ghz pentium 4 . \n it requires 0.65 s to compute and display the 2300 voulumes with 15000 facets of the muon precision chambers system . \n the real - time displacements are fluid ( @xmath3  10 views per second ) for a number of volumes @xmath4  400 . \n an event scan on testbeam data provides another performance measurement . in the exercise \n consisting in the display of events in loop with 6 chambers and typically 20 hits , it needs 0.02 s / event for bare evd . \n this an order of magnitude less than the time needed to reconstruct the event : 0.20 s / event . \n the present design of the program has strong advantages . \n the user can download a single executable binary files . \n no special dynamic library loading , no fancy apis need to be installed . the program is efficient even if operated remotely , e.g. on remote clusters from a x - terminal .    on the other side , \n the program has shortcomings . \n it uses a limited graphics interface ( 256 colors in the current version of higz , possibly extended to 1024 ) . \n it does not profit from the high performance capabilities of graphics cards when operated locally on pcs ( z - buffer ) .    in the developments under consideration , a migration to opengl is envisaged . however some of the features of the present design would be lost . \n for example , such technology based on z - buffer does nt allow to delineate the volume edges . \n this property is crucial for hep detectors . \n it is considered to integrate parts of persint in the root data analysis framework . \n the graphics capabilities of root would be enhanced by using the calculus of hidden faces and intersecting volumes . in parallel , the integration of persint in the athena atlas software framework for reconstruction and analysis can be studied . \n the utilization of persint will continue as an event and geometry display for the atlas experiment . \n it will be used as online evd in the h8 - 2003 muon testbeam , and in the h8 - 2004 atlas combined testbeam . \n it will have an important role to play in the commissioning of atlas , participating in the debug of the detector ( cosmics run , calibration runs , ... ) . \n finally it is a candidate for the atlas online evd for monitoring of data -

pairs . in each geant step , the diffusion variance is evaluated : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the drift path and @xmath13 . \n @xmath14 is taken to be the hole diffusion coefficient : @xmath14 = 11 cm @xmath15s @xcite and @xmath16 , where the hole mobility is taken to be @xmath17 = 450 cm@xmath15vs @xcite and @xmath19 is the electric field per unit length ( which depends on the bias voltage ) . \n this model gives a qualitatively good description of the beam test data ( see figure [ fig : clustertype ] ) and tuning of the model parameters is currently under way . \n + geant3 is not supported anymore since 1996 . therefore , alice implements the possibility to use geant4 @xcite and the more broadly physics validated fluka @xcite in its detector simulation . \n the code which interfaces the alice software package aliroot @xcite with these packages has been validated using the beam test of 2004 . \n for example , it is confirmed that differences between fluka and geant3 do not affect the simulation of the spd . \n data analysis of the proton beam tests in 2002 and 2003 shows excellent performance of the alice spd with @xmath7 99 % efficiencies and intrinsic precision @xmath20 11 @xmath21 in the @xmath2 coordinate . \n given the successful exploitation of the previous beam tests , the 2004 beam test integrating all three its silicon detector technologies did not need to entirely focus on detector and read out electronics performance . \n the detectors were rather used to test alice daq , trigger and data analysis which is used to validate the alice software framework . \n + simulation of the spd using geant3 including gaussian diffusion of charges gives a good description of the beam test data of 2002 and 2003 already with simple assumptions on the model parameters . \n further improvement is expected from currently performed tuning of its parameters . \n newer particle tracking packages , like geant4 or the more extensively physics validated fluka are implemented within the alice detector simulation and the code is validated using the 2004 beam test data . \n alice collaboration 1999 , technnical design report of the inner tracking system , cern / lhcc 1999 -

{"ContextTokens": 4088, "GeneratedTokens": 223, "SynthesizedBody": "graphene is a single - layer atomically thin allotrope form of carbon , where carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice . owing to its single - atom thickness and unique electronic properties it is a promising material for technological use @xcite . \n although graphene was originally thought to be a pure system , recent scanning tunneling microscopy work shows that it is a disordered system @xcite . \n it has lattice defects , vacancies , ripples , dislocations , magnetic impurities , etc . \n particularly there are charge puddles caused by chemical adsorption or molecules trapped between the graphene lattice and substrate @xcite . \n previous studies of impurities have focused on understanding their effects on the ground state electronic properties of graphene @xcite . however , an equally important aspect is the study of the consequences of these charged impurities on the dielectric response for future electronic devices . \n several studies explored plasmonic excitations in pristine graphene @xcite . \n so far almost no work focused on localized plasmons ( nano - plasmons ) in graphene . \n these excitations have the ability to concentrate an electric field ( visible photons ) at the nanoscale regime , thereby beating the diffraction limit . \n the potential technological applications of this effect are vast . \n for example , it is possible to improve solar cell efficiency by increasing the cross section of the absorbing material without requiring a thick layer of it @xcite . \n another potential application is the new sub - field of photonics called plasmonics , where plasmons substitute photons in the information transport extending photonics into the nanoscale world @xcite . in biology \n the potential applications include labeling and imaging , optical sensing and photo - therapy treatment of cancer @xcite .    here \n we study nano - plasmons , that is , localized plasmonic excitations in pristine and disordered graphene . \n when plasmons are localized the translational invariance of the lattice is lost , hence analytical calculations become impractical . \n a self - consistent quantum - mechanical approach to nano - plasmons in graphene in the presence of impurities has been developed , which accounts for the non - locality of the dielectric response function @xcite . \n here we use a generalized version of this approach , where the polarization operator is diagonalized , providing information about individual plasmonic excitations , including spatial profiles and local spectral density of states . \n the calculation is performed for a single impurity at the center of the carbon hexagon . \n we study the impurity effect as a function of the sign , strength , and size of the impurity potential , and the doping level of graphene . the interactive use of three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization allows us to identify readily which plasmonic excitations are localized vs.  delocalized . \n our visualization of the poles of self - consistently calculated polarization operators shows the existence of nano - plasmons around naturally occurring impurities in graphene , which confirms that graphene is an intrinsic plasmonic material @xcite . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the lattice model used to calculate the plasmonic excitations in graphene . in section 3 \n , we describe the needs for an advanced 3d visualization tool to analyze complex multidimensional data sets and discuss the computational requirements . \n the results of the plasmonic modes are presented in section 4 . in section 5 \n , we perform a quantitative analysis of the symmetries of the various nano - plasmonic modes and conclude in section 6 . \n the electronic structure of graphene is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the kinetic and potential energy , while @xmath2 is the coulomb interaction between electrons . \n the interaction is treated as a perturbation and will be considered later in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . the single - particle part of the hamiltonian on a lattice is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes nearest neighbor sites ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are operators that create and annihilate electrons at site @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ev is the tight - binding hopping parameter , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential ( @xmath10 for undoped graphene ) . \n @xmath11 is the change in the on - site potential for atom at site @xmath12 due to the presence of an impurity at @xmath13 . \n @xmath14 is the strength of the impurity potential and @xmath15 determines its spatial spread . \n the matrix structure of the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath1 is @xmath16 the diagonalization of the non - interacting single - particle hamiltonian @xmath17 gives eigenstates @xmath18 and eigenvalues @xmath19 which satisfy @xmath20 . \n each state has an occupation number given by the fermi function @xmath21^{-1}$ ] .    in order to compute the polarization operator due to an induced charge \n , we define the tensorial matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the basis of the eigenstates @xmath24 using the superindices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which reshape a matrix into a vector in a column - wise fashion so while @xmath27 one has @xmath28 , the above tensors can be written as diagonal matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 the polarization operator is a density - density response function . summing the product of non - interacting green s functions over matsubara frequencies \n @xmath31 one obtains the non - interacting polarization operator @xmath32 using the superindices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one can write @xmath35 as the product of diagonal matrices @xmath36 which again is a diagonal matrix \n .    next we include the coulomb interaction @xmath2 for electrons on the lattice . \n the interaction hamiltonian is written in terms of creation and annihilation operators in the lattice basis as @xmath37 where the only non - zero components are @xmath38 we can write @xmath2 in the basis of the eigenstates , where it will be a full tensorial matrix . therefore @xmath2 can also be represented as a matrix in the superindex space @xmath39 .    within the rpa calculation \n the polarization operator of the interacting system is given by @xmath40 using eq . \n ( [ eqn : polariz ] ) we can write @xmath41 the nano - plasmonic excitations correspond to the poles of the polarization operator . hence the modes correspond to charge density oscillations with amplitude @xmath42 such that @xmath43 the matrix @xmath44 is diagonalized giving the eigenvalues @xmath45 and eigenvectors @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 . \n the polarization has poles at @xmath48 for each eigenvalue @xmath45 of @xmath49 . \n one can then find the spatial profile of the mode with energy @xmath45 through @xmath50 . by going back to the lattice basis and neglecting the orbital overlap \n we get the local charge oscillation @xmath51 the amplitude of the induced charge density oscillation at site @xmath7 is the vector @xmath52 . of course the induced charge will oscillate with frequency @xmath45 , that is , @xmath53 . \n we use a standard numerically exact diagonalization method to solve eq . \n ( [ eqn : condition ] ) . \n this allows us to find all the poles of the polarization operator and , thus , we obtain the complete information of the plasmonic excitations on the graphene lattice . for a lattice having @xmath54 sites , \n the matrix size of @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 . \n the number of eigenmodes scales as @xmath57 for @xmath58 electron - hole pairs at half - filling . therefore the number of data points where the plasmon dispersion needs to be visualized scales as @xmath59 , which becomes rapidly a big number even for small lattice sizes . \n visualization plays an important role in scientific data analysis with a growing need for being able to visually analyze complicated data sets in three dimensions ( in real space ) and more ( in parameter space ) . \n the analysis of such data is always complemented by the ability to effectively interact with the data . \n interacting with multidimensional data sets in a 3d environment ( stereo display ) adds an additional advantage to navigating and seeing _ through _ complex data sets . although this advanced visualization feature is not always necessary for the data analysis . \n the need for visual analysis of large data sets ( larger than the size that a typical computer with a graphics card can process ) is growing . \n the problem is commonly tackled by using distributed parallel processing on multiprocessor units . \n here we discuss a specific example of analyzing a multidimensional , medium - sized data set ( on the order of megabytes ) . \n the data set has 200,000 to 300,000 points in three dimensional space . in this paper \n , we show the efficiency of a small - scale parallel rendering computer cluster as a possible solution . \n the data is obtained from a calculation of the spatial distribution of plasmonic excitations ( induced charges on lattice sites ) in pristine and impure graphene . since visual analysis of data combined with quantitative analysis provides a better understanding of the data studied , we present specific examples for the quantification of visual information using the open - source visualization tool paraview @xcite . \n we analyze the dispersion of the plasmonic excitation as a function of energy @xmath60 . since the graphene lattice is two dimensional , the analysis of the induced charge distribution on individual lattice sites as a function of energy @xmath61 adds one more dimension to the visualization problem . for a given impurity potential , \n a single data set is already four dimensional ( 4d ) in the hyper - space of variables ( x , y , @xmath61 , @xmath62(x , y,@xmath61 ) ) . \n the x - y dimension is fixed by the number of lattice sites chosen for the calculation . \n we fixed it to be @xmath63 lattice sites . \n the z - dimension is determined by the number of possible energies @xmath61 of the plasmonic excitations . for 96 lattice sites \n the number of unique frequencies @xmath61 is about @xmath64 , and the number of induced charges as a function of frequency to be visualized is about @xmath65 . to specify the induced charge oscillation at each lattice site \n , we need one scalar value and three coordinates . \n further , we need at least two colors to represent the polarity of the induced charge . in three dimensions \n it is necessary to use a 3d glyph to represent the scalar value ( induced charge ) . \n we use a `` sphere glyph '' having at least 10 points of resolution for angle @xmath66 and 10 points for angle @xmath67 @xcite . in the xml unstructured grid data file format @xcite , for which the visualization tool paraview has a reader to input data , the size of the raw data file is about 10 megabytes . after using the 3d sphere glyphs , to represent the induced charge distribution , \n the size of the data set to be processed becomes about 1.3 gigabytes @xmath68 megabytes . \n so the memory required by the computer to process the data becomes more than 100 times larger than the size of the original raw data set . \n one can use a single - processor computer with a high - end graphics card to analyze and post - process a couple of such data sets , but many data sets of this size can not be efficiently processed , let alone attempting a real - time or interactive data analysis . hence using a single - processor computer \n is neither time efficient nor practical and parallel rendering on multiple cores or cpus ( central processing units ) or multiple gpus ( graphical processing units ) becomes mandatory . in the remainder of this study we demonstrate how distributed parallel rendering on multiple cpus can solve the problem of large data sets . \n [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n using an advanced visualization tool like paraview one can extract in addition to the _ obvious _ visual cues @xcite also quantitative information from the data set of interest . \n we demonstrate this capability by first plotting a histogram of the distribution of induced charges over all lattice sites and over all energies . \n the histogram is generated by applying the built - in ` histogram ' filter in paraview @xcite on a data set with impurity potential @xmath69 . \n this information may appear trivial , but is of interest to verify the conservation of total charge in our calculations , i.e. , the sum of all induced charges must vanish and must be equally distributed between positive and negative oscillations . since pristine graphene does not have localized plasmons , whereas impure graphene does , it is important to understand the rearrangement of induced charges . \n we can check for charge conservation and induced charge balance for two completely different cases , namely , localization vs.  delocalization of modes . \n the symmetric distribution of the induced charges as seen in the histogram or probability function of finding a specific induced charge in fig . \n [ fig : histogram ] implies that the total induced charge is zero . \n we verified the charge neutrality by calculating the sum of the induced charges .    in both cases , pristine and impure graphene , \n the number of zero - induced charges is significantly larger than the number of nonzero induced charges , i.e , lattice sites that are unaffected . \n however the number of zero - induced charges is slightly bigger in impure graphene than in pristine graphene . \n the magnitude of induced charges decrease exponentially in impure graphene , while it has a gaussian distribution in pristine graphene . \n the range of the magnitude of induced charges is slightly bigger for impure graphene . \n this implies that a relatively small number of plasmons acquires a bigger magnitude of induced charges . \n the larger number of zero - induced charges , as well as a wider range in the distribution of charges , and the exponential decrease are consequences of localized plasmonic excitations . \n next , we monitor the induced charge at a single site in the graphene lattice as a function of energy . \n the calculation is performed with or without the presence of impurity . for the impurity case \n the impurity potential is fixed at @xmath70 . \n we plot this information by using the built - in ` plot over line ' filter @xcite . \n it gives interpolated values of the variable along an arbitrary user - specified line . \n the result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : probe_line ] for a particular nearest - neighbor site of the impurity , marked by the arrow in fig . \n [ fig : graphene_lattice](a ) . \n one also sees that the range of induced charges are bigger for the impure graphene . \n in addition , comparing fig .  [ \n fig : histogram](b ) and fig . \n [ fig : probe_line](b ) one can see that the range of induced charges in impure graphene increases with increasing impurity potential from @xmath69 to @xmath71 .    finally , we extracted the energy - resolved spatial distribution of induced charges for pristine and impure graphene . \n as mentioned above , there are about 2300 plasmonic modes for a lattice with @xmath63 sites . \n it is very time consuming to extract every individual plasmonic excitation manually . however , this can be automated in paraview by using the sui ( script user interface ) . \n we developed a simple _ python _ script , which controls the rendering in paraview , to extract the distribution of the induced charges for all energies . \n it is worth mentioning that using a single - processor computer it is impractical to extract the necessary information in real time ( it takes several hours to resolve the spatial distribution for all energies ) . \n this computationally intensive problem can be overcome by running the sui in parallel rendering mode . \n since there are many unique plasmonic modes ( characterized by the unique induced charge distributions ) , it is impossible to report all of them . \n so we show only a few selected plasmonic modes in fig . \n [ fig : plane_cut_u=0 ] . \n one can clearly see that the cancellation of induced charges , which is required for the conservation of the total charge , can happen locally ( e.g. , pairwise ) or globally ( e.g. , in groups ) . \n some plasmons have simple patterns of dipolar , quadrupolar or triangular distribution of localized induced charges . \n however , others have non - trivial symmetries and correspond to higher - order multipoles .    in fig . \n [ fig : plane_cut_u=2 ] we show the energy - resolved spatial distribution of induced charges in impure graphene for a few selected plasmon energies with characteristic patterns . \n these charge distributions are very different from those of the pristine lattice . \n we can clearly see that the cancellation of induced charges can happen only over a larger area , because of the creation of localized plasmons . \n some of these modes have simple patterns of dipolar , quadrupolar , radial or triangular symmetry . \n however , others have highly non - trivial patterns , e.g. , clumps of similar charges on nearest lattice sites . \n the main result reported here is that the localization of plasmonic modes occurs at the nano - meter scale concentrating the electric field onto a very small area . \n we investigated through exact diagonalization the plasmonic excitations of graphene in the presence of a single impurity with a special focus on localized modes ( nano - plasmons ) near the impurity . \n the dependence of excitations on the model parameters such as the sign , magnitude , size of the impurity potential and number of electrons in graphene was discussed . \n it was shown that the impurity potential and doping can be used to tune the properties of nano - plasmonic excitations , demonstrating that graphene is an inherently plasmonic material . \n taking nano - plasmons in graphene as a case study , we demonstrated the importance of a three - dimensional , interactive visualization tool to explore and analyze large data sets in a more effective and time efficient way . \n we described the visualization problem faced with , even when the data set is only several megabytes in size . \n this issue arises when the data set is intrinsically multidimensional in both real space and parameter space . as a solution to this problem \n , we proposed a small - scale parallel processing approach , because it can no longer be efficiently handled by a single - processor computer . finally , using an interactive visualization tool we could extract even more quantitative information leading to a better understanding of the physical properties of nano - plasmons on a two - dimensional lattice . \n the results discussed can be tested , in principle , in experiments by high - frequency optical probes or local scanning tunneling spectroscopy probes . however , in order to achieve such tests , calculations of extended or nano - sized impurity clusters are very desirable as they would give plasmonic excitations spread over a larger size with smaller frequencies . \n we are especially grateful to james ahrens and john patchett for many helpful discussions and support on the efficient use of paraview . \n this work was carried out under the auspices of the national nuclear security administration of the u.s . \n department of energy through the laboratory directed research and development program and the office of basic energy sciences at the center for integrated nanotechnologies at the los alamos national laboratory under contract no . \n de -

{"ContextTokens": 3911, "GeneratedTokens": 226, "SynthesizedBody": "the effect of gravitational lensing is to redistribute the intensity from sources behind the lens into images with different positions and brightnesses , while conserving surface brightness @xcite . \n this means that gravitational lensing not only magnifies the background sources , but also changes their apparent density on the sky . \n the details of whether the number counts of background sources seen through a foreground gravitational lens are increased or decreased depend on the properties of the lens and the slope of the faint counts @xcite , a process known as magnification bias @xcite . \n in this letter , we report detection of a deficit in the surface brightness of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) in the centers of massive galaxy clusters measured using the spire instrument @xcite on the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite . to interpret these observations and understand the consequences of lensing a background field , the lensing properties of the cluster and the background source population are carefully simulated in a large number of realizations . \n we concentrate on the intensity profile after removing detected sources to highlight faint fluctuations in the cib . \n the resulting effect after such a removal is a localized region of decreased surface brightness at the cluster center . \n we use these observations to constrain the intensity of the submillimeter ( sub - mm ) background at @xmath2 m . \n this study uses confusion - limited maps of galaxy clusters from the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; @xcite ) . \n the spire data are reduced using a combination of the hipe @xcite and smap ( @xcite ; @xcite ) packages . \n the sample of clusters is listed in @xcite and m.  zemcov et al . \n ( in preparation ) .    in order to study the strongly lensed regions it is necessary to restrict our attention to those clusters large enough that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the solid angle of the negative magnification region and @xmath5 is the solid angle of the spire beam . \n this cut leaves only four clusters from the hermes sample of twelve : a370 , a1689 , a2219  and rx j@xmath6 . \n the negative magnification region in the image plane maps to the interior of the lens caustic in the source plane , so it is a reasonable tracer of the area which undergoes strong lensing . \n the mapping from total mass to lensing characteristics is complex and the area @xmath4 is not strictly proportional to cluster mass ; however , this cut does effectively restrict our analysis to the most massive centrally condensed systems .    to measure the deficit , \n a catalog is generated for each cluster at each spire wavelength using the scat algorithm @xcite based on @xmath2 m source - selection . \n our goal is not to identify particular point sources , but rather to remove emission from bright point sources , so employing a low detection threshold is reasonable . \n we chose a @xmath7 threshold , where @xmath8 is the map root - mean - square variation , dominated in these maps by confusion noise . \n the measurement is not sensitive to the precise value of this number provided it is not so high as to leave residual sources ( @xmath9 ) nor so low as to needlessly mask a large fraction of the map ( @xmath10 ) . \n this yields a catalog of @xmath11 sources in each cluster field which are then subtracted from the cluster image using a gaussian model of the beam . \n an example of the resulting image for one cluster is shown in figure [ fig : maps ] , which shows a statistical deficit in surface brightness near the center of the cluster . \n a simple way to visualize this deficit is to plot annular averages of the source - subtracted maps , as shown in figure [ fig : clustercenter ] . \n similar averages centered on randomly chosen positions in spire images do not show this deficit . \n gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness and therefore does not alter the mean intensity of the extragalactic background light at any wavelength . however , this statement applies only when all sources are kept in calculating the intensity profile and when averaged over many directions through the cluster  for some configurations of the background sky unusually bright images can be found . \n the measurement reported here involves the removal of bright detected sources , which leads to a situation where lensing shows a profile that does not conserve intensity . \n this does not imply that the total number of photons and therefore intensity is not conserved , as discussed in @xcite , since detected sources are removed .    when viewed through a lensing cluster imposing a magnification @xmath12 on background sources , a background source with flux density @xmath13 \n is magnified such that the observed flux density is @xmath14 . \n the resulting increase in the flux density is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the projected surface density of galaxies ; the observed number density of sources through the lens is modified to be @xmath15 . \n the overall effect of this is to modulate existing fluctuations in the background source field . using the parameterization that the intrinsic number count of the faint background sources scales as @xmath16 , the differential number counts lensed through the cluster become @xmath17 . \n the differential counts imaged through the cluster are either decreased or increased depending on whether the intrinsic counts have a slope @xmath18 smaller than or greater than 2 . if sources are not removed from the image , the total cib surface brightness is conserved @xcite .    the observations reported here \n do not constrain the exact number counts of sources or the difference of the counts of sources through and away from the cluster . \n one reason for this is that the observations are limited by the angular resolution of the spire instrument , which results in a blending of the faintest sources . \n the effects of limited - resolution observations of the intensity profile of background sources through the cluster are described in @xcite and @xcite . \n high resolution observations with alma will allow more precise measurements of the difference in the counts away from and through the cluster . \n we can use detailed lensing models of these well - studied clusters and models of the source counts and redshift distributions of the sources which comprise the cib to generate numerical simulations of the observed sky brightness , and explore how the amplitude of an observed deficit depends on source model parameters . to simulate the sub - mm background \n , we use the model described in @xcite , which is tuned to match a variety of observed number counts @xmath19 and is forced to integrate to the total intensity of the cib @xcite . \n the model associates both a spectral shape and redshift to each source , down to @xmath20 . \n these simulations do not include coherent clustering of the galaxies which comprise the sub - mm background , which is a small effect on the scales of interest here ( @xmath21 arcmin ; @xcite ) . \n poisson noise is modeled by the simulation and accounts for the cosmic variance one would expect in the real sky . \n the simulated images have area @xmath22 deg@xmath23 and contain @xmath24 sources to source fluxes @xmath25njy . \n these simulated backgrounds are then lensed using lenstool models ( @xcite ;

all the sources with @xmath27 are lensed from redshift planes discretized into @xmath28 steps . \n varying the redshift distribution of the @xcite model within reasonable limits does not change the results of these simulations . \n an example of one such simulation is shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : maps ] . \n the central surface brightness deficit is evident in the modeled image in all three spire bands . \n these simulations show that three factors contribute to the effect reported here : ( 1 ) the sizes and typical lensing amplification factors of clusters , ( 2 ) the number densities and redshifts of the sources responsible for the cib , and ( 3 ) the sensitivity and beam size of spire . \n these combine so that when we examine the lensed cores of spire images of cluster fields and remove all reasonably significant sources , we are left with deficits in the surface brightness of the sky in small regions near the cluster center .    in order to compare the data to the simulations , we use the same procedure discussed above on simulations of the cluster targets . in these simulations , \n instrumental noise with the same amplitude as the data is inserted into the simulated , lensed cluster images which are propagated through an identical detection / subtraction procedure as the real data , resulting in the gray bands in figure [ fig : clustercenter ] which represent the mean and standard deviation of the model results drawn from 100 realizations of the background sky . \n these capture the variance of the lensing deficit due to different background configurations and reflect the range of possible deficit shapes and amplitudes arising from our ignorance of the exact configuration of the background sources . \n a potential concern is whether simulating sources to @xmath29njy is sufficient for the modeling result to converge . to check this \n , we have performed simulations where sources are excluded below @xmath30 . by @xmath31jy \n the map is densely populated and the effect has converged , and including fainter sources does not have an appreciable effect on the amplitude of the deficit . this is because sources below @xmath32jy are rarely boosted above the @xmath7 detection threshold so do not create a net deficit after source removal .    to investigate the dependence of the deficit on the background number counts , \n we perform simulations drawn from the measured counts presented in @xcite , similar to the calculations in @xcite . \n the slope of the faint end for @xmath33mjy @xmath34mjy is varied in @xmath35 , bracketing the nominal value @xmath36 which accounts for the firas background ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as can be seen in figure [ fig : simgamma ] , for shallow slopes , \n the surface density of sources is small enough to produce zero flux in the center of clusters . for steeper slopes , \n the probability that a source falls behind the center of the cluster image is no longer small and the surface brightness increases . \n existing constraints on the brightness of the cib at @xmath2 m exclude @xmath37 at @xmath38 in this range @xcite . \n according to our simulations using the @xcite model , statistically the central region of these clusters images have zero surface brightness from lensed sources . at @xmath2 m , \n emission from sources within the central arcminute of clusters tends to be faint . \n therefore a situation arises where the cluster itself is `` invisible '' , the probability of a foreground source coinciding with the cluster center is small , and the background is lensed by the cluster , so no sources of emission exist in the center of the cluster . \n if this region has zero surface brightness , as the model suggests , we can use it as an absolute zero point . \n l|ccccccc cluster & @xmath39 & cib @xmath40 & stat . \n @xmath41 & model @xmath41 & bcg @xmath41 & abs . \n @xmath41 & total @xmath41 + & @xmath42 & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) & ( mjy sr@xmath1 ) +    a370 & 3.0 & 0.67 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + a1689 & 7.5 & 0.68 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath45 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 + a2219 & 3.3 & 0.71 & @xmath49 & @xmath43 & @xmath45 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + rx j@xmath6 & 11.3 & 0.71 & @xmath54 & @xmath49 & @xmath45 & @xmath55 & @xmath51 +    total & 25.1 & 0.69 & @xmath50 & @xmath54 & @xmath56 & @xmath52 & @xmath57 +    of course , if the above assumption is incorrect , any sources of emission local to the cluster center  for example , from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) or the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect  will bias the measurement to lower inferred surface brightness . \n though only a @xmath58 fractional contamination in the @xmath2 m spire band , the sz effect is significant at longer sub - mm wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) so we defer reporting the cib inferred from the two longer wavelength spire bands to future work . \n sub - mm emission associated with the central region of target clusters is known @xcite ; for example , in the hermes sample ( but excluded from this work ) abell 1835  and abell 2390  are both known to host bcgs with sub - mm fluxes of many mjy . because of this potential bias , the lensing deficit yields a lower limit to the cib . to check for contamination from galaxies within the critical region , we use _ \n spitzer_-mips @xmath59 m data . \n no bcgs are obvious in the spire images of the four clusters , but we can use the @xmath59 m  @xmath2 \n m bcg flux density ratio measured by @xcite to estimate an additional one - sided , positive - going uncertainty to the central zero point in each image . \n this corresponds to a @xmath7 value of @xmath60mjy per beam at the position of the bcg . \n we do not detect other @xmath59 m sources associated with the cluster in the central deficit region . \n diffuse dust emission associated with the intracluster medium has never been detected , but from predictions we expect this kind of emission to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the surface brightness of the lensing deficit at @xmath61 m @xcite .    to determine the absolute intensity of the cib , the average of each map in its central region is used to generate a zero point for the image . \n the mean brightness of the resulting image , excluding the central region , is then computed . to estimate the uncertainty associated with each measurement , \n we compute the quadrature sum of the statistical uncertainty of the maps as traced by the standard deviation of the pixels in the central region ( stat . \n @xmath62 ) , the one - sided uncertainty from the bcg emission ( bcg  @xmath41 ) , the uncertainty from the simulations associated with the configuration of the background source ( model @xmath41 ) , and the @xmath63% absolute calibration uncertainty of spire ( abs .  cal . \n @xmath64 ) . \n we estimate the eddington bias associated with the effect of subtracting sources from the maps before computing the mean of the central region by comparing simulations including and excluding simulated noise , resulting in an estimate of @xmath65mjy sr@xmath1 for the eddington bias on the sample . \n table [ tab : cib ] lists the areas of negative magnification in each target , the inferred cib brightness for each of the four cluster fields that pass all of the selection cuts , and the uncertainty budget associated with these measurements . \n the statistical - uncertainty weighted mean of this value , @xmath66mjy sr@xmath1 , is the inferred brightness of the cib at @xmath2 m from the lensing deficit method . \n this value is consistent with the firas values determined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the same band within @xmath7 . \n we have detected an interesting new phenomenon which is due to the properties of the sub - mm background and gravitational lensing in massive clusters . \n this deficit in the measured surface brightness constrains the smallest allowable surface brightness of the cib and so is another way to limit its absolute brightness , adding to a list which includes @xmath67 analyses , stacking , and source counting , in addition to direct photometric measurement . \n furthermore , in principle the presence of this deficit places interesting constraints on the faint end of the number counts , although larger samples and comprehensive modeling are required to convert measurements to source count constraints . \n because gravitational lensing is achromatic , this effect occurs in all of the spire bands . \n other instruments working at sub - mm and mm wavelengths like act / spt and ccat should also be able to measure this deficit effect , assuming that the background in question is sufficiently far behind the lensing cluster , and that the instrumentation is sensitive to sources at levels similar to spire s with enough angular resolution to resolve the central region of clusters . \n in addition , this effect produces a complicated , spatially structured cib surface brightness distribution which is a potential foreground for high resolution sz effect measurements at longer wavelengths . \n spire has been developed by a consortium of institutes led by cardiff univ .

trough filter has been constructed for 50 hz mains , attenuating interference in the mhz region and above by @xmath4 90 db \n .    the resonant frequency of both cavities must stay close to the system frequency @xmath1 during the measurement run . \n we define half the 3  db bandwidth of the cavities ( 65  khz ) as the limit for the maximum amount of allowable drift . \n the emitting cavity dissipates 50  w of power by forced air cooling . \n it heats up and expands considerably . during a warm up period \n the drift of @xmath5  1  mhz is manually compensated by a tuning screw . \n after @xmath5  1 h , thermal equilibrium is reached , the cavity is stable and no further tuning adjustments are necessary . \n we monitor the reflected power from its coupling port continuously by a directional coupler and a detector diode , as long it is below a certain threshold , the cavity is considered to be on tune . \n the resonant frequency of the detecting cavity is monitored by observing a bump in its spectral noise power density . a low noise amplifier ( lna ) , based on a high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) is directly connected to the detecting cavity , it provides g = 44.7  db gain at @xmath6 = 32.4  k noise temperature . \n the noise temperature of the detection cavity is frequency dependent , its maximum is at resonance and equals the physical temperature of @xmath7 = 290  k. this can be observed as a significant peak over the noise floor of the amplifier , allowing us to determine the resonant frequency . \n the overall system noise temperature of the complete receiving chain , determined by friis formula is @xmath8 = 32.5  k.    since there is no energy loss associated with the wisp conversion process , the regenerated photons in the detecting cavity appear with the same energy as the photons in the emitting cavity . \n thus , the signal which is coupled out from the detecting cavity has the same frequency and bandwidth as the one which is generated on the emitting side . for this reason , \n data processing is a matter of detecting a sinusoidal signal of known frequency in the white background noise . \n the vsa records complex samples , representing a bandpass limited signal with up to 25 mhz span , centered at @xmath9 . \n the recorded data is evaluated by a python script , estimating the noise power spectrum . after applying a hanning window to reduce the effect of spectral leakage ( \n if the narrowband signal falls between two bins and no window is used , its amplitude can be reduced by up to 36 % @xcite ) , one fast fourier transform ( fft ) is calculated over the entire time trace , which can be up to several hundred millions of samples long . \n the `` fftw '' software library is used to implement the fft efficiently . \n r0.4        considering pure white noise as an input signal to the calculation , @xmath10 describes the 3 db bandwidth of one spectral bin . \n it depends on the length of the recorded time trace ( @xmath11 ) and the applied window function . \n the hanning window broadens the frequency response by a factor of @xmath12 . \n the average available noise power @xmath13 decreases proportionally with the length of the time trace @xmath11 . if a signal is observed , it will appear as a single line in the spectrum with constant power . \n the signal to noise ration should thus improve linearly with @xmath11 . \n for this to hold true , all oscillators must be synchronized and stay stable in frequency relative to each other within a tolerance given by @xmath14 . \n synchronization is achieved by a 10 mhz signal , which all instruments use as frequency reference . \n long - term frequency drifts in the order of few mhz can not be avoided during the @xmath15  h measurement time . \n however , with synchronization , they will affect all oscillators in the same way and cancel out in the measurement result . \n this way , each bin of the synchronized fft effectively corresponds to a lock - in amplifier , tuned to the bin s center frequency . to proof the setup is stable over 12 h , a test run has been conducted . for the evaluation \n , its time trace has been truncated to different lengths . in fig \n [ fig : signoise ] , the expected linear decrease of the average noise floor can be observed . \n a narrowband signal has been introduced by provoking electromagnetic leakage . \n once the signal emerges from the noise floor , it stays relatively constant in power . \n the signal peak never exceeded the width of two bins in the spectrum , which is the minimum dictated by the hanning window , showing that the frequency - locking with a relative accuracy in the @xmath16hz range has been achieved between all the involved oscillators . \n a 11.5 h measurement run for hsps has been carried out in march 2012 . no narrowband signal was detected and the data was interpreted as an exclusion result . \n details can be found in @xcite . \n we improved over the most sensitive exclusion limits from cosmic microwave background measurements , in the energy range of @xmath17ev .    for axion measurements , \n both cavities need to be placed in a strong magnetic field . \n thus modification of the setup was necessary and a smaller secondary shielding box has been constructed from non magnetic stainless steel . \n it contains the detecting cavity , the lna and a analog optical link with 4.5 ghz bandwidth . \n the optical fibre allows signal transmission from the secondary to the primary shielding box , containing the optical receiver and the vsa . \n the cavities were tuned to the tm@xmath18 mode , at 1.76 ghz , coupling well to axions @xcite . the hardware transfer function from the cavity port , through all cables , the lna , and \n the optical link has been carefully determined by a network analyzer to be 60.0 db at 2.95 ghz and 58.7 db at 1.76 ghz , allowing to normalize the measured noise spectra .    in june 2012 \n a magnet was available during a one week timeslot . \n the normal conducting dipole magnet is regularly used for material testing at cern and has a aperture of @xmath5  100  x  50  x  30  cm . \n it provides an average field strength of 0.51 t , which has been confirmed by a calibrated hall probe . \n we were able to record 3 measurement runs of 4 h , 4 h and 6 h length . \n the first run showed em leakage . \n a weak spot could be narrowed down with a near - field probe to the gasket between lid and flange of the enclosure and mitigated by copper mesh . \n no signal and only noise was observed in the second and third run ( see fig .  [ \n fig : exclsignal ] ) . \n the data of the second run was translated to an exclusion limit for axions and is shown in fig . \n [ fig : excldetail ] and fig . \n [ fig : excloverview ] as the red trace . in the third run , @xmath5 7 mm@xmath19 of cr@xmath20o@xmath21 crystals \n have been placed on the bottom of each cavity . \n one may speculate if cr@xmath20o@xmath21 interacts with axions because of its magneto - electric properties @xcite . \n however , despite a 2% reduction in q factor , no surprising effects were observed . \n although current exclusion limits could not be challenged , we gained experience on our measurement setup and successfully operated it within a magnet for the first time . this allows to utilize a stronger , superconducting magnet in a next step . \n we are planning to work together with an external partner , where a superconducting magnet with a wide enough aperture for our measurement setup is available . \n the projected sensitivity with this magnet ( 4.5 t ) and the current setup in a 8 h run is shown in fig . \n [ fig : excloverview ] as the blue trace . \n + the authors would like to thank r.  jones , e.  jensen and the be department management for encouragement and support . \n thanks to the organizers of the patras workshop for a very enjoyable and inspiring conference . \n supported by the wolfgang - gentner - programme of the bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung ( bmbf ) . \n j.  jaeckel , a.  ringwald , _ \n `` a cavity experiment to search for hidden sector photons '' _ , physics b659 2008 g. heinzel et al . , `` _ _ spectrum and spectral density estimation by the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , including a comprehensive list of window functions and some new flat - top windows _ _ '' , max - planck - institut fr gravitationsphysik 02/2002", "StartTimeOffset": 698106793122, "RequestID": "91a5a62414691b4e3c3513bbcf0bd3025f124d0c", "TotalTokens": 2545}
{"ContextTokens": 2768, "GeneratedTokens": 127, "SynthesizedBody": "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are bursts of gamma - rays that arguably signal the birth of a black hole somewhere in the universe . based on the duration and spectrum , two classes of bursts \n have been observed  @xcite : those that last less than two seconds and have on the average hard spectra ( short grbs ) , and those that last longer than two seconds and are spectrally softer ( long grbs ) . the exact nature of the grb progenitors is unknown , although it is possible that long grbs come from the collapse of massive , rapidly rotating stars  @xcite and short grbs result from the merger of compact objects  @xcite . \n regardless of the progenitor system , accretion onto the resulting compact object is thought to create a highly relativistic jet . \n the prompt gamma - ray emission from the grbs may arises from the internal shocks due to collisions of faster shells with slower ones ejected earlier by the central engine . \n the subsequent softer multi - wavelength emission , referred to as the afterglow , may be due to the collision of the fireball with the extra - stellar material  @xcite . \n our understanding of grbs progressed very rapidly after the detection of multi - wavelength afterglows . \n well localized , favorably positioned grbs get fairly good multi - wavelength afterglow coverage . \n currently , the leading grb afterglow detection mission is @xmath0 which detects 90100 grbs annually . \n most of the @xmath0 grbs get observed by various instruments around the world because of its rapid arc - minute localization capability . \n compared to @xmath0 , @xmath1 gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) detects about 250 burst per year but with poor localization . the error circle ( ec ) of @xmath1 gbm detected bursts \n is too large for a single telescope to observe effectively . \n the typical statistical uncertainty of the gbm burst location is about 3.3 degrees . \n however , when combined with the systematic uncertainty of 3.8 degrees  @xcite , the total burst location uncertainty is @xmath2 5.0 degrees ( i.e. , 5.0 degree error radius ) . \n naturally , a brighter burst will have a smaller gbm ec than a weaker burst .    even though the localization is poor , gbm detected bursts have very good timing and spectral information including crucial @xmath3 measurements ( @xmath3 is the peak energy of the grb @xmath4 spectrum ) . if there is a method to localize gbm detected grbs to a few arc - seconds uncertainty , then large telescopes can do deeper follow  up observations to determine the redshift of the burst and also potentially identify any emerging supernova . in addition , @xmath0 can also slew quickly to the gbm burst in order to observe the x - ray afterglow and obtain its light curve in x - ray wavelengths . \n based on @xmath0 observations about @xmath2 60% of grbs have optical counterparts  @xcite . \n these optical counterparts are detected by various observatories with r magnitudes ranging from 14 to 22 within few hours after the burst  @xcite . \n thus , it is reasonable to assume about 60% of the gbm detected grbs also have optical counterparts with similar brightness distribution . if we were able to cover the entire gbm ec within about 24 hours after the burst it is conceivable that we would be able to find optical afterglows of @xmath2150 grbs per year , which is more than the total number of burst @xmath0 detects per year .    due to the small energy range ( 15 - 150 kev ) of the @xmath0 burst alert telescope ( bat ) \n , @xmath0 measurements alone can not constrain the @xmath3 of all bat detected bursts  @xcite . in contrast , due to the wide energy range ( 8 kev - 40 mev ) of gbm , all grbs detected by gbm have fairly good @xmath3 measurements . hence \n , addition of possibly another @xmath2100 bursts per year with good @xmath5 and redshift measurements may allow us to explore the validity of various grb luminosity relations and to conduct detailed grb hubble diagram studies . \n we have investigated the feasibility of using a system to do coordinated monitoring of the bat field - of - view ( fov ) for prompt optical emission from grbs  @xcite . \n the study showed that with the current instrumentation , performing such a coordinated monitoring is not practical mainly due to the bat s very large fov . \n however , a similar coordinated observing campaign can be used to find the optical afterglow of gbm detected bursts . \n the gbm ec is much smaller than the bat fov and observers do not need to continuously monitor the field to detect the optical afterglow . \n this enables a given observatory to perform multiple observations inside the gbm ec and thereby increase the chance of a afterglow detection . \n the basic proposal is to design a system to facilitate scanning of the gbm ec for optical emission from grb afterglows . \n this observing program will be specially aimed at amateur astronomers around the world . \n proliferation of amateur telescopes with high quality ccd cameras has opened a new avenue to study optical emission from grbs . \n the basic objective of the system is to coordinate a significant number of ground based telescopes to scan different patches of the gbm ec in order to find the location of the optical afterglow . unlike the gcn system  @xcite which sends notices to large number of recipients , \n this system will send customized targeted messages to individual registered telescopes . \n these individual messages will be sent via email or socket connections and they will have one or more assigned pointing locations for each telescope . \n the target telescopes can be either robotic or non - robotic . \n the selection of various patches in the gbm ec will be done based on the number of available telescopes , individual telescopes physical location , field of view ( fov ) and sensitivity . \n it is also reasonable to assume that these telescopes can observe multiple patches of the gbm ec , which will increase the chances of detection significantly . \n some of the important impacts of the proposed project are :    1 . \n the project will significantly enhance the value of gbm as a grb discovery instrument . \n 2 .   potentially increase the number of burst with good timing , spectral and redshift measurements . \n the project will allow and attract the participation of amateur astronomers and their telescopes .            in order to investigate the feasibility of the project \n , we performed a monte carlo simulation to study the probability of detection of optical afterglows from @xmath1 gbm grbs . \n we assumed that gbm detects about 150 grbs with optical afterglows ( total rate is 250 per year ) per year distributed isotropically in the sky and throughout the year . \n we have distributed telescopes in such a way that they roughly trace the major cities in the world . \n then for each burst we tracked the path of the sun and selected a set of telescopes away from the sun and within few hours from the burst location to scan the gbm ec . \n we also calculated the illuminated fraction of the moon s disk ( @xmath6 ) at the time of each burst . \n the probability , @xmath7 , of finding a grb was estimated by @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the total number of independent attempts to observe , with probability of success , @xmath10 . in this case \n @xmath9 is equal to the product of number of available telescopes and number of patches each telescope can observe . \n we calculated the probability of success , i.e. , the probability of detecting a given burst afterglow per observation using the following equation . \n @xmath11 note that typically the one @xmath12 gbm ec is @xmath13 . \n we repeated this procedure for every simulated burst , while changing the total number of telescopes participating in the program , the fov of telescopes , and total number of patches a given telescope can cover . \n the results of our simulation are shown in figure  [ sim_results01 ] and figure  [ sim_results02 ] . \n for these particular simulations we have assumed that all the telescopes have the same fov and all telescopes can cover some constant number of patches in the gbm ec . \n furthermore , we assumed that these telescopes will be able to observe assigned sky patches within a few hours after the burst . \n hence , in the simulation we used only telescopes which are within a few hours ( @xmath2 6 hours ) of the burst location . \n the number of participating telescopes in the observing program was varied from 20 to 100 . \n figure  [ sim_results01 ] shows the number of localized bursts ( @xmath14 total number of bursts ) as a function of the fov of participating telescopes . \n here we have fixed the number of participating telescopes to 25 . \n various curves correspond to different number of patches that each telescopes can observe . \n figure  [ sim_results02 ] shows the number of localized bursts as a function of number of participating telescopes in the program assuming that each telescope can observe 20 patches . \n the six curves shown in the plot correspond to various field of views . according to the simulation , with 60 telescopes participating \n it is possible to detect about 40 grb optical afterglows per year using telescopes with fov of @xmath15 . \n this value is close to the value of a typical fov of an amateur telescope . \n it is also interesting to note that if we have about 10 telescopes participating with fov of @xmath16 , then it is possible to detect about 25 grb afterglows per year . in order to put these values into perspective we point out that thus far , no one has managed to observe optical afterglow of a grb based only on a gbm localization ( the gbm has been detecting grbs for more than three years ) . \n it is also worth noting that not all the gbm locations will have a statistical error of 3.3 degrees . about a third of the grbs \n will have a statistical error less than this value . \n about 10% will have error of 1 degree or less . \n in such cases the gbm ec radius will be less than 5 degrees and may be as small as 4 degrees . obviously , for those cases we have a much higher chance of detecting the afterglow .    a schematic block diagram of a potential software system is shown in the figure  [ diagram ] \n the system has two components : 1 ) a scheduling system that will assign various observing patches to participating telescopes , and 2 ) a online system that will let observers to upload their images and search for candidate transients . \n the algorithms in the scheduling system will check the gbm ec observability of each participating telescope and assign them to different parts of the gbm ec . in doing this \n the algorithm will consider individual telescopes fov , sensitivity and local weather conditions . \n in addition , it will also assign more than one patch for each astronomer . \n on average an amateur astronomer may receive about 40 notices per year . \n the exposure time for each patch depends on many factors such as aperture , seeing , type of ccd camera etc and typically may vary from 1 to 30 mins . \n the probability of success depends on the telescope configuration ( fov , sensitivity ) , local weather and sky conditions , and the number of patches observed . \n however , every amateur observer who submits an observation to the system will get credit for their effort by being a co - author of the subsequent gcn notice that results from a successful detection . \n the online system is envisioned to have a web interface where the participants can submit their observations . \n it will also have online tools that will compare the submitted observations with existing catalogs and search for the optical afterglow of the grb . \n if one of the observations has a positive detection then the system will initiate a follow up observation to establish whether the candidate source is fading . \n if the candidate is found to be fading ( telltale signature of a grb afterglow ) then the magnitudes of the two images will be determined and a gcn circular will be sent . \n we investigate the feasibility of implementing a system that will coordinate ground based telescopes ( both amateur and professional ) to scan the gbm ec in order to localize gbm bursts . \n unlike the gcn system , proposed system will send individual customized messages to telescopes to observe certain patches in the gbm ec . \n the scientific objective of the system is by localizing gbm detected burst , we will be able to increase the number of gbm bursts with mutil - wavelength followups potentially with redshifts measurements . \n these measurements are scientifically very important because there are hints that gbm bursts may represent significantly different burst population . based on our simulation \n , we can detect about 25 grb afterglows per year using just 10 telescopes with @xmath16 field - of - view . with more telescopes participating in the program \n , we should be able to detect many more afterglows and study a potentially interesting burst population that is currently inaccessible to the grb community .", "StartTimeOffset": 704500739124, "RequestID": "0f1b75db98f1b02c411a6b8158b1404c64320747",

{"ContextTokens": 2656, "GeneratedTokens": 68, "SynthesizedBody": "there is no consensus regarding the generation of the magnetic field in neutron stars . \n the field could either be a fossil remnant from the progenitor star in the form of abrikosov fluxoids of the core proton super - conductor ( baym , pethick & pines 1969 , ruderman 1972 , bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) . \n or it could be generated after the formation of the neutron star in which case the currents would be entirely confined to the solid crust ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 ) . \n evidently , the nature of the evolution would depend very much on the internal field configuration . \n observations and statistical analyses of existing pulsar data , nevertheless , indicate that significant decay of magnetic field is achieved only if the neutron star is a member of an interacting binary ( bailes 1989 , bhattacharya 1991 , hartman et al . \n + the processes that are responsible for the field evolution in neutron stars in binaries are - a ) expulsion of the magnetic flux from the super - conducting core during the phase of propeller spin - down , b ) screening of the field by accreted matter and c ) rapid ohmic decay of the crustal field in an accretion - heated crust ( for a review see bhattacharya 2000 ) . \n diamagnetic screening of the field by accreted matter does not seem likely to have any long - term effect ( konar 1997 ) and we shall exclude it from the present discussion . \n the other models invoke ohmic decay of the current loops for a permanent decrease in the field strength . in either case \n , the effect of accretion is two - fold . \n the heating reduces the electrical conductivity and consequently the ohmic decay time - scale inducing a faster decay . at the same time \n the material movement , caused by the deposition of matter on top of the crust , pushes the original current carrying layers into deeper and denser regions where the higher conductivity slows the decay down . \n the mass of the crust of a neutron star changes very little with a change in the total mass ; accretion therefore implies assimilation of the original crust into the super - conducting core . \n when the original current carrying regions undergo such assimilation , further decay is stopped altogether . \n both the purely crustal model as well as the model assuming an expelled flux have been investigated by many authors ( see bhattacharya 2000 ) . the important difference between our work and that of the other investigators lies in our assumption of a _ flux freezing _ upon the assimilation of the original current carrying layers into the super -

spin period ' combination . \n our results agree well with the observations and are summarised in table - i ( kbi , konar & bhattacharya 1999a - kbii ) . \n the nature of field evolution is similar for the model of spin - down induced flux expulsion ( konar & bhattacharya 1999b - kbiii ) . \n though there is one major difference as can be seen from fig.([f_lmxb ] ) . to produce millisecond pulsars in lmxbs for an expelled flux large values of impurities , in the prior - to - accretion original crust , are required . but this would result in extremely small surface fields in old isolated pulsars . \n this is in complete contrast to a purely crustal model and expectation from statistical analyses of pulsar data . \n the paradigm of field evolution that have emerged out of observations , statistical analyses and theoretical expectations have been summarized in fig . \n ( [ f_paradigm ] ) where the connection between the radio pulsars and their binary counterparts , namely the x - ray binaries is indicated . in table - ii we indicate the constraints on various physical parameters in the field evolution models placed by the requirement to match observed properties in a variety of systems ( kbii , kbiii ) . the parameters discussed here are - the density at which the initial crustal current distribution is located ( @xmath1 ) , the impurity strength in the crust ( @xmath2 ) , the duration of wind - accretion phase in different binary systems and the rate of accretion in the roche -

the present data can be made to fit scenarios with both a _ slow _ or an _ accelerated _ cooling . \n therefore , it is not clear which is the correct cooling behaviour of an isolated neutron star . \n accreting phase - the crustal temperature corresponding to a given rate of accretion has not been determined with any degree of certainty . also , the existing results are limited in their scope . \n post - accretion phase - no calculation exists for the thermal behaviour of this phase at all . \n * transport properties * - several factors affect the transport properties and hence both thermal and magnetic field evolution . \n prominent among them is the change in the * chemical composition * due to a ) accretion and b ) spin - down . \n recently it has been shown that the impurity content of the accreted crust for near - eddington accretion rates could be extremely large ( schatz et al . \n this , along with a temperature inversion near or beyond the neutron drip ( brown 1999 ) might modify the transport properties significantly . moreover \n the presence of dislocations , defects , non - spherical nuclei have so far not been taken into account in the calculation of transport properties . \n these are also expected to have an impact on the field evolution in isolated as well as binary pulsars . \n + * multi - polar structure * - all of our and similar investigations have been based on an assumption of a pure dipolar model for the magnetic field . \n though calculations for isolated neutron stars does not show any appreciable change in multi - polar structures ( mitra , konar & bhattacharya 1999 ) - the situation would change in presence of accretion or a very strong magnetic field ( geppert et al . \n 1999 ) due to the importance of the hall term requiring further investigation . + \n * the magnetar question * - amongst some of the more recent developments the magnetars pose a great challenge for the existing theories of field evolution since they require a very rapid field evolution in isolated neutron stars . though some work have already been done in this area ( heyl & kulkarni 1998 , geppert et al . \n 1999 ) -

{"ContextTokens": 3380, "GeneratedTokens": 321, "SynthesizedBody": "emission from h@xmath0o masers has been found in a few galaxies , exhibiting apparent isotropic luminosities a million times higher than in typical stellar masers @xcite . \n the detection rate of these megamasers is very low , i.e.  about 5% among seyfert galaxies @xcite and almost zero among radio galaxies ( e.g. ,  ) . \n the maser is associated with dense and warm material , possibly a molecular torus or disk , around an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . \n the agn apparently produces the seed radio photons and the x - ray photons needed to pump the masing material @xcite .    with the help of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) megamasers \n can be used to investigate the small - scale structure of an agn in great detail . in the case of ngc  4258 \n this has helped to establish the presence of a thin , warped disk around the nucleus , to determine the black hole mass , and even to measure the precise distance to this galaxy @xcite . \n finding new megamaser galaxies is therefore of prime interest . \n the only clear trend that has emerged in recent years is that megamasers are exclusively found in type 2 agn , i.e.  those seyferts and liners which are expected to be obscured by a molecular torus according to the unified scheme @xcite . \n many have high absorbing column depths inferred from x - ray spectroscopy . \n there is also an indication of an excess of megamasers in highly inclined galaxies @xcite . \n here we report the discovery of a hitherto undetected and very luminous megamaser in the seyfert galaxy mrk  348 during a radio flare of the agn . \n mrk  348 ( ngc  262 , @xmath6 , luminosity distance @xmath7 mpc for @xmath8 converted into the galactic standard of rest and @xmath9 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , is a well - studied seyfert 2 galaxy with broad emission - lines in polarized light @xcite . \n the galaxy is classified as an s0 with a rather low inclination ( @xmath10 , see ) . \n ground - based @xcite and hubble space telescope imaging @xcite have revealed a dust lane crossing the nucleus and an excitation cone in emission - lines . \n ginga observations found hard x - ray emission and a high absorbing column depth of @xmath11 towards the nucleus @xcite . \n all this suggests the presence of an obscuring torus in mrk  348 . \n attempts to detect the obscuring material through radio spectroscopy have failed so far ( e.g.  h i , ) . \n what makes this galaxy stand out among seyfert galaxies is its bright and variable radio nucleus . \n found a compact radio core on vlbi scales with a flux density of several hundred milli - jansky and a flat to inverted spectrum . \n presented more recent vlbi observations for two epochs , showing a two - component structure expanding with sub - relativistic speeds . \n they also noted a flare of the radio continuum emission at 15 ghz with the flux rising from 120 mjy to 570 mjy between 1997.10 and 1998.75 . in the following we will present and discuss results of k - band radio spectroscopy of this galaxy . \n data were taken in march and april 2000 , using the effelsberg 100 m telescope of the mpifr equipped with a dual channel k - band hemt receiver . \n the system temperature was of order 70k on a @xmath12 temperature scale ; the beam size was 40@xmath13 . \n the data were recorded using an autocorrelator with 8 @xmath14 256 channels and bandwidths of 80mhz each . \n the eight backends were configured in two groups of four , sampling the two orthogonal linear polarizations . \n frequency shifts between the four backends representing a given linear polarization were adjusted in such a way that a total velocity range of 3000kms@xmath3 could be covered . \n the measurements were carried out in a dual beam switching mode ( switching frequency 1hz ) with a beam throw of 121@xmath13 in azimuth . only linear baselines were subtracted . \n calibration was obtained by measurements of w3oh ( 3.2jy according to ) . \n pointing could be checked on mrk  348 itself and was found to be stable to within 57@xmath13 . \n the galaxy was initially observed to look for ammonia ( nh@xmath5 ) and cyclopropenylidene ( c@xmath5h@xmath0 ) absorption against the bright radio nucleus . \n no absorption features were found . \n the transitions , rest frequencies , and upper limits of these observations are listed in table [ abslines ] .    .[abslines ] upper limits for absorption lines measured towards the nucleus of mrk  348 . \n ( 1 )  molecule and transition observed ; col . \n ( 2 )  rest frequency of transition in ghz ; col . ( 3 )  channel width in km s@xmath3 ; col . \n ( 4 )  upper limits ( 1@xmath15 ) for flux per channel in mjy . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the h@xmath0o ( @xmath16 ) transition is very close we also observed the redshifted 22.23508 ghz line and detected an emission feature on march 17 . \n we repeated the observations on five subsequent days and detected the line each time . \n the six spectra are shown in fig . \n [ h2ospec ] . \n we also produced a combined spectrum of all days ( fig . \n [ specall ] , top ) and fitted the h@xmath0o line with a gaussian profile . \n a one component fit yields a central velocity of @xmath17 km s@xmath3 for the line , which is redshifted by 133 km s@xmath3 from the systemic velocity . \n the peak flux is @xmath18 mjy with a full width at half maximum of @xmath19 km s@xmath3 . \n the integrated flux is 4.71@xmath20 jy km s@xmath3 , yielding an apparent isotropic luminosity of 420 @xmath21 . \n a two component fit yields a narrow line at @xmath22 km s@xmath3 with @xmath23 km s@xmath3 and @xmath24 mjy plus a broad line with @xmath25 km s@xmath3 , @xmath26 km s@xmath3 , and @xmath27 mjy . \n the latter fit indicates that the line is asymmetric and has a pronounced blue wing . \n if we compare our two best spectra from 17 march and 5 april we tentatively find some variability in the shape of this blue wing . \n we searched for additional high velocity features and did not detect anything down to a limit of 6 mjy ( 1@xmath15 , 4 km s@xmath3 ) in the range 3250 to 6200 km s@xmath3 and down to a limit of 10 - 15 mjy in the range @xmath28 to 10480 km s@xmath3 . \n the continuum flux density we find at 22 ghz is @xmath29 jy , corresponding to @xmath30 watt hz@xmath3 . \n we also reduced some archival data of earlier observations of mrk  348 taken between october 1997 and february 1998 and combined them into one data set ( fig . \n [ specall ] , bottom ) . in this spectrum \n the broad line is marginally detected with a flux density approximately three times lower than in the current observations . \n the smaller and variable baseline in these earlier observations made a reliable identification of this line impossible without _ a priori _ information . \n we have clearly discovered a new megamaser in mrk  348 . \n its luminosity is comparable to the emission from ngc  3079 which contains the second most luminous h@xmath0o maser after txs  2226 - 184 @xcite . \n the line width is among the broadest found for a megamaser , similar to the masers in txs  2226 - 184 and ngc  1052 . assuming the emission is associated with material close to the center this is the first spectroscopic evidence for molecular gas possibly obscuring the nucleus .    despite the bright radio continuum and the molecular maser line \n we have found no absorption lines from either nh@xmath5 or c@xmath5h@xmath0 . \n this is in line with the earlier non - detection of h i absorption @xcite . \n c@xmath5h@xmath0 is an organic ring molecule which is widespread in the galaxy and is associated with diffuse gas in the ism @xcite . \n it was also found in absorption against the nucleus of the radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite . from our non - detection \n we find a 1@xmath15 upper limit for the optical depth @xmath31 times the covering factor @xmath32 of @xmath33 . \n this is seven times smaller than the value found for centaurus a and might be related to the fact that we see mrk  348 almost face on .    on the other hand , with its type 2 agn , polarized broad emission - lines , and \n a nuclear dust lane seen , mrk  348 falls right into the roster of typical megamaser galaxies , where it is suggested that the masing material is part of the obscuring ` torus ' in the unified scheme of agn . \n the face - on orientation of mrk  348 then would suggest that the axis of this torus and the galaxy disk axis are severely misaligned .    in october 1997 \n february 1998 the flux density of the line was three times lower than it was in march 2000 . in the earlier survey by the maser line \n was not detected and given its line width and low flux density it would have resulted only in a broad feature at the @xmath34 level . \n linear interpolation with time of the continuum flux density given in suggests a continuum flux density for mrk  348 around 310 mjy in october 1997 at 15 ghz . \n the level we measure is roughly a factor of three higher  assuming a flat spectrum  and this increase in flux density is similar to the increase in flux density of the line . \n this could indicate a correlation between continuum and maser flux density , implying an unsaturated maser . with its current radio luminosity \n the galaxy is now the most radio luminous megamaser galaxy ever discovered . \n the response of the line to the continuum flare within about 2 years sets an upper limit to the distance of the masers from the nucleus of @xmath350.6 pc , which is of similar order as the size scale of the molecular disk found in ngc  4258 .    indeed , noted a certain excess of detected megamaser galaxies with large radio powers . \n mrk  348 certainly adds to this trend . \n the distribution of radio powers at 6 cm of the parent samples of agn selected by has a peak around @xmath36 watt / hz . if we add mrk  348 and more recently discovered megamasers @xcite and also complement the radio data in with more recent data from the nasa extragalactic database , we find that 12 out of 19 detected megamaser galaxies are at or above the peak in the distribution of radio power for galaxies without megamaser detections .    because of the possibly biased selection of the detected megamasers this is not highly significant . \n however , it highlights an apparently necessary prerequisite for megamaser emission , namely an agn with a compact radio core to provide seed photons . \n so far all detected megamasers have compact ( @xmath37 ) , mostly flat - spectrum , radio emission at a level of a few milli - jansky . in some cases , like mrk  348 @xcite , \n ngc  1052 @xcite , mrk  1210 @xcite , ngc  2639 @xcite , ngc  3079 @xcite , ngc  5793 @xcite , ngc  5506 @xcite , and possibly ngc  4945 @xcite the radio cores can even reach several tens to hundreds of milli - jansky \n .    while compact radio cores in seyfert and liner galaxies are not uncommon , only very few are so prominent as those in some of the radio - bright megamaser sources . \n we find that all megamasers mentioned above , i.e.  more than a third of known megamasers , have compact radio cores above a fiducial limit of 25 mjy at 5 ghz . on the other hand , in a survey of spiral galaxies find only 3 out of 54 galaxies ( 22 of which are seyfert galaxies ) with compact cores above 25 mjy at 5 ghz . \n similarly , in a survey of nearby agn find roughly 40% of seyfert and liner galaxies to contain compact flat - spectrum radio cores . \n however , only three out of 48 galaxies have flux densities @xmath3825 mjy . known megamasers therefore seem to prefer galaxies with relatively bright compact radio emission . \n mrk  348 currently has the brightest and most prominent radio core among megamaser galaxies . \n morphology , spectrum , and variability of the core are very similar to the radio core in iii  zw  2 which was the first seyfert galaxy discovered to contain a superluminal jet . \n this galaxy has a millimeter - peaked spectrum and a jet which shows a stop - and - go behavior indicative of a strong interaction with dense material on the sub - parsec scale @xcite . \n therefore speculate whether the bright inverted radio core in mrk  348 could be interpreted similarly to those in compact symmetric objects ( csos ) with a gigahertz - peaked - spectrum ( gps , see ) . in these galaxies \n bright hotspots are formed in a jet that terminates already on the parsec scale . in iii \n zw  2 and mrk  348 this seems to happen on even smaller scales , leading to higher peak frequencies and could be due to frustration of the jet by a molecular cloud or even a warped or misaligned torus .    since the masers in ngc  1052 , which have similar broad line widths as in mrk  348 , \n are found along the radio jet @xcite it should be checked whether in mrk  348 one has an analogous situation . \n one can speculate that in such a case the evolution of the radio flare and the evolution of the maser flare and its blue wing could be related , possibly providing a unique diagnostic tool to study jet - ism interactions .    in any case \n , with its bright radio core mrk  348 provides an ideal opportunity to observe the maser lines in this galaxy at high resolution with vlbi during this flare even though the lines still have a rather low flux . \n since radio and maser emission seem to be highly variable both should be monitored frequently . given that mrk  348 was not discovered in an earlier survey this finding also suggests that existing samples should be revisited to search for more flaring megamasers . \n we thank alan roy for helpful discussions . \n we are grateful to jim ulvestad for a prompt referee report and useful suggestions . \n this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by jpl , caltech , under contract with nasa .", "StartTimeOffset": 728280084846, "RequestID": "9223e3d6ea3318be642d0fb92b21b771c271be76", "TotalTokens": 3701}
{"ContextTokens": 2892, "GeneratedTokens": 197, "SynthesizedBody": "the be / x - ray systems represent the largest sub - class of massive x - ray binaries . \n a survey of the literature reveals that of the 115 identified massive x - ray binary pulsar systems ( identified here means exhibiting a coherent x - ray pulse period ) , most of the systems fall within this be counterpart class of binary . \n the orbit of the be star and the compact object , presumably a neutron star , is generally wide and eccentric . \n x - ray outbursts are normally associated with the passage of the neutron star close to the circumstellar disk ( okazaki & negueruela 2001 ) . a review of such systems may be found in coe et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n the source that is the subject of this paper , the x - ray transient gro j100857 , was discovered on july 14 1993 by the batse experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory ( stollberg et al . \n 1993 and wilson et al . \n the source was observed in the 20200 kev band , and was found to be pulsating at a period of 93.5s . \n its spectrum was observed to be consistent with optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with kt=25 kev . from these x - ray data \n it was concluded that the system was a massive binary system - a neutron star with either a be or supergiant primary . \n a full report of this discovery outburst was presented in shrader et al . \n ( 1999 ) . \n subsequently the optical counterpart was identified by coe et al , ( 1994 ) who showed it to be a v=15.3 ob star with a strong ir excess and strong balmer line emission . in this paper \n we present more than 10 years of optical monitoring of this counterpart , including a blue - end spectrum taken from the southern african large telescope ( salt ) , which enables refinement of the spectral class to much higher accuracy than previous published work . \n we also demonstrate how the optical characteristics correlate with the long - term x - ray ( rxte / asm data ) behaviour . \n this is supplemented by @xmath2-ray observations from integral , in particular , reporting the details of the june 2004 outburst from gro j100857 . \n h@xmath0 data have been collected over the last 13 years from a series of telescopes . the dates and properties of the h@xmath0 line \n are presented in table  [ tab : obs ] . in this table the following telescopes and configurations have been used :    * aat - 3.9 m telescope , aat ( australia ) , royal greenwhich observatory spectrograph ( rgos ) , 25 cm camera , 1200v grating and tek ( 1024x1024 ) ccd . \n the dispersion was 0.8 / pixel and the signal to noise ratio from the 600s exposure was @xmath340 . \n * saao - 1.9 m telescope , sutherland observatory ( south africa ) , spectrograph , site detector , 1200 l / mm grating . \n the dispersion was 1.0 / pixel and the signal to noise ratio @xmath310 . \n .table of h@xmath0 measurements . \n see text for details of observatory / instrument used . \n [ cols=\"^,^ , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : spectra ]    two spectral models were fit to the data , a power - law with a high energy cut - off and a thermal bremsstrahlung model . \n both models fit equally well and have a reduced chi - square of @xmath31 ; the details of the fit parameters are shown in table  [ tab : spectra ] . \n an attempt was made to introduce an absorption component to both , however the fit could not resonably constrain the parameter . \n consequently , an absorption component fixed to the anticipated galactic absorbing column density of @xmath31.5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 was added . \n the unfolded spectra with the high - energy cut - off power law model fitted is shown in figure  [ fig : intspec ] . \n the fluxes given by the spectral models were 5.7 @xmath4 10@xmath7 erg @xmath6 s@xmath8 in the 320 kev band and 4.1 @xmath4 10@xmath7 erg @xmath6 s@xmath8 in the 20100 kev band . \n taking these numbers combined with the source distance of 5kpc ( coe et al , 1994 ) produces a flux estimate of ( 12 ) @xmath4 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath8 . \n this value is in good agreement with the level of x - ray luminosity estimated from the small accretion - torque driven pulse period changes reported in section 4 . \n using the clear outburst profile presented in figure  [ fig : fold ] for the period 2001 - 2006 it is possible to determine an accurate ephemeris . \n we assume the binary period is 248.9d ( levine & corbet , 2006 ) and chose the highest bin in the figure to be defined as phase 0.0 . \n from this the following outburst ephemeris is determined :    @xmath10 = 50186@xmath14 + 248.9n    where the dates are in modified julian day format and n is the outburst number . \n if the time of outburst is compared to the predicted time of periastron determined from the pulse period variations ( see table 2 ) , it agrees within 1.5d for the mjd 49189 outburst , indicating no significant phase shift between these two events . \n if we use this rxte / asm ephemeris then we can determine that the phase of the two integral outbursts discussed here are 0.99 and 0.00 . \n furthermore , the phase of the peak of the 1993 batse outburst reported in shrader et al . \n ( 1999 ) is 0.01 . \n thus all three reported events fit very comfortably with the above ephemeris and hence are almost certainly type i outbursts . \n this is supported by comparing the phase of the peaks of outbursts as seen in the folded lightcurves from batse , rxte / asm and integral all of which seem to match very well . \n there is no evidence for the phase changes in outburst seen in exo 2030 + 375 and explained by wilson et al . \n ( 2002 ) as related to global one arm oscillations in the circumstellar disk . \n though there are changes in the disk , evidenced by the overall shape changes of the h@xmath0 profile seen in figure  [ fig : ha ] , they are obviously not great enough to result in such outburst phase shifting . \n figure  [ fig : ew2 ] shows the h@xmath0 equivalent width measurements over the last 13 years . although the h@xmath0 equivalent width is not a direct measurement of the size of the circumstellar disk the data in this figure can be used as an indicator of growth and decline in the disk . to this effect \n we interpret the significant decline in the h@xmath0 flux , followed by a strong recovery as a period of disc shrinking and regrowth . \n this idea is consistent with the lack of observed x - ray outbursts of gro  j1008@xmath1157 during 19962001 - see figure  [ fig : fold ] . \n another feature to take note of in figure  [ fig : ew2 ] is the maximum measured h@xmath0 equivalent width . \n reig , fabregat & coe ( 1997 ) show that this maximum h@xmath0 equivalent width is correlated with the orbital period in a be / x - ray binary and the observed correlation can be explained by a viscous circumstellar disk truncated by the resonant torque of the orbiting neutron star ( negueruela et al . , 2001 ) . \n the system under discussion here spends a large fraction of the observed timescale at an h@xmath0 equivalent width of close to @xmath12 , while undergoing type  i x - ray outbursts . \n this may suggest that the @xmath12  ew measurement describes the circumstellar disk at a size that puts it close to the @xmath13 point at periastron .    to estimate the size of the h@xmath0 emitting region of the circumstellar disk we make used of the peak separation measurements in table  1 and the relation from huang ( 1972 ) .    where @xmath14 is the disk radius , @xmath15 is the inclination and @xmath16 is the peak separation . \n the average of the three measurements taken while the system was in normal outburst was determined to be 236@xmath115 km / s and used in the following determination of the disk size .    from the blue spectrum \n we determine the spectral type of the optical counterpart of gro  j1008@xmath1157 to be b1 - b2 ve . from allen ( 1973 ) \n we estimate the mass and radius of such a star to be 15m@xmath17 and 7r@xmath17 respectively . \n then , using the measured values of @xmath18 and assuming that the be star disk is in the plane of the orbit we find an inclination angle of @xmath19 for the circumstellar disk of gro  j1008@xmath1157 . \n these stellar parameters give an estimated h@xmath0 disk size of 72r@xmath17 and a ratio of disk size to l@xmath20 point ( measured from the centre of the be star ) of r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.64    in comparison , if the data for 1997 are used with a @xmath23v of 350 km / s , then this results in a much smaller disk of the order of 33r@xmath17 in size . \n even the 72r@xmath17 is much smaller than the truncation radius predicted by the viscous disk theory for this be / x - ray binary by okazaki & negueruela ( 2001 ) . using slightly different stellar and orbital parameters \n those authors predict that the circumstellar disk of gro j1008 - 57 is most likely truncated at the 7:1 or 8:1 resonance radius . at such a radius \n the disk verges on the l@xmath20 point at periastron , thus explaining the frequently observed type i outbursts .    exploring the upper and lower limits of the disk size estimates presented in this work requires the identification of the major uncertainties affecting the results.the uncertainty in the spectral types introduces a range of possible masses for the be star of 10  18 m@xmath17 . using extreme upper limits for both the stellar mass and @xmath18 , with the lower limit on @xmath23v \n , we find that r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.86 . at the other end of the range we find r@xmath21/r@xmath22 @xmath3 0.51 \n however , it is worth bearing in mind that , contrary to the assumption in most disk models , the be star disk is probably not isothermal . \n thus the physical size of the disk is not constrained to the h@xmath0 emitted size of the disk . \n for example , in the case of the isolated be star @xmath24 per the h@xmath0 disk size has been measured by direct interferometry to be around ten stellar radii ( quirrenbach et al . , 1997 ) , whereas similar radio observations ( dougherty & taylor 1992 ) suggest that material may be present as far away as hundreds and even thousands of stellar radii . \n so , in the case of gro j100857 the totality of the disk may extend beyond the radius measured here from the h@xmath0 data . \n this is indirectly confirmed by the very fact that we see regular x - ray outbursts , suggesting the disk material must , indeed , reach the l@xmath20 point . \n the study of pulse period changes in gro j100857 from the batse data have allowed a precise orbital determination . \n the orbital period found agrees , within errors , with that determined by levine & corbet ( 2006 ) from x - ray outburst cycles . \n these outbursts seem to be very reliable in nature , showing no variation with x - ray energy , nor are they correlated with the changes in the h@xmath0 profile , as was seen in the case of exo 2030 + 375 ( wilson et al , 2002 ) \n . however , the substantial changes in the h@xmath0 ew correlate nicely with the existence and changing levels of the x - ray outburst sizes . \n in addition , using the peak separation measured from the h@xmath0 profiles an indication was provided of the disk size which is in general agreement with the detailed models of okazaki & negueruela ( 2001 ) . \n the results are a direct confirmation of the value of multiwavelength observations of these complex systems . \n this paper uses observations made from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , and x - ray data provided by the asm / rxte team . \n vam acknowledges support from the south african nrf and the british council in the form of a salt / stobie studentship .", "StartTimeOffset": 734591685354, "RequestID": "83cc60f62c4127cc3bd9c2ae74f187254f4fb2a3", "TotalTokens": 3089}

band spectra of the complex nebula lmc \n smp  83 , which they attribute to episodic bipolar ejections from a non - degenerate secondary in a close orbit with a white dwarf . \n we have initiated a study of photometric variability in large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) pne in order to make use of a very large , complete sample to set limits on the fraction of pn central stars that have companions of some sort , and to explore the frequency of other patterns of variability . \n we have used data from the extensive supermacho photometric survey at ctio of the lmc which was obtained over a  4.2 year period from 2002 through the end of 2005 ( see * ? ? ? \n one object , rpj  053059683542 ( hereafter referred to by its common catalog name , rp916 ) , was found to have spatially resolved variability , which is a highly unusual phenomenon that to date has only one other rough analog : the variability in the galactic pn m29 . \n rp916 was discovered by @xcite in the anglo - australian observatory ( aao)/ukst deep h@xmath0 survey of the lmc , who classified it as a `` true '' planetary nebula based on its morphology and spectral characteristics . \n it is one of the largest pne known in the lmc , and has a bipolar morphology . \n aside from the near uniqueness of the phenomenon , this type of variability is highly suggestive of an interaction of the pn central star with an otherwise undetectable binary companion . \n we describe in  2 the extant observations for rp916 , including the photometric campaign , optical spectroscopy , and broad - band ir photometry from the 2mass catalog and from the sage survey with the _ spitzer space telescope_. we analyze the characteristics of the variability in  3 , and suggest interpretations that are most consistent with the observations in  4 . \n even before @xcite reported the initial discovery , a good deal of ground- and space - based data had accumulated on rp  916 , including broad - band optical and infrared images , and optical spectra . \n interestingly , the bulk of the observations were obtained during the course of surveys of the lmc that were designed with purposes other than pn research in mind . \n the primary optical images that were used for this study were obtained as a part of the supermacho survey of a 23 deg@xmath1 region centered on the bar of the lmc ( see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for details of the observing campaign ) . \n eighty - two images in the vicinity of rp916 were obtained with the mosaic - ii ccd camera on the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory between 2002 january and 2005 december . \n most images were taken with a broad @xmath2 filter with a passband that covers 510740  nm and includes the strong nebular emission lines such as h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath3 , but avoids [ ] @xmath4 . \n this wide bandpass enabled the detection of faint objects ( @xmath5 ) within the typical 150  s exposures of the survey . \n the ccd plate scale is 027 pixel@xmath6 , which samples the psf very well : the delivered image quality varied from roughly 08 to 20 over the course of the observing campaigns . \n an atmospheric dispersion corrector was used to minimize the differential atmospheric dispersion through the broad filter at the typical airmass of 1.3 to 1.4 . \n the supermacho data were processed with an automatic pipeline @xcite that corrects for electronic cross - talk between the amplifiers , removes the bias level , and applies a flat - field . \n the images were re - projected to a common geometry , with an rms accuracy of @xmath7  mas . \n the psfs are then matched , the images are corrected for sky background , and placed on a common photometric scale prior to template subtraction . the template image ( see  3 ) is shown in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : images ] , and was selected based on the good image quality ( @xmath8 ) and the excellent photometric quality of the night on which this image was obtained . \n the discovery images used by @xcite were obtained as part of an aao / ukst deep photographic survey in h@xmath0 and in @xmath9band continuum , and were obtained between 1998 and 2000 . \n the 70    bandwidth of the h@xmath0 filter also includes the [ ] emission lines at @xmath3 . \n the photometric depth of the stacked images is @xmath10 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 for h@xmath0 . \n the digitized images were sampled at 067 pixel@xmath6 , and the image resolution is roughly 35 . as described by @xcite , the stacked h@xmath0 and @xmath9band images were each assigned a specific color in the final . \n the discovery image of rp916 is shown in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : images ] . \n fortuitously , additional images were obtained by one of us ( a.r . ) with _ hubble space telescope _ using the wfpc2 camera . \n these images were obtained to study a microlensing target , but happened to include rp916 at the edge of the field of view . in all , four images were obtained on 2007 may 17 : u9px0601 m and u9px0602 m with the f555w filter , and u9px0603 m and u9px0604 m with the f814w filter . \n the exposure times were all 500  s. we combined the calibrated images for each filter to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and to remove cosmic - rays . the f814w image is shown in figure  [ fig : hst ] . \n @xcite obtained two confirmatory spectra of rp916 on 2004 december 14 with the 2df fiber spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope : one with a dispersion of 4.3    pixel@xmath6 and the other with a dispersion of 1.1    pixel@xmath6 . \n the higher - dispersion spectrum was used to resolve close emission line blends and to determine the radial velocity . \n since the angular size of the nebula exceeds the areal coverage of the fiber , the spectra actually correspond to the western lobe of rp916 . \n the spectra show moderately low excitation , with f ( [ ] @xmath4)/f(h@xmath13 ) @xmath14 , relatively strong [ ] @xmath15 and [ ] @xmath16 , weak [ ] @xmath17 , no detectable emission , and moderate [ ] with f(@xmath18+@xmath19)/f(h@xmath0 ) @xmath20 . \n rp916 is a moderately strong infrared source ( for a pn in the lmc ) , based on the 2mass @xmath21 magnitudes @xcite that were obtained on 2000 february 20 ( mjd 51,602 ) . \n it was also detected in the mid - ir sage survey with _ \n spitzer space telescope _ @xcite in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 bands with irac , and the @xmath25 band with mips ( the @xmath26 and @xmath27 band catalog data have yet to be published ) . \n the first epoch sage observations were obtained during 2005 july 1526 , around mjd 53,570 . \n the ir brightnesses are given in table  [ tab : irphot ] . \n all of the optical images show that rp916 has a `` butterfly '' bipolar morphology @xcite , with a dark lane ( 046 , or 0.11 pc , in width ) bisecting the pinched main lobes of emission . \n the extent of the nebula is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 pc at the distance of the lmc ) as measured from a contour at 10% of the peak nebular brightness in the f814w image ; the extent is roughly twice as large when measured just above the sky level , with a substantial extension of faint nebular material to the ene of the geometric center of the nebula . \n the h@xmath30 color image shows that the emission is almost entirely nebular : what little continuum is evident in the @xmath9band image undoubtedly originates from a combination of nebular continuum , emission lines in the @xmath11 bandpass , and the few very faint field stars that are seen in the _ hst _ image . \n interestingly , a faint star is evident in the f814w image , within the waist of rp916 , offset by @xmath31 from the symmetry axis defined by the optical emission . \n the star is barely visible in the f555w image however , indicating that it is intrinsically very red , or suffers heavy extinction from dust within the waist of the nebula . \n it is not clear whether this is the central star of the nebula . \n the more detailed _ hst _ images show clumps of emission , with the brightest knots or lobes extending almost symmetrically to the east and west but do not intersect at the geometric center of the nebula . \n the appearance of rp916 in the 2mass images that of an extended point source , with no sign of bi - lobed structure ; the object is not resolved in the _ spitzer _ irac or mips images . although the confirmatory spectra of @xcite are neither deep nor well enough calibrated to support a detailed abundance analysis , @xcite derived an approximate density for rp916 of @xmath32  @xmath33 from the [ ]  @xmath34 line ratio . \n the amount of extinction , while only roughly determined , appears to be higher than average ( @xmath35 ) for an lmc pn ; given the strong ir emission , some of the extinction may be intrinsic to the nebula . \n finally , the modest ratio of f([])/f(h@xmath0 ) suggests that n is not highly enriched . \n the various , general properties of rp916 are summarized in table  [ tab : properties ] . \n the original point of our work was to search for variability in planetary nebulae . \n this search was enabled by using the automated pipeline developed for the supermacho project , which makes use of a very powerful difference image technique ( see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) . in brief , \n all of the images are resampled to the same geometry and sky subtracted , and the images are placed on the same photometric scale . \n the psf of the template image is then matched to each target image via convolution , and subtracted . \n the result of this subtraction on four selected nights is shown in figure  [ fig : diff_img ] , where the difference has the value 0.0 everywhere ( apart from shot noise ) except for features that are either fainter or brighter than those in the template image . \n photometry is then performed at the positions of the lobes on the difference image for each observation . \n this technique has been shown to yield accurate photometry even in crowded fields such as the lmc , and is extremely robust against non - photometric conditions . \n light curves were determined for the eastern and western lobes of rp916 , which are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] . \n note that both lobes increased in brightness compared to the template image , but some time after the second year of the observing campaign the eastern lobe began to fade while the western lobe continued to brighten . by mjd \n @xmath36 july the western lobe began to fade , but more slowly than the eastern lobe . \n close inspection of figure  [ fig : diff_img ] suggests that the orientation of the brightness enhancement in the western lobe changed and became elongated by mjd @xmath37 dec . the western lobe brightened by nearly 40% during the course of the observing campaign . \n rp916 is unusual in many respects , including its large physical size , strong ir emission , and optical variability . \n but the morphology and moderate ionization spectrum leave little doubt that it is a genuine planetary nebula , and the measured radial velocity establishes its location in the lmc . if the central star of rp916 has a binary companion that is very red and luminous it could contribute to the near - ir continuum luminosity , but it can not account for the extreme colors in the mid - ir . \n note , however , that since the epochs of the 2mass and sage observations differ by 5.4 years it is possible that the ratio of the near- to far - ir luminosity could have changed somewhat during that time . \n we conclude that rp916 contains a large amount of dust ( which might be expected given the pinched waist and the dark band that bisects the nebula ) . \n if rp916 is similar to other lmc pne with significant dust , both molecular emission features and thermal continuum radiation contribute substantially to the total ir flux , particularly in the mid - ir ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the nebular variability is the most unusual feature of this object , and it is difficult to think of a cause that does not involve a binary star as the central engine . indeed , the lack of an extreme n enrichment , which is typical of bipolar pne in the lmc @xcite is consistent with common - envelope evolution , where the expected conversion of c to n via hot - bottom burning is suppressed . \n it may be that the variation resulted from an outburst from a red companion . in this case \n a change in optical luminosity might be manifested in the nebula as a light echo seen in scattered light from dust within the nebula . \n ( note that the phase lag of @xmath38  d between the peak emission of the two lobes in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] would imply a significant inclination out of the plane of the sky . \n ) however , no mira - like periodicity is detected over the 1450  d observing campaign . \n it seems unlikely that the variation is from a global change in ionizing photons , as the inferred h recombination timescale is @xmath39  yr if the derived density is representative of the whole nebula . in any case \n , a light echo can not explain the radial structures that are evident in the detailed _ hst _ images . \n the variability might on the other hand result from a precessing jet of material from the central source that interacts with ( i.e. , shocks ) the surrounding nebula . \n other pne that show a similar photometric variability , resulting from a symbiotic companion , are the galactic bipolar pn he2104 @xcite , and lmc - smp  83 @xcite . \n @xcite interpreted the variability within m29 as an interaction of a jet from the central source interacting with the surrounding pn , which has over time continued to shape the nebular morphology . while this mechanism is an interesting possibility for rp916 , confirmation would require long - slit spectroscopy to measure the velocity field , high - resolution ( @xmath40 or better ) imaging in h@xmath0 to reveal the time - dependent morphology of the variability , imaging polarimetry to measure the extent of any scattered light by dust , and infrared spectra to understand the nature of the ir luminosity and ( possibly ) detect a red , luminous companion star . \n the frequency of nebular variability generally among pne is not known , but rp916 may be the most extreme example of how pne morphology can be re - shaped even at very advanced stages of evolution . \n photometric monitoring at high spatial resolution of a sizable sample of bipolar pne in the lmc is crucial for determining what fraction of pne experience the unusual variability of rp916 . \n perhaps the observing campaigns of the next generation of survey telescopes such as that for lsst , which will have the necessary depth , sky coverage , and cadence , can help to resolve this broader question . \n support for this work was provided by noao , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nsf cooperative agreement nas526555 . \n the supermacho survey was conducted under the auspices of the noao survey program . \n thanks the goldberg fellowship program for its support . \n supermacho is supported by stsci grants go10583 and \n go10903 . we thank the referee ( k. volk ) for his extremely helpful comments . \n @xmath41 m & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + @xmath46 m & & & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + @xmath49 m & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath54 m & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & & + @xmath57 m & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & & +      r.a . \n ( j2000 ) & @xmath60 @xmath61 59481 & 1 + dec ( j2000 ) & @xmath62 35  4129 & 1 + morphology & `` butterfly '' bipolar & 1 , 2 + angular size & @xmath28 & 1 + physical size & @xmath29 pc & 1 + density & 400 @xmath33 & 3 + v@xmath63 & 280 km  s@xmath6 & 2 + @xmath64 & 0.9 & 3 +", "StartTimeOffset": 739925263872, "RequestID": "f4836cdc763fde6dc9161f1057982a2e20f65c71", "TotalTokens": 4279}

continuous coverage of the spectral shape of extragalactic vhe emitters over more than 4 decades of energy . \n the large majority of extragalactic tev emitting objects are blazars , radio - loud active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet closely oriented toward the earth , as described in @xcite . here \n , we discuss a method , recently published in @xcite , to derive an upper limit on the redshift of a blazar , based on the comparison between the spectral index at gev energies as measured by lat ( unaffected by the cosmological absorption up to redshifts far beyond those of interest here ) and the tev spectrum corrected for the absorption . \n starting from the derived limits , we find a simple law relating these values to real redshift , which can be used to guess the distance of unknown redshift blazars . \n we assume a cosmological scenario with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \n the photon flux emitted by a blazar in both gev and tev regimes can be well approximated by power laws , of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the power - law index . at vhe , \n the photons of the spectrum interact with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , via electron - positron pair creation . \n quantitatively , the effect is an exponential attenuation of the flux by a factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical depth , a function of both photon energy and source redshift . \n thus , the observed differential energy spectrum from a blazar , @xmath12 , is related to the emitted one , @xmath13 , according to @xmath14 .    in order to estimate a safe upper limit to the source distance \n , we can reasonably assume that the intrinsic spectrum at tev energies can not be harder than that in the adjacent gev band . \n indeed , from the brightest objects studied at both gev and tev energies it appears that the sed is continuous , with a broad peak not requiring additional spectral components @xcite . \n hence , a natural assumption is to require that the slope measured in the gev energy range is a limit value for the power - law index of the de - absorbed tev spectrum .    for the study \n , we consider the blazar sample listed in table  [ table_values ] and containing all the extragalactic tev emitters located at redshift larger than @xmath15 , detected by lat after taking 5.5 months of data @xcite . in order to estimate the redshift @xmath0 for which the tev spectral slope equals to the gev one \n , the measured spectral points of each source have been corrected for the corresponding absorption factor @xcite , starting from redshift @xmath15 , and the resulting spectrum fitted with a power law . \n the procedure , applied in fine steps of redshift , is iterated until the slope of the de -

{"ContextTokens": 3224, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "the kinematics of the large amplitude , oxygen - rich agb variables known as o - miras have long been known to give valuable clues to the ages and evolution of agb stars as well as being important for galactic structure studies ( e.g. feast 1963 ; feast & whitelock 2000 ) . \n until recently the galactic carbon - rich miras ( c - miras ) have been much less intensively studied . \n the present paper summarizes the results of a kinematic and photometric study of galactic c - miras leading to a determination of their absolute magnitudes and ages . \n it then goes on to discuss what c- and o - miras tell us about galactic structure and composition . \n the paper is based on three recently published papers ( whitelock et al . \n 2006 ; menzies , feast , & whitelock 2006 ; feast , whitelock , & menzies 2006 ) . \n it has been known for a long time that an optically selected sample of c - miras in the lmc shows a well defined @xmath0 - logp relation ( feast et al . \n it is now possible to extend this relation to longer periods using data for obscured c - miras ( whitelock et al . \n the relation which extends from about 160 to 1000 days has the form @xmath3 where the distance modulus of the lmc has been taken to be 18.50mag . \n the scatter about this relation is only 0.17mag . \n one aim of the present work was to derive the zero - point of this relation for galactic c - miras . \n multi - epoch jhkl observations were obtained of 239 c - rich variables allowing classification and period determination . \n mean bolometric magnitudes were obtained by combining these data with iras or msx observations ( details in whitelock et al . \n 2006 ) . combining these results with data in the literature and \n some new optical radial velocities we have available for analysis 177 c - miras with known bolometric magnitudes and radial velocities from optical or millimetre ( co ) observations ( details in menzies et al . \n 2006 ) . assuming a pl relation of the form given in eq . 1 \n , we found clear evidence of differential galactic rotation . \n the zero - point of this relation was then adjusted until , using a standard formulation of differential rotation , we recovered the oort constant @xmath4 derived from cepheid proper motions ( feast & whitelock 1997 ) . in this way we obtained a galactic zero - point of @xmath5 , not significantly different from that for lmc c - miras ( eq.1 ) . in the kinematic analysis \n , we used only stars within @xmath6 of the solar distance from the galactic centre . \n the data are not sufficient to allow us to derive an independent pl slope . \n cccccc group & period & @xmath7 & age & mass & n + & [ days ] & [ @xmath8 & [ gyr ] & @xmath9 & + all & 521 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & 149 + 1 & 373 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & 49 + 2 & 521 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & 50 + 3 & 655 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & 50 +    the residual velocities from differential rotation were then used to derive velocity dispersions . \n table 1 shows @xmath7 , the velocity dispersion radial from the galactic centre , for the whole sample and the sample divided by period , as well as the numbers ( n ) of stars involved . \n the ages and initial masses were derived using the relation between the kinematics and age of local dwarfs ( nordstrm et al . \n 2004 ) based on padova models ( girardi et al . \n there is some evidence of a trend of age with period , the longer period stars being younger . \n this is qualitatively similar to the trend of age with period shown by o - miras ( e.g. feast & whitelock 2000 ) . \n the results for the c - miras contrast with the younger ages and higher initial masses sometimes suggested for the bulk of c - miras . \n in recent years there has been a considerable amount of work based on the hypothesis that the relative frequency of carbon to oxygen rich ( m - type ) cool stars is a simple measure of the overall metallicity ( normally characterized by [ fe / h ] ) of the stellar system or part of the system in which they are found . \n the results of the last section allow one to test this in the limited case of the c- and o - miras and to extend the discussion to cool stars generally . \n ccc period & @xmath7 & n + @xmath22 $ ] & [ @xmath8 & + 175 & @xmath23 & 17 + 228 & @xmath24 & 24 + 272 & @xmath25 & 26 + 324 & @xmath26 & 40 + 383 & @xmath27 & 32 + 453 & @xmath28 & 15 +    table 2 shows the velocity dispersion radial from the galactic centre for local o - miras as a function of period . the data are derived from feast & whitelock ( 2000 ) and show the dependence of @xmath7 ( and hence age ) on period for these stars . \n a comparison of tables 1 and 2 shows that there appears to be no significant populations of c - miras with @xmath7 in the range 40 to @xmath29 whilst there are strong o - mira populations in this range . \n since age increases with @xmath7 , this implies that there are o - miras in an ( old ) age range where there is not a significant c - mira population . \n thus the ratio of c- to o - miras will depend on the age distribution of any population considered and not simply on [ fe / h ] . \n this result may be seen in a somewhat different way for miras in the solar neighbourhood . for an optically selected sample wood & cahn ( 1977 ) found that the ratio of the number of o - miras to c - miras was about 14 . however , in a local sample of dust enshrouded miras which is biased to longer period ( and hence younger ) stars this ratio is about unity ( olivier , whitelock , & marang 2001 ) . \n it is useful to consider in this connection the stellar population of the galactic bulge . \n with one possible exception , this contains no c - miras or any normal carbon stars . \n however , it does contain o - miras with a wide range of periods . \n these range up to 700 days in the sgri window ( glass et al . \n 1995 ) and to even longer periods near the centre ( wood , habing , & mcgregor 1998 ) . \n it has long been known that this implies a considerable age range in the bulge . \n the age range implied overlaps with that expected for c - miras ( table 1 ) . \n this suggests that the absence of c - miras from the bulge is not simply an age effect .    in fact , in the past it was usually assumed that the absence of carbon stars in general from the bulge was due to a high metal abundance . \n it is , however , now known that bulge k giants have a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath30 and m giants @xmath31 ( fullbright , mcwilliam , & rich 2005 ; rich & origlia 2005 ) . \n these values are close to the mean value for the local thin disc , [ fe / h ] = @xmath32 ( nordstrm et al . \n thus neither age nor metallicity can apparently explain the absence of carbon stars from the bulge . \n however , it has been know for some while ( glass et al . \n 1995 ) that the jhk colours of o - miras in the bulge differed from those in the lmc and this could be explained by a high oxygen abundance ( feast 1996 ) . \n recent work ( rich & origlia 2005 ) now shows that in bulge m giants oxygen is overabundant with respect to comparable local stars ( @xmath33 \\sim + 0.3 $ ] ) whilst several workers find @xmath34 \\leq 0 $ ] in relevant lmc populations . \n this suggests that oxygen abundance may be a controlling factor in the ratio of carbon to oxygen giants in stellar systems . \n the above does not rule out the possible dependence of the relative frequency of carbon stars on [ fe / h ] at a given [ o / fe ] . \n if that were the case we would expect that in a system with a spread in [ fe / h ] the carbon stars would evolve preferentially from the lower metallicity stars ( [ o / fe ] assumed constant ) . \n however , in the galactic disc the available work on carbon stars ( e.g. abia et al . \n 2001 ) suggests that their [ fe / h ] is near that of the mean of local disc stars and not skewed to lower abundances . but \n further work on this is desirable . \n two alternative interpretations of the kinematics of local disc stars are currently under discussion . \n nordstrm et al . \n ( 2004 ) found that the velocity dispersion of these stars increases steadily with age from 1 to 10 gyr ( see their fig 31 where their @xmath35 corresponds to the @xmath7 used in the present paper ) . on the other hand quillen & garnett(2000 , 2001 ) ( see also freeman & bland - hawthorn fig 5 where their @xmath36 corresponds to the @xmath7 of the present paper ) suggest that the velocity dispersion remains constant from 2 to 10 gyr at about @xmath37 and then jumps suddenly to about @xmath38 , the two regimes constituting the thin and thick discs . \n this latter interpretation apparently leaves no room for galactic components with @xmath7 in the range 35 to @xmath39 where , as table 2 shows there is a significant o - mira population . since o - miras are rare objects we expect them to be tracers of a large main sequence population . \n such a population is accounted for naturally in the nordstrm et al . \n interpretation of galactic kinematics . \n it is , however , difficult to see how it could be accommodated in the quillen and garnett model . \n \\1 . assuming the @xmath0 - period relation for galactic c - miras has the same slope as for those in the lmc , the zero - points in the two systems are the same within the uncertainties + 2 . \n galactic c - miras have ages of @xmath40 gyr and initial masses of @xmath2 . \n there is some evidence that the ages of c - miras decrease with increasing period . \n the ratio of c- to o - miras in a population depends on the age distribution of that population . \n the lack of carbon stars in the galactic bulge is connected to an oxygen overabundance . \n the galactic o - miras favour the interpretation of galactic kinematics of nordstrm et al . \n this paper is based on three papers mentioned in the text and i am grateful to my colleagues , patricia whitelock , john menzies , freddy marang and m.a.t . \n groenewegen for their contributions to this work . \n in particular , i am especially indebted to patricia whitelock and john menzies with whom the data were analysed and the conclusions formulated . \n abia , c. et al . \n 2001 , apj , 559 , 1117 feast , m. w. 1963 , mnras , 125 , 367 feast , m. w. 1996 , mnras , 278 , 11 feast , m. w. , glass , i. s. , whitelock , p. a. , & catchpole , r. m. 1989 , mnras , 241 , 375 feast , m. w. , & whitelock , p. a. 1997 , mnras , 291 , 683 feast , m. w. , & whitelock , p.a . \n 2000 , mnras , 317 , 460 feast , m. w. , whitelock , p. a. , & menzies , j. w. 2006 , mnras , 369 , 791 freeman , k. , & bland -

cmd ] ] \n stellar associations contain the richest sample of young bright stars in a galaxy . \n consequently our knowledge on the young massive stars of the mcs has been collected from photometric and spectroscopic studies of young stellar associations @xcite . \n however , the picture of these stellar systems changed when _ \n hubble _ observations revealed that mcs associations are not mere aggregates of young bright stars alone , but they also host large numbers of faint pms stars @xcite , @xcite . although nearby galactic ob associations are known to be significant hosts of such stars @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pms studies in the mcs with _ \n hubble _ were focused only on the surrounding field of the supernova 1987a @xcite , cluster ngc  1850 @xcite , and the star - burst of 30 doradus @xcite , all in the lmc . \n however , these studies are limited by crowding , even at the angular resolution facilitated by _ hubble_.    to learn more about low - mass pms stars in the mcs , one has to study less crowded regions like young stellar associations . \n indeed , an investigation on the main - sequence imf of the lmc association lh  52 with hst / wfpc2 observations by @xcite revealed @xmath1 500 low - mass candidate pms stars easily distinguishable in the @xmath6 , @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) @xcite . \n more recently , deeper observations with the wide - field channel ( wfc ) of acs of another lmc association ( the star - forming region lh  95/n  64 ) revealed the coexistence of pms stars and early - type stars in such stellar systems ( figure [ fig - ima ] ) . \n these one - of - a - kind observations dramatically changed the picture we had for stellar associations in the mcs by revealing a unique rich sample of pms stars in lh  95/n  64 ( figure [ fig - cmd ] ) . \n the spatial distribution of these low - mass members demonstrates the existence of significant substructure ( `` subgroups '' ) , as in the case of galactic ob associations . \n this stellar sub - clustering has its origins possibly in short - lived parental molecular clouds within a giant molecular cloud complex . \n each of these `` _ pms clusters _ '' in lh  95/n  64 includes a few early - type stars . \n such stars have been identified as candidate herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars due to their strong h  emission . \n near - ir spectroscopic study with vlt / sinfoni ( eso program 078.d-0200 ) will clarify their nature . \n , @xmath7 being the standard deviation of the background surface density . \n this map demonstrates the existence of statistically significant concentrations of pms stars outside the main body of the association ngc  346 ( located at the center ) . \n such pms clusters are suspected to be the product of sequential star formation triggered by the action of the ob stars in ngc  346 , which shape the southern part , and a supernova , which affects the northern part of the region @xcite . \n [ fig - cmap ] ]      a spatial behavior similar to the pms population of lh  95/n  64 is seen in pms stars of the association ngc  346 in the smc @xcite , from observations with acs / wfc . \n ngc  346 is located in the brightest h  ii region of the smc , n  66 , and acs uncovered the richness of this region in pms stars @xcite , @xcite . \n the surface density map of the region of ngc  346/n  66 constructed from star counts of the pms stars in the observed field is shown in figure [ fig - cmap ] . \n apart from the association itself ( seen as the central large concentration ) there are at least five distinct concentrations of pms stars with surface stellar density  -2.truept  3@xmath7 above the background ( where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of the background density ) , which fit the description of `` pms clusters '' . \n the size of each cluster is defined by the isopleth corresponding to the local mean density around it , and the time - scale within which each pms cluster was presumably formed is defined by their individual cmds . \n although the loci of the pms stars in the cmd exhibit a broadening , which prevents an accurate estimation of their age , it was found that the pms clusters located away from ngc  346 to the north , represent the most recent star formation activity in the region @xcite .    , @xmath3 cmd of all stars detected with acs / wfc imaging in the area of ngc  346 ( 06 around its center ) . pms isochrone models by for ages 0.5 to 15  myr are overplotted to demonstrate that the observed broadening of the pms stars can be easily misinterpreted as an age - spread . \n simulations showed that this spread can be explained as the result of interstellar reddening of @xmath8  mag alone , or of two star formation events ( a true age - spread ) @xmath15  myr apart if the reddening is lower . \n typical photometric uncertainties in brightness and color are also shown @xcite . \n [ fig - pms ] ]      the loci of pms stars in the cmd often show a widening , which could be evidence for an age - spread @xcite . \n the low - mass population in subgroups within ob associations of the mw exhibits little evidence for significant age - spreads on time - scales  -2.truept  10  myr @xcite . \n although this time - scale is in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and cloud dissipation , age differences of the order of 10  myr may be very important for understanding of how sequential star formation proceeds . \n moreover , there are several factors apart from age -

pms ] ) . \n simulations showed that apart from photometric uncertainties , binarity and variability , reddening seems to play the most important role in the observed widening of the pms stars , providing false evidence for an age - spread if the region suffers from high extinction @xcite . \n young stellar systems , which host newborn pms stars , naturally provide the testbed for a comprehensive study of the stellar imf . \n a coherent sample of pms stars is found with _ hubble _ from acs imaging in the vicinity of another smc association , ngc  602 , located in the h  ii region n  90 @xcite . \n the region of ngc  602/n  90 includes no distinct subgroups , and therefore , being less complicated than ngc  346/n  66 , is more suitable for the investigation of the low - mass imf . for the construction , \n though , of this imf a mass - luminosity relation derived from evolutionary models can not be used due to the spread of the pms stars , also apparent in the cmd of ngc  602 . \n instead , counting the pms stars between evolutionary tracks , which represent specific mass ranges , seems to be the most accurate method for the construction of their mass spectrum ( figure [ fig - imf ] ) .    ] \n the coexistence of h  ii regions and pms stars in stellar associations of the mcs indicate that star formation may be still active in their vicinity . \n indeed , observations with the _ spitzer _ space telescope revealed objects classified as candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) in such regions @xcite , @xcite , and _ hubble _ \n s contribution has been very important in disentangling their nature @xcite . \n the region of ngc  602/n  90 is also found with _ \n spitzer _ to host possible ysos , and the comparison of the loci of these ir - bright sources with the _ hubble _ images interestingly showed pms stars to be their optical counterparts @xcite . \n a variety of objects is discovered to coincide with these candidate ysos , such as single highly embedded sources , small compact pms clusters , as well as features similar to `` elephant trunks '' , all located at the periphery of ngc  602 , along the dust ridges of the molecular cloud presumably blown -

{"ContextTokens": 2923, "GeneratedTokens": 210, "SynthesizedBody": "classically if a particle is located in one of the wells of a dswp and does not have sufficient energy to surmount the barrier in the potential , it will be forever confined to that well . \n quantum mechanics shows that due to the wave - like nature of the particle , after a certain length of time , there is a non - zero probability that it will be located in the other well . \n it is therefore quantum mechanically possible for a particle to pass through a barrier that it can not classically overcome . \n this phenomenon is known as quantum tunneling effect . \n the quantum tunneling results in the splitting of the low - lying energy levels which occur in pairs with slightly different energy values . \n the transition frequency between the energy levels of each pair is associated with the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation . particularly in the ammonia molecule \n this transition frequency for the ground - state has been measured at about @xmath4 @xcite . \n this phenomenon , namely the inversion spectrum of the ammonia molecule , has been observed through infrared spectroscopy and plays a fundamental role in the principle of operation of the ammonia maser@xcite . \n although inversion effect occurs in other molecules as well ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) @xcite , @xmath0 provides a tractable vibrational system for experimental observation and exploitation , since inversion frequency falls in the microwave region .    until recently , \n oscillation of probability density in position space @xmath5 between the wells has been the usual way to approach the quantum tunneling phenomenon and consequently the inversion spectrum . \n heisenberg uncertainty relation reflects this phenomenon , but information entropy offers a more sensitive approach , to study a particle moving in a non - classical way through the barrier . \n information - theoretic tools , initially applied to communication systems , have been employed extensively to investigate various classical and quantum systems e.g. in physics @xcite , chemistry @xcite , biology @xcite and many other scientific branches as well . \n specifically , the well - known information measures defined by shannon @xcite and fisher @xcite , have been applied with considerable success in quantum systems e.g. atoms @xcite . \n shannon information entropy has been correlated fairly well with experimental data for atomic ionization potentials and dipole polarizabilities @xcite . \n a comprehensive account of applications to molecules can be found in @xcite and @xcite . \n another example is an information - theoretic treatment of a molecule ( @xmath6-system ) described in @xcite .    to begin with , one needs a probabilistic treatment of a system , which in fact is especially suitable and relevant for quantum systems , and then use the corresponding probability densities , @xmath7 in position space and @xmath8 in momentum space as input to the definitions of shannon information entropy and fisher information . \n thus , one proceeds to the calculation of the information content of the system and investigate its related properties . \n an additional merit of the probabilistic treatment is that one can calculate quantitatively , in a systematic manner , a measure of complexity of the quantum system , the so - called lmc statistical complexity @xcite . \n the lmc complexity of the @xmath9 ion was studied using a simple wavefunction of coulson type , leading to a promising relation of complexity with chemical bonding @xcite . \n atomic complexity has been calculated for the first time in the literature in @xcite , where another definition of complexity was employed , namely the sdl measure @xcite . \n last but not least , calculations of molecular information entropies were carried out in @xcite .    in the present paper \n we apply the above methods in order to study the ammonia molecule as a test bed , and in particular to assess the effect of tunneling on the shannon information entropy , the fisher information and the lmc complexity , together with heisenberg s uncertainty . \n we employ a simple model for the ammonia molecule , i.e. the double square well potential ( dswp ) , which captures its essential properties required for a probabilistic treatment via the schrdinger equation . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ dswp ] , \n we derive the time - dependent wavefunction for the ammonia molecule ( dswp ) , and we also plot the time dependence of probability density in both position and momentum spaces . in section [ iswp ] , we consider the infinite square well potential ( iswp ) , in order to compare the corresponding results of the dswp with a system , where quantum tunneling is absent . in section [ statistical measures ] \n we define the relevant statistical measures and present the intrinsic relation among them . in section [ results ] \n we illustrate and comment the results i.e. the time evolution of statistical measures for both ammonia molecule ( dswp ) and iswp . \n the conclusions of the analysis are drawn in section [ summary and conclusions ] . \n the ammonia molecule has the shape of a pyramid where the nitrogen atom is at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms form the base in the shape of an equilateral triangle @xcite . \n the position of the nitrogen atom is chosen as the origin of the x axis . \n manning potential @xcite constitutes a good approximation of the ammonia molecule potential , which is defined by the function    @xmath10        in the following analysis we replace the manning potential ( fig . [ manning ] ) by the simplified dswp ( fig . \n [ dswp - potential ] ) . \n dswp in general , is a tractable quantum system which can be solved analytically , and therefore it will be used to illustrate the main features of the actual potential . \n we study the quantum motion of a  particle \" representing the collective motion of the three hydrogen atoms . \n the mass of this hydrogen plane is equal to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . \n the depth is assumed to be @xmath13 , the height of the central barrier @xmath14 and the maximum distance that the hydrogen plane can take from nitrogen is @xmath15  where @xmath16 @xcite . \n adjustments to the length of the wells @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been made , so that the calculated frequencies are in accordance with the ones that have been found experimentally ( @xmath19 ) @xcite . \n dswp in the ammonia molecule is defined by the following piecewise function ,    @xmath20    , width=211,height=139 ]    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath21  and @xmath22  . \n the one - dimensional schrdinger equation ( se ) is :    @xmath23    by dividing the @xmath24 axis into five spatial regions , and following the standard procedure @xcite we solve analytically the corresponding second order differential equations , taking into account continuity and smoothness conditions for the wavefunction at @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n the potential is an even function of position , i.e. , @xmath27 . due to this symmetry , \n the solutions of the se are either odd or even functions of position . \n we solve these equations only for @xmath28 , because only in that case the energy is less than the barrier s height , and so quantum tunneling is possible . \n the symmetric ( even ) solution is :    @xmath29    while the antisymmetric one ( odd ) is :    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    in the even case we set @xmath32 , and the values of the constants @xmath33 are obtained by solving the resulting transcendental equation numerically . \n working similarly in the odd case , we set again @xmath32 and find @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n the energies and phases found numerically are :    .energies and phases in ammonia molecule @xmath0 [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , disequilibrium @xmath36 and lmc complexity @xmath37 versus time are plotted in fig . \n [ fig : nh3-d -

oscillation - momentum ] that curves of @xmath48 overlap with each other when the particle is predominately in the left or in the right side of the well ( @xmath49 ) , which results in a local maximum value . \n the importance of shannon and fisher information entropies is now obvious , since these two measures manage to differentiate dswp from iswp case , providing a more sensitive analysis of the system .    finally , in fig . \n [ fig : iswp - d - c ] we plot disequilibrium and lmc complexity versus time . \n 0.35     0.35 \n we have found that when a particle tunnels through a barrier in a dswp , the heisenberg product of uncertainties and information entropy form a periodic function , which take their minimum values when the particle is located in one well , and their maximum when the particle is in the middle of the penetration region . despite the absence of the tunneling effect in iswp case \n , heisenberg relation shows qualitatively the same behavior as in dswp case . on the other hand , information entropies , disequilibrium and lmc \n complexity show slight but crucial qualitative differences , formulating a criterion , whether the tunneling effect is present or not in a quantum - mechanical system . \n our results also verify the main differences between shannon and fisher information entropies . \n fisher s information reflects the localization characteristics of the tunneling effect more sensitively than the shannon information entropy , while the first one resembles to an exponential rise , and the latter to a logarithmical one . \n moreover , shannon s information entropy @xmath38 reflects the behavior of probability density in position space @xmath5 , while the fisher information the behavior of probability density in momentum space @xmath48 . \n this can be observed from the results in both dswp and iswp cases . in this sense , \n shannon information entropy is complementary to fisher information .    in conclusion \n , it is worth mentioning that generally dswp and ammonia molecule in particular , are of great interest in the field of quantum computation and information . \n recent experimental and theoretical research @xcite has shown that dswp can be used to make quantum logic gates for ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices , while the ammonia molecule provides a nice vibrational system , which can be a promising candidate for achieving molecular quantum computation . \n gadre , reviews of modern quantum chemistry , a celebration of the contributions of robert g. parr , vol . \n 1 , world scientific , singapore , 2002 , ch . information theoretical approaches to quantum chemistry , pp \n . 108147 .", "StartTimeOffset": 773522188884, "RequestID": "74b2d069613f8602267f40f812ad2494ae7c5c7e", "TotalTokens": 3133}

[ \n cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     three of the sources have falling ( non - thermal , @xmath2 ) spectra . \n cgpse  165 is a likely extragalactic source . \n it is only slightly extended at 1420 mhz , has a non - thermal spectrum and has no associated infrared emission . \n particularly noteworthy though is the filamentary structure made up of cgpse 172 and 168 \n . both sections of this filament have falling spectrum between 408 and 1420 mhz . a combined flux density measurement yields a spectral index of @xmath3 . \n this steep , non - thermal , spectral index combined with the filamentary morphology seen at both 408 and 1420 mhz makes this object a strong candidate for a new galactic snr ( g151.2 + 2.85 ) . \n figure  [ fig : l112 ] shows the region near the cas  a snr . \n the region is rich in optical regions and has been interpreted as being the early stages of the formation of an ob association @xcite or even being part of a much larger complex of star - forming regions @xcite . \n some of the individual regions have been observed at radio wavelengths at higher resolution but the cgps data show all of the regions in context and are sensitive to the extensive extended emission . \n for example , the observations of sh-2  157 by @xcite and @xcite focus only on the region around cgpse 72 and 75 , while cgpse 73 , 74 , and 78 are probably also related . \n the vla survey of optically visible regions by @xcite does not include any of these regions presumably due to a combination of the angular size limit for survey targets ( @xmath5 arcmin ) and the difficulty of obtaining images close to the cas  a snr . \n while cas a itself was not imaged by the drao interferometer because its high brightness makes image calibration extremely difficult @xcite , the cgps image quality at 1420 mhz for the region close to cas a is extremely high . \n special data reduction techniques , described by @xcite , were used to minimize artifacts associated with the bright snr . \n in addition the field centres for the fields surrounding cas a were selected so that the snr was located in the first null of the primary beam of the drao interferometer at 1420 mhz @xcite . \n since the cgps observations were not directed only to the locations of the optical regions a new galactic snr , g113.0 + 0.2 ( cgpse  83 , 84 and 85 ) , was discovered at the high - longitude end of this complex @xcite . \n also cgpse 87 is a newly identified faint extended radio source . \n the combined infrared , line and high - resolution ( approximately 45 arcsec ) molecular line data also available for this area would make the reinvestigation of this region , in the context of it possibly being a forming ob association , particularly worthwhile . \n there are a large number of optical regions with sizes ranging from 0.2 degrees up to about 0.5 degrees located around @xmath6 ( see figure  [ fig : nvsscomp ] ) . \n the emission associated with these regions is encompassed by a very extended `` bowtie '' structure of which the southern portion is associated with the large optical region sh 2 - 230 . \n the region around cgpse  201 ( sh 2 - 235 ) has been studied in some detail @xcite owing to its compact nature , which facilitates interferometric observations , and the fact it contains a number of embedded infrared sources . \n the region around the bright source cgpse  200 ( sh 2 - 236 ) is probably worthy of a more detailed investigation beyond the existing studies which use this large as as tracer of the galactic velocity field ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the filaments cgpse  192 , 193 , 195 and 196 are all apparently thermal emission . \n cgpse  195 has a rising spectrum between 408 and 1420 mhz and infrared ( _ iras _ ) images of this area clearly show associated infrared emission . \n cgpse  196 is associated with a small ridge of infrared emission which is originating from an embedded infrared source , _ iras _  05329 + 3628 within a distant molecular cloud @xcite . \n there is no obvious infrared emission associated with cgpse 192 and 193 , however , given the fact the filaments are not detected at 408 mhz , they are most likely thermal emission associated with sh 2 - 230 . \n the cgpse catalogue provides a summary of the extended radio emission sources detected in the second quadrant of the galaxy by the cgps at 1420 mhz and at arcminute - scale resolution . \n in addition to flux density measurements at both 1420 and 408 mhz , the catalogue contains positional information and cross - identifications with other major radio and optical catalogues . \n also included are mosaic codes for each source that will facilitate the retrieval of cgps data from the cadc . \n the catalogue includes a number of newly identified radio continuum sources including a new galactic snr g151.2 + 2.85 . \n it expands the coverage of previous catalogues of extended galactic radio sources to include essentially the entire second quadrant along the galactic plane , and corrects a number of misclassifications and inadvertent omissions of large sources from previous catalogues . \n for example , cgpse  34 and 37 ( da 558 and da 568 ) were not included in the @xcite catalogue , and objects like cgps  17 and 187 are now correctly classified as regions not snrs . \n the outer galaxy is an ideal region for the study of the structure of spiral arms and for the observation of the content of star - forming regions owing to the relative proximity of the sources of interest and limited confusion when compared with similar studies directed towards the inner galaxy . \n we have illustrated how the radio continuum data alone from the cgps can provide new synoptic views of star forming complexes and lead to the discovery of new sources . \n the entire cgps data set is a unique resource for the investigation of galactic structure and star formation and it is hoped that this catalogue will facilitate the use of the cgps data set by the wider astronomy community . \n j.p . contributed to this research as part of the freshman honors program at iowa state university . \n j.m . participated in this research through an undergraduate research opportunity funded by iowa state university . \n the dominion radio astrophysical observatory is operated by the national research council of canada . \n the canadian galactic plane survey is supported by a grant from natural science and engineering research council of canada . \n green d.a . , 2006 , a catalogue of galactic supernova remnants ( 2006 april version ) , astrophysics group , cavendish laboratory , cambridge , united kingdom ( available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/ )", "StartTimeOffset": 780003018540, "RequestID": "b7afa3a31f16a8ab4cd4fbb216ecfea8e27dc00a", "TotalTokens": 1884}

resolution studies of the sun , we will set the stage for this review of the intricate flow fields of sunspots . \n the line - of - sight velocity can be derived from a doppler - shifted spectral line profile , and its height dependence can be inferred by carefully selecting lines , which originate at different layers in the solar atmosphere , or by measuring the bisectors of spectral lines . \n local correlation or feature tracking are the methods of choice in determining horizontal proper motions ( see fig . \n [ fig01 ] ) . in principle , \n spectroscopic and imaging techniques provide access to the three - dimensional velocity field . \n instruments commonly used to measure solar velocity fields can be placed into five broad categories ordered according to their spectral resolving power : ( 1 ) imaging with interference filters , ( 2 ) imaging with lyot filters , ( 3 ) line - of - sight velocity and magnetic field measurements using filtergraphs , ( 4 ) imaging spectropolarimeters , and ( 5 ) long - slit spectrographs . \n we introduce observations obtained with the instruments@xmath0 ( superscripts indicate the instrument category ) of the _ hinode _ solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the interferometric bidimensional imaging spectrometer ( ibis@xmath1 , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the crisp imaging spectropolarimeter ( crisp@xmath1 , * ? ? ? \n * ) , the gttingen / gregor fabry -

to - date . \n consequently , our approach had to be a very subjective one motivated by the imminent commissioning of the gregor solar telescope and the upcoming science demonstration time with the gfpi . \n the existence of convective signatures in the umbra has been debated for many years . \n high - resolution observations with crisp pinpointed strong upflows of up to 1.4  km  s@xmath3 in deep photospheric layers , which are associated with bright umbral dots @xcite . \n the height dependence of line - of - sight velocities was determined from the bisectors of coarsely sampled spectral lines . \n the umbral dots are identified with columns of hot , rising material with weaker and more inclined magnetic fields as compared to the umbral background . to establish overturning convective energy transport in the umbra \n , downflows have to exist , which were indeed observed ( 0.41.0  km  s@xmath3 ) in confined areas at the periphery of umbral dots as predicted by theory . \n some elongated umbral dots exhibit dark lanes in their centers , where the magnetic field is even weaker and more inclined . \n these umbral dots resemble ` coffee beans ' because of this peculiar intensity pattern , which originates from the accumulation of material at the top of rising plumes increasing the density and elevating the opacity @xcite . \n as pointed out by @xcite , the velocity gradient with height in umbral dots imposes an observational challenge , _ \n i.e. _ , the doppler shifts are hard to observe in the line core  explaining the scarcity of reported umbral downflows , which are a phenomenon of the deep photosphere . \n in addition , small - scale features such as umbral dots change size and velocity within a few minutes , thus necessitating observations with high spatial and temporal resolution .    scrutinizing light - bridges separating different umbral cores \n , @xcite found another remarkable feature . \n even though similar in appearance to granulation , light - bridges have dark central lanes with a width of about 400  km , where upflows reside , which are strongest in deep photospheric layers . \n typical velocities are around 0.5  km  s@xmath3 but reach as high as 1.0  km  s@xmath3 . however , the direction of the flows is just opposite to the downflows in intergranular lanes . \n similar to the dark lanes in umbral dots , the narrow , dark channels of light - bridges have weaker and more inclined magnetic fields .      in the penumbra , \n the evershed flow denotes a radial outflow of gas , which is aligned with more horizontally placed magnetic flux tubes in dark penumbral filaments . \n theoretical models based on the thin flux tube approximation arrive at steady as well as time - dependent flows driven by pressure differences . the ` moving flux tube ' model ( _ e.g _ , * ? ? ? \n * ) explains much of the observed fine structure . \n however , ` steady siphon - flow ' models still remain viable and provide strong arguments against super - alfvnic , ` sea - serpent'-like flows @xcite , namely that they are gravitationally unstable .    the average vertical velocity field of the quiet sun as observed by the _ hinode _ \n spectropolarimeter @xcite is always dominated by upflows , whereas the penumbra shows a different behavior . here \n , upflows cover a larger area for doppler velocities below 0.4  km  s@xmath3 , in particular in the inner penumbra . \n however , at velocities above 0.6  km  s@xmath3 downflows have a larger areal coverage . \n this leads to a net downflow of more than 0.1  km  s@xmath3 for the entire penumbra . \n the upflows of the inner penumbra are typically elongated an possess an aspect ratio of about five . in contrast , the largest downflows in the penumbra of up to 9  km  s@xmath3 at the outer penumbral boundary exceed even the largest quiet sun values of about 3  km  s@xmath3 and have a shape closer to circular . \n penumbral grains migrate inwards in the inner penumbra . \n the evershed flow begins at the leading edge of the penumbral grains @xcite , which have been identified with the footpoints of hot upflows in strongly inclined flux tubes @xcite . \n the evershed flow then turns horizontal and follows preferentially the dark cores of the penumbral filaments @xcite , where the magnetic field is more horizontal . \n the striking dark - cored penumbral filaments are much easier to discern in polarized light than in continuum images @xcite . \n their spectral line profiles are very asymmetric , which hints at multiple magnetic field components along the line - of - sight or within the resolution element . \n the dark cores have a lateral extend of less than 200  km and exhibit magnetic fields , which are weaker by 100150  g as compared to the lateral brightenings . \n the evershed flow reaches velocities up to and even exceeding the photospheric sound speed of about 7  km  s@xmath3 . \n the evershed flow shows temporal variations on scales of 1015  min , which also corresponds to the intensity variations of evershed clouds . \n small patches of opposite polarity and strong downflows are observed throughout the outer penumbra indicating that some penumbral field lines already return to the interior well within the penumbra itself @xcite . selecting spectral lines with contribution functions covering the deep photosphere or bisector analysis are the means to determine the height dependence of the evershed flow , which increases in strength with depth . \n the evershed flow is not stationary . \n coherent flow patches ( evershed clouds ) can be traced from within the sunspot to move away from the spot @xcite , where they can be associated with moving magnetic features ( mmfs ) . \n @xcite report that the evershed flow continues at least sporadically outside the penumbra into the sunspot moat , _ i.e. _ , not all field lines , which carry the evershed flow , submerge below the photosphere at the penumbra s outer boundary . analyzing spectropolarimetric _ \n data , @xcite find high - speed ( supersonic ) downflows by analyzing stokes-@xmath4 profiles . \n if such profiles become more complicated , _ i.e. _ , if they have multiple lobes , then using the zero - crossing of the stokes-@xmath4 profile is not a good indicator of flow velocities . \n this argues in favor of instruments capable of resolving spectral line profiles and not filtergraph systems , which deliver dopplergrams and magnetograms prone to erroneous interpretation . \n the observed downflows occur in three distinct locations : ( 1 ) the outer penumbral boundary ( mmfs ) , ( 2 ) the edge of the umbra in absence of penumbral structures , and ( 3 ) near small - scale field concentrations in the sunspot moat ( convective collapse ) . \n these features have in common a pointlike appearance with diameters of about 1 . \n they are transient features with lifetimes from a few minutes to about 30  min but on average the lifetimes tend towards the lower end of this range . on the other hand , in long - duration observations , \n filamentary magnetic features become visible in the sunspot moat @xcite revealing that mmfs preferentially move along certain pathways . \n @xcite present another interesting finding , namely that in the inner moat the flow velocities are higher in the ultra - violet ( 170  nm ) as compared to visible ( 500  nm ) continuum , while reversing this relationship in the outer moat . \n active region noaa  10977 contained a bipolar group of pores , which never developed a penumbra , even though infrared caii @xmath5  nm observations revealed superpenumbral structures ( a worthwhile research topic on its own ) . in a coordinated observing campaign with _ \n hinode _ and ibis , @xcite detected short , radially aligned magnetic structures at the periphery of the pore , which however did not bear any resemblance to penumbral filaments . \n consequently , in their absence no indications of the evershed effect could be detected . \n surprisingly , both moat flow and mmfs were surrounding the pore questioning their close ties to the evershed flow . \n the presence of mmfs was interpreted as twisted magnetic field lines , which were pealed away from the vertical flux bundle of the pore by the ( super)granular flow . \n a mechanism to remove magnetic flux from a sunspot is the interaction of penumbral filaments at the edge of the sunspot with the granulation , which erodes the magnetic field of the sunspot @xcite . \n flux detaches in the form of mmfs from the more vertical background fields of the uncombed penumbra , thus contributing to the decay of sunspots . \n other types of mmfs , which are related to the magnetized evershed flow , do not change the net magnetic flux . \n these dark penumbral filaments with strong horizontal magnetic fields often reach into the moat region . \n this goes along with a non - stationary penumbral boundary , which advances and retracts with respect to an average position .    in the last stage of sunspot decay , \n only a pore without a penumbra remains @xcite , where small finger - like , weak , and almost horizontal magnetic features of opposite polarity can be recognized at the pore s boundary . \n they extend up to about 1.5  mm and have blue - shifted stokes profiles indicative of upflows with speeds of 12  km  s@xmath3 . \n this could be the remnants of magnetic field lines , which previously carried the evershed flow . \n no longer held down by the mass provided by the evershed flow , they become boyant and lift of to vanish in the chromosphere . in general , the question remains open , where penumbral flux tubes end . \n at least in the final stages of a decaying sunspot , alternatives might exist to the notion that they just bend below the surface at the periphery of the penumbra . \n this problem is also tied to the matter of mass continuity in the evershed flow , since sources and sinks still need to be unambiguously identified and the balance between inflows and outflows has to be established . \n if the mass would be supplied by the flux rope rising through the convection zone , which initially led to the emergence of the sunspot , then decoupling from this flux rope would shut off the mass flow causing the sunspot to decay . \n it is noteworthy that the divergence line observed in the middle penumbra survives the decay process @xcite and even the moat flow is still detectable long after the penumbra has vanished @xcite . \n flares occur near magnetic neutral lines , where strong magnetic field gradients exist , and where the horizontal component of the magnetic field is strongly sheared . \n the height dependence of horizontal proper motions can be derived by applying local correlation tracking techniques to images obtained in multiple spectral regions . near - infrared images at the opacity minimum probe the deepest photospheric layers , whereas g - band images provide access to higher layers as compared to continuum images observed in the visible part of the solar spectrum . \n @xcite presented such a multi - wavelength study of active region noaa  10486  one of the most flare - prolific regions of solar cycle 23 . \n both horizontal and vertical shear flows with speeds of about 1  km  s@xmath3 exist in the vicinity of magnetic neutral lines . \n these flows are long - lived and persistent . \n thus , the magnetic field might not be the only agent trigerring solar flares . \n the flow speed in shear regions is diminishing with height while the direction remain essentially the same . \n therefore , shear flows are dominant in the deeper layers of the photosphere . in response to an x10 \n flare the shear flows significantly increased , which was interpreted as shear release in the overlying magnetic fields or as the emergence of twisted and sheared flux infusing energy from subphotospheric layers . \n shear flows are not just limited to horizontal flow fields . in a spectropolarimetric study of a b7.8 flare in active region noaa  10904 , @xcite detected ( supersonic ) downflows of up to 7  km  s@xmath3 in the penumbra . \n twisting and interlaced penumbral filaments are no longer radially aligned with respect to the major sunspot and become almost tangential . \n however , the evershed flow remains aligned with the magnetic field . \n islands of opposite polarity and complex flows require a three - dimensional topology necessitating high spectral resolution to capture these features in multi - lobed stokes-@xmath4 profiles . \n twisted and sheared penumbral filaments , photospheric shuffling of footpoints , and rapid motion as well as rotation of sunspots can all destabilize the magnetic fields above an active region . in a multi - wavelength study of active region noaa  10960 \n , @xcite find evidence that helical twist is accumulated before the flare and then activated to release the stored energy during the flare . \n the orientation of penumbral filaments can strongly deviate from the radial direction in satellite sunspots and @xmath6-configurations . \n photospheric signatures of the flare are the now well - established rapid penumbral decay and umbral enhancement @xcite , which are indicative of a rearranged magnetic field topology . \n in addition to these signatures , @xcite noticed the lateral displacements of penumbral filaments during an x3.4 flare in active region noaa  10930 on 2006 december  13 . \n this occurs immediately before ( 4  min ) the flare initiation , when penumbral filaments move laterally towards the magnetic neutral line , while changing direction and moving away from it for about 40  min after the flare . \n the energy involved in the lateral displacements is only a few percent of the total energy released in the flare . \n space observations are not only free from seeing but , depending on orbit , do not have to cope with the day night - cycle on earth . \n thus , in principle , high cadence observations with long coverage become possible to follow magnetic structures of active regions while they evolve . \n such observations from space are only limited by on - board processing and telemetry . despite the availability of long time - series with consitstent quality only few systematic and comprehensive studies of flow fields \n are available . \n the majority of investigations have been limited to case studies . \n this is an opportunity for the time yet to come to explore this enormous database with the aim to put the still fragmented puzzle of flows in and around sunspots together into a comprehensive picture . in this respect , \n high - cadence vector magnetograms of the recently launched solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) will certainly advance our knowledge regarding eruptive events on the sun . \n the new and upcoming instrumental capabilities on the ground will drastically improve angular resolution . \n adaptive optics and future multi - conjugate adaptive optics will allow to capture time - series of spectropolarimetric data , which are longer than the lifetime of solar ( small - scale ) structures . \n the polarimetric sensitivity and spectral resolution of these instruments including infrared capabilities will produce multi - dimensional data sets suitable for advanced spectral inversion techniques . \n for the first time , physical quantities become accessible at the fundamental scales of physical processes on the sun . \n mv expresses her gratitude for the generous financial support by the german academic exchange service ( daad ) in the form of a phd scholarship . \n cd acknowledges a daad travel grant facilitating his attendance at the iau symposium .", "StartTimeOffset": 794825356860, "RequestID": "fc8ca03e7a13e648d3c4c0cb24146424845fde30", "TotalTokens": 4154}

chemical cells in terms of theoretical ultra - low momentum neutron absorption cross sections .    in sec.[potential ] , a simple neutron optical potential model for a spherical well is reviewed and the complex scattering lengths for describing the ultra - low momentum neutron absorption cross sections are derived@xcite . in sec.[transmutation ] , we discuss the experimental distribution in atomic mass number @xmath6 of the low energy nuclear reaction products measured in laboratory chemical cells@xcite . very remarkably , the product yield in a chemical cell is in some ways qualitatively similar to nuclear abundances found in our local solar system and galaxy@xcite . the local maxima and minima in these abundances are strongly correlated to the local maxima and minima in the ultra - low momentum neutron absorption cross sections . \n this strong similarity serves as an indicator of the potential importance of ultra - low energy neutrons in nuclear reaction kinetics as briefly discussed in the concluding sec.[conc ] . \n let us consider the following _ optical potential model _ for the effective ( added to a nucleus ) neutron amplitude @xmath8 . \n the complex potential probed by the neutron has the form of a spherical well . \n the well radius for a given atomic mass number @xmath6 is modeled by @xmath9 in detail , we assume a complex spherical step potential well @xmath10 from the scrdinger equation for the neutron amplitude @xmath11 one finds the scattering amplitude @xmath12 , @xmath13 and thereby the total neutron cross section @xmath14 in the ultra - low momentum limit , one may compute the neutron scattering strength @xmath15 the exact analytic form of the limiting eq.([potential6 ] ) is given by @xmath16 employing this optical potential model with @xmath17 , the total neutron cross section in the long wavelength limit may be analytically computed , @xmath18 as plotted in fig.[fig1 ] . \n the peaks in the neutron cross section correspond to comfortably fitting the neutron wave within the spherical model optical potential wells of the nuclei . \n the well radius @xmath19 varies with @xmath20 in accordance with eq.([potential1 ] ) . \n while the model solved above refers the absorption of one neutron by one spherical nucleus , when the model is applied an ultra - low momentum neutron in a condensed matter electrode of a chemical cell , the very long neutron wave length spans many nuclei . \n this gives rise to collective quantum coherent effects in the neutron - nuclei interaction . \n the following experimental nuclear transmutations have been previously reported using light water solutions of one molar @xmath21 in electrolytic cells . \n small plastic micro - spheres were coated with thin films of nickel which were then employed to construct electrodes . \n the granular thin film structure of the electrodes allowed for large effective surface areas for the nickel hydride . \n if there exists sufficiently large flux of protons moving through the nickel and if the surface of the nickel hydride film is saturated with hydrogen atoms and thereby protons , then nuclear transmutations could be measured to take place with a yield that is plotted as functions of @xmath6 . \n the magnitude of the transmuted nuclear yields varies from one experimental run to to another . \n the variations will depend on the isotopic composition of the metallic hydride cathode and anode , various ions found in solution and the nano - scale uniformity of the electrode fabrication processes . \n however , the distribution of the yields versus atomic number appear to be understandable in terms of the total cross sections for neutron absorption in the ultra - low momentum limit , i.e. in terms of the above calculated neutron scattering strength .    in fig.[fig2 ] , we plot the reported transmutation yield versus atomic mass number for a moderately productive run@xcite employing a nickel cathode and compare the observed shape of the yield function and the shape of the ultra - low momentum neutron scattering strength . in fig.[fig3 ] \n we plot the reported transmutation yield versus atomic mass number for a very productive run@xcite employing a nickel cathode and again compare the observed shape of the yield function and the shape of the ultra - low momentum neutron scattering strength . \n similar experimental results@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite have been found employing titanium hydride , palladium hydride , and layered pd - ni metallic hydride electrodes . in all such experimental runs , \n the agreement between the multi - peak transmutation yields and the neutron scattering strength is quite satisfactory . \n let us conclude with some comments on the nature of the peaks in the theoretical neutron scattering strengths shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in varying the atomic mass number @xmath6 , we are in reality varying the radius @xmath22 of the optical potential well . when the neutron wavelength within the well reaches resonance with the radius of the well@xcite a peak appears in the scattering strength . if we associate resonant couplings with the ability of the neutron to be virtually trapped in a region neighboring the nucleus , then for intervals of atomic mass numbers about and under the resonant peaks we would expect to obtain neutron halo nuclei@xcite@xcite . \n the spherical optical potential well@xcite predicts the halo nuclei stability valleys@xcite and thus the peaks in observed nuclear transmutation abundances . \n finally , the neutrons yielding the abundances in our local solar system and galaxy have often been previously assumed to arise entirely from stellar nucleosynthetic processes and supernova explosions . \n however , such assumptions may presently be regarded as suspect@xcite@xcite . \n it appears entirely possible that ultra - low momentum neutron absorption may have an important role to play in the nuclear abundances not only in chemical cells but also in our local solar system and galaxy . \n g. h. miley , g. narne , m. j. williams , j. a. patterson , j. nix , d. cravens , h. hora , `` quantitative observation of transmutation products occurring in thin -

distance interactions , with @xmath15 , are due to the exchange of weakly coupled gravitons of low momentum ( linearized gravity ) @xcite . in transplanckian collisions \n quantum gravity acts at distances of order @xmath16 , well within the event horizon ( @xmath17 ) . \n these interactions are characterized by a small deflection angle in the center of mass frame . \n the elastic collision of a neutrino and a parton that exchange @xmath18-dimensional gravitons is described by the _ \n eikonal _ amplitude resumming an infinite set of ladder and cross - ladder diagrams . in these _ soft _ processes , the neutrino transfers to the partons \n a small energy fraction @xmath19 and keeps going . \n then the parton starts a hadronic cascade , that will be observable if @xmath20 .    to estimate the relative frequency of both type of processes @xcite , \n consider a @xmath2  gev neutrino that scatters off a nucleon with @xmath21  tev and @xmath22  tev for @xmath23 extra dimensions . \n the number of eikonal interactions before the neutrino gets destroyed is the ratio of interaction lengths @xmath24 , with @xmath25  km ( 4 km ) in ice , whereas for a sm interaction @xmath26  km . \n this opens up the possibility of _ multiple - bang _ events . \n in fact , for a detector of length @xmath27 , the total interaction probability , the probability of @xmath28 bangs and the average number of bangs is @xmath29 which yields , for the given neutrino and @xmath30  km , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n the event rate at a neutrino telescope is proportional to the flux , the exposure time , the cross sectional area , the interaction probability ( roughly proportional to the length ) and the probability that the neutrino of a given inclination survives to reach the detector ( depending on the zenith angle , column density of material and the detector depth ) . \n the energy distribution of the hadronic cascades and the total number of black hole and eikonal events @xcite at amanda ( 0.03 km@xmath36 and a length of 700 m ) and icecube ( 1 km@xmath37 ) for the neutrino fluxes introduced above are given in figs . \n [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively . in the sm \n we expect 1.32 ( 0.50 ) contained events per year in icecube for the higher ( lower ) flux . of those \n , 0.38 ( 0.14 ) would come from a neutral current and 0.94 ( 0.36 ) from a charged current . \n the flux of primary nucleons reaching the atmosphere from several gev follows approximately a power law with negative spectral index 2.7 changing to 3 at about @xmath38  gev ( the _ knee _ ) and then back to 2.7 at about @xmath2  gev ( the _ ankle _ ) . around 90% of these nucleons \n are protons and the rest are neutrons , free or bound in nuclei . as this flux enters the atmosphere , an induced flux of secondary hadrons ( nucleons , pions , kaons , etc . ) \n is generated @xcite , many of them with enough energy to produce tev physics in interactions with atmospheric nucleons . \n for instance , at @xmath39 gev ( @xmath40  tev ) the secondary nucleons ( mesons ) increase a 50% ( 15% ) the number of primaries . \n exotic massive particles @xcite produced inside the shower could be detected at ground if they are _ long - lived _ \n ( their decay products would be otherwise confused with thousands of particles ) , since they tend to be more _ penetrating _ and can survive the shower ( most of ordinary particles , except muons and neutrinos , get aborbed by the atmosphere in sufficiently inclined showers ) . \n in split - susy models @xcite the squarks are heavy and the gluinos may be light and long - lived if @xmath41-parity is conserved \n . these gluinos would be pair - produced by atmospheric interactions with the uhe hadron flux @xcite , at a rate of less than one down - going pair per year and square kilometer if their mass is just above 160 gev ( fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n a gluino rapidly fragments into an @xmath41-hadron . \n for instance , a neutral gluino - gluon state of mass @xmath42 ( larger than 170 gev from tevatron ) would have a quite small interaction length ( similar to that of a pion at the same velocity ) but would be nevertheless very penetrating , losing only @xmath43 per interaction . \n thus , while a proton deposits most of its energy in two vertical atmospheres , a 200 gev gluino gives away just one per cent of its energy .    to observe the long - lived gluinos , first one needs enough events \n . this will not be the case in a neutrino telescope like icecube , with an area of 1  km@xmath36 . \n in contrast , the pierre auger observatory has an extension of more than 3000 km@xmath36 and a shower - energy threshold of about @xmath44  gev that would allow the detection of 20 ( 2 ) gluino - pairs per year if @xmath45 gev ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . \n the gluino signal is distinct , since it consists of a series of hadronic mini - showers resembling a trace of constant energy , more clearly seen in inclined showers ( 25% of them have zenith angle above @xmath46 ) . \n moreover , gluinos come in pairs separated by a distance @xmath47 , enhanced in quasi - horizontal showers for which @xmath48 m if they start at a typical height @xmath49 km with an average opening angle @xmath50 .              in supersymmetric models with an exact @xmath41-parity and a gravitino lsp working as dark matter , \n a charged nlsp , typically a ` right - handed ' stau , is a long - lived particle since it can only decay via gravitational interactions . to get a sizeable rate \n the staus must be pair - produced through strong interactions , in prompt decays of coloured particles ( gluinos and squarks ) @xcite . \n the stau - pairs produced high in the atmosphere propagate down to the core of icecube , about two kilometers below the antarctic ice , facing a strong background of muon pairs . \n the propagation of muons and charged particles in matter is well understood . \n the energy deposition per column density follows a law @xmath51 where the first term , independent of the mass of the particle , describes ionization effects and the second , inversely proportional to the mass , accounts for bremsstrahlung , pair production and photohadronic processes . \n below 500 gev ionization is dominant , so staus and muons lose energy at a similar rate , but above that energy the staus , being at least a thousand times heavier , are much more penetrating . in fig . \n [ fig5 ] the range of staus and muons is given compared to the integrated column depth of the earth from icecube at different zenith angles . \n for example , a muon of @xmath52 gev has a range of just 25 km water equivalent ( w.e . ) and can reach icecube from an angle @xmath53 while a stau of 130  gev of the same energy can arrive from a @xmath54 . \n another relevant observable is the separation of the two particles in the detector , which can be resolved if it is larger than 50 m. fig . \n [ fig6 ] shows the number of stau and muon pairs reaching icecube from a height @xmath55  km as resolved parallel tracks carrying a fraction @xmath56 or 0.7 of the energy of parent @xmath57 ( gluino or squark ) . \n this signal can be distinguished from possible stau pairs produced by cosmogenic neutrinos , extensively considered in the literature @xcite . \n firstly , in quasi - horizontal showers the staus produced by neutrinos have a smaller track separation since they are typically produced in the ice , and secondly they may be distributed more isotropic , while those produced by hadrons can not arrive from much below the horizon . \n the cosmogenic neutrinos directly probe tev gravity in transplanckian neutrino - nucleon collisions , which may be of two types . \n hard processes ( subdominant ) where a microscopic black hole is formed and subsequently evaporates . \n soft , elastic processes where a small energy fraction is transfered by the neutrino to a hadronic cascade producing a clear signal in large neutrino telescopes ( absence of muons and possibly multiple - bang events ) . \n the primary nucleons or secondary hadrons inside an air shower may produce new massive particles when they interact with atmospheric nucleons . in particular inclined air showers \n may contain well separated , long - lived gluino pairs ( possibly detectable by auger ) or staus ( distinguishable from the muon background close to horizon at icecube ) . \n jii wishes to thank the organizers of the conference for their hospitality and the nice atmosphere of the meeting . \n this work has been supported by mec of spain ( fpa2006 - 05294 ) , junta de andaluca ( fqm-101 and fqm-437 ) and a grant cicyt - infn ( 07 - 10 ) . \n d.  v.  semikoz and g.  sigl , jcap * 0404 * ( 2004 ) 003 . \n n.  arkani - hamed , s.  dimopoulos and g.  dvali , phys . \n b * 429 * ( 1998 ) 263 ;

( 1999 ) have suggested that the source is in a high - soft state during the burst phase and in a low - hard state during the quiescent phase on the basis of available spectral observations and derived disk parameters of grs  1915 + 105 . \n the source makes state transitions in very short time scales corresponding to the rise and fall time of the bursts ( a few seconds ) . \n such fast changes of states are possible in the two component accretion flows ( tcaf ) where the advective disk covers the standard thin disk ( chakrabarti 1996 , rao et al . \n the time scales of the burst phase are compared with the viscous time scales of the thin accretion disk . \n recently , chakrabarti ( 1999 ) have presented a solution to the rapid state transition based on tcaf ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ) . \n the mass outflow from the regions of the shock compressed flow initiates the quiescent phase and the catastrophic compton cooling of the material in the sonic sphere marks the end of the quiescent phase and the start of the burst phase . \n this model essentially reinforces the suggestion of yadav et al . \n ( 1999 ) but gives a physical basis for the start of the event . \n the shock compressed gas with compression ratio r @xmath11 1 will produce the outflows which pass through the sonic points at r@xmath12 @xmath13 r@xmath14 provided the flow is isothermal till r@xmath15 , where r@xmath14 is the shock location and @xmath16 r@xmath17/(r-1 ) ( chakrabarti 1999 ) . \n chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) have expanded this model further and derived a correlation between t@xmath18 the duration of off state ( duration in which the sonic sphere becomes ready for catastrophic compton cooling ) and @xmath19 the qpo frequency between 2 @xmath2 10 hz . for an average shock 2.5 @xmath20 r @xmath11 3.3 , t@xmath18 is insensitive to the compression ratio . \n using average value of r @xmath21 2.9 and a constant velocity post -

zero burst time would represent the viscous time scales of the thin accretion disk as any change in the @xmath29 would require the viscous time scale to reach r@xmath15 when system can revert back to the quiescent phase ( yadav et al . \n the ir bursts are produced due to viscous - thermal - instability and the quiescent and burst time are correlated suggesting that both these parameters represent the viscous time scales of the thin disk ( t@xmath18 is of the order of viscous time scales and changing continuously ) . \n the burst time varies over a large range of 100 to 500 s suggesting viscous -

2 s . \n the quiescent time properties of these bursts are very different from the properties observed for other types of bursts . \n the average quiescent flux is high ( 7000@xmath210000 c / s ) and the @xmath37 of the energy spectrum is 2.67 . \n the asm flux is low ( 47@xmath260 asm c / s ) . \n the hr@xmath38 ( ratio of flux in 5@xmath213 kev band and flux in 2@xmath25 kev band ) is high ( 1.0@xmath21.06 ) during the quiescent phase . \n the ratio of the average burst flux and the average quiescent flux is almost constant during these bursts ( yadav & rao 2001 ) . \n the dispersion around a fixed period is lowest ( @xmath6 ) . \n this type of bursts have been observed for extended period almost continuously from 1997 may 26 to june 26 suggesting very stable thermal - viscous conditions during these burst ( yadav et al . \n 1999 , yadav & rao 2001 ) . at t@xmath18 \n , the sonic sphere cools down which ends the quiescent phase and marks the start of the burst phase . \n however the conditions are very stable and remain unchanged \n . the outflows immediately start and sub - keplerian halo appears quickly which abruptly ends the burst phase and the next quiescent phase starts producing ringing type burst phase with the burst peak flux hardly lasting for 1 - 2 s. the quiescent time decreases as the @xmath29 increases ( figure 2 ) . as the average quiescent flux increases the t@xmath18 decreases reducing the burst recurrence time without affecting the burst phase duration . \n an increase in the @xmath29 increases the quiescent flux and reduces the burst cycle ( appearing of the burst phase more frequently ) which explains why this type of bursts were observed over a large range of asm flux from 47 to 60 c / s ( the hr@xmath38 remains unchanged ) . \n castro -

( 1996 ) report on the observations at hr5127 and phi herculis \n . this paper concerns the mu pegasi scan .    we observe with a constant velocity scan in azimuth of @xmath94  relative to the pointing star . \n the left - hand lobe of the antenna pattern was coaligned with the field of view of our ccd cameras and centered on mu pegasi . \n gyroscope drift was taken out every 400 seconds . \n the relative offset between the center of the chop and the target star was 055 in azimuth .    during the mu pegasi scan ( 7.22  ut to 7.76  ut ) the gyro malfunctioned and moved the chop center with \n a trajectory tilted 10@xmath10 degrees from horizontal . \n the orientation of the gondola was still vertical . \n we verified the orientation and trajectory with the positions of stars in the ccd camera field of view . \n we did not observe in the same orientation as in max3 and we do not expect the morphology to be identical . \n the other max 5 observations displayed no significant tilt . \n we calibrated the instrument before and after the observation using a membrane transfer standard ( @xcite ) . \n we observed jupiter from 4.86  ut to 4.95  ut to measure the beam size and position and to confirm the membrane calibration . using the best - fit beam size and the membrane calibration , the derived temperature of jupiter agrees with griffin et al . \n ( 1986 ) to within 10% . \n we assume a 10% uncertainty in calibration . \n the calibration is such that a chopped beam centered between sky regions with temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 would yield @xmath13 in the absence of instrumental noise . \n anisotropy experiments are potentially susceptible to off - axis response to local sources , particularly the earth , the balloon , and the moon . \n the unchopped off - axis response in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is @xmath14 70  db below the on - axis response from 15  to 25  in elevation under the boresight . \n we have not made comparable measurements of the chopped sidelobe response in azimuth . \n mu pegasi was @xmath15 137  away from the moon during the observation . \n we remove transients due to cosmic rays using an algorithm described by @xcite . \n this procedure excludes approximately 18% of the data . \n we demodulate the detector output using the sinusoidal reference from the chopping secondary to produce antenna temperature differences @xmath16 on the sky . \n this produces a data set in phase and a data set 90  out of phase with the optical signal . \n the noise averaged over the observation gives respective cmbr sensitivities of 440 , 240 , 610 , and 5100 @xmath17 in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14  @xmath0 bands . \n the averages of the measured instrumental offsets in antenna temperature were 0.6 , 0.15 , 1.4 , and 2.8  mk in the 3.5 , 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands . \n we attribute this to chopped emissivity differences on the primary mirror and chopped atmospheric emission . \n the offset drifts in the higher frequency bands with amplitudes of 0.7  mk and 1.0  mk in the 9 and 14 @xmath0 bands over a time scale of  3 minutes . \n comparison of the first and second halves of the scan shows that the signal is stable in the 3.5 , 6 , and 9 @xmath0 bands , but not so in the 14 @xmath0 band . \n the instability in the 14 @xmath0 band could be caused by sidelobe pickup or atmosphere . to increase the stability , \n we subtract an offset and gradient , as in a ground based observation , with a linear least squares fit to each pass going from -4  to + 4  or + 4  to -4 . \n each half scan takes 72  s.    for each observation we calculated the means and 1  @xmath18 uncertainty of the antenna temperature differences for 29 pixels separated by 17  on the sky . \n figure  [ mpant ] shows the antenna temperature differences as a function of scan angle for the mu pegasi scan . \n there is significant structure ( @xmath19  =  38 , 86 , 86 , 79 for 27 dof ) that is well correlated ( @xmath20 ) in all channels of the in - phase data . \n possible astrophysical sources for the signal in the mu pegasi scan are free - free or synchrotron radiation , interstellar dust ( isd ) emission , radio point sources , or cmbr . from the rising spectrum in @xmath21 in figure  [ mpant ] \n it is clear that cmbr , free - free or synchrotron radiation alone is not responsible for the signal . \n the latter two cases are also excluded by amplitude and morphology arguments . \n if we extrapolate the haslam 408 mhz map ( @xcite ) to our frequencies using @xmath22 for free - free emission and @xmath23 for synchrotron radiation and convolve with our chopped beam pattern , we find that the former produces @xmath24 of the signal in the 3.5  @xmath0 channel and the latter @xmath25 . \n furthermore , the morphology does not match that of the data . \n an automated point source search has yielded no candidates within 90  that could produce a signal greater than @xmath26 . \n previous experience in this region leads us to expect isd to be the main contributor to our high frequency signal . \n we convolved the iras 100  maps with our chopped beam pattern and produced simulated scans . \n we found the scale factors that minimized the reduced @xmath19 from 100  simulations to each data channel separately and then normalized them to the 3.5 @xmath0 band . \n the results are shown in table [ specfits ] . \n the best fit morphology and spectrum are superimposed over the data in figure  [ mpant ] . \n if we consider the 6 , 9 , and 14 @xmath0 bands only , these scale factors indicate a warm dust spectrum @xmath27 , where @xmath2  =  1.3@xmath28 and t@xmath29  =  19@xmath30  k. this is consistent with our previous results ( @xcite ) . \n however , the rise in amplitude in the 3.5 @xmath0 band is not well explained by a warm dust or warm and cold dust model . \n there are two possible causes for the rise in amplitude in the lowest band . \n one is a high frequency leak in the filters . \n pre - flight systematic tests with a thick grill high pass filter showed that high frequency leakage above 20  was less than 0.8% of the total band response to a 300k blackbody chopped relative to a 77k blackbody . using measured filter transmittances and the amplitude of dust fluctuations in this sky region ( fischer et al . 1995 ) , we calculated that maximum modeled high frequency leakage of power from dust fluctuations contributes less than @xmath151% of the expected inband power from cmb fluctuations and less than 2% of the observed structure . \n another candidate is a correlated low frequency component .. however , our cross - correlation coefficient 3.5 @xmath31 which should be compared to @xmath32 for @xmath33 however , fits of two component models did not conclusively distinguish between the possibilities , such as cmbr + isd and hii + isd . \n we conclude the following about the foreground contaminant : the correlation between the 14 @xmath0 band and the other bands indicates a single foreground morphology . whatever the nature of the foreground , the relative amplitudes in the bands are given in table [ specfits ] column 2 . because of the excellent fit of the iras 100  maps to the 14 @xmath0 channel , \n we assume that the isd dominates over any other possible high frequency contaminant . \n we analyze the three channels most sensitive to cmbr , 3.5 , 6 and 9 @xmath0 for anisotropy in the presence of a single foreground morphology with the spectrum found above . \n we use maximum likelihood methods assuming uniform prior to set limits of the rms temperature fluctuation in the data , @xmath34 ( @xcite ) . \n the likelihood , l , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the data vector of all 29 bins and 3 channels and @xmath37 is the full covariance matrix for a flat band power spectrum . \n we marginalize the data to account for the best fit foreground spectrum given in table [ specfits ] and the offset and gradient removal ( @xcite ) . to do so \n , we construct a data vector and covariance matrix , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 account for both a single foreground spectrum and offset and gradient removal respectively . using @xmath42 and @xmath43 in equation ( [ likelihood ] ) \n yields an upper limit , @xmath44 23 @xmath45k ( 95% confidence level ) or @xmath46 . \n when max3 mu pegasi is analyzed in a fashion similar to this paper , we find @xmath47k ( 95% confidence level ) when marginalized for the dust model in @xcite . \n the two data sets are consistent with each other for similar analysis techniques . \n furthermore , the max5 mu pegasi upper limit is consistent with the result from hr5127 ( @xmath48 ) although roughly so with phi herculis ( @xmath49 ) which were also observed in that flight . \n we have presented new results from a search for cmbr anisotropy with high sensitivity at 05 angular scales near the star mu pegasi . \n free - free and synchrotron radiation are excluded as the main source of signal on amplitude and spectral arguments . \n there are no strong point sources in the field . \n the morphology of the observed structure is consistent with known interstellar dust but not the spectrum . \n the structure in the 6 , 9 and 14 @xmath0 channels is fit by a single dust model power law @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , and @xmath52  k. we can not rule out the possibility that the structure is a correlated combination of dust and cmbr or dust and free - free radiation . \n linear combinations of the data independent of the best fit spectrum yield a @xmath53 . \n ( 95% confidence level ) the results are consistent with our previous observation in the region . \n these data are available from the authors . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation through the center for particle astrophysics ( cooperative agreement ast  91 -

sensitive magnetic field measurements @xcite .    of particular interest \n has been the recent observation of ultra - slow light ( usl ) @xcite in atomic gases , at group velocities on the order of 10  m / s , due to a steep linear dispersion in the index of refraction associated with the narrow eit feature . \n this could allow for controllable true - time delay devices for classical light pulses , with applications in fiber - optic telecommunications @xcite and radar signal processing @xcite . \n later extensions of the technique to stored light @xcite ( for several milliseconds ) has also raised the possibility of quantum memory devices @xcite . \n while the narrow frequency feature ( below the natural linewidth and doppler width ) of eit is one of its attractive features for precision applications @xcite , this has drawbacks in regards to delay and storage applications . \n optical communications and radar processing typically desire @xmath4  ghz bandwidth . \n similarly , single photon sources and other tools of potential quantum information technologies may emit photons over a broad band . in usl experiments to date \n , the width of eit transparency window is much narrower . \n eit and usl work best when the atom can be well described with a @xmath5 energy level structure . \n the signal field is near - resonant with a stable state ( which we label @xmath6 ) and a radiatively decaying excited state ( @xmath7 ) . \n the pump field is resonant with another stable state @xmath8 and the common excited level @xmath7 . \n we consider two energy level schemes in @xmath0rb , shown in fig.[fig : diagram](a ) . \n the schemes are labeled `` a '' ( dashed , blue arrows ) and `` b '' ( solid , red arrows ) . \n the transparency and slow , distortion - free propagation of the signal pulse that we desire occur only when the frequency difference of the two lasers @xmath9 matches the energy level difference between levels @xmath6 and @xmath8 to within the narrow eit width . \n frequency components of the signal outside this width are strongly absorbed and distorted . \n this width is directly proportional to the pump power and practical limits on the pump power ( @xmath10  mw/@xmath11 ) limit it to @xmath1  mhz . \n [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     because of the extremely strong dependence of @xmath12 with power we found numerically that one always benefits from using smaller @xmath13 , so this parameter should be chosen to be the smallest reasonable value over which the beam can be easily focused . \n though too small a value @xmath13 would lead to a higher loss from @xmath14 this problem is almost always dominated by the diffusion in the magnetic field gradient and so is not a big consideration . \n similarly , in choosing @xmath15 we found that the gain in transparency from higher intensities tended to outweigh the gain one got from lower slopes . \n figure  [ fig : parameterdrift](b ) shows the maximum delay - bandwidth product versus @xmath16 , but keeping the pump power constant and adjusting the interaction with @xmath15 such that the bandwidth @xmath17  mhz was also kept constant . indeed one sees that one gains by using steeper gradients over smaller areas . \n ultimately , the slope @xmath16 that can be used in practice will be determined by the manner in which the magnetic field gradient and signal dispersion can be generated .    in the calculations in figs . \n [ fig : wideband ] and [ fig : parameterdrift](a - b ) we chose pressures @xmath18  torr and 25  torr for schemes a and b , respectively . numerically these were found to be about optimal . in fig . \n [ fig : parameterdrift ] we plot the dependence of the of the maximum delay - bandwidth on the pressure for several cases . in scheme \n a , the optimal pressures are larger than in the homogenous case due to increased importance of reducing diffusion in the magnetic field gradient . interestingly , even in scheme b , higher pressures eventually reduce the performance . \n this can be understood from the factor @xmath19 in the analytic estimate for @xmath12 above . \n the physical origin of this factor is the fact that the eit width @xmath20 decreases with @xmath21 and therefore makes the resonance more sensitive to the averaging over nearby magnetic fields eq . \n ( [ eq : rhodiffint ] ) . \n we plot the dependence on pressure for two different gradients in each scheme . while the optimal pressures are slightly different , the dependence on pressure is rather weak and so a sensitive parameter search versus @xmath22 should not be required . \n we have performed a comprehensive and systematic analysis of eit resonances , and the resulting pulse propagation characteristics , in @xmath0rb vapors , including effects of couplings to additional levels in the hyperfine structure and a buffer gas . \n we then calculated the delays , transmissions , and bandwidths for propagation of light tuned to these resonances . \n we analyzed two particular @xmath5 level schemes ( diagrammed in fig . \n [ fig : diagram ] ) and found that scheme b was far superior , in terms of achievable delays and delay - bandwidth products , due to the lack of coupling to additional levels . despite its poorer performance , scheme a still provides reasonable performance and may be desirable since it is much easier to initialize , simply with optical pumping . \n importantly , we found the eit resonance could be shifted over a wide range of frequencies by applying a homogeneous magnetic field , and that the resonance characteristics were quite insensitive to this field over range of about 500  mhz . \n this analysis serves as a useful model to study eit in conventional slow light , and also as a basis for study of our channelization architecture . \n we then presented a model to analyze the effect of an inhomogenous magnetic field , which causes a strong variation of the eit resonance frequency in the transverse direction . \n this was then applied to analyze the performance of our proposed channelization architecture for wide - band slow light , where a signal pulse is spatially dispersed according to frequency and an inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied in a such a way that the eit resonance frequency matches this dispersion . \n we found that by choosing the magnetic field gradient so the change in the two - photon resonance is slightly mismatched from the transverse dispersion of the signal , one could achieve eit and slow light conditions over a much larger bandwidth than with conventional slow light . \n this is essential for applications in many signal processing applications . \n we found that the diffusion of atoms in the field tended to reduce the delay - bandwidth products with bandwidth . in scheme b , \n this architecture should allow a delay - bandwidth greater than unity up to bandwidths of about @xmath2  mhz , where delays are @xmath3  ns ( see fig .  [ \n fig : pulsedrift ] ) . \n furthermore , we note either the pump field power or the magnetic field gradient can be used to control @xmath23 and thus the delay , making it a controllable time delay system . \n the buffer gas is important in reducing the diffusion of atoms from into regions of widely varying magnetic field and so higher buffer gas pressures are generally desirable for higher magnetic field gradients . \n however , we also found that higher pressures narrow the eit feature and can therefore increase the sensitivity of the dispersive slope and absorption profile to magnetic field gradients . \n balancing these two considerations leads to an optimal pressure , which we found this optimum to be near @xmath2410  torr for scheme a and @xmath25  torr for scheme b , for reasonable parameters . \n this optimal pressure was not very sensitive to the exact value of the gradient and other parameters . \n we also found that one generally benefited from tight focusing and high magnetic gradients .    in future work , it will be useful to consider the effects of atomic diffusion at a more microscopic level . \n in particular , it has been found that the model used here for diffusion out of the interaction region may overestimate the loss in real systems due to the fact that atoms can diffuse back into the interaction region @xcite . additionally , \n dynamical jumps of velocity of individual rubidium atoms upon collisions with the buffer gas has also been found to be an important consideration @xcite . \n finally , for implementation of this system , work is also needed to develop optimal methods for transversely dispersing the signal field and producing large linear magnetic field gradients . \n the role played by the differential phase shift in this system is interesting in its own right and merits further investigation . \n it is not entirely clear that the pulse will not be significantly more slowed than our analysis here shows , due to subtleties with the transverse dispersion of the signal . \n perhaps the signal dispersion or magnetic field could be engineered in such a way that the group velocity is governed by the _ local _ ( and much larger ) @xmath26 , rather than @xmath23 , allowing much larger delays . \n furthermore , it may be possible to combine this method with aspects of previous light storage experiments @xcite to significantly increase the delay times . \n the authors wish to thank irina novikova , mikhail lukin , and fredrik fatemi for helpful discussions . \n this work was supported by the office of naval research and the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) slow light program . \n rotondaro and g. p. perram , `` collisional broadening and shift of the rubidium @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines ( @xmath30 ) by rare gases , @xmath31 , '' \n _ j. quant . \n radiat . transfer _ * 57 * pp . \n 497507 , 1997 .", "StartTimeOffset": 870762505872, "RequestID": "759ed7214df92fea5e2af209f22a6e757c6fd837", "TotalTokens": 2419}

qubit gates required to implement a toffoli gate can be reduced by making one of the qubits in the circuit a qutrit ( or , in the general case , a qudit ) . \n the qutrit nature will only manifest during the gate - after the gate only the qubit levels will be occupied . \n remarkably , the additional space afforded by the extra level on one qubit provides a significant reduction in the resource requirements . \n this reduction is particularly dramatic for optical implementations where systems for applying the envisaged manipulations exist quite naturally . \n the paper is arranged in the following way . in the next section \n we introduce the scheme in an abstract , implementation independent , way and demonstrate its increased efficiency . in section iii \n we consider various optical realizations and then summarize and conclude in our final section . \n we begin by showing how a toffoli gate can be implemented using only three controlled sign ( c - s ) gates plus single qubit unitaries by allowing one of the qubits to be a qutrit . to our knowledge \n the most efficient implementation that has been described using only qubits involves five 2-qubit gates @xcite , @xcite . \n if we restrict ourselves to using only controlled sign ( c -

linearities . \n we then consider heralded non - deterministic gates based on measurement induced non - linearities . \n finally we consider demonstration gates based on post - selected measurement induced non - linearities . in each case \n we find considerable advantages to our qudit implementation . \n it has long been known that a strong cross - kerr non - linearity enables the implementation of universal optical quantum gates on the encoding we have just introduced @xcite . in particular a @xmath33 non - linear medium can be used to induce a cross - kerr effect between the relevant photon modes . \n ideally the cross - kerr effect will produce the unitary evolution @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 is the annihilation operator for one optical mode and @xmath36 another . \n consider the schematic set - up of fig.[fig3 ] . \n two polarization encoded qubits are converted into spatial dual rail qubits using polarizing beamsplitters . \n one mode from each of the qubits is sent through the cross - kerr material . \n the operation of this device on an arbitrary two qubit input state is given by the following evolution :    . \n pbs are polarizing beamsplitters.,width=302 ]    @xmath37    only when both modes entering the kerr material are occupied is a phase shift induced . if we now choose the strength of the non - linearity such that @xmath38 , the effect is to flip the sign of one element of the superposition producing a c - s gate . \n we can introduce a third spatial mode by using polarization rotation and polarizing beamsplitters and hence implement the control gate sequence required in section 1 as shown in fig.[fig4 ] . \n notice , from eq.[c - k ] , that this c - s gate implements the identity if both polarisation modes are unoccupied as required . \n only 3 @xmath33 interactions are required compared with the 5 or 6 that would be needed to implement the toffoli by the usual qubit gates . \n thus the same saving is made as discussed for the abstract case . \n gates by accessing an additional spatial mode . \n the half - wave plates ( @xmath39 ) are set at 22.5 degrees so as to act as hadamard gates and the c - s gates are implemented as per fig.[fig3].,width=302 ]    unfortunately kerr materials with the required strength of non - linearity are not presently available . as a result we now consider non - deterministic implementations based on measurement induced non - linearites . \n knill , laflamme and milburn have shown that scalable quantum gates can be implemented on optical qubits using linear elements , photon counters and photon sources @xcite . \n in particular , using linear optical elements , photon counters and an entangled photon pair as resources , it is possible to implement the optical c - s gate of the previous section non - deterministically with a probability of success of 1/4 @xcite . \n gate success is heralded by the photon counter signature obtained from the entangled pair after interaction with the qubits . \n if we used the direct method of implementing a toffoli via a sequence of c - s gates and single qubit unitaries we would require 6 entangled pairs and the probability of success would drop to @xmath40 . \n recently fiur@xmath41ek @xcite suggested a dedicated scheme requiring only 3 entangled pairs with a probability of success of @xmath42 . \n his method offered significant reduction in the number of entangled pairs required , but only a modest increase in the success probability . \n our method further reduces the number of additional entangled pairs and dramatically improves the success probability . in the following \n we will adapt our qutrit techniques to linear optics and obtain a heralded toffili gate requiring only 2 entangled pairs and working with a probability of success of @xmath43 . \n gates by accessing an additional spatial mode . \n the half - wave plates ( @xmath39 ) act as hadamard gates and the c - s gates are implemented using heralded non - deterministic gates . \n the sign change occurs on the @xmath44 component.,width=302 ]    the proposed set - up is shown in fig.[fig5 ] . \n it is similar to the deterministic gate set - up except that the c - s gates are assumed non - deterministic and the final two - qubit gate is replaced with a passive quantum filter . \n notice that , because we are also exploiting the polarization degree of freedom on the second spatial mode , the target is now effectively a ququit ( a 4-level quantum system ) . \n each 2 qubit gate works with a probability of success @xmath45 and requires an entangled pair for their operation . \n the filter succeeds with probability @xmath46 and does not require any ancilla qubits for its operation . \n the gate works in the following way : the state after the second c - s gate ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) is @xmath47 conditional on the correct photon counting outcomes from the previous two c - s gates ( probability of success @xmath48 ) . here \n @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to horizontally and vertically polarized single photon states respectively and @xmath51 refers to the vacuum state ( both polarization modes unoccupied ) , i.e @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . \n the initial state is as defined in eq.[3qubits ] and the ordering of the kets corresponds to top to bottom in fig.[fig5 ] . \n instead of using a third c - s gate as in the deterministic scheme , half - wave plates oriented at 22.5 degrees are applied to both target modes leading to the state @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 . \n the third and fourth modes are then recombined on a polarizing beam - splitter and the output mode is conditioned on a zero detection at the second output port of the polarizing beamsplitter . \n the probability of the zero detection is @xmath46 producing the conditional output state @xmath58 hence we have produced a t - s gate with the phase flip occurring on the @xmath59 component . \n the probability of success is @xmath60 . \n the proposed heralded circuit represents a five - photon experiment . \n such experiments are feasible , but difficult @xcite . in the following section we propose an in principle demonstration requiring only three photons . \n we now consider the construction of a post - selected gate . by this \n we mean a gate in which the photons act as their own ancilla , with success heralded by successful detection of a photon for each qubit , so - called coincidence detection . in this way a t - s gate requiring only the 3 photons needed to represent the 3 qubits could be constructed . \n for example , we could substitute post - selected c - s gates @xcite into the circuit of fig.[fig5 ] . \n these gates operate with a probability of success of @xmath61 so this would produce a post - selected t - s gate requiring only three photons and working with a probability of success of @xmath62 . \n however , it turns out the gate can be optimized for maximum success probability by using the techniques for chaining post - selected c - s gates described in ref.@xcite and in this way achieves a success probability of @xmath63 as we now describe . \n fiur@xmath41ek also considered this problem and proposed a different architecture with a success probability of about @xmath64 @xcite .    . \n the figure is represented , for clarity , as if all modes are spatial . in an experimental realization polarization modes \n would be utilized where ever possible.,width=340 ]    our proposed set - up is shown in fig.[fig6 ] . \n the important part of the circuit is the central string of two interferometers created from the top target mode ( @xmath65 ) . \n firstly , if this mode is unoccupied , photons can only emerge in all three output qubits if they remain in their respective modes . \n in this case no phase flip occurs . \n if the top target mode is occupied we must consider passage of the photon through the central interferometers . \n the first interferometer is anti - balanced if the bottom mode of the first control mode , @xmath66 , is unoccupied . as a result the photon couples completely into the bottom mode of the second interferometer with a phase flip . \n on the other hand , if the bottom mode of the first control is occupied there will be no phase change at the one third beamsplitter in the first interferometer due to two photon interference ( assuming a single photon exits from each port of the beamsplitter ) . in this case \n the first interferometer is balanced and the photon will couple completely into the top mode of the second interferometer . \n now we turn to the second interferometer . \n if the top mode of the second control , @xmath67 , is unoccupied then passage through the bottom mode of the interferometer induces a phase flip . but recall this will only occur if the photon has undergone a phase flip in the first interferometer . thus if the photon subsequently makes it into the output target mode it will not have undergone a phase flip . \n similarly if the target photon couples into the top mode of the second interferometer then it will not have undergone a phase flip in the first interferometer and will not undergo any further phase flip if it subsequently makes it to the output target mode , regardless of the state of @xmath67 . \n finally , if the photon couples into the bottom mode of the second interferometer ( meaning that @xmath66 had its bottom mode unoccupied , and the photon has picked up a phase flip ) , and @xmath67 has its top mode occupied , two - photon interference at the one third beamsplitter in the second interferometer then leads to no phase flip . thus if the target photon subsequently makes it to the output , this state component will carry a phase flip . summarizing , we find that the only state component that will carry a phase flip will be the one in which every qubit was in its logical zero state , where we take occupation of the top mode to be logical zero . \n the beamsplitter ratios are picked such that all state components have equal probability to lead to an event with a photon appearing in all the output qubits . \n that probability turns out to be @xmath63 . \n we have discussed the implementation of toffoli gates in circuits where one of the qubits is allowed to be a qutrit , or more generally a qudit and shown that increased gate efficiency can be achieved . in particular we showed that instead of 6 c - s gates , as required for a qubit only circuit , introducing a qutrit allows this to be reduced to 3 c - s gates . for an @xmath68-toffoli \n the required gate number is @xmath69 if a @xmath70 level qudit is available . \n we showed that for deterministic optical quantum processing a natural implementation method could be identified . for non - deterministic optical approaches further simplifications \n could be identified leading to a heralded toffoli gate with a probability of success of @xmath43 and a post - selected gate with a probability of success of @xmath63 . \n these latter results open the door to experimental optical demonstrations of toffoli gates in the near future and make small scale applications appear more feasible . \n it is interesting to note that a non - universal set of qubit gates , c - s plus hadamard ( an additional @xmath71 gate is required to make this a universal set ) , becomes universal , toffoli plus hadamard , when a single additional quantum level is introduced . \n we thank j. l. dodd , g. j. pryde and j. l. obrien for useful discussions . \n this work was supported by the australian research council and the dto - funded u.s.army research office contract no . \n w911nf-05 - 0397 . \n we note that a 3 two - qubit gate construction does exist for the so - called `` simplified toffoli gate '' that differs from the true toffoli gate by a non -

low - mass substellar analog to a classical t tauri star : it has broad , variable h@xmath3 emission due to accretion @xcite , mid - infrared excess due to a disk @xcite , ultraviolet emission due to hot accreted gas and warm circumstellar molecular hydrogen gas @xcite , and forbidden oxygen emission due to an outflow@xcite . despite its youth \n , it is not detected in x rays @xcite or radio @xcite , so is apparently relatively magnetically inactive . \n @xcite discovered a red companion ( 2m1207b ) , 5 magnitudes fainter in the k band . \n common proper motion confirms that this is a bound pair @xcite with a separation of @xmath4 . \n the secondary has a late - l spectral type @xcite . \n the inferred luminosity implies a mass @xmath5 @xcite , although @xcite suggest that the secondary is @xmath6 jupiter masses and viewed through an edge - on disk . \n because the twa is a relatively nearby , loose association there has been some confusion on the distance to the system . \n @xcite adopted a distance of 70 pc , on the basis of theoretical models of brown dwarf evolution . \n the hipparcos distance of tw hya itself is @xmath7 @xcite . \n @xcite used the moving cluster distance method to estimate the distance to 2m1207a to be @xmath8 pc , while @xcite used the same method , but an updated proper motion and a different group membership list to estimate @xmath9 pc . with uncertainties in the distance to the tw hya group of @xmath10 , firm conclusions about the natures of 2m1207 \n a and b , as well as other members of the group , have been elusive . \n \" here we present the first trigonometric parallax for 2m1207a . \n we confirm that it is a member of the tw hya association and put put constraints on the planet candidate 2m1207b . \n observations of 2m1207a in the @xmath11 band were obtained at the ctio 0.9 m telescope by the recons group via the smarts consortium . \n there are 54 parallax frames obtained over 2.14 years . \n the observing techniques and data reduction are fully described by @xcite . \n the resulting relative parallax is @xmath12 . \n @xmath13 photometry was obtained in july 2007 on five nights using the same telescope and reduced as described in @xcite . \n we estimate the correction to absolute parallax to be @xmath14 on the basis of photometry of the seven reference stars ( table 1 . ) \n the absolute parallax is therefore @xmath15 , for a distance of @xmath16 . \n the observed proper motion is @xmath17 at position angle @xmath18 degrees . \n the distance and proper motion of 2m1207 is consistent with twa membership . \n the position angle expected for motion towards @xcite s twa convergent point is 251.4 degrees , consistent with the measured proper motion . using @xcite s radial velocity of @xmath19 for 2m1207a , the ( u , v , w ) space velocities are ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 , consistent with mamajek s centroid group value of ( @xmath22 ) @xmath21 . in particular , the measured distance rules out any association with the background lower centaurus crux discussed by @xcite . using @xcite s measurements and our distance , the projected separation is @xmath23 a.u . \n _ the primary and its disk : _ \n @xcite found 2m1207a to be @xmath24 brown dwarf . because they used mamajek s value of 53 pc as the distance , this mass is not changed significantly by a distance increase of 2% : 2m1207a is best understood as a @xmath25 brown dwarf . \n the disk parameters derived by @xcite also remain unchanged because they used the same distance . \n the observed @xmath26 is consistent with the m8 spectral type and suggests the accretion rate at the time was @xmath27 ( see figure 4 of riaz & gizis 2007 . ) in figure  1 , we plot the h - r diagram of the local field population and 2m1207a . like the young m \n dwarf au mic ( gl 803 ) , 2m1207a lies @xmath28 magnitudes above the main sequence in the @xmath29 vs @xmath30 diagram , confirming youth .    _ \n the secondary : _ the usual procedure for analyzing 2m1207b is to assume a bolometric correction appropriate to late - l dwarfs , and then fit the luminosity to evolutionary models . \n @xcite estimated @xmath31 for 70 pc , @xcite estimated @xmath32 for 59 pc , and @xcite estimated @xmath33 for 53 pc . \n the trigonometric parallax would therefore support the last two estimates . \n @xcite , however , noted an inconsistency with this procedure . \n they argued that their h and k - band near - infrared spectra of 2m1207b were best fit by an effective temperature of @xmath34k . \n however , for the @xmath35 fits , the expected effective temperature is more like @xmath36 k. they suggest the best resolution is that 2m1207b is viewed through an edge - on gray disk , and that therefore it is more luminous than otherwise estimated . \n 2m1207b is then a @xmath37 planetary mass brown dwarf . \n the wide separation and mass ratio ( @xmath38 ) suggests this planetary - mass object did not form through core accretion @xcite .    without rejecting the possibility of a edge - on disk \n , we argue that available evidence does not rule out a low temperature for 2m1207b . in figure  2 , we plot colors and absolute magnitudes for late - m , l and t dwarfs with parallaxes @xcite . \n all the previous attempts to fit 2m1207b noted that it is red compared to field brown dwarfs , which can be attributed to having more dust in the photosphere . \n the faintness at j - band measured by @xcite ( @xmath39 ) is supported by the nicmos f110 m measurement of @xcite ( @xmath40 ) . \n @xcite measured @xmath41 and @xmath42 for 2m1207b . on the other hand , it is clear from mohanty et al.s ( 2007 ) ( @xmath43 ) spectrum that there is deep water absorption but little methane absorption . we conclude that 2m1207b has a spectral energy distribution that is l - type , but very red . \n reversing the usual procedure , in figure  3 we plot the required k - band bolometric correction required to fit the @xcite models at an age of 10 myr . observed bolometric corrections for field l and t dwarfs from @xcite as a function of temperature for an assumed age of @xmath44 are also shown . \n the l to t transition is believed to occur at @xmath45k , and can be marked in figure 3 by the change in bolometric corrections . \n the transition is related to the change in dust properties in photosphere ( see kirkpatrick 2005 for a review ) , and some of the first fits to late - l dwarf spectra gave incorrect values of @xmath46k due to the failure of cooler models to resemble the real spectra . \n this simply reflects the extreme difficulty of modelling the temperature range 1200 - 1400k , and indeed in light of this , no models succeed in fully explaining both the blue hook and brightening in j - band of field t dwarfs . \n analysis of the luminosity ( see kirkpatrick ) has been the most reliable way to derive temperatures . \n this history suggests to us that the existing fit must be viewed with caution  while apparently very good , it is inconsistent with the absolute magnitudes unless an edge - on disk is invoked . \n although mohanty et al . show that the dusty models do fit the observed color of 2m1207b , it must be noted that the same models predict very red colors for field l dwarfs , which are not observed . \n indeed , @xcite note that `` the dusty and cond models represent extreme situations which bracket the more likely intermediate case resulting from complex , and presently not understood , thermochemical and dynamical processes . '' \n we think it plausible that existing dusty models fail to properly model the dust in low surface gravity dwarfs , and that 2m1207b might therefore be @xmath47k , as expected for the @xmath48 model . as an example how this might occur , \n we note that @xcite invokes a parameter , @xmath49 , that characterizes the thickness of the clouds , and argues that the wide range of colors for field objects near @xmath50k is due to changes in this parameter in otherwise similar brown dwarfs . in one case , @xcite is able to fit an l6.5 dwarf with @xmath51k or @xmath52k ( without methane absorption ) by varying @xmath49 by only 100k . \n evidently an extremely red color like 2m1207b could be obtained for a low @xmath53 with @xmath54k  that is , a very thick cloud compared to field l dwarfs . \n this would be the opposite situation from field t dwarfs , where the cloud becomes thinner ( @xmath49 increases . ) similarly , in the @xcite models , a parameter , @xmath55 , represents sedimentation , and redder colors are produced by smaller values of @xmath55 ( i.e. , less precipitation and thicker clouds . ) \n regardless of how the proper degree of dust is produced , if our speculation that @xmath56k is correct , the implied @xmath57 would require that more of 2m1207b s energy is escaping at wavelengths longward of 3 microns than in field l dwarfs . \n in any case , the observed colors and spectrum do not match any field brown dwarf , so there is not much doubt that atmosphere is dustier , but a low temperature remains speculative . \n unfortunately , there is a third problem with estimating the mass of 2m1207b . \n @xcite have investigated the dependence of the structure models to the initial conditions , and found that the luminosity is very sensitive to the initial conditions for up to 100 myr . in specifically discussing the case of 2m1207b \n , they note that for a `` warm start '' rather than usually assumed `` hot start , '' the best fit mass is @xmath58 rather than @xmath59 . \n the situation , therefore , is that given the now known distance , 2m1207b may be @xmath60 _ if _ current structural models are correct , the red color implies a cool temperature , and there is no disk , but both @xcite and @xcite present plausible scenarios in which the mass is higher . \n we have measured the trigonometric parallax of 2m1207 and found that the distance and space motion are consistent , as expected , with membership in the tw hydrae association . indeed \n , 2m1207 now has a more precise distance determination than tw hya itself . \n there are no difficulties in modelling the primary : it is a @xmath1 mass brown dwarf that is accreting from a circumstellar disk . \n the faint secondary remains problematic . because we do not know the appropriate initial conditions , \n do not have a model atmosphere that reproduces the colors , and do not know whether or not it is observed through a disk , a case can be made that 2m1207b s mass is as low as @xmath61 or as high as @xmath62 . our best estimate is @xmath48 if 2m1207b is not viewed through a disk . \n further study of this planetary mass object is needed ; we particularly need to know if it has an effective temperature of @xmath63k , @xmath64k , or even less . \n we thank eric mamajek and davy kirkpatrick for useful discussions . \n we thank charlie finch for his initial reduction of the parallax data . \n we thank the anonymous referee for a discussion of the tsuji paper . \n we also thank the members of the smarts consortium , without whom the parallax observations could not have been made . \n support for this work was provided by nasa research grant nng06gj03 g . \n the recons parallax program has been supported by the nasa / nsf nstars project , nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) , the national science foundation ( grant ast 05 - 07711 ) , and georgia state university . research has benefitted from the m , l , and t dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org and maintained by chris gelino , davy kirkpatrick , and adam burgasser . \n rrr @xmath65 & @xmath66 & + @xmath67 & @xmath68 & + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & + @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + @xmath74 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath80 ( mas ) & @xmath81 + @xmath82 ( mas ) & @xmath83 + @xmath84 ( mas ) & @xmath85 + @xmath29 & @xmath86 & + @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 + @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 + @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 + mass ( @xmath96 ) & @xmath97 & @xmath98 +", "StartTimeOffset": 895508891934, "RequestID": "aa859f058ab9dd54f3238723e0cb97f280d87eb1", "TotalTokens": 3192}

traps@xcite , can be studied in optical lattices when two or more atoms occupy a single lattice site . \n this requires a technique for achieving much higher atomic densities than possible in optical lattices at present . to overcome the density limit that is due to light induced interactions between atoms optical lattices \n have been proposed @xcite , in which the fluorescence rate for the trapped atoms is strongly reduced . \n they are referred to as dark or gray optical lattices and have been demonstrated @xcite using a scheme that requires a static magnetic field .    in this paper \n we describe and experimentally investigate a new type of dark ( or gray ) optical lattice that utilizes merely an optical field . \n the lattice combines efficient accumulation of the atoms in the lowest energy level of the optical potential with a reduced fluorescence rate for the localized atoms . \n we have studied @xcite the adiabatic release of atoms from the dark optical lattice both theoretically and experimentally with the result that the band populations are indeed mapped on the corresponding momentum intervals of the free atom , as it was suggested by kastberg _ \n @xcite for adiabatic cooling in a bright optical lattice . \n this population mapping is accurate , if optical pumping between different bands is negligible during the adiabatic release . in an experiment with a slow beam of rb atoms \n we utilize this population mapping to measure the band populations of the purely optical dark lattice . for a wide range of parameters we find excellent agreement between the measured band populations and theoretically calculated values . \n this establishes population mapping by adiabatic release as an experimental tool to investigate the interaction of atoms with a spatially periodic potential . \n to create the optical lattice we use a standing wave consisting of two counter propagating waves with mutually orthogonal linear polarizations ( lin@xmath3lin ) . in this configuration \n the polarization changes periodically from @xmath4 to @xmath5 polarization along the standing wave axis . \n detuning and intensity are chosen such , that the laser field couples a ground state manifold with integer total angular momentum @xmath0 to two excited state manifolds with angular momenta @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n [ lattice ] illustrates the situation for the simplest example of a @xmath6 transition pair . \n the interaction of the oscillating atomic dipole with the standing wave causes spatially periodic light shifts in the atomic ground state manifold . in regions of purely @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) polarized light the atoms are optically pumped into the @xmath9=@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ground state , which is decoupled from the light field and experiences no light shift or optical excitation . at locations of linearly polarized light all ground state sublevels \n are coupled to excited states@xcite . in this case \n all ground state sublevels are light shifted towards higher energies , if the laser field is tuned to a frequency higher than both transition frequencies ( blue detuning ) . in this semi classical picture of point like atoms \n one expects that the atoms are cooled by a sisyphus mechanism@xcite and accumulated in dark states at locations of pure @xmath4-polarization . in a picture which treats the atomic motion quantum \n mechanically the atomic wave function always has a finite spatial extent and can not be completely decoupled from the light field . \n therefore a dark ( gray ) optical lattice with a low fluorescence rate and long coherence times is formed @xcite . \n low fluorescence rates for the localized atoms are achieved , even if the lattice is operated at small detunings . \n the situation is qualitatively similar to that of magnetic field induced dark optical lattices , where localized dark states are created by combining a standing wave with a magnetic field @xcite . \n we have also investigated a second configuration@xcite , in which a purely optical dark lattice is formed in a similar way on a @xmath12 transition pair with integer angular momentum @xmath0 . \n the laser field forms a lin@xmath3lin standing wave and is tuned between the two transitions . to understand the underlying mechanism \n consider first the coupling of the laser field only to the @xmath13 transition . \n for any polarization and for any position in space one substate @xmath14 of the ground state manifold is not coupled to the light field . \n all other substates of the ground state manifold couple to the light and are light shifted towards higher energies , because the laser field is tuned to a frequency higher than the transition frequency . \n now complete the picture and consider additionally the coupling of the laser field to the @xmath2 excited state manifold . here \n the laser field is detuned towards lower frequency and introduces additional spatially varying light shifts towards lower energies . \n this affects all substates of the ground state manifold . \n the state @xmath14 , which so far was unshifted , undergoes the largest light shift towards lower energy . as a result \n a dark optical lattice is formed , since optical pumping on the ( far detuned ) @xmath15 transition is negligible . in spite of low optical pumping dynamics on the @xmath15 transition \n the coupling to the @xmath13 transition allows for an efficient sisyphus cooling@xcite of the atoms to the minima of the lowest optical potential . \n it has been suggested in recent experimental work@xcite that the populations of an optical lattice can be directly experimentally measured by an adiabatic release of the atoms from the lattice and a subsequent measurement of the resulting atomic momentum distribution . \n [ latticerelease ] shows schematically the band structure of the lattice during the adiabatic release . \n the plot on the left side corresponds to a situation of high laser field intensity , _ \n i.  e.  _ of deep optical potentials . \n the atoms are tightly bound to the lattice sites and tunneling between neighboring potential wells is negligible . therefore the lowest energy bands are flat@xcite . for lower field intensity ( central plot ) \n the wave functions of neighboring wells can overlap and the energy bands have a corresponding curvature . \n if the field is completely switched off and no lattice interaction is present , the band structure is that of a free particle . \n the segments of the energy - momentum - parabola @xmath16 are plotted on the right side in the reduced zone scheme . \n if the release is fully adiabatic , the population from the lowest ( first ) band is mapped exactly to the momentum interval between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the second band will be mapped to the intervals @xmath19 to @xmath17 and @xmath20 to @xmath21 . \n the @xmath22-th band will be mapped on the @xmath23 to @xmath24 and the @xmath25 to @xmath26 momentum intervals . \n nonadiabaticity and incoherent redistribution of the atoms during the release will modify this mapping . \n the assignment between the band populations of the lattice and the momentum intervals of the free atoms will be less accurate . \n we have performed a full quantum monte carlo simulation with a time dependent laser intensity to quantitatively verify the mapping between the stationary population distribution of the lattice and the momentum distribution of the free atom . \n for the three lowest energy bands the deviations between the band populations and the calculated fraction of atoms to be found in the corresponding momentum interval are below 1% @xcite . \n for an experimental demonstration of the purely optical dark lattice and the band population measurement , we have performed an experiment @xcite with the apparatus described in refs.@xcite . \n the purely optical dark lattice is realized on the @xmath27 transitions of the @xmath28rb @xmath29-line . \n a pulsed beam of cold rubidium atoms is directed vertically downwards and crosses a standing wave field ( lattice field ) , which induces the optical potentials of the dark lattice ( fig . \n [ experimentsetup ] ) . \n the atoms are cooled into the lattice sites and are then gradually released from the optical potential due to the gaussian shape of the lattice field . below the lattice field the momentum distribution of the atoms is measured with a resolution of one third of the photon recoil . \n the lattice field is induced by a standing wave oriented along the @xmath30-axis and has a frequency tuned @xmath31mhz to the blue of the @xmath32 transition . \n the hyperfine - splitting between the two excited states of the @xmath29-line is @xmath33 . \n correspondingly the detuning with reference to the @xmath34 transition is @xmath35 . \n the incoming beam of the standing wave is linearly polarized along the @xmath36-axis and the reflected beam is polarized along the y - axis . \n the gaussian waists of the beams are @xmath37 mm in @xmath36-direction and @xmath38 mm in @xmath39-direction . \n this corresponds to a 0.4ms time of flight of the atoms ( 3.2 m/s ) through the waist @xmath40 . \n the region of the lattice field is shielded against stray magnetic fields to well below 0.5 mg . \n a second standing wave overlaps the lattice field . \n it is tuned to the @xmath41 transition of the @xmath42-line and optically pumps the atoms into the @xmath43 ground state .    to determine the momentum distribution we place a pinhole of @xmath44 m diameter 5 mm below the standing wave axis . \n the atoms that pass through the pinhole expand horizontally in two dimensions according to their transversal momentum . \n a transversal momentum of @xmath45 is translated into @xmath46 m transversal displacement in a plane 9.6 cm below the pinhole . \n the spatial distribution of the atoms in this plane is imaged by recording the fluorescence in a sheet of light with a ccd camera . \n the sheet of light is formed by a standing wave which is resonant with the @xmath47 closed cycle transition of the @xmath42-line . \n for each set of parameters we accumulate 200 single shot images and subtract the separately measured background . to obtain a one dimensional momentum distribution in @xmath30-direction \n we integrate the two dimensional distributions along the @xmath39-axis . \n we count the number of atoms detected in the momentum intervals @xmath17 to @xmath18 and @xmath19 to @xmath48 corresponding to the populations in the lowest energy band and the two lowest energy bands , respectively . \n these experimentally obtained band populations are plotted as data points in fig . \n [ popula ] . \n the light shift is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the resonant saturation parameter on the @xmath51 transition in the center of the gaussian beam . \n the data points were recorded for several intensities and fixed detuning . \n the solid lines represent the ( steady state ) band populations in the lattice calculated @xcite for the center - of - beam parameters using a rate equation approach . \n the experimentally measured populations and the calculated steady state populations agree within 5% over the full range of investigated parameters . \n this is remarkable , because the calculation is based only on the detunings and the intensities in the center of the gaussian beam and the comparison involves no fit parameter . \n small deviations for the experimental values towards higher ground state population are found for high light shift parameters @xmath52 . \n this can be attributed to the small but finite spontaneous emission probability during the release of the atoms . \n it mainly affects energetically higher lying states and transfers additional population to the ground state . \n in conclusion , we have theoretically and experimentally studied purely optical dark optical lattices which combine low photon scattering rates with a high population in the lowest energy bands . \n long coherence times in this bands allow for adiabatic manipulations and for the observation of non - dissipative effects in periodic potentials @xcite . \n the lattice is formed by coupling an atomic ground state to two excited states . \n the atoms are trapped at locations of purely circular polarization which permits an extension of the scheme to two and three dimensions using the same field configurations as for bright optical lattices @xcite . \n the adiabatic population mapping between the energy bands and free particle momentum intervals allows a direct determination of the band populations . \n we measured the band populations over a wide range of lattice parameters . \n the quantitative agreement of the measured band populations with the calculated results shows that adiabatic mapping is a promising tool to study the density dependence of the band populations in an optical lattice . \n we are

{"ContextTokens": 3782, "GeneratedTokens": 190, "SynthesizedBody": "gesture and human action recognition from visual information is an active research topic in computer vision and machine learning . \n it has many potential applications including human - computer interactions and robotics . \n since first work  @xcite on action recognition from depth data captured by commodity depth sensors ( e.g. , kinect ) in 2010 , many methods  @xcite for action recognition have been proposed based on specific hand - crafted feature descriptors extracted from depth or skeleton data . with the recent development of deep learning , \n a few methods have also been developed based on convolutional neural networks ( convnets )  @xcite and recurrent neural networks ( rnns )  @xcite . \n however , most of the works on gesture / action recognition reported to date focus on the classification of individual gestures or actions by assuming that instances of individual gestures and actions have been isolated or segmented from a video or a stream of depth maps / skeletons before the classification . in the cases of continuous recognition , the input stream usually contains unknown numbers , unknown orders and unknown boundaries of gestures or actions and both segmentation and recognition have to be solved at the same time . \n there are three common approaches to continuous recognition . \n the first approach is to tackle the segmentation and classification of the gestures or actions separately and sequentially . \n the key advantages of this approach are that different features can be used for segmentation and classification and existing classification methods can be leveraged . \n the disadvantages are that both segmentation and classification could be the bottleneck of the systems and they can not be optimized together . \n the second approach is to apply classification to a sliding temporal window and aggregate the window based classification to achieve final segmentation and classification . \n one of the key challenges in this approach is the difficulty of setting the size of sliding window because durations of different gestures or actions can vary significantly . \n the third approach is to perform the segmentation and classification simultaneously . \n this paper adopts the first approach and focuses on robust classification using convnets that are insensitive to inaccurate segmentation of gestures . \n specifically , individual gestures are first segmented based on quantity of movement ( qom )  @xcite from a stream of depth maps . for each segmented gesture , an improved depth motion map ( idmm ) \n is constructed from its sequence of depth maps . \n convnets are used to learn the dynamic features from the idmm for effective classification . \n [ fig : framework ] shows the framework of the proposed method . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows . \n section ii briefly reviews the related works on video segmentation and gesture / action recognition based on depth and deep learning . \n details of the proposed method are presented in section iii . \n experimental results on the dataset provided by the challenge are reported in section iv , and section v concludes the paper . \n there are many methods proposed for segmenting individual gestures from a video . \n the popular and widely used method employs dynamic time warping  ( dtw ) to decide the delimitation frames of individual gestures  @xcite . \n difference images are first obtained by subtracting two consecutive grey - scale images and each difference image is partitioned into a grid of @xmath1 cells . each cell \n is then represented by the average value of pixels within this cell . \n the matrix of the cells in a difference image is flattened as a vector called motion feature and calculated for each frame in the video excluding the final frame . \n this results in a @xmath2 matrix of motion features for a video with @xmath3 frames . \n the motion feature matrix is extracted from both test video and training video which consists of multiple gestures . \n the two matrices are treated as two temporal sequences with each motion feature as a feature vector at an instant of time . \n the distance between two feature vectors is defined as the negative euclidean distance and a matrix containing dtw distances ( measuring similarity between two temporal sequences ) between the two sequences is then calculated and analysed by viterbi algorithm  @xcite to segment the gestures . \n another category of gesture segmentation methods from a multi - gesture video is based on appearance . upon the general assumption that the _ start _ and \n _ end _ frames of adjacent gestures are similar , correlation coefficients  @xcite and k - nearest neighbour algorithm with histogram of oriented gradient  ( hog )  @xcite are used to identify the _ start _ and _ end _ frames of gestures . \n jiang et al . \n @xcite proposed a method based on quantity of movement  ( qom ) by assuming the same _ start _ pose among different gestures . \n candidate delimitation frames are chosen based on the global qom . \n after a refining stage which employs a sliding window to keep the frame with minimum qom in each windowing session , the _ start _ and _ end _ frames are assumed to be the remained frames . \n this paper adopts the qom based method and its details will be presented in section  [ subsec : video - seg ] .      with microsoft kinect sensors \n researchers have developed methods for depth map - based action recognition . \n @xcite sampled points from a depth map to obtain a bag of 3d points to encode spatial information and employ an expandable graphical model to encode temporal information @xcite . \n yang et al . @xcite stacked differences between projected depth maps as a depth motion map ( dmm ) and then used hog to extract relevant features from the dmm . \n this method transforms the problem of action recognition from spatio - temporal space to spatial space . in @xcite , \n a feature called histogram of oriented 4d normals ( hon4d ) was proposed ; surface normal is extended to 4d space and quantized by regular polychorons . following this method , yang and tian @xcite cluster hypersurface normals and form the polynormal which can be used to jointly capture the local motion and geometry information . \n super normal vector ( snv ) is generated by aggregating the low - level polynormals . in @xcite , \n a fast binary range - sample feature was proposed based on a test statistic by carefully designing the sampling scheme to exclude most pixels that fall into the background and to incorporate spatio - temporal cues . \n existing deep learning approach can be generally divided into four categories based on how the video is represented and fed to a deep neural network . \n the first category views a video either as a set of still images  @xcite or as a short and smooth transition between similar frames  @xcite , each color channel of the images is fed to one channel of a convnet . although obviously suboptimal , considering the video as a bag of static frames performs reasonably well . \n the second category represents a video as a volume and extends convnets to a third , temporal dimension  @xcite replacing 2d filters with 3d equivalents . \n so far , this approach has produced little benefits , probably due to the lack of annotated training data . \n the third category treats a video as a sequence of images and feeds the sequence to an rnn  @xcite . an rnn is typically considered as memory cells , which are sensitive to both short as well as long term patterns . \n it parses the video frames sequentially and encodes the frame - level information in their memory . \n however , using rnns did not give an improvement over temporal pooling of convolutional features  @xcite or over hand - crafted features . \n the last category represents a video as one or multiple compact images and adopts available trained convnet architectures for fine - tuning  @xcite . \n this category has achieved state - of - the - art results of action recognition on many rgb and depth / skeleton datasets . \n the proposed gesture classification in this paper falls into the last category . \n the proposed method consists of two major components , as illustrated in fig . \n [ fig : framework ] : video segmentation and construction of improved depth motion map ( idmm ) from a sequence of depth maps as the input to convnets . given a sequence of depth maps consisting of multiple gestures , the _ start _ and _ end _ frames of each gesture are identified based on quantity of movement ( qom )  @xcite . \n then , one idmm is constructed by accumulating the absolute depth difference between current frame and the _ start _ frame for each gesture segment . \n the idmm goes through a pseudo - color coding process to become a pseudo - rgb image as an input to a convnet for classification . \n the main objective of pseudo - color coding is to enchance the motin pattern captured by the idmm . in the rest of this section , video segmentation , construction of idmm , pseudo - color coding of idmm , and training of the convnets \n are explained in detail .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n this paper presents an effective yet simple method for continuous gesture recognition using only depth map sequences . \n depth sequences are first segmented so that each segmentation contains only one gesture and a convnet is used for feature extraction and classification . \n the proposed construction of idmm enables the use of available pre - trained models for fine - tuning without learning afresh . \n experimental results on chalearn lap congd dataset verified the effectiveness of the proposed method . \n how to exactly extract the neutral pose and fuse different modalities to improve the accuracy will be our future work . \n the authors would like to thank nvidia corporation for the donation of a tesla k40 gpu card used in this challenge . \n 10 w.  li , z.  zhang , and z.  liu , `` action recognition based on a bag of 3d points , '' in _ proc . \n ieee computer society conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops ( cvprw ) _ , 2010 , pp . \n j.  wang , z.  liu , y.  wu , and j.  yuan , `` mining actionlet ensemble for action recognition with depth cameras , '' in _ proc . \n ieee conference on computer vision and pattern recognition ( cvpr ) _ , 2012 , pp . \n 12901297 . \n x.  yang , c.  zhang , and y.  tian , `` recognizing actions using depth motion maps -

{"ContextTokens": 1349, "GeneratedTokens": 204, "SynthesizedBody": "in a neutrino point source analysis one focuses on obtaining the best angular resolution by observing muon tracks inside the detector volume . \n the expected signal stems from charged - current interactions of muon neutrinos and a small fraction of tau neutrinos . \n the background consists primarily of high energy muons , produced in the atmosphere in extended air showers , with a much lower but irreducible contribution of atmospheric neutrinos from the same interactions . in icecube \n [ ] , cherenkov light from these events is detected in digital optical modules , with 60 of these arranged vertically on a string . \n a total of 80 strings will be installed until 2011 , situated at a depth of 1.45 to 2.45  km inside the glacial ice at the geographic south pole . a standard method to suppress atmospheric muons , reaching the detector from above , \n is a cut on the reconstructed track direction at the horizon , which allows icecube to cover only the northern hemisphere , as presented in [ ] . inside the earth , \n the neutrino - nucleus cross section rises with energy and prevents the majority of up - going neutrinos with energies above a pev to reach the vicinity of the detector . in our extended analysis , \n down - going tracks are included and their energy is used to separate signal neutrinos from atmospheric background , based on the softer spectrum of the latter . \n different zenith dependent cuts make it possible to perform a point source search above and below the horizon . \n the analysis presented here used icecube data collected between may 2007 and april 2008 ( 276 days ) with 22 strings . \n an on - line filter stream provided an all - sky muon track sample with a rate of @xmath0 hz , and elaborate direction reconstructions were performed off - line . \n down - going events with declinations smaller than @xmath1 were rejected due the small interaction volume above the detector leading to very low signal expectations . \n the steeply rising muon background above the horizon is dominated by multiple muons forming so - called bundles . to separate them from neutrino - induced single muon tracks , \n a selection cut based on the resolution of individual photon pulses in an optical module was applied . \n the threshold values were a function of the reconstructed zenith angle and energy for each event . \n employing parameters depending on the quality of the fitted track , similar to those in [ ] , the background was reduced further . by systematically testing combinations of threshold values in dependence of zenith angle \n , these cuts were optimized for the best sensitivity considering two template spectra , a standard @xmath2 and a harder @xmath3 power law of the neutrino energy @xmath4 . \n + the resulting sample is composed of 1877 events between @xmath1 and @xmath5 . \n simulations show that the down - going events from the southern hemisphere are dominated by atmospheric muons , while the up - going tracks are mainly induced by atmospheric neutrinos . \n related to zenith dependent signal and background expectations , the cuts allow for an excess of events in the region just above the horizon . the neutrino signal efficiency , as estimated from simulations , improves with energy and effectively defines a threshold rising from the tev regime in the northern hemisphere to pev energies in the south . compared to previous point source analyses in icecube  [ ] , \n an improved direction reconstruction was used . \n it is a likelihood algorithm that uses not only the timing information of the first pulse in each optical module , but also the total charge to account for the probability of multiple photoelectrons from individually scattered photons . \n this is particularly important for neutrino energies above 100 tev , where photons from secondaries produced along the muon track are an important addition to the light yield . \n the median angular resolution for the final event selection is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) under the assumption of an @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) spectrum . \n we performed a binned scan of the entire sky map and also tested a list of pre - defined directions , with a search bin radius of @xmath8 . \n details on the method for the all - sky search are given in [ ] . \n the major difference is that in this work we extended the scan to the southern sky . \n no significant deviation from the background -

defined list of source candidates was used , aiming at reducing the effects of trial factors . from the confirmed active galactic nuclei ( agn ) \n listed in the third egret catalog  [ ] we selected 23 bright blazars by imposing thresholds for average ( maximum ) photon fluxes of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ph @xmath13s@xmath14 . \n two additional blazars reported in november 2008 were also included , see [ ] , [ ] , as well as two close - by agn , m87 and centaurus a , and the center of our galaxy , sgr a*. no significant excess above background was found for any of these candidates . \n the upward fluctuation with the highest significance occurs for pks 1622 - 297 with 1 event observed and 0.3 expected . from background simulation using randomized data , we expect a similar or more significant result from any of the sources in 98% of all cases . \n the limits given in table  [ sourcelist ] , calculated according to  [ ] , are preliminary and do not yet include systematic uncertainties \n . a previous point source search with better sensitivity for the northern sky has been performed , and it was decided a priori that it gives the final results for the up - going region ( dec . \n @xmath15 ) [ ] . \n a new approach to neutrino point source searches extends both below and above the horizon and increases the reach of icecube above pev energies and to the southern sky . \n results from data taken with 22 strings are consistent with the background -

{"ContextTokens": 3627, "GeneratedTokens": 111, "SynthesizedBody": "the systematic investigation of melting kinetics in alloys , and particular in eutectic and peritectic systems , is much less developed than the investigation of solidification ( for a recent review on solidification see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . \n microstructures , being at the center of materials science and engineering , are formed during the solidification process and , in this sense , the melting process is less attractive for practical applications . \n however , the interfacial pattern selection problem during the melting process might be very interesting . \n for example , in our previous publications @xcite we discussed a free boundary problem for two moving interfaces that strongly interact via the diffusion field in the liquid layer between them . \n this problem arises in the context of liquid film migration during the partial melting of solid alloys @xcite and could also be relevant to the sintering process in the presence of the liquid phase @xcite . for the melting of one - phase alloys to proceed in this way \n , the local equilibrium concentrations have to be different for the two interfaces providing the driving force for the process . \n it is by now well accepted ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the difference of the equilibrium states at the melting and solidification fronts is due to the coherency strain energy which is important only at the melting front because of the sharp concentration profile ahead the moving melting front . \n the other source of elastic deformations during the melting process , even in pure materials , is the density difference between the solid and the liquid phase . \n if the melt inclusion is entirely inside the solid matrix , inhomogeneous elastic deformations inevitably arise . \n the peculiar behavior of the melting kinetics in such systems was discussed in @xcite . \n the main purpose of this paper is to describe the problem of contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems along the boundary between two solid phases ( see fig . 1 and fig . \n the local concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces in such systems are different because of the chemical difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases , and weak coherency strain effects are not so important here . if we also assume that the liquid phase extends up to the sample surfaces , the mentioned elastic deformations due the density difference are not important either , because a weak hydrodynamic flow inside the liquid phase compensates the density difference . \n we concentrate here on the velocity selection problem during the melting along the solid - solid interface . \n the presence of the triple junction ( see fig.1b and fig . \n 2b ) plays a crucial role in this process . in the classical problem of dendritic growth , where the triple junction is not present , the velocity selection is controlled by tiny singular effects of the anisotropy of the surface energy ( for review see @xcite ) . \n the triple junction produces a very strong perturbation of the liquid - solid interfaces and controls the velocity selection . \n the other important difference compared to the classical dendritic problem is that the kinetics of the contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems is controlled by the diffusion inside the needle - like liquid phase and not in the outer phase . \n all features of the contact melting process mentioned so far are common for both systems . \n there is , however , important difference between eutectic and peritectic systems . in the eutectic system ( fig . \n 1 ) both interfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 are melting fronts while in the peritectic system ( fig.2 ) the @xmath0 interface is a solidification front if the temperature @xmath4 is above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 . \n in other words , during the melting of peritectic systems the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies . \n it means that , additionally to the formation of the liquid phase , the polymorphic transition @xmath6 occurs . in this context \n the contact melting in the peritectic system is similar to the process of liquid film migration , mentioned above , where the liquid film is also located between melting and solidification fronts .    finally , we discuss in this paper the evolution of the solid - solid interface due to surface diffusion . \n this process inevitably arises due to the deviation of the interface from a flat configuration in the vicinity of a triple junction . \n we show , however , that surface diffusion does not play a controlling role in the melting kinetics , and only allows for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface . \n we consider the two - dimensional problem of the simultaneous melting of two eutectic phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 along the boundary between them . the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction \n are schematically presented in fig.1 . \n the compositions of the solid phases are close to their equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the eutectic temperature . \n we assume that diffusion in the solid phases is very slow . \n the temperature of the sample , @xmath4 , is slightly above the eutectic temperature @xmath9 ( for the notations see fig.1 ) . at small overheating the concentration field in the liquid \n , @xmath10 obeys the laplace equation @xmath11 we assume local equilibrium at the liquid - solid interfaces . \n then the concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces are : @xmath12 here the notations of the different concentrations are clear from the phase diagram ( fig . \n 1a ) ; the capillary lengths are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface energy of the @xmath15 interface , @xmath16 is atomic volume which is assumed to be the same in all three phases , @xmath17 is the free energy of the liquid phase per atom and @xmath18 is its second derivative with respect to @xmath19 . \n the mass balance conditions at these interfaces read : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase . \n ( [ equil])-([mass ] ) are written for the case of small angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the triple junction . \n this leads to the small angles along the whole interface , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n in this case we can use the so - called `` lubrication '' approximation for the solution of the laplace equation . in this approximation one \n neglects the derivatives with respect to the `` slow '' @xmath27 variable as compared with the derivatives with respect to the `` fast '' @xmath28 variable :    @xmath29    the slow variable functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be found from the boundary condition , eq . \n ( [ equil ] ) : @xmath32 from eqs . \n ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ concentration ] ) we find the following relations , @xmath33 which together with eqs . \n ( [ constant ] ) and ( [ equil ] ) form a closed system of two second order differential equations for the front profiles @xmath34 and @xmath35 . \n they are subject to the boundary conditions at the triple junction : @xmath36 @xmath37 ( see fig . \n it follows from eqs . \n ( [ prof ] ) and ( [ bound1 ] ) that @xmath38 where @xmath39 . \n we also find from eq . \n ( [ bound2 ] ) that @xmath40 the relation ( [ match ] ) allows to eliminate the profile @xmath41 and to write the closed equation for the profile @xmath42 . \n moreover , one can integrate this equation once with respect to @xmath27 and finally obtains a nonlinear first order differential equation for the profile @xmath42 : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the dimensionless overheating above the eutectic temperature . \n let us introduce the dimensionless coordinates : @xmath45 then eq . ( [ first ] ) takes the form @xmath46 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 : @xmath48 the solution of this equation starts at the origin with @xmath49 and should have parabolic asymptotics @xmath50 for large values of @xmath51 . \n it turns out that such a smooth solution exists only if the parameter @xmath52 . in other words \n , this is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem which leads to the selection of the velocity @xmath53 : @xmath54 we see that the posed problem has a relatively simple , essentially analytical solution . \n the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction are schematically presented in fig.2 . \n the temperature of the sample is @xmath4 and slightly above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 ( for the notations see fig.2a ) . \n overheating is assumed to be small and the compositions of the solid phases are close to the equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the peritectic temperature . \n ( [ laplace])-([mass ] ) are valid also for the peritectic system where @xmath55 should be replace by @xmath56 and in the second equation in ( [ equil ] ) one should change the sign in front of the capillary term , @xmath57 this reflects the fact that the equilibrium between the @xmath3-phase and the liquid phase corresponds to the negative slope of the liquidus line for the peritectic phase diagram and to the positive slope for the eutectic diagram . as a result , eqs . \n ( [ match])-([angle ] ) remain the same and eq . \n ( [ first ] ) is replaced by @xmath58    we note that the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the peritectic system ( fig . \n 2 ) are negative if we define them in the same way as for the eutectic system : @xmath61 thus , replacing @xmath62 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 by @xmath65 , we recover eq . \n ( [ basic ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 finally , for the steady - state velocity we obtain @xmath68 as we have already noted in the introduction , the interface @xmath69 represents now a solidification front . during the melting , in the peritectic system , \n the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies . \n in addition to the formation of the liquid phase the polymorphic transition @xmath6 takes place . \n we have already mentioned that diffusion along the solid - solid interface plays an important role allowing the necessary rotation of the structure in the vicinity of the triple junction , @xmath70 ( see fig . \n 1b and fig . \n at the same time , far away from the triple junction , the solid - solid interface is parallel to the @xmath27 axis ( @xmath71 ) .    the corresponding surface diffusion equation which describes the @xmath72 interface has been discussed in @xcite and , essentially , it is given by the classical mullins equation @xcite : @xmath73 in this description the diffusion takes place inside of layer of the thickness @xmath74 ( diffusion coefficient is @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 is the corresponding capillary length : @xmath77 } { 2(c_{\\beta}-c_{\\alpha})^2f_{\\alpha}''(c_{\\alpha})f_{\\beta}''(c_{\\beta})}.\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is the free energy of the @xmath79 phase per atom . \n the solution of this equation which has a proper behavior at large values of @xmath27 and satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath84/q;\\,\\,\\,\\,b=[\\kappa(0)/q+\\theta]/(q\\sqrt{3}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 . \n this solution is uniquely defined because the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath22 and @xmath86 are known from the solution given in the previous sections . \n the velocity is given by eqs . \n ( [ velocity ] ) and ( [ velocity1 ] ) for the eutectic and peritectic systems respectively ; the angle @xmath22 is given by eq . \n ( [ angle ] ) for both cases and the curvature of the @xmath87 interface at the triple junction , @xmath88 , is also known since we have already found the concentrations at the triple junction . \n the procedure of calculation of @xmath86 is straightforward but tedious and involves new thermodynamical parameters . \n therefore , we explain this procedure only schematically : the concentrations in the solid phases at the triple junction can be calculated , on one hand , using the condition of local equilibrium with the liquid phase ( along the @xmath89 interface ) and , on the other hand , using the condition of local equilibrium between two solid phases ( along the @xmath90 interface ) . at the triple junction \n these compositions should coincide . \n the capillary corrections to the equilibrium solid concentrations can be written similar to eq . \n ( [ equil ] ) for all there interfaces . \n since the profiles @xmath41 and @xmath42 have been already found , the mentioned continuity condition allows to calculate the curvature @xmath86 of the solid - solid interface . \n we note , however , that the term @xmath91 in eq . \n ( [ ab ] ) is of order @xmath92 and can be neglected compared to @xmath22 for small @xmath60 . \n this means that the tedious calculations explained above are not needed in the limit of small @xmath60 . \n we also note that the characteristic length scales of the solid - solid interfacial pattern are small compared to the characteristic length scales of the melt structures by the same small parameter @xmath93 . \n moreover , the diffusional flux along the solid - solid interface has a nonzero value at the triple junction . in principal , this flux has to be taken into account in the description of the diffusional field in the liquid phase . \n this effect has been neglected in the previous sections . \n more careful analysis shows that corrections to eq . \n ( 6 ) due to this effects are small by the same small parameter , @xmath94 thus , in the limit of small @xmath60 the surface diffusion process has no influence on the kinetics of the contact melting and allows only for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface inside the relatively small region in the vicinity of the triple junction . \n we have developed and analyzed a relatively simple model for the melting kinetics along the solid - solid inter - phase boundaries in eutectic and peritectic systems . \n the process is controlled by the diffusion inside the liquid phase and the existence of the triple junction is crucial for the velocity selection problem . \n the additional assumption of small opening angles @xmath95 at the triple junction plays only a technical role and allows to solve the posed problem essentially analytically using the lubrication approximation for the diffusion field in the liquid phase . \n the obtained scaling results for the dependence of the steady - state velocity of the moving pattern on the overheating , which are exact in the limit of small angles , can still be used for the moderate values of the angles with only prefactors of the order of unity missing . \n we note the obtained scaling relation , @xmath96 , is similar to the scaling relation in eutectic growth . using eq . \n ( [ velocity ] ) and characteristic values of the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 we estimate the characteristic velocity to be of the order of @xmath101 . \n we hope that our results will stimulate some new model experiments on contact melting phenomena . \n 99 h. mller - krumbhaar h , kurz w , brener ea . \n solidification . in : \n kostorz g. editor . \n phase transformations in materials : willey - vch , weinheim , 2002 p.81 . \n temkin de , acta mater . \n 2005;53:2733 brener ea , temkin de . \n lett 2005;94:184501 muschik t , kaysser wa , hehenkamp t. acta metall 1989;37:603 yoon dn , hupmann wj acta metall 1979;27 : 973 yoon dn . int . \n rev 1995;40:149 yoon dn , cahn jw , handwerker ca , blendell je , y. j. baik yj , in : interface migration and control of microstructures . \n . metals . park . \n ohio 1985 , p. 19 . \n brener ea , marchenko vi . \n jetp lett 1992;56:368 brener ea , iordanskii sv , marchenko vi . \n lett 1998;82:1506 kessler d , koplik j , levine h , adv . \n phys 1988;37:255 brener ea , and melnikov vi . adv .", "StartTimeOffset": 925264890036, "RequestID": "3b3b80db9fb6c944bc7f393a44ebd0f19fc9e917", "TotalTokens": 3738}

{"ContextTokens": 3292, "GeneratedTokens": 196, "SynthesizedBody": "the first known supernova observed with vlbi was the type ii supernova 1979c , which was only the second supernova detected in the radio , and bartel ( 1985 ) reported a determination of its angular size . \n the first vlbi image identified as that of a supernova was one of 41.95 + 575 in m82 by wilkinson & de bruyn ( 1984 ) , although the recent results have cast some doubt on the identification as a supernova ( mcdonald et al . \n bartel et al .  ( \n 1987 ) published a higher resolution image of 41.95 + 575 , and then bartel et al . \n ( 1991 ) published an image of sn  1986j . \n since then , radio imaging of approximately ten supernovae has been carried out ( see table  1 below ) , where i use the word `` imaging '' somewhat loosely , meaning supernova for which we have some morphological information , including size determinations , from radio observations . \n i will attempt to briefly summarize the state of radio supernova ( rsn ) imaging . \n radio imaging is an important tool for the study of supernovae , at least those that are radio bright , ie . \n if fact , vlbi radio observations are presently the only means to directly image the expanding shell of any supernova much farther away than sn  1987a . the radio emission is generated as the expanding shell of supernova ejecta interacts with the progenitor star s circumstellar medium ( csm ) which generally consists of its stellar wind . \n the expanding shell of ejecta generates two shocks , a forward shock which propagates into the csm and a reverse shock which propagates into the stellar ejecta . \n chevalier ( 1990 and references therein ) showed that in the case of density distributions for the csm and the ejecta that are power laws in radius , the solution is self - similar and the supernova shell expands such that its radius , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is time since the explosion and the parameter @xmath3 is commonly known as the deceleration parameter . \n the value of @xmath3 will depend on the density distributions of both the csm and of the ejecta , and @xmath4 indicates free expansion . \n = 0.60    = 0.86    the interaction region between the ejecta and the csm is an important laboratory for studying shock acceleration , since supernovae are thought to be responsible for the majority of cosmic rays \n . we can also learn about both the supernova and the csm . \n furthermore , since the speeds of the ejecta are usually several orders of magnitude faster than those typical of red giant winds , the supernova shock over - runs the wind , and thus the interaction region acts like a time - machine , and has the potential to reveal the last thousands of years of the progenitor s wind history . finally , by equating the angular expansion velocity measured with vlbi with the radial expansion velocity measured spectroscopically , a direct , geometric distance determination can be made ( see bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) . \n the early vlbi observations of sn  1979c and sn  1986j allowed measurement of their sizes and determination of their expansion curves . figure  [ bieten_f86exp ] shows the expansion curve to date of sn  1986j ( see bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2002 ;

bartel et al . \n 2000 ; and marcaide et al . \n 2002b , 1997 ; and references therein ) . \n the quality of the data allowed both vlbi groups to independently determine departures from simple power - law expansion , with bartel et al . \n ( 2002 ) reporting that @xmath6 was near unity early on , decreased to @xmath70.8 by @xmath8  d , and then increased slightly after that ( see figure  [ bieten_f93exp ] ) . \n mioduszewski , dwarkadas , & ball ( 2001 ) performed simulations of an expanding supernova shell , based on a particular model of the ejecta profile , and found changes in @xmath6 remarkably similar to those in fact observed for sn  1993j ( e.g. , bartel et al . \n after 10 years , sn  1993j has slowed to less than half its original expansion velocity , which implies that the swept up material is now comparable in mass to the ejecta , and for reasonable mass - loss rates of the progenitor , suggests that the ejecta have a relatively low mass of @xmath9 , and that the progenitor had lost most its envelope mass to a binary companion prior to the supernova explosion . \n the images of sn  1993j , shown in figure  [ bieten_f93img ] show a wealth of detail ( see http://www.yorku.ca/bartel/snmovie.html for a movie of the expanding supernova ) . in projection \n , the supernova has remained very circular , and phase referencing has shown that it expands isotropically from the explosion center to within 5.5% ( bietenholz , et al . \n 2001 , 2003 ) . \n the shell structure is clearly visible in all the adequately resolved images . \n there are , however , distinct departures from circular symmetry even at the earliest resolved epochs , where there is a pronounced minimum to the west and a maximum to the east - southeast ( fig . \n [ bieten_f93img ] ) . even after 10 years \n , no sign of a pulsar nebula has yet been seen at the center . \n however , it seems probable that the ejecta in the interior of the shell are dense enough that the radio optical depth due to free - free absorption will remain large for several decades , and hence obscure any emerging pulsar nebula . \n l l c c c c l c name & host & distance&type & expansion & @xmath10 & morphology & ref.@xmath11 + & galaxy & & & speed & + & & ( mpc ) & & ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath0 ) & + sn 1979c & m100 & 16 & ii & 12 & 0.95 & circular & 3 + sn 1980k & ngc6946 & 6 & ii & @xmath13 & & & 1 + sn 1986j & ngc891 & 10 & ii & 6 & 0.7 & distorted shell & 5 + 41.95 + 575@xmath14 & m82 & 3 & & @xmath15 & & asymmetric & 7 + 43.31 + 592 & m82 & 3 & & 9.7 & 0.7 & circular shell & 7 + 44.01 + 596@xmath14 & m82@xmath16 & 3 & & & & circular shell & 7 + sn 1987a & lmc & 0.05 & iipec & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & circular shell & 6 + sn 1993j & m81 & 4 & ii & 8.5 & 0.81 & circular shell & 2 + sn 1994i & m51 & 8 & ic & @xmath19 & & & 4 + sn 2001gd & ngc5033 & 13 & ii & @xmath20 & & & 8 +    table  1 gives an overview of the characteristics of the rsne for which we have some morphological information . of the well - resolved supernovae , all but 41.95 + 575 , whose identification as a supernova is uncertain , show a discernible , fairly circular shell morphology . \n the observed shell structures are clear evidence that the bulk of the radio emission originates from the interaction of the expanding shells with their surroundings , rather than from nebulae around the young pulsars , as had also been suggested . despite the relatively circular shells , \n significant intensity modulation with position angle seems the norm . \n none of the imaged rsne show a clear case of bisymmetric structure , as might be expected from axisymmetric stellar winds . \n there is evidence , however , most compelling from sn  1986j , for some more asymmetric structure , possibly in the form of protrusions or jets . \n the origin of the asymmetries and protrusions is not yet well understood . \n the observed mostly circular morphologies , do , however , suggest mostly spherical shells , which allow direct distance determinations to be made ( e.g. , bartel & bietenholz , this volume ; bartel 1985 ) . \n power - law expansion curves , with @xmath21 , provide a first order fit to all supernovae whose sizes have been determined over a reasonable time baseline except for sn  1987a , which is probably in a much lower density environment than the other radio - bright supernovae . \n however , at least in the case of sn  1993j , distinct departures from strict power - law expansion can be seen , implying significant structure in the ejecta and/or the csm . in both \n sn  1993j and sn  1986j , the source structure has been shown to change non self - similarly as the supernova expands . \n there is an intriguing change in the radio spectrum of sn  1986j , with a new spectral component that peaks at @xmath2220  ghz emerging after @xmath2210  yr , possibly related to a new compact component in the images , that may perhaps be related to a pulsar nebula ( see bietenholz et al . \n 2002 ) . \n there is still considerable scope for the more detailed understanding of supernova shell dynamics , and for determining the structure of the csm and of the ejecta through hydrodynamic simulations , particularly in the case of sn  1993j where exceptionally good data are on hand . \n currently , there are only a couple of rsne per decade that are close enough and bright enough to image . \n future improvements in sensitivity , e.g. , the mark  iv vlbi recording system , the evla , and the ska , will allow us to image somewhat more rsne , but will only enable a modest increase in the resolution available to global vlbi ( by going to higher observing frequencies ) . \n the practical distance limit is on the order of 30  mpc , where global vlbi at 22  ghz gives a linear resolution of @xmath238000  au . \n there have been approximately 8 rsne per decade with a 22-ghz flux density @xmath24  mjy since 1980 , so even with the ska , the number of rsne available for imaging will be limited . \n it will therefore be important to image those rsne that are available to us , since they will provide us with direct distance estimates , test our understanding of the supernova process , which may be crucial to understanding the distant , un - resolved supernovae upon which cosmological results are based , and allow us to probe the circumstellar environments and thus the wind - history of evolved stars , and allow us maybe to see the birth of a pulsar nebula . \n bartel , n. 1985 in supernovae as distance indicators , lecture notes in physics , ed . \n n. bartel ( berlin : springer verlag ) , 107 bartel , n. , et al . \n 1987 , , 323 , 505 bartel , n. , rupen , m. p. , shapiro i. i. , preston , r. a. , & rius , a. 1991 , nature , 350 , 212 bartel , n. , et  al . \n 2000 , science , 287 , 112 bartel , n. , et al . \n 2002 , , 581 , 404 bartel , n. , & bietenholz , m. f. 2003 , , 591 , 301 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2001 \n , , 557 , 770 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2002 \n , , 581 , 1132 bietenholz , m. f. , bartel , n. , & rupen , m. p. 2003 \n , , 597 , 374 chevalier , r. a. 1990 , in supernovae , ed . \n a. petschek ( berlin :  springer ) , 91 manchester , r. n. , et al . \n 2002 , publ .  the astr .  soc . of australia , 19 , 207 mcdonald , a. r. , et al . \n 2001 , , 322 , 100 marcaide , j.  m. , et  al . \n 1997 , , 486 , l31 marcaide , j. m. , et  al .  2002a , , 384 , 408 marcaide , j.  m. , et  al . \n 2002b , in proc . \n of the european vlbi network symp . \n , eds .  e. ros , r. w. porcas , a. p. lobanov & j. a. zensus , 239 mioduszewski , a. j. , dwarkadas , v. v. , & ball , l. 2001 , , 562 , 869 pedlar , a. , et al . \n 1999 , mnras , 307 , 761 prez - torres , m. a. , et al . \n 2002 , , 335 , l23 prez - torres , m. a. , et al . \n 2003 , in proceedings of iau coll.192 : supernovae , _ in press _ \n wilkinson p. n. , & de bruyn , a. g. 1984 , , 211 , 593", "StartTimeOffset": 938206241658, "RequestID": "973ab6389edcd9d2588f8b7a28b3071dc945c196", "TotalTokens": 3488}
{"ContextTokens": 2818, "GeneratedTokens": 97, "SynthesizedBody": "radial oscillations of non - rotating relativistic stars have been studied for over thirty years . \n methods for obtaining their spectra have been well established ( bardeen , thorne & meltzer  1966 ; see also chapter 26 of misner et al . \n 1973 and the references therein ) , and have been applied to several equations of state ( see for example meltzer & thorne  1966 ) . \n these works were mainly motivated by consideration of stellar stability because general relativistic effects tend to destabilize stellar models @xcite .    on the other hand , \n the effect of rotation on stellar oscillations is less well understood in a general relativistic context . as in the non - axisymmetric mode case , \n the slow rotation approximation has been the only accessible way for investigating the eigenmode behaviour of rotating stars @xcite . \n recently , numerical relativistic hydrodynamic codes have been developed by several authors and some numerical simulations of rapidly rotating stars have been carried out . \n stergioulas et al .   and font et al . \n have shown that initial small perturbations around an equilibrium star evolved to a superposition of normal mode oscillations ( note that their hydrodynamic simulation is done in the fixed background spacetime . \n on the other hand , shibata et al .   have solved the full system of einstein equations to investigate the dynamical stability of rapidly rotating stars . ) . \n although the excitation and evolution of these modes in realistic situations should be investigated by time dependent hydrodynamic simulations , it is also important to study the mode behaviour along rotational equilibrium sequences by using linear perturbation theory . \n so far we have studied a few sets of non - axisymmetric eigenmodes of rotating stars in general relativity ( f - modes by yoshida & eriguchi  1997,1999 ; p - modes by yoshida  1999 ( unpublished ; presented at the 9th yukawa international seminar black holes and gravitational waves - new eyes in the 21st century- ) ) . \n these results have been obtained within the cowling approximation in which euler perturbations of the metric coefficients have been neglected ( see mcdermott et al . \n 1983 and finn  1988 for a definition ; see lindblom and splinter  1990 for the accuracy of the method when applied to non - radial modes of spherical stars ) . \n apart from some low order modes , these results are in good agreement with those of the full perturbation theory including metric perturbations ( for comparison of the eigenfrequencies for slowly rotating stars , see yoshida & kojima  1997 ; for comparison of the neutral points of the cfs instability , see yoshida & eriguchi  1999 which compare the results with the one obtained by full computation of stergioulas & friedman  1998 and morsink et al . \n 1999 )    it is therefore natural to expect that the cowling approximation could also be successfully applied to the _ quasi - radial _ modes which are the smooth extensions of the radial modes of spherical stars to rotating stars . in the present paper , we study quasi - radial modes by using the cowling approximation . \n contrary to the expectations , our results indicate that _ computations with this approximation can not reproduce the relativistic instability of spherical stars . \n _ this is plausible because the instability is essentially caused by the loss of balance between gravity and the pressure gradient , and in calculations of it even the small corrections of gravity can not be neglected . moreover \n , the phase cancellation of the perturbed gravitational potentials , which may be effective in the case of non - axisymmetric modes , can not be expected to happen for radial modes . \n see the appendix of the present paper for the comparison of two methods in the case of radial modes of non - rotating stars . \n although the validity of cowling approximation for rotating stars is not fully assessed , we here _ expect _ that at least a qualitative picture of the eigenmode dependence on stellar rotation could be studied by this approximation . \n the equation of state used here is the polytropic one , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the rest mass density , energy density and pressure of the stellar matter , respectively . \n geometrized units , @xmath4 , are adopted in this paper as well as @xmath5 , following font et al .  . \n the constant @xmath6 is the polytropic index . \n the adiabatic exponent of the perturbed matter is assumed to coincide with @xmath7 . \n the factor @xmath8 is another constant . \n each equilibrium sequence is computed with @xmath8 and @xmath6 fixed .    in the present study \n polar - like coordinates are used and the metric components are written as : @xmath9 the rotational axis is located at @xmath10 . \n the coordinates used in the actual numerical computation are surface - fitted ones @xmath11 which are defined as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the form of the stellar surface in equilibrium . \n the numerical method used here is basically the same as that in yoshida & eriguchi   where non - axisymmetric modes were investigated . \n a minor modification is needed to obtain the axisymmetric modes . in the case of non - axisymmetric modes , \n the eulerian variable @xmath14 is explicitly set to zero at the centre of the star ( @xmath15 is the eulerian variation of the pressure ) . in the case of axisymmetric modes , however , this is not the case since the regularity of the solution requires @xmath16 to be zero at the stellar centre . \n therefore we simply modify the finite - difference scheme at the innermost grid points in our numerical code . \n moreover to avoid the coordinate singularity on the rotation axis , points on the axis are excluded from the computational region . \n most of the results shown in this paper are computed with a resolution of 40 uniformly distributed gridpoints in the radial @xmath17 direction and 10 in the angular @xmath18 one . \n the computational region is a quarter of the meridional section of stars , thus the range of the radial and the angular coordinates are @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    in figs . \n [ n05freq ] and [ n15freq ] the eigenfrequencies of the axisymmetric modes are plotted against the rotational frequency of the equilibrium model . \n the model parameters are tabulated in table [ eqmodel ] . \n .parameters of the stellar model . here \n @xmath21 is the rest mass density at the stellar centre , which is fixed as constant along the sequence . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gravitational mass and the mass - to - radius ratio , where @xmath24 is the circumferential radius . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ compare1d ]      comparing with the eigenfunctions of non - axisymmetric modes , we notice that the eigenfunctions of quasi - radial modes change their shapes significantly along rotational equilibrium sequences . \n for example , the radial distributions of the eulerian pressure perturbation and the radial component of the velocity perturbation change considerably near the equatorial plane of the star . the number of radial nodes of these functions increases as the stellar rotation rate increases . on the other hand , \n the overall radial dependence of the @xmath25-component of the velocity perturbation changes little as the star spins up . \n therefore we can use the shape of this function as a tracer of the selected mode along the equilibrium sequence . \n the nomenclature of mode sequences is based upon the behaviour of the mode of a non - rotating star to which the sequence is continued smoothly . \n in addition to the polytropic case presented here , we have tried to compute quasi - radial modes of realistic neutron stars by using some of the candidate zero temperature equations of state . \n however it was rather difficult to obtain full sequences of these modes with our method . \n as the star begins to rotate , the convergence to the quasi - radial modes suddenly becomes much more difficult \n . this may partly be due to the fact that these modes are sensitive ( as compared with the non - radial modes ) to the surface condition of the equilibrium star . \n unfortunately , in the case of more realistic eos , the adiabatic exponent is subject to large oscillations , becoming negative in some parts . \n these large variations decrease considerably the accuracy of our method which then becomes inadequate . \n we thank luciano rezzolla for detailed comments on the manuscript , and john miller for his help to improve it . \n we also thank kji ury for useful discussions . \n bardeen j. m. , thorne k. s. , meltzer d. w. , 1966 , apj , 145 , 505 chandrasekhar s. , 1964 , phys . \n , 12 , 114 , 437 clement m. j. , 1986 , apj , 301 , 185 finn l. s. , 1988 , mnras , 232 , 259 font j. a. , stergioulas n. , kokkotas k. , 2000 , mnras , 313 , 678 fowler w. a. , 1964 , rev . \n 36 , 549 and 1104 hartle j. b. , friedman j. l. , 1975 , apj , 196 , 653 lindblom l. , splinter r. j. , 1990 , apj , 348 , 198 mcdermott p. n. , van horn h. m. , sholl j. f. , 1983 , apj , 268 , 837 meltzer d. w. , thorne k. s. , 1966 , apj , 145 , 514 misner c. w. , thorne k. s. , wheeler j. a. , 1973 , gravitation . \n freeman , san francisco morsink s. , stergioulas n. , blattnig s. r. , 1999 , apj , 510 , 854 shibata m. , baumgarte t. w. , shapiro s. l. , 2000 , phys . rev . , d61 , 44012 stergioulas n. , font j. a. , kokkotas k. , 2000 , in aubourg , e. , montmerle , t. , paul , j. peter , p. , eds , proceedings of the 19th texas symposium on relativistic astrophysics , nucl \n , 80 ( in cd -

pixel events for the pn ( pattern @xmath15 4 ) and single- and multiple - pixel events for the mos ( pattern @xmath15 12 ) .    for the timing analysis \n , we extracted the source counts from a circle of radius 15@xmath16 and converted their arrival times to the solar system barycenter . \n we used only the events in the energy range from 0.15 to 2 kev , as it was done for the 2011 data by @xcite . \n this resulted in 1519 pn counts and 485 mos counts . \n we estimate that the background contributes about 22% and 17% of these counts , respectively .    in order to take into account a possible spin - up or spin - down of the source during the @xmath74.5 years between the two  observations with plausible values of @xmath17 s s@xmath1 , we considered possible periods in the range from 19.1 to 19.2 s ( the value measured in 2011 was p@xmath18=19.156@xmath100.001 s ) . using the sum of the pn and mos counts \n , we found a maximum value of the z@xmath19 statistics @xcite of 8.74 , for a period p=19.174 s ( see fig . \n [ fig - z2 ] ) . \n however , the corresponding probability of chance occurrence , taking into account the number of sampled periods , is too large to claim a significant detection .    through monte carlo simulations we found that a sinusoidal modulation with pulsed fraction of 33% , as found in the 2011 data , has a probability of 99.9% of being detected at a significance above 5@xmath14 in an observation with the same duration and counting statistics as the 2016 one . \n the corresponding probability for a pulsed fraction of 25% ( the lower bound of the 2@xmath14 uncertainty of the 2011 value ) is 84% . \n therefore , the lack of a detection in the new data strongly suggest that either the pulsations in  disappeared ( i.e. the pulsed fraction decreased making them undetectable ) or the peak at 19.2 s appearing in the 2011 periodogram was caused by a statistical fluctuation .    for the spectral analysis we used circular extraction regions with radii of 20@xmath16 for the source and 50@xmath16 for the background . \n time intervals of high background were excluded . \n we merged the spectra from the three cameras into a single epic spectrum and produced the appropriate response matrix using the task multixmmselect . \n following exactly the same procedures , we extracted also the epic spectrum of  from the 2011 data , which we reprocessed using sas v15 . \n the effective exposure times of the 2016 and 2011 spectra are 48 ks and 28 ks , respectively . by comparing the two spectra we found no evidence that the flux or spectral shape changed between the two observations . \n therefore , we performed the spectral analysis by jointly fitting the 2011 and 2016 data in the 0.2 - 2 kev energy range using the xspec software . \n simple models ( power law , blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) modified by interstellar absorption could not fit the data ( values of reduced @xmath202.5 ) . \n thermal plasma emission models , with abundances fixed at solar values @xcite were also rejected , but they could give satisfactory fits if some of the abundances were let free to vary . \n for simplicity , and considering that the quality of the data does not allow us to constrain a large number of spectral parameters , we considered only a single - temperature plasma described by the apec model . \n we found strong evidence for an overabundance of c and ne , the latter being required to fit the significant excess of emission visible in the spectra at @xmath70.9 kev . \n the derived c and ne abundances were found to depend on that of he , which was however poorly constrained by the x - ray data . \n therefore , considering that  is an extreme he - rich star , we fixed the abundance of this element to a mass fraction of x@xmath21=0.99 . in this case \n we obtained a good fit with temperature kt=0.22 kev , absorption n@xmath22 @xmath23 , and solar abundances relative to hydrogen for all the other elements ( see fig . \n [ fig -

? ? * and references therein ) . \n an empirical correlation has been found between the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of early type stars : @xmath30 @xcite . \n the x - ray luminosity we derived for   corresponds to a value of @xmath31 , fully consistent with the observed dispersion around the above average relation . \n it is thus natural to ascribe the x - rays observed in  to the same , or similar , processes that are at work in the stellar winds of massive early type stars . \n there is in fact evidence from uv and optical spectroscopy that , despite its low luminosity compared to normal o - type stars , has a stellar wind . \n the inferred mass - loss rate is @xmath32=3@xmath33 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite , in good agreement with the predictions of the most recent theoretical models of radiatively - driven winds in low luminosity hot stars @xcite .    in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] we plot the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of the five sdo stars that have been detected in the x - ray range . for comparison , \n the values for a sample of normal o stars seen in the rosat all sky survey @xcite are also shown in the figure . \n @xcite is another single , he - rich star very similar to  for what concerns its optical spectrum , composition and mass - loss properties @xcite . \n these two stars lie very close in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane . \n the same is true for the spectroscopic binary , which is in a 1.55 day orbit with a neutron star or white dwarf companion @xcite . for this star we plot in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] the x - ray luminosity observed when the compact companion is eclipsed by the sdo star and likely due to wind emission ; out of the eclipse the luminosity is a factor ten higher and pulsations at 13.2 s are observed . \n the x - ray spectra of these three stars are similar , except for the presence of a harder component in  which might be related to its binary nature . \n the two other sdo stars plotted in fig . \n [ fig_lxlb ] ( feige 34 and ; @xcite ) are less luminous and their faint x - ray emission has not been studied in detail . \n it is however remarkable that they lie on the extrapolation of the average l@xmath2-l@xmath36 relation observed at higher luminosity . \n the temperature found in the spectral fits of  is in the lower range of the values seen in the sample of o - type stars observed with the  epic instrument , when a single - temperature plasma is sufficient to describe their low resolution x - ray spectra @xcite . \n this might be related to the weaker wind of  compared to that of normal o - type stars . \n it is also interesting to note that the weak - wind o - type dwarf @xmath37 col ( hd 38666 ) , with a mass - loss rate @xmath32 = 10@xmath38 @xmath5 yr@xmath1 @xcite similar to that of , has an x - ray emitting wind with higher temperature ( kt@xmath70.4 kev , @xcite ) , despite its lower wind velocity ( v@xmath39=1,200 km s@xmath1 wrt v@xmath39=2,000 km s@xmath1 , @xcite ) . \n however , we caution that the temperatures derived from low - resolution spectroscopy of faint x - ray sources , such as the hot subdwarfs discussed here , might be affected by the uncertainties in the element abundances . \n instruments with large collecting area and high spectral resolution are needed to address these issues in more detail and fully exploit the study of subdwarfs in the context of a more general understanding of stellar wind in hot stars . \n this work , supported through financial contributions from the agreement asi / inaf i/037/12/0 and from prin inaf 2014 , is based on data from observations with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) . \n pe acknowledges funding in the framework of the nwo vidi award a.2320.0076 .                    , u. , geier , s. , irrgang , a. , et  al . \n 2014 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 481 , 6th meeting on hot subdwarf stars and related objects , ed . \n v.  van grootel , e.  green , g.  fontaine , & s.  charpinet , 307", "StartTimeOffset": 957855569556, "RequestID": "dc53adab7113b40a6b74cca73ce5aaa0d34ede51", "TotalTokens": 3435}
{"ContextTokens": 3384, "GeneratedTokens": 252, "SynthesizedBody": "radon is considered to be the second most important cause of lung cancer after smoking @xcite . inhaled radon - daughters deposit in the respiratory system and most of the alpha - particles emitted by them hit the surrounding epithelial cells . \n previous studies proved that the spatial distribution of deposited radioactive particles is highly inhomogeneous in the central airways @xcite , @xcite , where radon induced malignancies predominate @xcite . \n therefore , it is quite important to determine what consequences this heterogeneity has and how cancer risk depends on the amount of inhaled radon progenies . the objective of this research is to investigate these questions applying numerical modeling techniques . \n the elaborated computational modeling efforts consist of three major steps . \n firstly , a 3d numerical epithelium model and a suitable microdosimetric model have been developed for the quantification of cellular hit numbers and doses . \n the next step is preparing a radiation biological carcinogenesis model , which connects biological responses to the computed microdosimetric data . \n finally , this model can be applied for a given deposition distribution computed by computational fluid and particle dynamics approaches . \n brick shaped epithelium model has been elaborated taking into account the experimental data about the average volumes , frequencies @xcite and depth distributions @xcite of the six epithelial cell types in the bronchial epithelium . \n the height of the fragments is 57.8  , while its area is equal to the area of individual numerical grid elements to be modeled constructing the airway geometry . \n the cells in the model are brick - shaped and placed in three layers : basal cells can be found at bottom , goblet and ciliated cells are placed in the upper region , other secretory and preciliated cells are located either in the upper or in the middle layer , while intermediate cells are situated either in the middle or in the bottom part of the epithelium model . there is no gap between the cells . \n the model of the epithelium is covered with a 5-micrometer - thick mucus layer .    in the microdosimetric model , \n the dose - contributions of beta- and gamma - radiation are neglected , i.e. only the alpha - particles are considered . \n the path of alpha particles is supposed to be straight . \n the deposited energy along a given track length and the range is determined by the utilization of the stopping and range of ions in mattersoftware @xcite . \n the energy lost in the airway lumen is considered by the application of the model presented in a previous work @xcite . calculating the intersection of brick - shaped cells and the tracks of alpha - particles , \n cellular hit numbers can be determined . \n in addition , knowing the alpha - energies at the boundaries of the cells , cellular absorbed energies and doses can be computed .    for the assessment of biological effects , a revised version of the so - called initiation - promotion model \n @xcite has been applied . \n this model supposes that carcinogenesis consists of two stochastic steps . \n the first one is called initiation , which means transformation in this model . \n initiation frequency ( @xmath0 ) is directly proportional to cellular absorbed dose ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2    according to the model , the second and final stochastic step towards cancer is promotion , which means the division of an initiated cell . in the bronchial epithelium , basal and goblet cells are thaught to be able to divide @xcite , therefore initiation and promotion frequencies are computed only for these two cell types .    supposing that cell death forces other cells to divide , promotion probability ( @xmath3 ) will be directly proportional to mitotic rate , which consists of two terms in the model . the normal mitotic rate is constant ( @xmath4 ) , while the forced mitotic rate is directly proportional to the number of cells died ( @xmath5 ) and inversely proportional to the number of cells capable of dividing ( @xmath6 ) :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 ( 1 @xmath9 ) is constant . \n the number of cells died in the individual grid elements is assessed by the expected value of cells killed utilizing the individual cell surviving probabilities ( @xmath10 ) , which decreases exponentially with the increase of absorbed dose    @xmath11    where @xmath12 ( 1.67 @xmath13 ) is constant . \n the probability that a given cell takes both stochastic steps are computed as the product of initiation frequency , promotion probability , and naturally , cell surviving probability , because only living cells are able to be initiated and promoted . \n presuming that the value of this probability is low , the probability that at least one cell capable of dividing in a given surface element of the airway geometry takes the above two steps ( @xmath14 ) can be expressed by ( 4 ) :    @xmath15        the deposition distribution is determined by computational fluid and particle dynamics approaches . for the computations , \n the airway geometry composed of five bifurcation units was discretised by the construction of an inhomogeneous , unstructured numerical mesh @xcite . \n air and particle flow describing equations were solved by finite volume methods . \n one way coupling has been assumed between the air and the radioactive particles . \n this presumes that particle trajectories are influenced by the airstreams , but the airflow is independent of the particles . \n inhaled particles were tracked until they left the targeted airways or deposited on the airway walls . since a viscous mucus layer is covering the bronchial airways , particle - wall impaction can be considered as inelastic . \n the multitude of these impaction points forms the deposition pattern . \n primary deposition patterns can be modified by the clearance mechanisms , especially mucociliary clearance . \n however , clearance mechanisms were not considered in this study . \n the microdosimetric and biological quantities are computed for epithelium model fragments with the same size as the individual elements ( grid cells ) of the mesh . then quantities characteristic for the whole geometry \n are calculated by the summation or averaging of quantities computed for the individual grid elements . \n for example , the right side of relation ( 4 ) has been computed for each grid cell of the geometry and summed up , so as to obtain a quantity directly proportional to cancer risk . \n the deposition distribution in the bronchial airway model demonstrated in figure [ fig:01 ] corresponds to 500 inhalations , 50 millions inhaled and 500  thousands deposited particles in the geometry during 23 minutes of work in the new mexico uranium mine , which is equivalent to 0.0129  wlm . \n the geometry model consists of 162  thousands surface units ( or grid elements ) , mean area of which is 62500   with about 3300 epithelial cells . \n the biological responses in the different surface units are presumed to be independent . \n the cellular hit - distributions are plotted in figure  [ fig:02 ] for basal and goblet cells . \n most cells receive no hit , while some cells can suffer tens of hits . \n obviously , basal cells are hit less frequently than goblet cells , since as compared to goblet cells , they are more deeply embedded in the epithelium . \n importantly , the average hit number over all the cell types is 0.0079 , more than three thousands times less than the maximum number of hits . in terms of percentages , \n 98.4% of goblet cells receive no hit , 1.4 suffer single hits , while 0.2% are hit multiple times . \n regarding basal cells , 99.9% percentage of them are not hit , however , there are cells receiving multiple hits , as well . \n figure [ fig:03 ] presents the distributions of absorbed doses at cellular level for cells hit . \n doses are determined independently of the calculation of cellular hit numbers . \n the cellular absorbed doses vary in a wide range between 0  and 1.5  gy . \n interestingly , there are several cells , which absorb more than 1  gy dose during the 23-minute - long exposure , while almost 99.3% of all the cells receive no hits and therefore absorb no dose . \n the mean cellular dose of basal cells is 0.15  mgy , while that of goblet cells is 0.86  mgy for exposure characterized by 0.0129  wlm . \n the average cellular dose over all cells is approximately 0.5  mgy , what means that tissue dose is also of this order of magnitude , while some cells and some clusters of cells absorb thousand times higher doses . \n the fractions of surviving cells have also been computed in each grid element , so the distribution of surviving fractions is obtained . in figure \n [ fig:04 ] , the number of surface units characterized by a given surviving fraction is depicted . \n the lowest surviving fraction in one grid element is 45% in case of goblet cells and 84% in case of basal cells . \n it is worth to mention that these low surviving ratios in a grid element are the result of only 23 minutes of radon exposure corresponding to 0.0129  wlm . on the other hand , surviving ratios lower than 99% are quite rare regarding the whole ( five bifurcation unit ) airway geometry model . \n the spatial inhomogeneity of surviving fractions implies high spatial differences in the local probabilities of carcinogenesis . by the application of the model , the probability that at least one epithelial cell in the airway model takes \n both stochastic steps towards cancer can be computed . \n let this probability be called risk . computing the probabilities that at least one cell will be initiated and promoted in a given surface unit , the contribution to the risk of that grid element can be determined . \n as it is expected , the risk defined above originates only from a restricted area of the model geometry . \n figure [ fig:05 ] demonstrates how large ratio of grid elements is responsible for a given proportion of risk at the 23 minutes exposure in the mine . \n as it is demonstrated , risk originates from hardly more than 1% of all the grid elements and approximately 0.1% of the surface of the airways provides 60% of the whole risk computed by summing the result of relation  [ eq:04 ] calculated for the individual grid elements . \n finally , some computations have been done to study , how the risk depends on the total burden . \n the number of deposited radon - progenies has been multiplied by whole numbers from 2 to 6 modeling the radiation burden during 46 , 69 , 92 , 115 and 138 minutes of work in the new mexico uranium mine . in this range , the surviving fractions decrease linearly by the macroscopic radiation burden . in case of goblet cells , obviously \n , this decrease is much higher , than in case of basal cells . \n the ratio of dead cells seems to be very small in both cases ( 0.60% in case of goblet and 0.09% in case of basal cells ) . \n however , if there were no radon - inhalation , only 0.13% of all the cells would die during 138 minutes . \n this value is computed by the normal mitotic rate ( 1/30 @xmath9 ) and the stem cell ratio among all cells . \n the effect in cell killing , therefore , is quite significant , even in case of the whole geometry , data of which are plotted in figure [ fig:06 ] . \n the exact value of risk can not be determined because of the unknown proportion factor in relation ( 1 ) , however the shape of the risk curve can be presented as the function of macroscopic radiation burden . \n figure [ fig:07 ] demonstrates that risk in the modeled airways starts to increase non - linearly . \n this relationship differs from the functions applied for initiation , promotion and survival  ( see relations 1 - 3 ) , because tissue response to radiation is the superposition of these effects . \n in case of radon inhalation , the cellular hit and absorbed dose distributions are very inhomogeneous within the central airways . \n there is three orders of magnitude difference between cellular and tissue doses in case of a 23-minute - long radon exposure in the mine , what means that the spatial heterogeneities should not be neglected in risk - assessment . \n the spatial distribution of surviving fractions in grid elements proves that not only single cells , but also cell clusters receive high radiation burdens . \n therefore , in some parts of the central airways very high cell death frequencies can be observed even in case of the applied 23-minute - long exposure in the new mexico uranium mine corresponding to 0.0129  wlm . \n these very high cell death frequencies supports the idea that processes governing lung cancer formation induced by radon - daughters may differ significantly from carcinogenesis caused by other types of exposure . in accordance with histological studies @xcite , \n the results demonstrate that cancer formation probability is much higher in some regions of the central airways than in other parts of it . \n importantly , risk seems to depend non - linearly on macroscopic radiation dose differing from the functions applied for initiation and promotion , which represent a radiation effect on individual cells and a radiation effect interpretable only on tissue fragments ( interacting cells ) . \n this simple model demonstrates , that the interaction between radiation effects on different organizational levels may strongly influence the radiation response of the organism . \n noteworthy , important effects such as dose - rate - effect and non - targeted effects are not considered in this study , therefore the computed values of biological quantities are quite uncertain . \n united states environmental protection agency ( 2003 ) assessment of risks from radon in homes , _ epa publications _ , 402-r-03 -

{"ContextTokens": 2045, "GeneratedTokens": 90, "SynthesizedBody": "in a recent paper @xcite , we pointed out that microcanonical calculations in the lattice gas model ( lgm ) with constant energy are no harder to implement than canonical calculations with constant temperature . \n we will call the first mlgm , and the second , clgm . for practical cases at hand @xmath1 or 200 ) , the calculations use monte - carlo simulations with metropolis algorithm . \n we found that in lgm , as used in nuclear disintegration problems , there is no `` backbending '' in the caloric curve for systems as small as @xmath2kr whether in microcanonical or canonical treatments . by `` backbending '' \n one means an `` s '' shape when energy is plotted along the y - axis and temperature along the x - axis . since microcanonical treatments seem to lead to backbending for small systems ( 100 particles is small enough ) in other models @xcite , our findings need some clarification . \n motivated by this , we present here results for a very small system , 11 particles in @xmath0 lattice . here \n we can avoid monte - carlo samplings and do exact ( though it still requires some numerical work which is easy ) computations . \n the results are quite interesting and not only explain our previous findings but also shed light on several connections between microcanonical and canonical calculations . \n as our objective is solely pedagogical , we assume there is just one kind of particles ( nucleons ) . \n we take the number of particles to be 11 . \n the lattice space is @xmath0 . \n this then implies a freeze - out density 0.41@xmath3 which is somewhat higher than the freeze - out density used in lattice gas model calculations @xcite . \n the nearest neighbour bonds are attractive : @xmath4mev to get the nuclear matter binding energy correct . \n the nuclear lattice gas model which is denoted here by lgm is an extension of the standard textbook lattice gas model as discussed , for example , in @xcite . \n we denote the standard lattice gas model by slgm . \n the difference is simple : in slgm , the nucleons are frozen in their lattice sites . in lgm , dictated by the physics of the nuclear problem , \n they are given momenta . in clgm \n , these momenta are generated using a maxwell - boltzmann distribution . in mlgm , they are taken from a uniform distribution within a sphere in momentum space . \n the addition of kinetic energy , however , changes the caloric curve in an interesting and profound way \n . we will find it useful to discuss the caloric curves in both slgm and lgm . \n chronologically , it is easier to discuss slgm first , then point out how lgm modifies the results . in both the models \n the key quantities are @xmath5= the number of configurations with @xmath6 nearest neighbour bonds for the case of 11 particles in @xmath0 lattice sites . once these are known both canonical and microcanonical calculations are readily done . \n the degeneracy factors are given in the small table . \n they can be obtained with little effort in this simple case .

axis by @xmath12 . \n if one wants to define a temperature , the standard practice in the microcanonical model is to compute @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) . \n an inspection of fig.1 shows that as a function of excitation energy the temperature will rise first , approach @xmath14 , will then switch towards @xmath15 and as the excitation energy will further increase the temperature will approach 0 from the negative side . \n this happens because in slgm there is an upper bound to energy . \n this is of course well - known for spin 1/2 systems in a magnetic field if the kinetic energy of the spin system is suppressed @xcite . in nuclear shell model , for example , this will happen if one restricts oneself to limited shell model orbitals . \n this is well - known to practitioners @xcite .    the caloric curve in microcanonical slgm is shown in fig . \n in plotting this curve we used degeneracies of successive discrete points in the excitation energy and divided by @xmath16 to get the temperature . \n notice that in the positive side of the temperature there is no anomalous behaviour . \n if we plot @xmath9 along the y - axis and @xmath17 along the x - axis , there is a `` giant '' size backending at about half the excitation energy available to the system . \n but this is merely a reflection of the fact that the excitation energy available to the system is finite . \n this will drastically change in the nuclear lgm where availability of kinetic energy will remove the upper limit . \n for canonical calculation , we pick a positive temperature : to get the caloric curve we compute @xmath18 . subtracting out the ground state energy we obtain the plot in fig . \n the same procedure can be used for negative temperature . \n both are used in fig . \n the similarity between caloric curves calculated in the microcanonical and canonical models is obvious although there are quantitative differences . \n from slgm we now turn to nuclear lgm which serves as a model for nuclear disaasembly . \n this was the case presented in @xcite . \n the excitation energy can come from two sources now : kinetic and potential . \n consequently , we compute @xmath19 where @xmath20 is discrete and taken from the table and @xmath21 is taken to be the integral @xmath22 @xmath23 in our chosen case is 11 . \n now there is no upper limit to @xmath9 . in fig . \n 3 we have plotted @xmath19 . the most important difference from fig . 1 \n is that the negative temperature zone has completely disappeared . \n thus the difference in the caloric curves obtained from slgm and lgm will be profound . \n there are two ways one can calculate the temperature in the microcanonical model . \n one is the standard formula : @xmath24 where @xmath25 the other intuitive approach would be to make the following ansatz . \n although we are talking of one system only , formally eq . \n ( 5.2 ) is similar to that of two systems characterised by @xmath8 and @xmath26 which share energy with each other but are insulated from the rest of the universe so that the total energy @xmath9 does not change . \n if the systems characterised by @xmath8 and @xmath27 are large then the sum above would be dominated by the largest term in the sum which is obtained when the temperature of each subsystem is the same , i.e. , @xmath28 . \n we now use @xmath29 . \n this leads to @xmath30 . \n this @xmath31 and the standard definition of @xmath17 agree quite well as can be seen in fig.4 . \n notice also there is no backbending in the microcanonical caloric curve . \n if one wants to use the microcanonical nuclear lgm for practical calculations with nucleon numbers about 100 or higher and also wants to obtain a value for temperature , getting the temperature from kinetic energy is the only easy option .    in fig.4 \n we have also shown the caloric curve in nuclear lgm in the canonical model . \n this agrees with the microcanonical calculation quite well . \n in the particular example ( 11 particles in @xmath0 boxes in the nuclear lgm ) , one has exact expressions for microcanonical density of states . \n one can also compute numerically the canonical partition function . in nuclear physics one \n often has numerical values for canonical or grand canonical partition functions . \n the direct expression for the microcanonical density of state is usually intractable and in order to obtain a value one uses the saddle - point approximation @xcite . \n we can use the nuclear lgm to test the accuracy of the saddle - point approximation since here both the microcanonical density of state and the canonical partition function are directly calculable . \n the microcanonical density of states and the canonical partition function are related by @xmath32 . \n the inverse transformation is @xmath33 . \n the saddle -

to - light ratio , which is assumed to be uniform throughout a galaxy , contrary to what we should expect based on well known spatial variations of stellar population and dust properties . \n hence , resolving the distribution of stellar mass is crucial to properly measure total stellar mass and mass density and to start investigating the structure and dynamics of galaxies in an unbiased way . having access to the mass distribution also allows to address questions like : is there any relation between _ local _ stellar mass density and the _ local _ sed and physical properties _ within _ a galaxy , similarly to the relations observed _ globally _ ? \n if so , what does it tell us about the internal mechanisms of galaxy evolution ?    with these goals and questions in mind , we have developed a new method to build stellar mass maps of galaxies ( * ? ? ? \n * zcr09 hereafter ) , which we review in this contribution ( sec . 2 ) . \n we also present preliminary results on the colour - stellar mass density relation within galaxies for a small sample of different morphological types ( sec . \n as described in zcr09 , our goal is to provide a computationally fast and observationally cheap method to obtain stellar mass maps . \n we express the surface stellar mass density at any given position @xmath2 of a galaxy as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the surface brightness in the chosen ` luminance ' band of effective wavelength @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the corresponding effective m / l ratio . in turn \n , we want to express @xmath7 as a function of colour indexes . despite the diversity of stellar population parameters and dust properties , \n if the luminance band and the colour indexes are appropriately chosen , the scatter of @xmath7 as a function of colour(s ) can be reasonably small ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n we choose the @xmath8 band ( largely equivalent to @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) as luminance band and we use @xmath0 and @xmath1 colour indexes to predict m / l@xmath11 . \n this choice is supported by the fact that m / l variations in nir are minimal with respect to shorter wavelengths , while these two colours are the best combination in terms of sensitivity and wavelength leverage . based upon the 2007 version of the @xcite code , which implements updated prescriptions for the tp - agb stellar evolutionary phase according to @xcite \n , we build a monte carlo library of 50,000 stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models with a variety of star formation histories , both continuous and bursty , metallicities and dust attenuations  la @xcite . in this way \n we mean to cover as uniformly as possible the parameter space occupied by individual regions in galaxies on scales of @xmath12  pc , from old , metal - rich bulges / spheroids , to young spiral arms with different degrees of dust absorption . then we bin the models in cells of @xmath13  mag@xmath14 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 and for each cell we consider the median m / l@xmath11 . \n this look - up table is then used to assign the median - likelihood m / l to each pixel in a galaxy , depending on its colours . \n our approach is therefore bayesian rather than frequentist and , as such , depends to some extent on the chosen prior distribution of models : a different choice of sfhs in particular can affect the m / l of the bluest stellar populations ( see zcr09 for a detailed discussion ) . \n we confirm ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) that the treatment of the tp - agb phase in the sps models has a great systematic impact on the resulting colours and m / l in nir , but this is mainly limited to young / blue stellar populations . \n apart from systematic effects , we find that the confidence half - range for the m / l is @xmath15% over most of the colour space , with the notable exception of the stellar populations with ages @xmath16  gyr , where the stellar evolution is very rapid and results in larger ranges , up to a factor 2 . \n the use of two colours is crucial to obtain such accurate estimates : by neglecting the dependence on @xmath1 one would easily over / under - estimate the m / l by a factor 2 to 3.-band and the @xmath0 colour as m / l predictor gives results that are in very good agreement with those based on @xmath17 in most cases , except in stellar populations dominated by a very young burst or with very large extinction . ]    to test our stellar mass mapping method we select a sample of 9 nearby galaxies , which are also part of the sings survey @xcite and for which optical sdss imaging and medium - deep nir imaging ( either from gold mine , @xcite , or ukidss , @xcite ) are available . \n the sample spans all range of morphologies , from ellipticals to late spirals . as fluxes and colours in individual pixels \n have to be accurate at few percent level in order for our method to work , it is necessary to pre - process the images to ensure that sufficiently high s / n can be reached also in the regions with surface brightness as low as 24 - 25 mag@xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 . \n this is done using a newly developed adaptive smoothing code adaptsmooth ( zibetti in prep . , zcr09 ) , which preserves the maximum spatial resolution compatible with the requested s / n . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows the maps of effective @xmath20 for the 9 galaxies of the sample . \n earlier type galaxies have more uniform and higher \n m / l , on average . \n the young stellar populations that characterize spiral arms result in lower m / l ratios , which in turn decrease the spiral arm contrast . \n the resulting stellar mass maps reveal that the structure of spiral galaxies is significantly smoother than it appears at any optical or nir wavelength . \n the colour gradients , especially visible in spiral galaxies , result in m / l gradients , which in turn affect the structural parameters and make them differ from the ones derived from light distribution . \n in particular , the effective radius of spirals is smaller when the stellar mass distribution is used .    in fig . \n [ fig1 ] one can see lanes of much higher m / l ( especially ngc4569 and ngc4536 ) , which correspond to dust lanes . \n these regions can hide a significant amount of stellar mass , although the emerging light hardly affects the global luminosity and colours of the galaxy . \n as we show in zcr09 , this causes stellar masses obtained from global photometry to be biased low with respect to what one gets from integrating resolved stellar mass maps : the latter may miss up to 40% of the total stellar mass of a galaxy if dust obscured regions are very extended ( as in ngc4569 and ngc4536 ) . \n based on the analysis of the previous section , we study the correlation between colours ( namely the optical @xmath0 ) and the surface stellar mass density _ within _ each galaxy . \n the distribution of pixels as a function of these two quantities are shown in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , where the grey scale denotes the density of pixels . as a general result \n , we see that the colour positively correlates with surface stellar mass density : galaxies are redder in higher density regions . \n although this holds for all galaxies , the slope and the dispersion of the correlation varies a lot along the morphological sequence . for a typical elliptical galaxy \n the relation is very flat and very tight ( consistent with a scatter due to photometric errors only ) . \n as we move to later types the colour - mass relation steepens , with low - density regions becoming increasingly bluer , while the highest density regions have roughly constant red colours . \n we can interpret this as a sign that star formation prefers low density and that the colour - morphology relation is mainly set by the relative weight of the younger stellar populations in the lower density regions with respect to the red high - density ` cores ' . \n in addition , we see that the scatter around the mean relation increases going to later types , which have a more disomogeneous distribution of physical properties at given surface mass density . \n the presence of dust also increases the scatter , especially at high surface mass density . \n these preliminary results based on a small sample of only 9 galaxies will be put on a much more solid ground , both from the statistical and physical point of view , by the forthcoming analysis of a larger sample of galaxies for which multiwavelength observations , from uv to radio , are available .", "StartTimeOffset": 982871400024, "RequestID": "4ebfed5f8cdbc96dee60a3920935936d1d5d18ec", "TotalTokens": 2126}

it is impossible to determine the contribution coming from each component . in particular \n it is impossible to determine the negative energy density arising from the casimir effect or dark radiation and positive energy density arising from radiation because they scale with respect to redshift in the same way in the friedmann equation . \n we note that the cmbr and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn

follows . \n the casimir effect is a simple observational consequence of the existence of quantum fluctuation @xcite . \n the casimir force between conducting plates leads to a repulsive force , like the positive cosmological constant . \n moreover , different laboratory experiments were designed to measure the casimir affect with increased precision and thus strengthen the constraints on corrections to newtonian gravitational law @xcite . for a survey of recently obtained results in casimir - energy studies see @xcite . for our purpose , it is important that the effect of casimir energy , which scales like radiation , can contribute into the @xmath4 relation  crucial for any kinematical test . \n it is also interesting that the same type of contribution to the effective energy density can be produced by loop quantum theory effects in semi - classical quantum cosmology @xcite . \n these effects give rise to an evolutionary scenario in which the initial singularity is

observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 abundances @xcite . \n let us consider newtonian cosmology following senovilla et al . \n . then we can define , following the authors , a homogeneous newtonian cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 having no spatial dependence , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and we require that the velocity vector fields depends linearly on the spatial coordinates . \n then the equation

the effect of rotation produces a negative term in the newtonian analogue of the friedmann equation .    in the newtonian cosmology in contrast to general relativity rotation \n can appear in homogenous and isotropic space . \n in general relativity the effect of rotation are strictly related to non - vanishing shear . \n the homogeneous universe with non - vanishing shear may expand and

this value is used for calculation of coordinate distance for snia belonging to this sample . in turn \n the value @xmath36 was assumed in the calculations of the coordinate distance for snia belonging to astier et  al.s sample , because the distance moduli @xmath22 presented in ref . \n 8) was calculated with such an arbitrary value of @xmath36 . \n the error of the coordinate distance

bounces ( @xmath64 ) appear for @xmath65 . in this case \n , the bbn epoch never occurs and all bbn predictions would be lost .    to obtain stronger constraints on the model parameters , \n it is useful to use the cmbr observations . \n the hotter and colder spots in the cmbr can be interpreted as acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma during the last scattering . \n it is very

{"ContextTokens": 2606, "GeneratedTokens": 246, "SynthesizedBody": "at a distance of about 2  mpc @xcite , the irregular galaxy ngc  1569 is one of the nearest starbursts @xcite . \n it is rich in ionized and neutral gas , and recently underwent a global starburst that lasted at least 100  myr and ended 510  myr ago @xcite . \n the starburst produced numerous hii regions and young star clusters , and still drives an x - ray superwind @xcite . \n one of the most notable features of the starburst is the super star clusters ( sscs ) near the center of the galaxy @xcite . \n they are some of the nearest and earliest - known examples of young , massive , compact star clusters . \n these sscs , which may evolve into clusters resembling present - day globulars @xcite , have been found in all types of starburst environments , from dwarf irregulars to galaxy mergers . \n we obtained spectra and images of the sscs in ngc  1569 on january 17 , 2000 ut using the near - infrared spectrometer nirspec on the keck ii telescope at the w. m. keck observatory . \n the night was photometric , with seeing of about @xmath4 . \n the _ k_-band image ( taken with the n7 filter by nirspec s slit - viewing camera ) in fig . \n [ kimage ] shows the brightest central sscs of which we obtained _ \n k_-band spectra ( 2.032.47  @xmath5 m ) , along with many other clusters and stellar sources . for the brightest clusters , \n sscs a and b , we also obtained _ h_-band spectra ( 1.491.78  @xmath5 m ) .     seeing . \n clusters for which spectra were obtained are labeled ]    date were reduced in the usual fashion , and the optimally extracted _ \n k_-band spectra are shown in fig . \n [ spectra]a . \n the strongest features in _ \n k _ band are the co first overtone bands longward of 2.295  @xmath5 m . \n these saturated bands are found in the cool atmospheres of supergiants and giants . \n their presence implies that the clusters contain stars that are at least 6 or 7  myr old , since that much time is required before the most massive stars evolve off of the main sequence . \n stellar evolution models for a simple stellar population predict that the hot blue stars capable of driving nebular emission will have completely evolved off of the main sequence by the time red supergiants appear . thus the conjunction of strong co bands together with weak br@xmath6 and he emission in the spectra of clusters a and c1 suggests that they are not instantaneous bursts . in the case of cluster c1 \n we believe that the weak emission lines are explained by contamination from a nearby hii region @xcite . \n the weak nebular emission from ssc a ( a double cluster @xcite ) is likely due to the wolf - rayet stars known to be present there @xcite . \n thus the spectrum of ssc a can not be explained with a single simple stellar population according to current population synthesis models . \n cluster c2 , on the other hand , shows both br@xmath6 and hei in absorption , which may be due to a much older population dominated by a stars and red giants .     and \n he emission , while c2 shows both of these in absorption . \n ( * b * ) _ h_-band spectra of sscs a and b with slopes removed , compared with the spectrum of a k1.5 ib supergiant @xcite . note the correspondence of features between star and cluster spectra , and the richness of _ h _ band ]    optimally extracted _ \n h_-band spectra of sscs a and b are shown in fig . \n [ spectra]b , together with the spectrum of a k1.5 ib supergiant from the kpno stellar atlases @xcite . \n a comparison of the star and cluster spectra reveals that most of the features in the cluster spectra are real , not noise , and that _ \n photospheric spectra are remarkably rich in strong metallic and molecular features . \n only the co bands stand out in the _ k_-band spectra , while many metal features in _ h _ band are as strong as the second overtone co bands . \n most of the features in _ \n band are blends of lines from co , oh , and metals such as fe , si , al , and mg . \n the most massive , evolved members of a single - aged stellar population tend to dominate its integrated light . \n thus the simplest approach to interpreting the integrated light may be to ask , what is the dominant spectral type of the cluster ? \n we attempt to characterize a cluster by an effective spectral type by fitting its _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra to a grid of nextgen model atmospheres @xcite , in order to determine an effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity for each object . \n the nextgen atmospheres were available for spherically symmetric giant stars with a range in t@xmath2 of 3000  k to 6800  k , a range in @xmath7 of 0.0 to 3.5 , and metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath8 0.0 ( solar ) , @xmath90.3 , @xmath90.5 , and @xmath90.7 . \n we first test the utility of this procedure by fitting the model atmospheres to an empirical spectrum of a star of known spectral type to evaluate the precision and accuracy with which it selects the atmospheric parameters . \n [ chi2]a shows the resulting @xmath10 contours for a fit to a solar - metallicity k1.5  ib spectrum . \n the resulting parameters , t@xmath11  k and @xmath12 , are a good match to those of the star . both _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra were required in order to remove degeneracies in the fits . \n contours for fit of nextgen models for : ( * a * ) spectrum of a k1.5 ib star ; ( * b * ) ssc  b ; ( * c * ) ssc  a. white filled contour indicates 1  sigma confidence level , and line contours represent 90 , 95 , and 99% confidence limits . \n best - fit parameters for ssc b imply an effective spectral type for the cluster light of k0 supergiant . \n best - fit parameters for ssc a imply an effective spectral type for the cluster light of g5 supergiant with @xmath13 . \n the temperature and range of @xmath7 are consistent with a mixed population of stars , either two short bursts or an extended epoch of star formation ]    next we fit the nextgen atmospheres at metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ( which is closest to that of ngc  1569 , [ fe / h ] @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite ) to the _ h _ + _ k _ spectra of the brightest _ \n k_-band cluster , ssc b. the resulting @xmath10 contours in fig . \n [ chi2]b have the same shape as those found for the star in fig . \n [ chi2]a , indicating that the light of cluster b is heavily dominated by stars with a very narrow range in spectral type . \n the effective spectral type for ssc b is that of a k0 supergiant , with t@xmath11  k and @xmath17 .    for the double cluster , ssc a , the @xmath10 contours are less tightly constrained in the fit parameters than for ssc b. fig . \n [ chi2]c shows them to be centered at a hotter t@xmath18  k and larger range of @xmath19 , typical for stars of types g5 i and g5 iii . \n it is unlikely , however , that such stars dominate the cluster s emission , since optical / uv evidence indicates that hot blue wolf - rayet stars are present together with the red evolved stars creating the strong infrared co bands . \n thus the inferred effective spectral type determined from the stellar atmospheres may simply result from the superposition of the two distinct populations . \n since a cluster consists of stars with a range of stellar masses , luminosities , and temperatures , it is more informative to model the integrated population directly than to focus on its effective spectral type . \n thus we employ the technique of population synthesis to calculate the distribution of stars in the h - r diagram of a cluster as a function of time . \n we then calculate the integrated spectrum of the cluster by adding the appropriate numbers of stellar spectra  either empirical spectra or model atmospheres .      all models in this paper \n were constructed using the updated evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 @xcite . \n the code incorporates the most recent stellar evolutionary tracks from the geneva group at metallicities ranging from very metal - poor , to twice solar metallicity @xcite , and it has been updated to allow the use of isochrone synthesis . \n starburst99 is a particular set of synthesis models which are optimized to reproduce properties of galaxies with active star formation , so it puts most of the emphasis on early evolutionary phases . \n later phases , like agb stars or white dwarfs , are covered only crudely or not at all . \n origlia et al . \n @xcite show that low - metallicity tracks do not reproduce the co 1.62  @xmath5 m and co 2.29  @xmath5 m indices of young lmc clusters \n . however , if the fraction of time spent as a rsg during the core - helium phase is forced to at least 50% , and if the rsg temperature is maintained to less than 4000  k , the models agree well with the observations . \n our modeling technique was modified according to this prescription ( leitherer , private communication , 2000 ) .    in order to generate model cluster spectra \n , we combine the starburst99 models with the empirical libraries of stellar spectra obtained at kitt peak by wallace & hinkle @xcite and meyer et  al . \n for a given cluster population , we add up the spectra of component stars , and include nebular continuum emission ( but not the recombination lines ) based on the number of ionizing photons predicted for the cluster . thus we generate a time series of model cluster spectra such as that shown in fig . \n [ mod]a for a 10@xmath20  m@xmath21 cluster with salpeter imf ranging from 0.1 to 100  m@xmath21 . for the first few myr , \n nebular emission powered by the hottest stars dilutes the photospheric emission from the cluster , but by an age of 67  myr , the most massive stars have evolved off of the main sequence to become red supergiants , whose spectra are marked by deep co bands .    finally , we can place observed cluster spectra in an evolutionary sequence by fitting them to the model sequences . \n figure  [ mod]b displays the _ h_-band spectra of sscs a and b together with the three model cluster spectra ( 15 , 18 , and 21 myr ) which most closely resemble the observations . note the correspondence between features and the decrease in their strength with time . since the models are for solar metallicity clusters , they presumably have stronger metal features at a given age than expected for a lower - metallicity cluster . \n thus the age estimates we derive from these models will be too large during this epoch of the cluster s evolution . \n we have presented new high - quality near - infrared spectra of several of the sscs in the nearby irregular starburst , ngc  1569 , and demonstrated the utility of the rich _ h_-band spectral region for modeling stellar populations . we found that combining _ h_- and _ k_-band spectra removed some of the degeneracy in fitting just one band to model spectra . \n we used population synthesis models together with model stellar atmospheres and empirical stellar spectra to fit for the effective spectral type of a cluster , and to generate sequences of synthetic cluster spectra to help determine the ages of observed clusters . \n since the empirical libraries are only complete for solar metallicity , we are constructing models that use model atmospheres at lower metallicities that are more appropriate for systems like ngc  1569 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1001209196862, "RequestID": "e82b70cf58c6cd1cc247d6518d483a4548266212", "TotalTokens": 2852}
{"ContextTokens": 3487, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "the temperature of interstellar dust grains has been calculated by various authors many times , starting in the 1940s ( see discussion in van de hulst  @xcite ) . in the calculations \n one always assumed that the particles were spheres ( see , e.g. , mathis et al . \n @xcite ) . however , it is well known since the discovery of interstellar polarization ( hiltner  @xcite ; hall  @xcite ; dombrovski  @xcite ) that the non - spherical grains should exist in the interstellar medium . \n the first and single attempt to study the shape effects on grain temperature was made by greenberg & shah  ( @xcite ) . \n they considered metallic and dielectric rayleigh spheroids and infinitely long icy cylinders of radius 0.1 @xmath1 m . \n their conclusion that non - spherical particles are about 10% cooler than spheres is the result even included in textbooks ( see whittet  @xcite ) . \n the calculation of the dust temperature is an essential step in any modelling of infrared ( ir ) emission from dust shells and discs , interstellar clouds , and galaxies . \n the dust temperature is included into the expressions for the determination of dust mass and cooling processes . \n the temperature of particles is also important for the process of molecule formation on grains .    in this letter \n , we estimate the particle shape effects on the interstellar grain temperature . \n calculations are made for compact homogeneous prolate and oblate spheroids of different semiaxes ratios , sizes and compositions . \n let us consider an interstellar grain in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings . in the isotropic radiation field \n the grain temperature @xmath2 can be obtained as a solution of the energy balance equation for absorbed and emitted energy [ in ergs@xmath3 ^_0 _ abs  4j_^isrf d= ^_0 _ em  4b_(t_d ) d , [ eq1 ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the absorption and emission cross - sections averaged over orientation and @xmath6 the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) [ in erg@xmath7s@xmath8@xmath1m@xmath3 . \n we suppose that the grains are prolate or oblate homogeneous spheroids with the aspect ratio @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the major and minor semiaxes of a spheroid , respectively ) . \n we characterize the particle size by the radius @xmath12 of the sphere whose volume is equal to that of a spheroid . \n the major semiaxis of the spheroid is connected with @xmath12 as follows : a = r_v ( a / b)^2/3 for prolate spheroids and a = r_v ( a / b)^1/3 for oblate ones . in our calculations , particles with sizes @xmath13 are considered .    under interstellar conditions \n , we can generally assume that the incident radiation is non - polarized and the grains are arbitrarily oriented in space ( 3d - orientation ) . \n then the mean absorption cross - sections can be found as _ \n abs = ^/2_0 g ( ) d.

spherical particles are rather small as it is the case for spherical grains . \n the shape effects are the most prominent in the case of grains consisting of absorbing materials ( see figs . \n [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] ) . \n such particles emit more radiation at long wavelengths where the imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath34 is large and increases significantly with wavelength ( excluding ac1 ) . in comparison with other materials presented in fig . \n [ f1 ] , the iron particles absorb much more radiation at visual wavelengths . for intermediate values of @xmath9 , \n the emissive capacity of spheroids is almost the same as for spheres and therefore spheroids have larger temperatures . \n this explains the peculiar curves for iron in fig . \n note also that for extremely prolate or oblate particles the decrease of the temperature with the growth @xmath9 ceases . \n for example , for prolate particles from cel1000 the ratio @xmath35 + @xmath36 0.51 , 0.38 , 0.28 and 0.26 if @xmath37 and 100 , respectively . \n the behaviour of @xmath34 for all silicates is rather similar and the values of @xmath34 in the ir are usually smaller than for materials with metallic properties . as a result , \n the ratio @xmath38 changes in narrower limits in fig . \n [ f2 ] in comparison with fig . \n [ f1 ] . \n the behaviour similar to described above is kept when the incident radiation is slightly polarized ( @xmath39 ) or its spectral distribution changes due to attenuation of the uv field and other components in eq . \n ( [ isrf ] ) . in both cases \n the relative changes of the ratio of temperatures remain in the limits smaller than 5% . \n the alignment of dust grains does not affect strongly the temperature of non - spherical interstellar grains . \n its influence becomes more important for particles immersed in an anisotropic radiation field like in circumstellar shells ( especially in the case of oblate grains , see voshchinnikov & semenov  @xcite for discussion ) . \n a similar situation exists near the the edges of dark interstellar clouds . for a fixed @xmath12 the difference in temperatures of porous spherical and non - spherical particles is smaller than for compact ones . \n the temperature of interstellar dust grains can be found by fitting the galactic ir emission by modified blackbody curves . \n the dust emission spectrum obtained from cobe data for dust associated with hi gas can be represented by a single modified blackbody curve with @xmath40 ( boulanger et al . \n @xcite ) . in order to compare the observationally - based emissivity law with dust models , the shape , size , and porosity distribution of the particles have to be taken into account . \n it is not the goal of this paper to perform such an analysis , but to provide necessary input data . from table  1 \n , it can be clearly seen that the temperature of refractory spheroidal grains with @xmath41 ranges between 12.1k and 15.7k , lower than predicted by the observations . \n the steady - state temperature of grains also dictates the efficiency of the process of molecule formation on grain surfaces . as it is shown by pirronello et al . \n ( @xcite ) , the decrease of a grain temperature by 20  30% can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen recombination by 2  4 times . \n in the conditions typical of the interstellar radiation field the temperature of the non - spherical ( spheroidal ) grains deviates from that of spheres of the same volume less than 10% if the aspect ratios @xmath0 . \n more elongated or flattened particles are usually cooler than spheres and in some cases the temperatures may differ by a factor 2 and more . \n the shape effects are almost independent of particle size but increase with the growth of the material absorption in the infrared ( i.e. , they are more important for carbonaceous and metallic particles than for silicates and ices ) . in dark interstellar clouds the non - spherical particles \n will be cooler than spheres , facilitating the molecule formation on grain surfaces . \n boulanger f. , abergel a. , bernard j .- \n , et al . , 1996 , \n a&a 312 , 256 dombrovski v.a . , 1949 , doklady akad . \n nauk armenia , 10 , 199 greenberg j.m . , 1968 , in : middlehurst b.m . , aller l.h . \n ( eds . ) , stars and stellar systems . \n vii , uni . \n chicago press , p.  221 \n greenberg j.m . , 1971 , a&a 12 , 240 greenberg j.m . , \n shah g.a . , 1971 , a&a 12 , 250 hall j.s . , 1949 , \n science 109 , 166 henning th . \n , 1998 , chem . soc . \n 27 , 315 henning th . \n , ilin v.b . \n , krivova n.a . , et al . , 1999 , \n a&as 136 , 405 hiltner w.a . , 1949 , \n science 109 , 165 ilin v.b . \n , voshchinnikov n.v . , 1998 , a&as 128 , 187 jger c. , mutschke h. , henning th . , 1998 , a&a 332 , 291 mathis j.s . , mezger p.g \n , panagia n. , 1983 , a&a 128 , 212 mezger p.g . , mathis j.s . , panagia n. , 1982 , a&a 105 , 372 ossenkopf v. , henning th . \n , mathis j.s . , 1992 , a&a 261 , 567 pirronello v. , liu c. , roser j.e . \n , vidali g. , 1999 , a&a 344 , 681 van de hulst h.c . , 1949 , rech . \n utrecht 11 , pt . 2 voshchinnikov n.v . , \n farafonov v.g . , 1993 , \n ap&ss 204 , 19 voshchinnikov n.v . \n , semenov d.a . , 1999 , \n , in preparation voshchinnikov n.v . , \n ilin v.b . , henning th . , et al . , 1999 , jqsrt , in press whittet d.c.b . , 1992 , \n dust in the galactic environments , institute of physics publishing , new york", "StartTimeOffset": 1011321233076, "RequestID": "d443cc8c0d758c50c313fc704876f4e84a9254c4", "TotalTokens": 3607}
{"ContextTokens": 2695, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "one approach for probing light curves which has received attention  @xcite is to express them as a series of displaced pulses , each with a parametric form . \n there is an appeal to this approach because fitting routines are well - understood and interpretations of rise time , decay time , full width at half max , etc , are possible . on the other hand \n , one must make certain assumptions when using the pulse - fitting procedure such as the choice of the functional form to use for an individual pulse and the number of parameters to be included in the fitting function . \n moreover , light with high variability at low power may show variations which are not statistically significant . \n a complementary approach using a wavelet - based analysis of a set of both long and short grb light curves is discussed by  @xcite in which a time scale , @xmath0 , is identified that marks the transition from white noise to a power law in the power density spectrum ( a @xmath1 behavior ) . \n it is argued that over time scales smaller than @xmath0 the light curves appear stochastic and signal power is distributed uniformly . at time scales larger than @xmath0 , identifiable structures ( such as pulses ) with signal power are no longer distributed uniformly over the periods of light variation . for this reason @xmath0 \n is referred to as the _ minimum variability time scale_.    the analysis presented in  @xcite is a non - parametric approach to probing light curves for time scales . \n it makes no assumptions about the nature of the structures in a given light curve that give rise to the @xmath1 character . \n the technique , however , offers no firm connection between @xmath0 and the constituent structures although it seems reasonable to associate @xmath0 with the scale of the smallest emitting structures present . \n results from an application of a log - normal pulse - fitting procedure to grb light curves have been published by  @xcite . in this paper \n we make a meta - analysis of the timing results presented by  @xcite compared with the techniques of  @xcite for a set of 34 grbs used in both studies . \n we begin by considering the relation between @xmath0 and the pulse parameters given in table 3 of  @xcite . \n the parameters with temporal units in table 3 are : _ time - since - trigger _ , _ rise time _ , _ decay time _ , and _ fwhm_. in all , 34 grbs comprising 379 pulses are considered here . \n we note that rise time , decay time , and fwhm as presented in table 3 of  @xcite are tightly correlated and for the argument that follows are interchangeable without affecting the conclusions . \n however , we use rise time to make our argument because , as  @xcite noted , rise times are observed to be shorter than decay time and fwhm ( see table 3 in  @xcite ) . \n we considered only those light curves from nai detectors and summed over the energy acceptance as in table 3 of  @xcite and in  @xcite .    in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] we plot the rise time for all 379 pulses ( 34 grbs ) along the vertical axis and @xmath0 along the horizontal . \n note that for each grb for which one @xmath0 is computed , there is a possibility for multiple pulses and therefore multiple rise times , hence the vertical columns of rise times for a single value of @xmath0 . \n for a given column of pulse times the shortest pulse rise times are at the bottom and one finds larger rise times by moving up the column . \n an equality line is also shown which is the locus where @xmath0 equals rise time . \n arguing as we do that @xmath0 represents the minimum variability time scale the space in the @xmath0-rise time plane below the equality line should be interpreted as a structureless white noise region . \n if some method were capable of discerning light curve structure in the region we define as white noise , then our assertion of having found a minimum variability time scale will have been disproven . indeed , in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] there are 27 pulses with rise times below the equality line . \n the uncertainties accompanying these 27 rise times are small , making their intrusion into the white noise region significant .    [ \n cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : goodshortrisetimes ]    however , a closer inspection of table 3 of  @xcite reveals that there are 20 light pulses in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] with rise times that are _ smaller _ than the smallest bin widths , in some cases smaller by factors of ten or a hundred . \n moreover , of those 20 pulses there are 16 pulses in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] with full widths at half max that are _ smaller _ than the smallest bin widths and indeed those 16 all fall below the equality line . \n while it seems that inclusion of these pulses in table 3 is important for the sake of completeness , we question the physical reality of these pulses . \n note that in  @xcite all light curves are binned at 200 microseconds . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] shows the effect of removing the 20 non - physical pulses . \n = rise time . \n we identify the area below the line with white noise . \n the data are expected to press up against the line from above but not to cross it . \n , width=317 ]        note that in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] the white noise region has been vacated by all but seven points and none of the pulse rise times above the equality line have been disturbed by the bin width cut . for the seven points that remain beneath the equality line , \n we show in table  [ table : goodshortrisetimes ] that six are within one sigma of the equality line . \n we make one other point regarding the pulse rise times in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errsnocuts ] and fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_errs ] , in particular regarding the size of the uncertainties . of the 379 pulse rise times reported by  @xcite and \n used for this meta - analysis , 301 have uncertainties smaller than the binning of the light curve , in some cases hundreds or thousands of times smaller . \n we argue that a conservative estimate of the uncertainties for the pulse rise times should be no smaller than a bin width . \n thus , we add in quadrature a bin width ( as reported in table 3 of  @xcite ) to the rise time uncertainties ( also reported in table 3 of  @xcite ) and plot the result in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrs ] .    in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrsmin ] we plot only the smallest rise times for each grb against @xmath0 . \n we argue that by rejecting pulse rise times smaller than light curve bin widths and by folding rise time uncertainties with a bin width we get strong evidence that @xcite and @xcite have tracked the same physical observables over approximately three orders of magnitude using independent methods .    . \n we have folded a single bin width into the rise time uncertainties.,width=317 ]     but with only smallest rise times included . \n note that the equality line between @xmath0 and rise time marks a boundary between scaling processes and white noise and gives substance to the interpretation of the minimum variability time scale.,width=317 ] \n for a large sample of short and long fermi gbm bursts , @xcite used a technique based on wavelets to determine the minimum variability time scale , @xmath0 . \n the authors associate this time scale with a transition from red - noise processes to parts of the power spectrum dominated by white noise or random noise components . \n accordingly , the authors note that this time scale is the shortest resolvable variability time for physical processes intrinsic to the grb . \n in addition , histograms of the values of @xmath0 for long and short grbs were shown to exhibit a clear temporal offset in the mean @xmath0 values for long and short grbs .    in a separate analysis , using a particular functional form for pulse shapes , @xcite have extracted an extensive set of key pulse parameters such as rise times , decay times , widths ( fwhm ) , and times since trigger for a host of bright grbs detected by fermi / gbm . using the fwhm values \n , these authors also reported a significant temporal offset between the mean values for long and short grbs . \n although neither group offers a concrete explanation for the temporal difference between the distributions of long and short grbs , it is noteworthy that they arrive at a result which is quantitatively in good agreement with one another , especially having used independent approaches . both sets of analyses also suggest scaling trends between characteristic timescales . in the case of minimum variability timescales the trend is between @xmath0 and the duration of the burst , typically denoted by @xmath2 . for the pulse - shape analysis , the trend is more readily evident and is demonstrated through a number of positive correlations involving key parameters such as rise times , decay times and fwhm times . \n it is relatively straightforward to interpret the scaling trends in terms of the internal shock model in which the basic units of emission are assumed to be pulses that are produced via the collision of relativistic shells emitted by the central engine . in the case of the pulse - fitting method \n this is essentially the default assumption . \n indeed , @xcite in their study of the brightest batse bursts with @xmath3 sec were the first to demonstrate this explicitly by identifying and fitting distinct pulses and showing a strong positive correlation between the number of pulses and the duration of the burst . \n more recent studies ,  @xcite have provided further evidence for the pulse paradigm view of the prompt emission in grbs . \n the wavelet analysis does not , however , rely on identifying distinct pulses but instead uses the multiresolution capacity of the wavelet technique to resolve the smallest temporal scale present in the prompt emission . \n nonetheless , as  @xcite have demonstrated , if the smallest temporal scale is due to pulse emissions , then we can still get a measure of the upper bound on the number of pulses in a given burst through the ratio @xmath4 \n . in the simple model in which a pulse is produced every time two shells collide , the ratio @xmath4 , should show a correlation with the duration of the burst . \n indeed , this correlation was reported by @xcite . \n the similar trends of scaling demonstrated by these two methods , not only suggest the robustness of both methods , but also point , perhaps more importantly , to an underlying interconnection between key parameters extracted by the two techniques . \n in other words , the minimum variability time scale extracted by the wavelet technique is directly related to key pulse time parameters such as rise times ( as depicted in fig . \n [ fig : mts_rise_combquaderrsmin ] ) , under suitably controlled pulse - fitting methods . \n through a meta - analysis of results presented by @xcite and by @xcite , we have studied the relationship between key parameters that describe the temporal properties of a sample of prompt - emission light curves for long and short - duration grbs detected by the fermi / gbm mission . \n we compare the minimum variability timescale extracted through a technique based on wavelets , with the pulse - time parameters extracted through a pulse - fitting procedure . \n our main results are summarized as follows :    \\a ) both methods indicate a temporal offset between short and long - duration bursts . \n the quantitative agreement between the two methods is quite good . \n \\b ) both methods point to scaling trends between characteristic timescales . in the case of the pulse - fitting method \n the scaling appears to involve parameters such as rise times , fwhm , and pulse intervals . for the wavelet technique , \n the scaling involves a correlation between the minimum variability time scale and the duration of the bursts . \n \\c ) by demonstrating a strong positive correlation between @xmath0 and the rise time of the shortest fitted pulses , we provide for the first time , a direct link between the shortest resolvable temporal structure in a grb light curve with that of a key pulse profile parameter . \n \\d ) by combining the two techniques , we have shown that one can arrive at a much tighter demarcation of the boundary between the power spectrum domains that separate red noise and white noise processes . \n the nasa grant nnx11ae36 g provided partial support for this work and is gratefully acknowledged . \n the authors , in particular gam and ksd , acknowledge very useful discussions with jon hakkila and narayan bhat .", "StartTimeOffset": 1021286386398, "RequestID": "674870f86bd3bc312607304e053e1aaa093a027b", "TotalTokens": 2815}

proton run was done on january 2004 at 2.2gev , to measure the @xmath3 reaction through an exclusive reconstruction of the hadronic ( @xmath1 ) and the dielectron ( @xmath2 ) dalitz decays , whose branching ratios are known . \n this fact allows to use the @xmath3 channel as a calibration reaction for the dielectron identification , in order to normalize the dielectron yields in theavy ions experiments . \n the study of the @xmath0 meson is of particular interest for several reasons . in the vicinity of the threshold the production of the @xmath0 meson \n was studied extensively and the inclusive cross sections are well known@xcite , while at higher energies the uncertainties are larger . moreover the observed electron pair invariant mass distribution for the @xmath0 dalitz decay branch can be used to check contributions from other sources ( such as @xmath4 dalitz , combinatorial background , etc . ) as well as the lepton trigger efficiency . \n in addition , if both protons and both leptons are detected , the reconstruction of this decay mode is kinematically complete without requiring an additional photon detector , and a missing mass technique can be applied . \n this would allow to separate the @xmath0 dalitz from all other sources and to map the effective acceptance of the spectrometer . \n in hades , however , the main algorithm for particle identification requires a combination of momentum and time - of - flight measurements . in the pp experiment it was not possible to use a start detector as a time reference , because of the high number of secondaries produced . \n this means that there is no common start time reference for tracks in the same event , but in general the data acquisition is started by the fastest particle which crosses the time - of - flight wall . in this case \n we measure the difference in time with respect to the fastest particle , instead of the real time - of - flight . \n thus it was necessary to develop an algorithm to reconstruct the start time of the reaction , and make particle identification possible . \n + the used algorithm relies on identifying one particle in the event and calculate its theoretical time - of - flight : from the assumed mass and the measured momentum we calculate the time - of - flight of the particle , thus the offset to the real start time of the reaction . \n the first kind of identification comes from the cherenkov detector , which is hadron blind and can select electron / positron tracks . if a lepton candidate is not found , a negative charged track in the same event is assumed as a negative pion . \n finally , we recalculate the time - of - flight of the other particles inside the same event using the extrapolated reaction time . in this way we obtained an average time resolution of 340 ps and an efficiency of about 92% for events with a lepton , and a resolution of 440 ps and an efficiency of about 93% for events with a negative pion . \n + after the start time reconstruction it is possible to use the recalculated time - of - flight in order to identify particles , for exclusive analysis of @xmath0 decay channels . \n the main goal of the p+p experiment was to verify the dielectron reconstruction efficiency needed for a correct interpretation of the hi data , by means of the well known @xmath0 meson decays into hadronic@xcite and electromagnetic channels@xcite . in the simulation we assumed resonant production of the meson via @xmath5 , with the dalitz matrix element taken from ref .  . \n for the eta hadronic decay the matrix element from ref .   has been implemented , and for the @xmath0 dalitz decay the vector dominance model ( vdm ) was assumed . \n in addition a full cocktail of reaction channels based on measured proton -

particle missing mass we selected the @xmath8 reaction , @xmath9 being determined from a fit to the missing @xmath4 peak . \n the missing - mass resolution was further improved with a kinematical refit of the full event@xcite . \n finally , the @xmath0 mesons were identified in the two -

pion background . by fitting the distribution by means of a gaussian plus a background function , \n we obtain the value of the @xmath0 mass with a resolution of 2.5% , and evaluate the hadronic production yield . \n moreover , by fitting the pp missing mass peak in various @xmath10 slices@xcite , the angular distribution on the @xmath0 meson emission has been evaluated and compared to simulation , by using the anisotropic angular model verified by the disto collaboration@xcite(right plot of fig . \n [ etahad_plot ] ) . \n the two distributions are in agreement within error bars , showing that the hadron efficiency is understood in the covered phase space region . \n center -

sensitive experiments have provided precise information on charge distributions . on the other hand , it is much more difficult to deduce neutron density distributions , since electromagnetic interaction provides little information on neutron density distributions . the proton and neutron density distributions have a similar shape in stable nuclei . \n however in recent research it has been reported that in some unstable nuclei the differences between proton and neutron shapes are greater than those in stable nuclei  @xcite . \n it has also been indicated that the thickness of the neutron skin is closely related to the symmetry term of the equation of state  ( eos )  @xcite . \n thus , the determination of neutron density distributions has become increasingly important . \n there have been many experiments attempting to extract neutron and matter density distributions in the nuclear interior using hadronic probes  @xcite . \n pion and alpha elastic scattering have been performed in the study of neutron and matter density distributions  @xcite . \n compared with other hadronic probes , the elastic scattering of protons at intermediate energies is suitable for extracting information on the nuclear surface and interior , because at intermediate energies , proton elastic scattering has a simple reaction mechanism . to deduce nuclear densities using protons , the incident energy has to be sufficiently high to describe the scattering by the simple mechanism . at energies above 100  mev \n , we can explain proton elastic scattering microscopically , because the imaginary part of the optical potential describes a quasi - free process mainly without the need for a renormalization factor . \n so far , energies above 500  mev have been applied for proton elastic scattering to study neutron density distributions  @xcite . \n however , this energy is sufficiently high to produce mesons , and information on the nuclear interior is easily masked by the meson - productions . \n furthermore , the total cross section of nucleon - nucleon scattering shows a minimum at the incident energy of 300  mev . \n we thus adopt 300 mev protons in this work as probes for information on the nuclear interior .    in our previous papers \n @xcite , we tuned the effective relativistic love - franey interaction by introducing so - called medium effects for the scattering from a nucleus whose density distribution is well known . \n we used elastic scattering from @xmath2ni to tune the interaction , since @xmath2ni is the heaviest stable nucleus with n @xmath3 z and the density distribution of the neutrons in @xmath2ni can be assumed to be the same as that for the protons . to explain the results of our experiments we found that we had to modify the scattering amplitudes of the nucleon - nucleon interactions inside the nucleus as follows . \n we phenomenologically changed the masses and coupling constants of exchanged mesons depending on the nuclear density . \n thus , we could explain the scattering sufficiently well to deduce the matter density distribution precisely . \n for our first systematic search for neutron density distributions , we selected tin isotopes \n . tin has many stable isotopes  ( @xmath4sn-@xmath5sn ) . \n also , unstable tin isotopes have a long isotopic chain including two double - magic nuclei  ( @xmath6sn  [ n=50 ] , @xmath7sn  [ n=82 ] ) . \n moreover , its proton number is a magic number  ( z=50 ) . \n thus , tin isotopes are suitable for the study of systematic changes in neutron density distributions . \n the main purposes of this work are to attempt to deduce information on neutron density distributions , and to systematically study the neutron skin thickness of tin isotopes . the experimental setup and procedure \n are described in sec . \n details of the analysis used to deduce neutron density distributions are given in sec . \n the deduced radii of tin isotopes are discussed in sec . \n iv.a summary is given in sec . \n the measurements were performed at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) , osaka university . polarized protons from a high -

type beam - line polarimeters ( blps )  @xcite placed between the ring cyclotron and a scattering chamber . \n each polarimeter utilized left - right asymmetries in p - h scattering from ( ch@xmath8)@xmath9 foil to determine the vertical transverse component @xmath10 of the beam polarization . \n the typical beam polarization was 65% . \n then the beam was transported to a target center in the scattering chamber . \n the typical beam spot size on the target during measurements was 1  mm in diameter . \n finally , the beam was stopped by an internal faraday cup inside the scattering chamber in the case of forward -

momentum - transfer region , the multistep process may affect the angular distribution of elastic scattering  @xcite . to estimate the effect of multistep processes \n , we performed a coupled - channel calculation by using the coupled - channel code ecis95 written by raynal  @xcite . figure  [ coupling ] shows the calculated cross sections and analyzing powers with and without performing a coupled - channel calculation using the global potential  @xcite . the contribution from the coupled - channel calculation for @xmath2ni in the momentum transfer range from 0.7  @xmath1 to 3.5  @xmath1 is relatively small ( 1 - 2% ) , which is less than the uncertainty of the medium - effect parameter . in the case of the tin isotopes , \n the situation is similar to the case of @xmath2ni . \n thus , the effect from the coupled channel is masked by the uncertainties of our introduced medium effects in this analysis . \n also , the coupled - channel effect might be partly included in our parametrization because we aimed to phenomenologically reproduce the experimental data . \n thus , the effect of the coupled - channel is negligible and was not included explicitly in our analysis . \n coupled -

{"ContextTokens": 2599, "GeneratedTokens": 90, "SynthesizedBody": "during latest decades , we have seen large numbers of publications on the use of pareto - lev and other heavy - tailed distributions in finance ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references there ) . one of the key authors that initiated this , was mandelbrot . \n he mentioned that gaussian distribution can not provide a solid explanation for observed large amount of ` outliers ' - in other words , the number of observations for which absolute value of deviation from empirical mean is bigger than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is empirical variance . \n aparently , mandelbrot considered stable distributions as a unique alternative to gaussian family basing on the fact of classical limit theorem for independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables , or , equivalently , on stability property . in the remainder of this paper \n , we show that stable distributions can not explain such a large number of outliers either . \n the connection to classical limit theorem for a non - random number of random summands seems to be questionable . \n a more natural perspective comes from the use of limit theorem for a random number of random variables . \n in this section we look at the probability of observing outliers in the case of distributions belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable distribution . \n specifically , suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d . \n random variables . \n denote by @xmath3 their empirical mean and empirical variance correspondingly . \n let @xmath4 be a fixed number . \n we are interested in the following probability @xmath5 our aim here is to prove the following theorem . \n [ th1 ] suppose that @xmath2 is a sequence of i.i.d . \n random variables belonging to a domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index of stability @xmath6 . \n then @xmath7    since @xmath8 belong to the domain of attraction of strictly stable random variable with index @xmath9 , it is also true that @xmath10 belong to the domain of attraction of one - sided stable distribution with index @xmath11 . \n \\1 ) consider at first the case @xmath12 . in this case , \n @xmath13{}{\\longrightarrow } a={{\\rm i}\\kern-0.18em{\\rm e}}x_1 $ ] and @xmath14{}{\\longrightarrow } \\infty$ ] . \n we have @xmath15 @xmath16{}{\\longrightarrow } 0.\\ ] ]    \\2 ) suppose now that @xmath17 . in this case \n , we have @xmath18 as @xmath19 . here \n @xmath20 is @xmath21-stable random variable , and the sign @xmath22 is used for asymptotic equivalence . \n similarly , @xmath23 where @xmath24 has one - sided positive stable distribution with index @xmath11 . \n we have @xmath25 @xmath26{}{\\longrightarrow } 0.\\ ] ]    \\3 ) in the case @xmath27 we deal with cauchy distribution . \n the proof for this case is very similar to that in the case 2 ) . \n we omit the details . \n let us note that for the case of distributions having finite second moment and non - compact support , the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) has a positive limit as @xmath19 . \n indeed , if the second moment is finite then both @xmath28 and @xmath29 have finite limits @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n the probability ( [ eq1 ] ) converges to @xmath32 as @xmath19 because of non - compactness of support of the distribution . \n therefore , it is clear that the explanation of presence a large number of outliers can not be provided by the heaviness of the tails . \n although the results of section [ s2 ] show that asymptotically the probability of presence of a large number of outliers is negligible , we may still have doubts for not too large samples . \n however , the samples in practice are not too small . \n so , basing on actual observed data , we can consider the sample size @xmath33 of order @xmath34 as typical one . \n we simulated @xmath35 samples of size @xmath33 ( @xmath33 is growing from 1,000 to 25,000 with step 2,000 ) and calculated the estimate of probability @xmath36 given by ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath37 . \n the behavior of this probability as a function of @xmath33 is reflected on figure [ fig1 ] . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution . \n we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath38-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller that for gaussian case starting at about @xmath39 . \n therefore , we can not expect many outliers for such stable distribution for typical sample size .     for @xmath37 . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath38 ; red line -

to standard gaussian distribution . \n we see that the probability @xmath36 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution becomes smaller than that for gaussian case starting from about @xmath42 . \n the decrease of @xmath36 for the case @xmath37 is much slower . \n for example , @xmath43 for @xmath41-stable symmetric distribution versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution . \n in this situation , we can not say that stable distribution provides less outliers that gaussian law . \n but will the corresponding number of outliers be sufficient for the predicted figures to be in agreement with observed data ? \n unfortunately , there are only a few papers giving observed number of outliers , that is an estimate of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 . some data of this kind may be found in @xcite , table 3 . \n corresponding estimates for probabilities @xmath45 given there vary from 0.009 to 0.013 . for symmetric stable distribution with @xmath46 , this probability is @xmath43 . \n we see that it is too small to explain the number of outliers in table 3 from @xcite . \n let us note that similar simulations for different values of parameters and sample size are given in @xcite . \n we shall not discuss them here .     for @xmath40 . \n blue line corresponds to symmetric stable distribution with @xmath41 ; red line - to standard gaussian distribution ] \n lately , _ tempered stable distributions _ have been growing increasingly popular . \n the idea of such distribution lies in altering the tails of stable laws by exponential tails starting from a certain point of distribution s support . of course \n , the probability @xmath36 in this case will not converge to zero anymore . \n however , one may expect that this probability will be small if the point of the tails alteration is far from the origin , since tempered distribution will be close to stable in this case . \n simulations support this opinion . \n let us consider only the case of symmetric tempered stable distributions having characteristic functions @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    on figure [ fig2a ] , plot of limit probability @xmath51 \n is given for the distribution ( [ eqa ] ) as a function of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . \n this plot shows that the probabilities are too small to explain the presence of large number of outliers .     as a function of parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ] \n here we discuss a way of constructing from a distribution another one having a higher probability to observe outliers . \n we call this procedure `` put tail down '' . \n let @xmath56 be a probability distribution function of random variable @xmath57 having finite second moment @xmath58 and such that @xmath59 for all @xmath60 . take a parameter @xmath61 and \n fix it . define a new function @xmath62 where @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . \n it is clear that @xmath67 is probability distribution function for any @xmath61 . \n of course , @xmath68 also has finite second moment @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . \n however , @xmath71 . \n let @xmath72 be a random variable with probability distribution function @xmath68 . \n then @xmath73 denoting @xmath74 rewrite previous equality in the form @xmath75 for @xmath72 to have more outliers than @xmath57 it is sufficient that @xmath76 there are many cases in which inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is true for sufficiently large values of @xmath77 . \n let us mention two of them .    1 \n .   random variable @xmath57 has exponential tail . \n more precisely , @xmath78 for some positive constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \n in this case , inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent for sufficiently large @xmath77 to @xmath81 which is obviously true for large @xmath77 . \n 2 .   @xmath82 has power tail , that is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 in view of existence of finite second moment . \n simple calculations show that ( [ eq4 ] ) is equivalent as @xmath85 to @xmath86 the last inequality is true for @xmath87 . \n let us note that the function @xmath68 has a jump at zero . \n however , one can obtain similar effect without such jump by using a smoothing procedure , that is by approximating @xmath68 by smooth functions . \n `` put tail down '' procedure allows us to obtain more outliers in view of two its elements . \n first element consists in changing the tail by smaller , but proportional to previous with coefficient @xmath88 . \n the second element consist in moving a part of mass into origin ( or into a small neighborhood of it ) , which reduces the variance . \n one of the arguments used to support the use of stable distributions in finance is that the observations may be considered as sums of a large number of random variables . \n however , to have the convergence to stable distribution , the summands themselves must have heavy tails , which seems to be unnatural . \n moreover , as we saw in sections [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] , the probability to observe large number of outliers is not in agreement with real data . \n however , alternatives to gaussian distribution are not restricted by stable distributions only . \n there are limit laws for the sums of i.i.d . \n random variables for _ random number of summands_. the theory of such limit distributions has been developed by robbins , dobrushin , gnedenko and others . \n the description of this theory can be found in the book @xcite . \n for some new results , see @xcite . as shown in these publications , the sums of a random number of i.i.d . \n random variables converges to so - called @xmath89-normal distribution . \n the form of this distribution depends on the law for number of summands . in the case of geometric distribution for the number of summands the limit law is laplace distribution instead of gaussian . for the case of \n transformed negative binomial distribution for the number of summands the role of gaussian law is played by symmetric gamma distribution . \n many other examples are given in @xcite . \n all such distributions have finite second moment . \n for many of them , the probability ( [ eq2 ] ) is essentially higher than for gaussian law . \n for example , laplace distribution gives the limit value of probability @xmath36 for @xmath37 equal to @xmath90 , versus @xmath44 for gaussian distribution . \n our suggestion is that such distributions are good alternatives to gaussian and stable laws .", "StartTimeOffset": 1046021963310, "RequestID": "d4365d59a8c9175384ed9d9896ffb86dcf19c9bb", "TotalTokens": 2689}
{"ContextTokens": 3343, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "much recent experimental and theoretical work has focused on the electronic transport properties of nanowires , motivated by promises of novel electronic devices and the basic scientific challenges that they present . \n one of the key findings in nanowire devices is that the coulomb interaction plays a crucial role in determining device properties . \n for example , electrostatics in carbon nanotubes ( nts ) leads to unexpected behavior of intra - tube _ \n junctions@xcite , of intra - tube schottky junctions@xcite , and of fermi level pinning at contacts between nts and metals@xcite . \n the importance of _ intra_-tube coulomb interactions naturally leads to the question of how _ \n inter_-tube interactions might influence device behavior . answering \n this question is gaining increasing importance as experimental devices based on multiple nanotubes are becoming more common@xcite [ an example is shown in fig . \n 1(a ) ] , and also to address the question of device packing density .    in this paper \n , we present self - consistent calculations based on the non - equilibrium green s function technique for planar carbon nanotube transistors containing multiple parallel nts . by analyzing the variations of the transistor characteristics with nt separation , we establish a length scale below which inter - tube interactions become important . \n while for small channel lengths this length scale depends on the channel length , for long channel devices it becomes independent of the channel length and is essentially determined by the gate oxide thickness . \n importantly , this length scale depends exponentially on the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the nts , and can be substantially reduced by embedding the nts in a high-@xmath1 dielectric in the channel and using embedded contacts . \n figure 1(b - e ) shows the device under consideration : infinitely long single - wall zigzag nts laying on metal electrodes at their two ends and on a dielectric in the channel region . a planar gate 10 nm below the dielectric surface controls the device behavior . \n we take a spacing of 0.3 nm between    the nt and the metal or dielectric , and assume that the nt cross - section remains circular , a good approximation for the nts considered heredeformation . \n the electronic properties of the nt are described using a tight - binding approach with one @xmath2 orbital per carbon atom , and a coupling @xmath3 ev between nearest - neighbor atoms . \n semiconducting tubes are ( 17,0 ) nts ( band gap of 0.55 ev , diameter of 1.33 nm ) while metallic tubes are ( 18,0 ) nts ( diameter of 1.41 nm ) . \n we take the nt midgap as the energy reference level , and use a metal workfunction of 5.5 ev , putting the metal fermi level 1 ev below the nt midgap . \n the gate insulator dielectric constant is that of sio@xmath4    to apply the non - equilibrium green s function formalismdatta , leonardiccn to this system , we divide the nt in principle layers , with each layer corresponding to a ring of the zigzag nt . \n the main quantity of interest is the green s function @xmath5 , from which one can obtain the transmission probability @xmath6 and the zero bias conductance    @xmath7 de\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the fermi function . \n @xmath5 is calculated by solving the matrix equation    @xmath9 ^{-1}\\text { , } \\label{gr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the isolated nt and @xmath11 is the electrostatic potential evaluated at the position of each layer . the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the interaction of the scattering region with the semi - infinite nt leads . in our tight - binding representation , \n the hamiltonian matrix elements for layer @xmath14 are @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of atoms around a nt ring ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 here ) and @xmath20 labels each of the nt bands . in this representation \n , we assume that the electrostatic potential on every atom of a ring is the same , a good approximation in this case since @xmath11 varies slowly over the nt diameter . \n the electrostatic potential is calculated by solving poisson s equation in three - dimensional coordinates on a variable grid with the source charge on the nt , and with boundary conditions at the source , drain , and gate surfaces , and at the vacuum / dielectric interface . \n this is done by combining a finite difference approach in the directions parallel to the nt and perpendicular to the substrate with a fast fourier transform in the direction perpendicular to the nts . \n once the three - dimensional electrostatic potential is obtained , the value for @xmath11 on each ring is taken as the average of the electrostatic potentials on the points on the nt nearest and furthest from the substrate , at the position of each ring .    to obtain the charge density , we note that our tight - binding technique provides the total charge on each layer of the nt , which needs to be spatially distributed . \n we assume a uniform distribution of the charge in the azimuthal direction , and spatially distribute the total charge in the radial and axial directions with a gaussian smearing function . the three - dimensional charge density \n is then given by @xmath21where @xmath22 \\\\ \n \\left [ -(r - r)^{2}/2\\sigma _ { r}^{2}\\right ] $ ] with @xmath23 the tube radius , @xmath24 the position of ring @xmath14 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 the smearing lengths in the axial and radial directions respectively ( this expression for @xmath27 is valid when @xmath28 , and we used values of @xmath29 nm and @xmath30 nm ) . \n our overall procedure is to solve the coupled set of nonlinear eqs @xmath31 self - consistently for a given gate - source voltage at zero drain - source bias . \n figure 1(e ) shows the unit cells for our calculations to study semiconducting - semiconducting and semiconducting - metallic interactions . \n we first discuss interactions between semiconducting nts . \n the conductance of the nt transistor as a function of the gate - source voltage is plotted in fig . 2 for different values of the separation between the nts . \n clearly , as the nt separation is reduced , the ntfet characteristics degrade ; in the range of gate voltages studied , the current can not be completely turned on for the smallest tube separation , while the behavior in the off state is essentially independent of tube separation . \n this behavior arises because of the charge induced on the nts by the gate voltage , and by interactions between nts at the contact . as shown in fig . \n 2a , the off state corresponds to the fermi level in the middle of the nt bandgap in the channel , with little charge on the nts , so coulomb interactions in the channel between neighboring nts are negligible . \n the on state however consists of making the nt _ p_-type in the channel by raising the valence band above the fermi level with the gate voltage ( fig . \n 2b ) ; this creates a large positive charge on the nt which interacts with the charge on neighboring nts , and lowers the electron energy . \n this pushes the bands down , and reduces the conductance .    while interactions in the channel play an important role in determining device behavior \n , nt - nt interactions also affects the contacts . because of the mismatch between the metal and nt workfunctions , \n contacts between nts and metals are governed by charge transfer between the metal and the nt , effectively doping the nt _ p_-type at the contact , with the metal fermi level just below the nt valence band edge in the contact@xcite . as the separation between nts decreases , the coulomb interactions between the positive charge at the contacts leads to a lowering of the bands ; at small enough separations , the valence band in the contact can be pushed below the metal fermi level . \n thus inter - tube interactions at the contacts can lead to modifications of the nt / metal contacts from ohmic to schottky . \n we find that this effect becomes important for inter - tube separations below @xmath32 nm ; the effects can be seen in the bottom curve of fig . \n 2 , where the on state conductance saturates to a value much smaller than the single - tube limit because of the schottky barrier . \n these effects of inter - tube interactions on contact properties can be mitigated by embedding the nts in the metal contact .    to quantify the role of coulomb interactions _ in the channel _ , we calculated the conductance versus gate voltage for devices with different channel lengths ; we plot in fig . \n 3 the conductance at @xmath33 versus tube separation , for several values of the channel length ( the smallest value of @xmath34 is large enough to avoid contact effects ) . the solid lines in the figure are fits of the form @xmath35 , from which we extract the value of @xmath36 at which the conductance decreases by more than 10% from its @xmath37 value . \n this length scale is plotted in fig . \n 4 as a function of channel length , and delimits regions where inter - tube interactions distort the single - tube behavior . clearly \n , very short channel devices can have very high packing densities , while long channel devices are limited to tube separations of 15 nm . a notable aspect of the results of fig . \n 4 is that the value of @xmath36 is independent of the channel length for large @xmath38 . at first glance \n , one would expect that a larger channel length leads to larger total charge on the nts and thus larger interaction energy . however , screening of the coulomb interaction by the planar gate leads to a different behavior , as we now discuss .    to derive approximate analytical expressions for the coulomb interactions between nts , we consider the simplified situation of fig . \n 5a : a nt of length @xmath38 is at a distance @xmath39 above a metallic substrate held a potential @xmath40 , and carries charge per unit length @xmath41 . \n we use an image potential construction to calculate the electrostatic potential @xmath42 at a distance @xmath36 from the charged tube , giving    @xmath43    in the long channel limit @xmath44 , eq . \n ( [ v ] ) becomes@xmath45the important point here is that in this limit the potential shift is independent of the channel length @xmath38 . \n taking a potential change of @xmath46 volts as a criterion for the importance of inter - tube effects , we obtain a separation@xmath47below which inter - tube effects become important . \n thus the gate oxide thickness @xmath39 sets the length scale @xmath48 . in the above expression \n , @xmath1 is the effective dielectric constant for the device geometry . for a simple comparison with our simulations \n we take @xmath1 as the dielectric constant of sio@xmath49 , and use the computed value of @xmath50 e / c atom in the on state . \n this gives @xmath51 nm in good agreement with our numerical results . \n a key point is that the length scale @xmath48 depends _ exponentially _ on the gate insulator dielectric constant ; thus , replacing sio@xmath49 with high-@xmath1 dielectric materials ( ntfets have been fabricated with hfo@xmath49@xcite , sro@xmath49@xcite and srtio@xmath52@xcite ) allows a reduction of @xmath53 to extremely small values , thus permitting high device densities . \n the general behavior of interactions between semiconducting nts can be understood from further analysis of eq . @xmath54 . near threshold , \n the charge on the nt can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the threshold voltage . \n substitution in eq . \n gives@xmath57hence , the gate voltage is rescaled and shifted by the interaction between nts . \n this behavior is indicated in the inset of fig . \n 2c , showing good collapse of the data after appropriate rescaling and shifting of @xmath58 .    the results discussed above focused on interactions between semiconducting nts \n . however , in multi - nt devices , there is often a mixture of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes . \n a question therefore is how the presence of nearby metallic nts affects the properties of the semiconducting nts . to address this issue \n , we performed calculations for the geometry depicted in fig . \n there , a semiconducting nt is separated from two metallic nts by a distance @xmath36 . \n figure 6 shows the calculated conductance vs gate voltage dependence for a 10 nm channel device . \n ( the conductance plotted here is that of the semiconducting nt only . for single electrodes making contact to all the nts \n , the conductance of the metallic tubes would have to be included to obtain the total device conductance . ) the behavior in fig . \n 6 is similar to that observed for interactions between semiconducting nts , i.e. a degradation of the characteristics with decreasing separation between the nts . \n however , because the charge on the metallic tubes is not strongly modulated by the gate voltage , the physics is somewhat different ; indeed , the metallic nts essentially consist of lines of constant potential . to their effect on the semiconducting nts we consider the situation of fig . \n 5b , where a line held at a constant potential @xmath59 is above a metallic plane held at potential @xmath58 . \n solution of the laplace equation for this geometry gives the potential on the nearby nt as@xmath60thus the presence of the metallic tubes shifts and rescales the gate voltage seen by the semiconducting tube . \n for small separations between the nts , the potential on the semiconducting nt approaches that of the metallic nt , which is larger than that of an isolated semiconducting nt . \n thus , at the contact , the fermi level is pushed above the valence band edge , leading to a schottky barrier and saturation of the conductance to lower values . \n the behavior expressed in eq . \n ( [ scaling ] ) can be verified by looking at the off state behavior , and scaling and shifting the gate voltage appropriately ; the inset in fig . \n 6 shows the resulting collapse of the data . \n in summary , we have shown that coulomb interactions between carbon nanotubes can have a strong influence on device behavior . \n below a characteristic length scale , interactions between nts can significantly degrade device behavior ; this can be understood in terms of a rescaling and shift of the applied gate voltage . for long channel devices , \n the tube separation above which interactions between nts is negligible becomes independent of the channel length , and is set by the gate oxide thickness . \n this length scale can be substantially reduced by using high-@xmath1 dielectrics , due to an exponential dependence on dielectric constant . while this paper focused on the static device properties \n , we expect that interactions during current flow ( e.g. coulomb drag ) would also have intriguing properties . \n we hope that this work will stimulate controlled experiments to further explore interactions between nanotubes . \n sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by sandia corporation , a lockheed martin company , for the united states department of energy under contract de -

{"ContextTokens": 3542, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "the supernova ( sn ) that occurred in 1987 in the nearby large magellanic cloud was the first object of its kind whose evolution in the radio to x - ray range has been resolved as a function of time . \n the study of sn  1987a continues and includes , in particular , extensive observations in very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath3  gev ) @xmath4-rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n the present work is a critical re - examination and extension of the studies by @xcite and @xcite(referred to as bkv11 in the following ) concerning the properties of the nonthermal emission of sn 1987a . as in those previous investigations , \n our framework is a nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration in sn remnants ( snrs ) . \n this theory couples the particle acceleration process with the hydrodynamics of the thermal gas @xcite and connects it with the gamma - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n the application of this theory to individual snrs ( see * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * for reviews ) has demonstrated its ability to explain the observed snr properties and radiation spectra . combining the theoretical model with the _ \n observed _ synchrotron spectra predicts new effects like the large degree of magnetic field amplification that leads to the observed concentration of the highest - energy electrons in a very thin shell just behind the forward shock into the circumstellar medium ( csm ) . \n the evolution of radio and x - ray emission at earlier times , also implied in the present paper , has been described by , e.g. bkv11 , who showed , in particular , that the evidence for strong shock modification comes primarily from radio data . \n efficient acceleration of the cr proton component is needed to produce significant shock modification leading to a soft and concave cr electron spectrum in sn 1987a , which well fits the observed nonthermal radio emission and x - ray spectra if the downstream magnetic field strength @xmath5 is as high as @xmath6  mg . \n such a high field leads to significant electron synchrotron losses that cut off the high - frequency x - ray part of the synchrotron spectrum , consistent with x - ray observations . \n the required magnetic field strength can presumably be attributed to its nonlinear amplification near the snr shock by the cr acceleration process itself @xcite .    as a consequence of the efficient production of the cr nuclear component , which is accompanied by strong magnetic field amplification , \n sn  1987a is expected to be a potential source of @xmath4-rays for the h.e.s.s . \n however , the flux of tev emission predicted in bkv11 exceeds the upper limit obtained by h.e.s.s . \n it is suggested here that this inconsistency is the result of an overestimate of the csm gas density , in particular , of the mass of the equatorial ring ( er ) . \n the present work uses the same canonical values ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) for the stellar ejecta mass , @xmath7 , distance , @xmath8 , hydrodynamic explosion energy , @xmath9 , and ejecta velocity distribution as in bkv11 , but takes into account the detailed radio continuum observations by @xcite and @xcite . in particular \n , the present work makes use of recent extensive csm modeling in terms of three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite ( in the sequel referred to as potter14 ) . \n an approximate prediction of the future nonthermal emission from sn  1987a for the coming decades is given . \n the densest part of the csm , which lies within the range @xmath10 of the elevation angle @xmath11 around the equatorial plane , is then considerably less dense than what was adopted in bkv11 . \n this is the main reason for the re - examination of the cr production in sn  1987a and the associated nonthermal emission . \n to study the propagation of the sn shock through the csm , the results of potter14 for the angular range @xmath10 relative to the equatorial plane are used . \n the most efficient cr and nonthermal emission production presumably takes place within this region . \n this is roughly consistent with radio observations @xcite . \n the adopted radial profile of the gas number density @xmath12 in this region is represented in figure  [ f1 ] . within the selected elevation range , it consists of several different morphological structures : ( i ) the wind bubble of the blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor star @xcite at @xmath13  cm with gas density @xmath14  @xmath15 , ( ii ) the h  ii region @xcite at @xmath16  cm with @xmath17  @xmath15 , ( iii ) the so - called hourglass region at @xmath18  cm with @xmath19  @xmath15 , and ( iv ) the free red supergiant ( rsg ) wind region at @xmath20 with @xmath21  @xmath15 ; \n the properties of structures ( iii ) and ( iv ) directly follow from potter14 . within the smaller elevation angle region of @xmath22 , \n the same radial profile includes the equatorial ring inside the h  ii region ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . \n its gas number density is chosen here to be distributed according to the relation @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the central ( maximal ) density of the er , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denote the total mass , radius , and width of the er , respectively . \n below , the values @xmath28 , @xmath29  cm , and @xmath30 are used . \n these parameter values are taken in order to fit the observed shock and radio - emission dynamics . \n they turn out to be consistent with the values used by potter14 . \n the csm described above differs significantly from the csm adopted in bkv11 . \n first of all , the er mass , albeit that of the ionized material only , @xmath28 @xcite , is considerably smaller than that used by bkv11 ( @xmath31 ) . \n second , the csm behind the er is less dense . \n these factors , as demonstrated below , lead to a considerable reduction of the expected nonthermal emission , in particular , of the @xmath4-ray emission , compared with the results of bkv11 . \n the propagation of the forward sn shock through the csm is modeled in the spirit of a spherically symmetrical approach . \n it approximates the shock and its effects as the weighted sum of two independent spherically symmetric shocks , propagating into , respectively , two different radial gas number density profiles of the csm , shown in figure  [ f1 ] : the first profile ( region 1 ) belongs to an azimuthally symmetric region of elevation angles @xmath11 near the equatorial plane @xmath32 , and the second , analogous profile ( region 2 ) , corresponds to the innermost @xmath22 . \n then , each quantity q , characterizing the number of accelerated crs and the amount of emission produced by these crs , is determined by the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the spherically symmetric values corresponding to the profiles that characterize the two regions 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the filling factors in the solid angle of these regions .    cr production by the sn shock at high latitudes @xmath37 is neglected here because the gas density in this region is considerably lower ( see potter14 ) . \n we also neglect cr production at the reverse shock for the reasons given in bkv11 . \n the question is , of course , to what extent such an approximate treatment remains consistent as a function of time with the real snr shock sweeping across the real csm to reach larger and larger radial distances . \n a priori the decrease of the gas density with elevation angle , symmetric to the equatorial plane , suggests this to be a roughly stable process . \n however , effects like the engulfment of the er clearly imply some non - radial shock propagation aspects . such effects are also apparent in the three - dimensional simulations of potter14 . \n in addition , the ring is clumpy , even though @xcite found indications that these hot spots are now gradually dissolving . \n this type of effect should primarily influence the detailed time dependence of the particle acceleration and hadronic @xmath4-ray emission rather than the global acceleration properties of the system . \n therefore , in a gross sense , the used mosaic of spherical shocks appeears to be an adequate overall approximation .      as in bkv11 , the magnetic field strength , @xmath38 , given by the expression @xmath39 is used . here \n , @xmath40 denotes the sn shock speed and @xmath38 is the field far upstream , presumably amplified by the crs of the highest energy . in the same sense , @xmath41 is the mass density far upstream . \n the high downstream magnetic field @xmath42  mg , where @xmath43 denotes the total shock compression ratio , is required to reproduce the observed radio and x - ray spectra @xcite . \n the calculation of the shock radius @xmath44 and speed @xmath40 again follows the scheme of @xcite , but see also bkv11 , as does the evaluation of the proton injection rate @xmath45 and of the electron - to - proton ratio @xmath46 . \n figure  [ f2 ] shows @xmath44 and @xmath40 , as the shock propagates in the csm corresponding to region 2 , together with the latest radio data @xcite . in the case of region 1 \n , the shock speed time profile @xmath47 does not contain the local minimum around @xmath48 days ; this is the main difference from the results presented in figure  [ f2 ] . \n iteratively fitting the theoretical quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the spatially integrated radio synchrotron spectra up to the year 2013 @xcite leads to a constant value for @xmath51 , whereas the value @xmath52 at @xmath53 year ( figure  [ f3]a ) is due to the assumption that , leaving the h  ii region , the nuclear injection fraction should , after @xmath54 year , go back to its value before the age of 10 years . during the ages between about 10 and 30 years \n the compressed and largely azimuthal magnetic field of the h  ii region should have depressed nuclear injection , consistent with the softening of the spatially integrated radio spectrum ( with index @xmath55 ) as shown in figure  [ f3]b . \n this figure also shows that outside the h  ii region , the shock is significantly modified relative to a pure gas shock for which the total shock compression ratio @xmath43 and the subshock compression ratio @xmath56 would both have a value of 4 . \n the adopted value of @xmath49 determines the amount of shock modification , in particular , the decrease of the subshock compression ratio @xmath57 relative its value of 4 for an unmodified shock . since crs with relatively small energies \n are produced near the subshock , the value @xmath57 directly determines the shape of the electron energy spectrum at energies below @xmath58  gev  which produce synchrotron emission in the radio range  and vice versa . \n therefore , as in all similar cases , the proton injection rate @xmath49 is inferred from a fit of the resulting theoretical spectral index @xmath55 of the integrated radio synchrotron emission to the observed value . \n the quality of this fit can be ascertained from figure  [ f3]b , where the best calculated time profile @xmath55 is presented together with the observational data .    from the epoch \n @xmath59 year onwards the value of @xmath55 decreases until the epoch @xmath60 year @xcite and is assumed to start to increase again at @xmath61 year . \n this appears to be consistent with recent measurements by @xcite and , especially , @xcite . \n however , the increase is not as fast as one would expect from the behavior of the local @xmath57 . \n this occurs because at subsequent epochs , the gas number density and , consequently , also the amount of freshly injected electrons and the magnetic field strength , are much smaller than when the shock was in the h  ii region . \n therefore , the synchrotron emission of those latter electrons , convected downstream in that higher magnetic field , remains dominant . \n for similar reasons , the variation in the shock compression ratio @xmath43 at an age 10,00012,000 days , caused by the rapid decrease of the upstream gas number density @xmath62 , does not significantly affect the integrated radio synchrotron emission flux , and the spectral index @xmath63 remains essentially independent of @xmath43 .    using these educated guesses for @xmath64 and @xmath46 the calculated flux of radio emission @xmath65 at frequency @xmath66  ghz \n is presented in figure  [ f4 ] together with the observational data obtained with the atca instrument @xcite . for those times where the radio flux has also been measured , the calculation is perfectly consistent with the observations . according to the calculation , the rapid growth of radio emission in the epochs @xmath67 year is due to the increase of the number of accelerated cr electrons , which is proportional to the swept - up mass within the h  ii region . for the adopted value of the outer boundary of the h  ii region , @xmath68  cm , the snr shock reaches this boundary after @xmath54 year , and the peak of radio emission is reached . even at later epochs , \n @xmath69 years , the radio synchrotron emission will still be dominated by the contribution of the swept - up matter of the h  ii region . \n the flux of radio emission is expected to decrease gradually by a factor of about 10 during the 10 years after 2017 . \n due to its considerably lower gas density , the contribution of the swept - up hourglass matter will become essential only for @xmath70 year , when the radio emission starts to grow slowly again . \n the calculated @xmath4-ray energy flux density above 3 tev as a function of time , shown in figure  [ f5 ] , is dominated by the @xmath71-decay component at all energies . since a significant part of the shock surface \n is expected to be tangential , and therefore to not efficiently inject / accelerate nuclear crs , the overall number of accelerating crs is normalized by a factor of @xmath72 , as previoously argued by @xcite and bkv11 .    as is clear from figure  [ f5 ] , the region 1 , which contains the er , the densest structure , contributes dominantly only during the shock propagation through the er , which is during days 700010,000 . \n according to figure  [ f5 ] , the maximal energy flux density of tev emission @xmath73  ev @xmath1 s@xmath2 was achieved at day 9000 , and after that epoch it decreased continuously due to the decrease of the csm gas density . since the radial gas density profile is much thinner compared with the one used earlier bkv11 , the peak value of the expected flux of tev emission is now lower and the tev emission expected for the future is considerably lower .    the most recent upper limit for the tev emission obtained by the h.e.s.s . \n telescopes during the period 2005 - 2012 @xcite ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) is roughly consistent with this prediction .    according to the calculation ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) , the most promising time for the detection of sn \n 1987a in tev @xmath4-rays is the 10 year period from 2008 to 2018 . at later epochs \n , sn  1987a should be detectable in the vhe range only by an instrument with a higher sensitivity than that of h.e.s.s . \n this work has been supported in part by the russian foundation for basic research ( grants 13 -

{"ContextTokens": 3044, "GeneratedTokens": 185, "SynthesizedBody": "that early - type galaxies form a well - defined color magnitude relation ( cmr ) was first recognized by @xcite . \n extensive studies by @xcite and @xcite compared the cmr of nine galaxy clusters and of field galaxies . \n they found them to be astonishingly similar . in combination with other studies comparing the cmr for e and s0 , within clusters , groups and the field @xcite a high degree of universality \n was shown for the relation . \n the cmr is typically explained by an increase of mean stellar metallicity with increasing galaxy mass as the dominant effect . \n the common underlying idea is that more massive galaxies have deeper potential wells , which can retain metal - enriched stellar ejecta more effectively and subsequently recycle the enriched gas into new stars . \n another factor could be a variable integrated galactic initial mass function , with more massive stars in more massive galaxies , and thus a more substantial enrichment ( e.g.  ) . \n an alternative explanation was given with a change of the mean age ( see e.g. @xcite , and some observational support for it in @xcite ) . \n the question of which explanation to favor is not totally settled yet due to the ambiguity introduced by the age - metallicity degeneracy . but \n data from clusters at higher redshift show that the cmr is in place ever since , favoring the mass - metallicity relation to be the dominant effect .    from early on \n , it was discussed whether the universality of the cmr also holds over the whole range of galaxy masses , i.e.  whether dwarf and giant early - type galaxies follow the same cmr . \n studies of different clusters show consistency with one common cmr for dwarfs and giants , albeit with a significant increase in the scatter at low luminosities ( @xcite for coma , @xcite for perseus , @xcite and for fornax , @xcite for antlia and for hydra i ) . \n more explicitely , @xcite stated that there is a common linear relation . \n but his fig . \n 3 might hint at a change of slope from high to low luminosities , similar to what @xcite suggested . \n interestingly , visual examination of the diagrams presented by most of the above - mentioned studies indicates consistency also with a change of slope \n yet linear relations were fitted in most cases ( see , however , @xcite ; see sect . \n 5 ) . in this letter \n we revisit the question of the universality of the cmr for dwarfs and giants . \n the sample is based on the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; @xcite ) . \n all early - type galaxies therein with a certain cluster member status and @xmath4 mag are taken into account , which is the same magnitude limit up to which the vcc was found to be complete . \n this translates into @xmath5 mag with our adopted distance modulus of m - m=31.09 mag ( d=16.5 mpc , @xcite ) . \n we treat uncertain classifications as in @xcite and exclude possible irregulars . \n seven further galaxies are exluded due to their low @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release five ( dr5 ) @xcite covers all but six early - type dwarf galaxies of the vcc . since the quality of sky level subtraction of the sdss pipeline is insufficient , we use sky - subtracted images as provided by @xcite , based on a careful subtraction method . \n the images were flux - calibrated and corrected for galactic extinction @xcite .    for each galaxy , we determined a \n petrosian semimajor axis \" ( @xcite , hereafter petrosian sma , @xmath9 ) , i.e. , we use ellipses instead of circles in the calculation of the petrosian radius ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the total flux in the @xmath10-band was measured within @xmath11 , yielding a value for the half - light semimajor axis , @xmath12 . \n this petrosian aperture still misses some flux , which is of particular relevance for the giant galaxies @xcite . \n the brightness and the half - light sma were corrected for this missing flux according to @xcite . \n axial ratio and position angle were then determined through an isophotal fit at @xmath13 . \n colors were measured within the elliptical @xmath10-band half - light aperture for each filter . \n errors were estimated from the @xmath6 and calibration uncertainties ( which we estimate to have a _ relative _ effect of 0.1 mag in each band , which is smaller than the absolute values given by sdss ) , as described in @xcite . \n our data constitute a very homogeneous set of measurements for galaxies in one cluster , obtained and reduced with the same instrument , setup , and software . \n from the five sdss filter bands we choose four representative colors : @xmath0 , mostly sensitive to age ; @xmath1 with the highest @xmath6 ; @xmath2 with the longest wavelength baseline at good @xmath6 ; and @xmath3 , mostly sensitive to metallicity . \n first of all , the impression one can get by examining just the _ black points _ in fig .  1 is that there is not one common linear relation from the faint to the bright galaxies . in all colors \n the overall shape appears more like `` s '' shaped . \n the brightest ( @xmath14 ) galaxies have almost constant color , i.e.  no correlation between color and brightness ; the very brightest galaxies show a larger scatter . \n these were reported before to be _ morphologically _ different from the other galaxies in more detailed studies of the inner light profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the remaining galaxies several descriptions seem to be plausible , ranging from just an offset between two relations with similar slopes up to a curved relation .    with the non - linear shape , it seems not very favorable to fit a straight line . \n this would not describe the data well , and there is no theoretical prediction what other function is expected . \n so at first , we want to make the overall shape more clearly visible , using continous , overlapping magnitude bins , in which mean and scatter are calculated . in fig . \n 1 these derived relations are shown with grey lines . \n the first impression is confirmed : one common linear relation for dwarfs and giants can not be seen . \n moreover , the white histograms showing the galaxy distributions in the bins are clearly peaked towards the bright and the faint end , while they are rather flat at intermediate luminosity . \n if the notion of two separate relations with an overlap is correct , this should become evident through an increased scatter about the relation around the intersection , relative to the photometric error . \n therefore we calculate the rms of the scatter around the mean in running bins ( clipping one time at 3@xmath15 ) and divide it by the rms of the photometric errors @xmath16 with color @xmath17 and mean color @xmath18 , averaging over the galaxies in the respective bin . here \n we exclude des with blue cores , since they are known to have different colors @xcite \n . this rms - ratio should be one if the scatter is only due to the measurement errors and larger than one if there is an intrinsic scatter . in fig .  1 we show the cmrs along with the rms - ratio @xmath19 .    indeed , the rms - ratio is enhanced between @xmath20 , indicating an intrinsically increased scatter , which could in principle be explained by a transition between two separate relations . \n but the change is steady . \n thus also alternative explanations , such as a more varied star formation history with decreasing galaxy mass , seem plausible  although the decrease in the scatter for the faintest dwarfs would still need to be explained .    one can argue about the significance of the rms - ratio increase for the brightest galaxies , since it is just a handful of them  nevertheless , this larger scatter might be related to the absence of a well - defined cmr at the brightest magnitudes . \n the numerical galaxy catalog of @xcite is based on a high resolution @xmath21-body simulation in a @xmath22cdm universe @xcite . \n the dark - halo merger trees of the @xmath21-body simulation are taken as input for a semi - analytical model ( sam ) of galaxy formation ( here a modified version of the mitaka model , @xcite ) . \n the sam models physical processes of galaxy formation and evolution such as gas radiative cooling , star formation , heating by supernova explosions ( supernova feedback ) , mergers of galaxies , population synthesis , and extinction by internal dust and intervening hi clouds . \n in particular , the model takes into account the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal after gas - rich mergers ( also for cases intermediate between a purely baryonic cloud and a baryonic cloud fully supported by surrounding dark matter as in ) . \n the gravitational well is shallower for the dwarf galaxies and thus they suffer a more substantial gas loss than giants . \n this process is not only important for the galaxy sizes , but also for their metal enrichment histories .    in the comparison of the cmr of the virgo galaxies with the sam ( fig . \n 2 ) , the shapes of the distributions are fairly similar , and the model cmr is indeed not well represented by a linear relation . in @xcite we presented an analogous comparison for the scaling relation of radius and brightness and found that the model qualitatively agrees with distribution of the galaxies in that diagram . both the cmr and the relation between size and brightness do not show a linear , nor one common behaviour for dwarfs and giants . \n nevertheless , in the framework of the sam both can be explained by the same physical processes , which govern @xmath22cdm structure formation , and thus both can be of cosmological origin ( see also @xcite ) .    beside the good agreement in the overall shape , an offset is observed . \n this offset could partly be due to uncertainties of the adopted synthetic stellar population model . \n vs. @xmath23 ( for which no transformations are needed ) the observed galaxies lie bluewards of the model ones with an smaller absolute offset than in @xmath24 vs. @xmath25 , but the scatter of the observed galaxies is larger due to the lower @xmath6 in the @xmath8-band . ] \n furthermore , the relative number of bright galaxies exceeds the observed one and the luminosity function is clearly different , which could possibly be explained with model input physics . \n in the literature , there is no consistent view of commonness or distinctness of the color magnitude relation of dwarf and giant early - type galaxies . \n some studies find a linear relation over the whole range of brightness , others find a change of slope . \n we studied the cmr of virgo cluster early - type galaxies , based on the wealth of sdss imaging data in multiple filter bands . \n our main result is that the dwarfs and giants do not follow one common _ linear _ relation . \n the appearance in the different colors , from @xmath0 to @xmath3 , is very similar , suggesting that age and metallicity go hand in hand : the cmr at shorter wavelengths is more sensitive to changes in age , while it is more sensitive to changes in metallicity at longer wavelengths . \n recent studies indeed claim that a combination of the effects of age , metallicity and also @xmath26-enhancement shape the cmr @xcite . \n the most direct comparison with other data is possible with @xcite , who studied early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the acs virgo cluster survey . in their fig . \n 123 they show the cmr in @xmath27 , using smaller apertures for the color measurements . \n for comparison we repeat the plot and indicate galaxies common to both samples with black dots in the symbols ( fig .  3 ) . \n we also show their fits ( to their data ) : two linear fits to a brighter and fainter subsample and one parabola for the whole sample . \n while a qualitatively good agreement is found , the small offset to bluer colors of our data is likely explained by a combination of the effect of different apertures , the atmosphere , and different physical filters . while we agree with @xcite that the cmr is not linear over the whole range , the faint dwarfs in our sample , which they do not reach ( cf . \n 3 ) , do not lie on the extrapolation of their parabolic fit , but rather define an overall `` s''-like shape . \n furthermore , some of the galaxies that might drag their cmr to the blue side , at their faint end , display blue cores from recent star formation activity @xcite , which we excluded . \n we found an increase of the scatter about the cmr at intermediate brightness , visible in fig .  1 through a broadening of the color distributions within the respective magnitude bins . \n this confirms the result that dwarfs and giants do _ not _ share one common _ linear _ cmr . for the brighter and fainter galaxies \n the scatter is closer to the photometric errors . \n @xcite concluded that the cmr is a result of two more fundamental relations : the faber - jackson relation and a relation between color and velocity dispersion . \n given the slope change of the faber - jackson relation from giants to dwarfs a change of slope of the cmr would actually be expected . \n it is important to emphasize that the curved shape of the cmr , and the possible existence of two adjacent relations does _ not _ necessarily imply different formation scenarios of dwarfs and giants . \n this is in accordance with previous claims of no distinction between them ( ) . instead , from the good qualitative agreement of the observed cmr shape with a semi - analytic model , \n we conclude that a common origin within the framework of @xmath22cdm structure formation appears plausible for both giant _ and _ dwarf early types . \n a more detailed multiparameter comparison of dwarfs and giants will be communicated in a forthcoming paper . \n we thank masahiro nagashima for helpful advice , and the referee for useful comments . we are supported within the framework of the excellence initiative by the german research foundation ( dfg ) through the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics ( grant number gsc 129/1 ) . \n the study is based on sdss ( http://www.sdss.org/ ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1068826843668, "RequestID": "4e0f029afd96950ef80d7e09d81847ae9e36c530", "TotalTokens": 3229}
{"ContextTokens": 4090, "GeneratedTokens": 241, "SynthesizedBody": "this article is in honor of alexander `` sasha '' soifer s sixtieth birthday . \n i have known sasha for about twenty years now ; i first met him when i competed in his colorado math olympiad in 1988 . \n i remember that he teased me about looking even younger than i was ( and also about my poor grades in school ) , but when we talked about mathematics he always spoke to me as his peer . \n we could speak a common language and share our curiosity and passion for solving problems . \n professor soifer has solved many outstanding math problems , but posed many more . \n he has composed most of the problems for twenty - five ( and counting ) colorado math olympiads , and written numerous research articles and five books about open problems in combinatorics and geometry . \n perhaps the most important thing that i learned from him is that we are free to ask our own mathematical questions and pursue them as far as we are able . \n this was a very empowering idea to me when i was young . \n sasha has nice taste in problems too , and tells a good mathematical story @xcite ; i have sometimes felt a little haunted by problems which i first heard from him . \n one problem i have always remembered for its simple and elegant statement ( and somewhat tricky proofs ) is the following , which appeared on the colorado math olympiad in 1988 @xcite . \n it stayed with me , and i have occasionally sat down trying to see a new solution to it . \n [ soif ] given five points in a triangle of unit area , there must exist some three of them forming a triangle of area @xmath0 or less . \n if the reader has never seen this problem , they are warmly invited to try it . \n the problem becomes easier if `` five '' is replaced by `` six '' or `` seven , '' but it seems to take some work to get `` five '' . \n solutions by alexander soifer , royce peng , and cecil rosseau all appear in the book , `` how does one cut a triangle ? '' which will soon be reprinted by springer @xcite . \n one wonders if this is the best possible result , and in a sense it is : it is easy to check that `` five '' can not be replaced by `` four '' . \n but what about the @xmath0 ? \n i must admit that i did not make any real progress toward proving theorem [ soif ] during the olympiad , but now i will have a ( very ) small revenge on the problem by improving @xmath4 to @xmath5 . in the spirit of sasha soifer and his wonderful journal geombinatorics \n , we leave the reader with some open problems as well . \n our main result is the following .    given five points in a triangle of unit area , \n then some three of them form a triangle of area less than or equal to @xmath1 . \n since ratios of areas are preserved under affine transformation , we assume without loss of generality that our unit triangle @xmath6 is equilateral . \n let @xmath7 denote the length of one side of @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath8{3}$ ] ) . \n we partition @xmath6 into @xmath9 congruent equilateral triangles of side length @xmath10 , as in figure [ fig : hund ] . \n label the five points by @xmath11 .     into @xmath9 congruent triangles.,width=216 ] \n

@xmath15 form a small triangle . \n ( in particular , if @xmath16 then either @xmath17 forms a small triangle for some @xmath18 , or else @xmath19 forms a small triangle . )    for any three points @xmath20 let @xmath21 denote the area of the triangle they form . \n the locus of points @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is a closed infinite strip @xmath15 centered on line @xmath24 , and of width at least @xmath25 since the diameter of @xmath6 is @xmath7 , the intersection @xmath26 of the complement of the strip with @xmath6 , has at most one component . \n the main point is that if a third point is inside @xmath15 we are done , and otherwise all three points lie in @xmath26 , and we need only check that this forces the area of the triangle they form to be less than @xmath27 .    by moving @xmath28 and @xmath29 along line @xmath24 until they intersect the boundary of @xmath6 if necessary \n , we only increase the width of the strip @xmath15 , so we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both on the boundary of @xmath6 . if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are on the same side of @xmath6 then @xmath26 is a triangle with maximal area when @xmath30 , and this area is only @xmath31 , in which case we are done , so we may assume that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are on two different sides of @xmath6 . \n now suppose that @xmath32 \n . then we can replace @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , so that the line @xmath35 is parallel to @xmath24 , and @xmath36 . \n this results in a new strip @xmath37 and denote the intersection of @xmath37

@xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , so that @xmath28 lies on side @xmath57 and @xmath29 on side @xmath58 , as in figure [ fig : seglemma ] . if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are both greater than @xmath61 then @xmath62 , and if they are both less than @xmath61 then @xmath63 , but we are assuming that @xmath30 . \n so by symmetry , we assume without loss of generality that @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in particular that @xmath66 . \n let @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the other two intersections of the boundary of @xmath15 with the boundary of @xmath6 . \n note that line @xmath69 intersects side @xmath70 , and in particular @xmath26 is a triangle . \n let @xmath71 . \n then by the law of sines , @xmath72 denote @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so in particular @xmath75 . \n we compute @xmath76 in terms of @xmath46 by @xmath77 so @xmath78    the angles of triangle @xmath79 are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and applying the law of sines and a familiar formula for area of a triangle , its area is given by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     it seems that this is probably a monotone decreasing function of @xmath46 on the interval @xmath84 $ ] , but we did not care to take derivatives of this function to prove it . \n so we instead take a slightly more indirect approach , and one that does not involve calculus . \n the idea is to start with the fact that @xmath85 can not be too large , which forces @xmath46 large , which in turn forces @xmath85 even smaller , etc . , and we quickly reach a contradiction to the supposition that @xmath86 .    since @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 , so @xmath89 . \n then if @xmath86 , @xmath90 so @xmath91    now @xmath92 , so this implies in particular that @xmath93 , and then since @xmath66 this gives that @xmath94 . \n plugging back in to the formula for @xmath85 gives @xmath95    we repeat the argument from before . \n if @xmath96 and @xmath86 , then @xmath97 , so @xmath98 . \n this gives in turn that @xmath99 a contradiction to the assumption that @xmath100 , since @xmath101    then we immediately have the following .    [ trihex ] \n if any two points of @xmath102 lie in a triangle of side length @xmath61 , or a hexagon of diameter @xmath61 , then some three points form a small triangle . \n these are many such triangles and hexagons suggested by our partition of @xmath6 , as in figure [ fig : trihex ] . \n .,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] \n we further restrict the possible arrangements of points by using the fact that a triangle in a parallelogram of area @xmath46 has area at most @xmath103 . \n ( this observation is used in soifer s original proof of theorem [ soif ] . ) \n [ parallel ] if any three points of @xmath102 lie in a parallelogram of area @xmath104 , then they form a triangle of area no more than @xmath105 . \n we make use of three such kinds of parallelograms , illustrated in figure [ fig : parallel ] , which we will call @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 parallelograms .    . \n from left to right , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 parallelograms.,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ] . from left to right , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 parallelograms.,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ] . from left to right , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 parallelograms.,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]    we consider three cases . \n case i is that there is a point of @xmath102 inside the central shaded triangle in figure [ fig : case1 ] . \n assuming case i , by the hexagon case of lemma [ trihex ] , there can be no other points in the wider shaded region in figure [ fig : wide1 ] , or else we are already done . \n but that leaves at least four points in the three corner white triangles . \n two of them must lie in the same triangle , but then by the triangle case of lemma [ trihex ] we are done . \n case ii is that there is a point @xmath109 in the shaded region in figure [ fig : case2 ] . by symmetry , assume that @xmath109 is in the upper triangle . \n there are no other points in the wider shaded region of figure [ fig : wide2 ] or we are done , by the hexagon case of lemma [ trihex ] . \n there is at most one point in the top white triangle , and so there are at least three points in the lower white region . \n the case of no points in the top triangle and four in the bottom is easy to dispense with by using lemma [ trihex ] . \n so assume that there is one point , @xmath110 , in the top triangle \n .     lies in one of the three shaded triangles . \n assume that @xmath109 in the top triangle.,width=192 ]    now @xmath111 and @xmath112 are all in the lower white region of figure [ fig : case2 ] . they can not all be in the lower two strips , or we are done by the parallelogram lemma with a @xmath113-parallelogram , so there is at least one point @xmath114 on the third or fourth row , by symmetry assume it is in the triangle on the left , as in figure [ fig : case22 ] . \n , @xmath110 , and @xmath114 are in the three shaded triangles : @xmath109 in the center , @xmath110 at the top , and @xmath114 on the bottom - left.,width=192 ]    by lemma [ parallel ] with a @xmath115-parallelogram along the left edge of @xmath6 and containing points @xmath110 and @xmath114 , @xmath109 must be in the bottom right corner triangle of side length @xmath10 , as in figure [ fig : case24 ] . then applying lemma [ parallel ] with @xmath107 and @xmath116-parallelograms gives that @xmath117 and @xmath112 are in the white region at the bottom of figure [ fig : case24 ] . \n -parallelogram , point @xmath109 is in the bottom right corner of the center triangle , or we are done.,width=192 ]     with @xmath107 and @xmath108 parallelograms gives than @xmath117 and @xmath112 are in the white regions at the bottom of @xmath6 . \n then @xmath114 , @xmath117 , and @xmath112 form a small triangle.,width=192 ]    we claim that then @xmath114 , @xmath117 , and @xmath112 form a triangle of area @xmath27 or less . given any particular location of @xmath117 and @xmath112 , triangle @xmath118 attains its maximum value ( given @xmath117 and @xmath112 ) with @xmath114 at a corner of its boundary triangle . \n if @xmath114 is one of the bottom two corners , then the three points are in a @xmath113-parallelogram , and if it is the top corner , they are in a @xmath119-parallelogram . in either case , the area of the triangle is less than @xmath27 by lemma [ parallel ] . \n then case iii is the only possibility left , that all five points contained in the outer shaded region in figure [ fig : case3 ] . \n we break the outer strip into three diamond and trapezoid shaped regions , figure [ fig : case32 ] . \n places severe restrictions on where the points may lie , if they are to form no small triangles . \n in fact without loss of generality we assume that @xmath109 is in the diamond on top , @xmath110 and @xmath114 in the trapezoids on the left and right , and @xmath117 and @xmath112 in the bottom trapezoid.,width=192 ]    any pair of the trapezoids can be covered with a hexagon and two triangles of diameter @xmath61 , so by lemma [ trihex ] , they contain a total of at most three points from @xmath15 . \n it is quick to deduce from this , that the points are distributed @xmath120 in the trapezoids , with one point in the diamond opposite the trapezoid with two points , or we are done . by symmetry \n we assume @xmath109 is in the diamond on top , @xmath110 and @xmath114 are in the trapezoids on the left and right , respectively , and @xmath117 and @xmath112 are in the bottom trapezoid .    by @xmath119-parallelograms at the top vertex of @xmath6 and going down the left and right sides , @xmath117 and @xmath112 are in an even smaller trapezoid , as seen in figure [ fig : case33 ] , but then we are done by lemma [ trihex ] . +    -parallelograms force @xmath117 and @xmath112 into in an even smaller trapezoid , shaded at bottom , but then we are done by lemma [ trihex].,width=192 ]    this completes the proof of the main result , but begs the question :    what is the minimum @xmath121 of all @xmath122 such that among every five points in a triangle of unit area , some three of them form a triangle of area less than or equal to @xmath122 ? \n ( note that @xmath121 is actually a minimum and not just an infinium , by compactness . \n @xcite )    [ inf ]    by figure [ fig : s16 ] , we have @xmath123 . \n this might be best possible .    . \n point @xmath124 is at the corner , @xmath76 and @xmath125 are on midpoints , and @xmath85 and @xmath126 partition the bottom side into three equal segments . \n note that triangles @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 all have area equal to @xmath131.,width=240 ]    @xmath132 . \n * in this section we return to using `` small '' to refer to triangles of area @xmath133 . \n * there is another way in which theorem [ soif ] might be improved , besides varying the @xmath0 . \n is it possible that given five points in a triangle of unit area , they must form not only one small triangle , but more than one ? \n we conjecture that this is the case ; in particular we believe the following holds . \n this is not true with `` three '' replaced by `` four '' , by the arrangement in figure [ fig:3small ] . \n if the conjecture holds then the following corollary would follow , by averaging : given @xmath134 points in a triangle of unit area , there they form at least @xmath135 small triangles . \n this leads us to the following question . \n a. soifer , how does one cut a triangle ? , center for excellence in mathematical education , 1990 v. boltyanski and a. soifer , geometric etudes in combinatorial mathematics , center for excellence in mathematical education , 1992 a. soifer , a mathematical coloring book , springer , 2008 a. soifer , colorado math olympiad , first ten years and further explorations , 1994", "StartTimeOffset": 1075837470834, "RequestID": "1c9d1bcb18c2032fec39061ad04607b89c5830e1", "TotalTokens": 4331}
{"ContextTokens": 1540, "GeneratedTokens": 239, "SynthesizedBody": "why the stars and galaxies are rotating ? what is the origin of the angular momentum ? it is known that the planets in our solar system show a remarkable scaling relation between the angular momentum @xmath1 and the mass @xmath2 for each planet , @xmath3 where the unit mass and the angular momentum are measured respectively by the planck mass @xmath4 g  and the reduced planck constant @xmath5erg@xmath6sec . \n only exceptions are the mercury and the venus whose rotations are locked with their orbital rotation around the sun . although the sun by itself deviates from the above scaling , the whole solar system is also on this line . because the relation eq.([jmplanets ] ) \n holds for the conserved quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it strongly suggests some fundamental origin of the planet system .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] \n we summarize our study and discuss on further extension and possible applications of it . \n we started our study from an interesting scaling law but @xmath7 within the cluster series . \n the same index is suggested for star series . \n see below . ] \n @xmath8 which holds for angular momentum @xmath1  and the mass @xmath2  of astronomical objects from the scale of planets toward that of clusters of galaxies . focussing on the cluster series , such as globular clusters , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , we extracted the nature of the fully non - linear stage of dark matter , after the formation of caustic surface , in analogy between sgs and the fluid turbulence . \n the essential kolmogorov laws were rederived from the fourier transformed navier - stokes equation and equations for sgs , by demanding the existence of a steady energy flow characterized by a single parameter @xmath9 . \n this is an analogue of the case of smoluchowski coagulation equation , which admits scaling solution by demanding the steady mass flow . \n then we tried to test our considerations in several cosmological observations , such as the velocity dispersion , mass - luminosity ratio , @xmath10 relation , power spectrum of density fluctuations , and the cosmic magnetic fields . \n they all point the concordant value for the constant energy flow per mass : @xmath11@xmath12sec@xmath13 .      1 . \n we would like to evaluate the energy flow @xmath9 for dm , which may be associated with the hierarchical coalescence process in which smaller clusters continuously form larger clusters . \n this process provides the bottom - up scenario for the formation of large scale structure especially in the cold dm model . \n we would like to check whether the value we used @xmath14@xmath15 $ ] is consistent with the hierarchical coalescence evolution of dm . \n roughly estimated , this accumulation rate of kinetic energy yields a galaxy within about @xmath16 years . \n if the above is the case for dm , then we would like to apply the same analysis to our planet system , which is also considered to have the coalescence evolution as its origin [ 35 ] . \n actually in the left half of figure [ fig3 ] , the planet and star systems seem to admit the fitting line with the same slope @xmath17 as the case for dm but with larger parameter value for @xmath9 . \n it turns out that the appropriate value for @xmath18  becomes of order @xmath19 , which seems to be too large to be explained from a simple coalescence process as in the case for dm . some violent mechanism , which allow huge energy transfer rate or catastrophic coalescence , is expected in the case for planet formation process . \n 3 .   in the fluid turbulence \n , there holds another relation often called kolmogorov 4/5 law @xmath20which is essential to explain the energy flow takes place from low frequency modes to high frequency modes on average . \n then what is the analogous relation for sgs and how is it relevant in the universe ? \n although we do not know the answer , it will be important to notice the fact that sgs [ 36 ] shares some common properties with the fluid turbulence [ 37 ] , such as the negative skewness and the exponential distribution function of the velocity - difference , etc . \n these common properties will be a good starting point for further discussion . \n 4 .   it would be interesting if we could actually transform eq.(ftjeans2 ) into the smoluchowski form like eq.([smoluchowski ] ) which directly expresses the coalescence evolution of sgs . \n if this is the case , the possible scaling solution , which may asymptotically realize , may correspond to the schechter function [ 3 ] which has a typical form , @xmath21where @xmath22 represents the frequency of the object of luminosity @xmath23 . if the cosmological objects are formed after many coalescence processes , then the smoluchowski equation will be more appropriate than the press - schechter theory [ 3 ] , in which a single collapse determines the population of objects at the corresponding scale \n . if this is the case , the index @xmath24 for the kernel @xmath25 ( see just below eq.([smoluchowski ] ) ) should be about @xmath26 . \n the exponential factor @xmath27 seems to be a natural tail of the distribution which is gradually evolving without runaway coalescence . \n we could not complete the argument on the velocity - luminosity ( or mass ) relation [ 38 ] which holds within a single species of object , from our point of view . \n if we simply apply our argument for luminous objects , we would have , from @xmath28 , the luminosity @xmath29as a function of the velocity @xmath30 or the velocity dispersion @xmath31  at that scale , provided appropriate reference ratio @xmath32 is given . \n for dm , we have , from @xmath33 , the mass expression @xmath34on the other hand , several tight relations are obtained for each type of galaxies . for spiral galaxies , tally - fisher relation of the form eq.(lv - rel ) holds with the variation of index from 3 for b - band to 4 for k band observations . for elliptical galaxies , a tight relation on the fundamental plane \n is established , @xmath35const.@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average surface brightness . \n although we can simply apply our argument to yield @xmath38which is almost consistent with the above , we can not obtain the relation in the form of a plain among three independent parameters ; all quantities are functions of only @xmath39 in our case . \n the authors would like to thank osamu hashimoto , hidenori takahashi for relevant discussions on the turbulence , osamu iguchi , yasuhide sota , and tohru tashiro for discussion on the local virial relation , nozomi mori for the cosmic magnetic fields and dynamo theory , masaaki morita , hideaki mouri for turbulence and fate of cosmic vorticity , kiyotaka tanikawa for showing us his paper before publication and providing us relevant references on @xmath10 relation , takayuki tatekawa for higher - order density perturbation theories . \n all of their help has been crucial for the completion of this paper .", "StartTimeOffset": 1092438317064, "RequestID": "f22d40afce00fd40726166a655bc60dbe1276fb4", "TotalTokens": 1779}

{"ContextTokens": 3880, "GeneratedTokens": 176, "SynthesizedBody": "an important issue in astronomical ccd photometry is obtaining an unbiased flux estimate for an extended source . \n usually , a circular or elliptic aperture is used for estimating the total flux of a source . \n while the aperture must be sufficiently wide for including most of the fluxes from the source , its size should be limited in order to minimize the sky noise and avoid contamination from the nearby sources . \n some adaptive schemes , such as kron aperture @xcite and petrosian aperture @xcite , have been proposed for optimization of results . \n however , galaxy photometry is not a straightforward process . for galaxies in a crowded region or for irregular galaxies with odd shapes , \n it is difficult to obtain the `` best '' aperture . automatic elliptical / circular apertures could include extra contributions from the nearby sources or miss the faint parts of the irregular galaxies . sometimes , it is also difficult to de - blend the flux from the nearby objects with an elliptical or circular aperture in a crowded region . \n the uncertainties in the flux measurement not only stem from the background noise but also from the shape and size uncertainties of the integrating aperture itself .    ideally , the sky noise could be minimized and the contamination from the nearby sources could be avoided if the aperture used is similar to or has the same shape as the source . \n isophotal technique has been applied for similar purposes @xcite . however \n , isophotal apertures might miss the faint edges of the objects and thus could underestimate the fluxes from the objects ; a corrected isophotal aperture photometry has thus been proposed to correct the problem @xcite . \n the corrected isophotal aperture assumes that the faint edge of an object is mainly affected with gaussian atmospheric blurring ; therefore , the total flux owing to the object can be derived from the isophotal aperture with a gaussian blurring correction . \n the correction might be suitable for point sources ; however , it has large uncertainty when applied to spheroidal galaxies . \n moreover , the wing of atmospheric point spread function was found to behave more like a power law rather than a gaussian profile @xcite .    for merging galaxies , which usually have more complex morphology \n , we would likely have too many unwanted background noises or contamination sources when applying elliptical apertures . \n isophotal technique might be quite suitable for merging galaxies , but it might miss the faint structures of the merging galaxies . \n currently , there is no suitable aperture technique that is specifically designed for merging galaxies . to achieve this goal \n , we provide a completely different algorithm by utilizing pattern recognition routines for obtaining an adaptive aperture which is enlarged from the original shape of the source by extending its boundary . \n we considered such an enlarged aperture is `` quasi - homomorphic '' to the original shape of the source . \n such a quasi - homomorphic aperture is very suitable for estimating the total magnitudes of irregular galaxies or normal sources in crowded regions .    in this supplement \n , we present a new technique for obtaining adaptive homomorphic apertures automatically by using pattern recognition routines . in section [ method ] \n , we describe the adaptive aperture photometry process in detail . \n this technique was applied to the merging galaxies observed in several survey projects , and the results are shown in section [ application ] . \n finally , in the last section , we discuss our results and summarize our methods . \n we developed a new algorithm for measuring the magnitudes of irregular objects by using adaptive homomorphic aperture photometry . \n the algorithm uses pattern recognition routines to create homomorphic apertures that are similar to the shapes of the irregular objects . \n the shapes of the sources and the apertures are identified in binary images , which are converted from the original ccd images based on detection thresholds . \n our photometry processes include background subtraction , binary image creation and homomorphic dilations . \n the software for these processes was implemented in the interactive data language ( idl ) .      before measuring the flux of a source in a ccd image \n , the background has to be subtracted from the ccd image . \n a global background value is usually not representative of the entire ccd image . to do the background subtraction \n , we basically follow the background subtraction steps in the sextractor package . \n our algorithm first divides the ccd image into several grids ( usually 200x200 pixels for one grid ) in order to get the local background values . after rejecting the outliers , the algorithm estimates the mode ( @xmath0 ) and the standard deviation for each grid . \n the algorithm applies a 3x3 median filter on the grids to reduce the overestimation around bright objects . in other words , for each grid the algorithm selects the median value of its eight neighbors to replace the value of that grid . \n the algorithm applies the bi - cubic - convolution interpolation to the entire ccd image to construct a smooth background map and a standard deviation map for background subtraction and following processes . \n the algorithm sets a threshold on the background - subtracted image to create a binary image . \n a specific pixel value will be set to 1(0 ) if the corresponding pixel of the background - subtracted image has a value higher ( lower ) than the local threshold . in the algorithm , \n the threshold is a free parameter , measured in units of local standard deviation @xmath1 . \n the default threshold is 1.5 @xmath1 in order to retain the faint structures of the sources . in the binary images , \n a group of connected pixels that exceed the threshold value is considered as an object .    to identify real sources \n , the algorithm applies the smoothing operator _ \n opening _ on the binary image . \n the operator _ opening _ is a combination operator of the image operators _ erosion _ and _ dilation _ , which are two basic image operators in the area of mathematical morphology @xcite . \n the effect of _ \n dilation_/_erosion _ on a binary image is to enlarge / reduce the boundaries of the objects . \n graphical illustrations of these processes are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . \n the operator _ opening _ will eliminate the objects that are due to background noise fluctuations ; these fake sources are usually have the sizes less than 5 pixels in the binary images . \n such a smoothing process might not reduce some noises that are correlated , but they will not affect on the photometry of real sources . \n the _ opening _ operator also disconnects the weak links between the object and nearby sources in the binary image . after completing the _ opening _ , \n the remaining group of connected pixels will be considered as a real object , and its coordinates will be set at the geometric center of the connected pixels . \n the adaptive aperture uses an irregular aperture that is quasi - homomorphic to the real shape of a source . for an irregular source , \n the source s shape can be derived from the binary image . however , galaxies have fluxes that decrease slowly as a function of radius and could have parts of their fluxes mixed with background noise , especially on the edges . to capture most of the fluxes of an irregular object , our algorithm takes the object s shape in the binary image to be its original shape and increases the aperture size in a quasi - homomorphic manner , implying that the aperture s size is enlarged while trying to preserve the original source s shape . \n the quasi - homomorphic extension of the aperture is implemented by using the _ dilation _ operator . \n the _ dilation _ \n operator can be applied more than once for obtaining the best estimate of the flux . \n the best size of the aperture should be the smallest size that captures all of the source s flux . for an isolated normal galaxy , \n this technique should yield the same results as other aperture techniques . \n we selected several known normal galaxies , which have well - defined photometric information , for examining the relation between the measured fluxes and the aperture sizes for several different instruments . \n the sizes of the apertures could be determined by comparing our results with the results for these known galaxies . because of the different sensitivity and observation conditions at different observations , the best aperture size for different instruments might be different . \n the number of _ dilations _ was set as a free parameter in the algorithm , for determining suitable aperture sizes for different observational data . \n to look for suitable parameters of the aperture sizes , we created 100,000 virtual galaxy images for testing . \n the artificial galaxies were created by using the combination of the s@xmath2rsic and the exponential profiles . \n these galaxies have different bulge - to - disk ratios , s@xmath2rsic indexes , and ellipticities and have the brightness difference as large as ten magnitudes . \n besides , 20,000 of the galaxies have asymmetric structures produced by adding an additional s@xmath2rsic model . \n we took these 100,000 artificial galaxy images to exam the performance of our algorithms . \n the results show that our method can detect more than 90% of the total fluxes for most of the galaxies using the threshold of 1.5  @xmath1 . \n these apertures with more _ dilations _ will recover more fluxes , but had little improvement after 3 _ dilations_. the testing also showed that the performance of this method is mainly affected by the the signal - to - noise ratios of the sources .    for testing the proposed method in real data , we applied the algorithm on the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ? \n * sdss ) images and the red sequence survey 2 ( * ? ? ? \n * rcs2 ) images . \n we selected a group of known isolated normal galaxies for determining suitable parameters for the images . \n we then applied the method by using these parameters for measuring the magnitudes of merging galaxies . \n the sdss database provides well - calibrated background - subtracted images . to test our algorithms , we selected 3,219 isolated normal galaxies from the sdss data release 9 and 42 mergers from the galaxy zoo project @xcite . figure  [ fig2 ] shows the measured fluxes vs. the aperture sizes of the 3,219 isolated galaxies . \n the results indicate that the best aperture sizes require four _ dilation _ operations with the threshold of 1.5 @xmath1 . \n we applied the parameters to obtain the homomorphic apertures for the 42 mergers and measured their fluxes . \n we compared our results with the sdss pertrosian measurements . since we only measured the total fluxes of the merging galaxy systems , we summed the sdss pertrosian fluxes of individual galaxies in the systems for comparison . \n as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , our algorithm was able to detect more fluxes from the merging galaxy systems . \n this result are most likely caused by the faint structures of the objects which did not contained in the individual galaxies measurements . \n the results indicate that this method is able to detect fluxes from the faint structures of the merging galaxy systems . \n @xcite have found more than 13,000 merging galaxy candidates by analyzing the rcs2 images . \n the rcs2 images were observed by the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) with the wide - field imager megacam @xcite . \n we adopted the adaptive homomorphic aperture method for retrieving the photometric information of these merging galaxy candidates . \n we used 1,081 isolated normal galaxies for estimating the best dilation number in determining the size of the homomorphic apertures ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) . \n the empirical test shows that the best size of an aperture requires 2 homomorphic dilations . with these parameters , \n the photometric information on the g , r , z bands for 13,290 mergers out of the 13,577 candidates has been successfully obtained . \n for the 287 failure cases , 102 were owing to the pollution of cosmic rays ; 110 sources had objects in immediate neighborhood , which were less than 0.6 arcseconds ( @xmath3 3 pixels ) away from the edges of the sources ; the rest were owing to false background subtraction . \n we developed an adaptive homomorphic aperture technique for measuring the fluxes of irregular objects . \n this technique needs to decide suitable parameters in determining the best size of an aperture . \n we can use a catalog of artificial sources or a group of known isolated galaxies with regular shapes to decide the suitable parameters . to contain minimum noises \n , the adaptive homomorphic apertures should be as small as possible but would capture the fluxes of the sources as much as possible . for irregular objects , this method might also contain faint structures of the sources , which might not be included by other automatically aperture techniques . \n our test showed that our algorithms could capture more fluxes for merging galaxies than did the petrosian aperture technique ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , whereas these two techniques demonstrated similar results for normal galaxies . \n this results indicate that the adaptive homomorphic apertures can be useful for detecting faint structures , which might not be detected by using the petrosian aperture technique .    in the algorithms , \n the threshold and the number of _ dilations _ are two main parameters that need to be decided . \n threshold value will determine the shapes of the objects . \n using high threshold values can minimize the contamination of background noises and separate very nearby sources but may loss the structure information at the edges of the objects . through the test for the known isolated galaxies with regular shapes \n , we found that the threshold value and the number of _ dilations _ are not independent ; using high threshold values need more _ dilations _ in order to have more accurate estimation of the fluxes of the sources . \n the adaptive homomorphic aperture technique requires different number of _ dilations _ for yielding the best aperture sizes for images with different sensitivity and resolutions . \n our tests showed that the number of _ dilations _ for the sdss images is four ; however , under the same threshold condition , the number of _ dilations _ for the rcs2 images is two . \n the method might require a group of known isolated galaxies with regular shapes for empirically deciding the suitable parameters for different observations . \n the influence of seeing will also be taken into account through the parameter deciding ; the dilated regions usually need to be greater than or similar to the seeing . \n the adaptive homomorphic aperture technique is also useful for objects located in the crowded regions . \n many merging galaxies in the rcs2 images were detected with additional nearby objects . \n the median seeing of the rcs2 images is about 0.7 arcseconds and the pixel sizes are about 0.2 arcseconds . with these observational conditions , we found that the homomorphic apertures can avoid contaminations from the nearby objects as long as the nearby objects are more than 0.6 arcseconds away from the edges of the sources . \n the images in different observing bands may require different parameters in creating the best adaptive homomorphic apertures . \n this might cause a problem when estimating the colors of objects since the detected areas on different images are different . to avoid this problem , we used a common aperture to measure the fluxes of an object in different observing bands . \n the basic shape in creating the common aperture of an object was the union of three basic shapes from aligned images of different observing bands . \n this technique is similar to the isophotal technique . \n the isophotal aperture photometry determines the aperture sizes by considering the pixels that have signals above the detection threshold , which is similar to the sizes of the original objects in the first step of the binary image process in our algorithm \n . generally speaking , the isophotal technique might miss the faint structures of the objects and might underestimate their total fluxes . \n there is a corrected isophotal aperture photometry attempting to correct the problem theoretically @xcite . \n the corrected isophotal apertures assume that the faint edges of the objects mainly stem from the gaussian atmospheric blurring ; thus , the total fluxes of the objects can be derived from the isophotal aperture photometry results by applying the correction relation . on the other hand \n , our algorithm avoids this problem by using the homomorphic dilation process . \n we applied these three aperture photometry techniques on the isolated normal galaxy samples of the sdss and the rcs2 for examining their performance ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) . \n we found that the measurement results obtained by using our algorithm are comparable with the results of the corrected isophotal technique for the rcs2 galaxies ; however , for the sdss sources , the results obtained by our algorithm are consistent with those of the petrosian measurement results , whereas both the isophotal and corrected isophotal measurement results seem to underestimate the true fluxes . \n these results suggest that the adaptive homomorphic aperture technique works well for different observations and the photometry information can be acquired in a straightforward manner . \n the adaptive homomorphic aperture technique is applicable to irregularly shaped extended sources and is also useful for sources in crowded regions . \n however , it might be necessary to decide the best number of dilations empirically for different instruments . \n once the number of dilations has been decided for specific observation data , the algorithms can be used for obtaining the fluxes of the sources . \n this work was partially supported by the ministry of science and

{"ContextTokens": 3223, "GeneratedTokens": 160, "SynthesizedBody": "new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has drawn extensive attention since the discovery of the sm higgs boson @xcite . while a few problems such as how to stabilize the higgs mass against ultraviolet radiative corrections are tied to new physics of high mass scale , in this paper \n we instead focus on dark matter with a mass near the weak scale . \n in contrast to new physics which appears at a rather high mass scale , such a dark matter model has promising prospect for discovery at both astrophysical and particle collider experiments . \n in particular , we are interested in the simplest higgs - portal dark matter model , in which the dark matter communicates with sm particles via the higgs scalar . unlike the fermion dark matter setting , a scalar dark matter in the so - called higgs - portal scalar dark matter model ( hsdm ) @xcite still survives the latest data of direct detections at xenon100 @xcite and lux @xcite , indirect detections at fermi - lat @xcite , and higgs invisible decay at the lhc run 1 @xcite . \n detailed discussions about this model have been given in the literature ( @xcite-@xcite ) . \n fitting the experimental data indicates that the dark matter mass is either near the resonant mass region between @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev or in a large - mass region above @xmath5 gev . \n while the large - mass region between 185 gev and 3 tev can be probed by the future xenon1 t @xcite , most of the resonant mass region is beyond the reach of this facility . in this paper \n , we discuss the collider signatures of the scalar dark matter in the hsdm model with a mass between @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev at the 14 tev lhc and the future 100 tev proton collider ( fcc ) . \n we will show that similar to circular electron positron collider ( cepc ) @xcite , fcc will be a useful machine for searching dark matter in this narrow mass region . \n we will show that for fcc with a luminosity of 10 @xmath6 the exclusion and discovery sensitivities reach to 57 gev and 56 gev respectively through the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) channel , and 54.8 gev and 53.9 gev respectively via the mono-@xmath7 channel . \n it indicates that fcc with 10 @xmath6 is a competitive facility in comparison with cepc or xenon1 t . \n the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec . \n ii , we briefly discuss the direct and indirect detection constraints on the hsdm . in sec.iii \n we address the collider phenomenologies for the hsdm with dark matter mass in the narrow resonant mass region at the 14 tev lhc and the 100 tev fcc , where we focus on both the vbf channel and mono-@xmath7 channel . \n our main results are presented in sec . \n iv , where we show the luminosities required for the @xmath1 exclusion and @xmath2 discovery . \n finally we conclude in sec . v. \n in the simplest hsdm model , the dark matter @xmath8 communicates with the sm particles through the sm higgs scalar . \n the lagrangian for this mode reads as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the singlet scalar bare mass , the self - interaction coupling constant , and the coupling constant between dark matter and sm higgs , respectively . a @xmath13 parity , under which @xmath8 is odd and other fields are even , is imposed to make the dm stable , which reduces the number of model parameters . \n after the electroweak symmetry breaking one can obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the physical mass of the singlet scalar , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 gev .    among the three model parameters , the self - interaction coupling @xmath19 does not directly affect the dm relic abundance , the dm - nucleon scattering cross section and dm production cross section at colliders , we simply decouple this parameter from the dm phenomenology discussed below . \n it turns out that the remaining two parameters are strongly constrained . \n assume that the cold dark matter is saturated by the singlet scalar @xmath8 , @xmath8 should account for the dm relic density measured by the planck and wmap @xcite , @xmath20 from which one infers the correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath12 as shown in fig.[figic ] . \n besides the relic abundance in eq.([relic ] ) , there are other indirect constraints , including the higgs invisible decay @xmath22 in the mass region @xmath23 and the @xmath24-ray limits from the fermi - lat @xcite . for the higgs invisible decay , fig.[figic ] \n shows the latest limits at the 8 tev lhc @xcite , hl - lhc and cepc @xcite , which indicates that @xmath21 below 52 gev is excluded by the data @xmath25 , while the hl - lhc and cepc can reach 54 gev and 57 gev , respectively .     from the dark matter relic abundance and higgs \n invisible decays at the lhc run 1 , hl - lhc and cepc.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      the direct detection at lux and xenon1 t can further constrain the parameter space , according to the spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the nucleon mass , @xmath28 is the dm - nucleon reduced mass , and @xmath29 is the hadron matrix element @xcite . \n fig.[figdc ] shows the predicted values of the spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section , together with direct detection limits at xenon100 @xcite and lux @xcite experiments . \n the limits at xenon1 t @xcite have been also shown . \n it indicates that the dark matter mass is restricted to a narrow resonant region between 53 gev and 63 gev . \n once we employ the latest fermi - lat limits @xcite , this narrow mass region is further reduced to a narrow range between 53 gev and 62.5 gev .     from lux and xenon experiments . \n the red curve represents the dark matter relic abundance constraint.,scaledwidth=70.0% ] \n in this section we study the collider signatures of the scalar dark matter at the 14 tev lhc and 100 tev fcc . \n we will explore the sensitivities at these two colliders for the dark matter mass in the narrow resonant region between 53 gev and 62.5 gev . \n we consider the dominant vbf channel as well as the sub - leading but relatively clean mon-@xmath7 channel . \n we use feynrules @xcite to generate model files prepared for madgraph5 @xcite , which includes pythia 6 @xcite for parton showering and hadronazition , and the package delphes 3 @xcite for fast detector simulation . \n in particular , the default cms detector card and the snowmass detector card are used for the 14 tev and 100 tev @xmath30 collider , respectively . \n events are generated by using madgraph5 at the leading order with the 125 gev higgs and fixed value @xmath31 for different dark matter masses . \n cross sections are reproduced by rescaling @xmath32 which corresponds to @xmath33 .      in the vbf channel , \n the dark matter pairs are produced through the higgs scalar @xmath34 where the higgs @xmath35 should be on - shell in our case . \n the primary sm backgrounds to this process include @xmath36jets , @xmath37jets , @xmath38jets and qcd multi - jets . for simplicity \n we consider the main contributions arising from @xmath39 and @xmath37jets channels , and adopt the cuts used by the cms vbf analysis @xcite for event selection : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity of the first ( second ) leading jet , respectively . \n @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the rapidity difference , azimuthal - angel difference and invariant mass of the two leading jets , respectively . \n any event with an additional jet with @xmath46 gev and pseudo - rapidity between those of the two tagged jets is rejected . \n we firstly apply the criteria in eq.([selection1 ] ) to the 8 tev lhc with data of 19.5 @xmath47 . \n the number of events for the sm background is 134 in the @xmath36jets channels and 145 in the @xmath37jets channels , respectively . \n compared with the reported number of events ( 99 in the @xmath36 jets channels and 183 in the @xmath37 jets channels ) by the cms collaboration @xcite , they are consistent with each other .    the criteria in eq.([selection1 ] ) \n will be also applied to both the 14 tev lhc and 100 tev fcc simulations for conservation . \n it is based on the following facts . \n first , there is little difference between the 8 tev lhc and 14 tev lhc except the collision energy , which means the cut on the pseudo - rapidity of the first two leading jets should remain unchanged . \n second , the kinetic distribution of the signal events though on - shell higgs decay and the main backgrounds z@xmath48jets and w@xmath48jets have similar changing trends when one modifies the cuts in eq.([selection1 ] ) , as the mass difference between the higgs and @xmath49 boson can be omitted compared to the variation of collision energy . \n it turns out that for a benchmark dm mass the effects on the ratio of signal over background events @xmath50 are less than two times due to variations on the cuts in eq.(6 ) such as @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 , @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 and @xmath55 gev . \n see table below for details . \n .effects on the ratio @xmath50 due to variations on the cuts in eq.([selection1 ] ) for benchmark dm mass @xmath56 gev at 100 tev fcc . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the mono-@xmath7 channel the dark matter pairs are produced via the process @xmath57 compared with the vbf channel , the mono-@xmath7 channel is sub - leading but relatively cleaner . for event selection in this channel \n we adopt the following cuts as suggested by the cms leptonic mode analysis @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dilepton transverse momentum and @xmath60 is defined as the component of @xmath61 parallel to the direction of @xmath62 . \n events are rejected if an additional electron or muon is reconstructed with @xmath63 gev , and any event having two or more jets with @xmath64 gev . \n similar to the discussions in the preceding section , the criteria in eq.([selection2 ] ) are examined via the 8 tev lhc simulation with data of 19.7 @xmath47 . \n the number of events for the sm background is 88 in the mono-@xmath7 channel . \n compared with the reported number of events 138 in the same channel by the cms collaboration @xcite , they are consistent with each other . unlike the cms result , the next - leading order ( nlo ) effects have been neglected in our simulation . \n the two numbers of events likely match better if the nlo effects are included in our analysis . following the similar facts mentioned in the preceding section , the criteria in eq.([selection2 ] ) will be directly applied to both the 14 tev lhc and 100 tev fcc simulations . \n we present our main results in fig.[fig14 ] and fig.[fig100 ] , which show the integrated luminosity @xmath65 needed for exclusion and discovery at the 14 tev lhc and 100 tev fcc , respectively . here , we take the following definition about significance @xmath66 systematic uncertainties are neglected in both the signal and the background simulations .     and 5@xmath67 discovery determined by @xmath68 in vbf and mono-@xmath7 channel at the 14 tev lhc , respectively . \n the solid dark line represents the 10 ab@xmath69 integrated luminosity.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    , but for the 100 tev fcc.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig.[fig14 ] one observes that for @xmath70 @xmath47 the scalar dark matter mass up to 53.5 gev can be excluded , and for @xmath71 @xmath47 the exclusion and discovery limits via vbf channel will reach to 54.6 gev and 54 gev , respectively . \n in contrast , fig.[fig100 ] shows that for @xmath70 @xmath47 the scalar dark matter mass up to 54.5 gev can be excluded , and for @xmath71 @xmath47 the exclusion and discovery limits at the fcc via vbf channel approaches to 55.8 gev and 55 gev , respectively . \n the exclusion limits via the mono-@xmath7 channel are obviously weaker in comparison with the vbf channel .    taking an integrated luminosity @xmath72 @xmath6 at the 100 tev fcc \n , one finds that the exclusion and discovery limits approach to 57 gev and 56 gev in the vbf channel , respectively . \n compared with either cepc or xenon1 t , where the exclusion limits approach to 56.5 gev and 56 gev , respectively , the fcc with @xmath72 @xmath6 is a competitive facility . \n fig.[fig14 ] and fig.[fig100 ] also illustrate that it is unlikely to detect the scalar dark matter in the mass range between 57 gev and 62.5 gev in hsdm model at any present and future facilities mentioned in this paper . \n in this paper , we explored the collider signatures of the scalar dark matter in the hsdm model . \n our study shows that for the 100 tev fcc with an integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath6 , the exclusion and discovery sensitivities reach to 57 gev and 56 gev respectively through the vbf channel , and 54.8 gev and 53.9 gev respectively via the mono-@xmath7 channel . \n compared with either cepc or xenon1 t , where the exclusion limits approach to 56.5 gev and 56 gev , respectively , fcc is a competitive facility . \n unfortunately , the scalar dark matter in the mass range between 56.5 gev and 62.5 gev is unlikely to be either directly or indirectly detected at any present and future facility discussed in this paper .", "StartTimeOffset": 1135330538502, "RequestID": "8fcbbdb45c92a053aedabb30ec0252c85ac6c6e3", "TotalTokens": 3383}
{"ContextTokens": 3632, "GeneratedTokens": 154, "SynthesizedBody": "the scientific study of the problems of growth and form occupies an anomalously broad set of disciplines . \n whether the emergent patterns are physical or biological in origin , their quantitative description presents many challenging and compelling issues in , for example , applied mathematics @xcite , biophysics @xcite , condensed matter @xcite and geophysics @xcite wherein the motion of free boundaries is of central interest . in all such settings a principal goal is to predict the evolution of a boundary that is often under the influence of an instability . \n here we study a novel variant of such a situation that occurs naturally on the frozen surfaces of lakes . \n lakes commonly freeze during a snowfall . \n when a hole forms in the ice cover , relatively warm lake water will flow through it and hence through the snow layer . \n in the process of flowing through and melting the snow this warm water creates dark regions . \n the pattern so produced looks star - like ( see figure [ fig : photo ] ) and we refer to it as a `` lake star '' . \n these compelling features have been described qualitatively a number of times ( e.g.  @xcite ) but work on the formation process itself has been solely heuristic . \n knight  @xcite outlines a number of the physical ideas relevant to the process , but does not translate them into a predictive framework to model field observations . \n knight s main idea is that locations with faster flow rates melt preferentially , leading to even faster flow rates and therefore to an instability that results in fingers . \n this idea has features that resemble those of many other instabilities such as , for example , those observed during the growth of binary alloys @xcite , in flow of water through a rigid hot porous media @xcite , or in more complex geomorphological settings @xcite , and we structure our model accordingly .    katsaros  @xcite and woodcock  @xcite attribute the holes from which the stars emanate and the patterns themselves to thermal convection patterns within the lake , but do not measure or calculate their nature . \n however , often the holes do not exhibit a characteristic distance between them but rather form from protrusions ( e.g. sticks that poke through the ice surface )  @xcite and stars follow thereby ruling out a convective mechanism as being necessary to explain the phenomena . \n the paucity of literature on this topic provides little more than speculation regarding the puncturing mechanism but lake stars are observed in all of these circumstances . \n therefore , while hole formation is necessary for lake star formation , its origin does not control the mechanism of pattern formation , which is the focus of the present work . \n the water level in the hole is higher than that in the wet snow  slush \n layer @xcite and hence we treat this warm waterc . ] region as having a constant height above the ice or equivalently a constant pressure head , which drives flow of water through the slush layer , which we treat as a darcy flow of water at @xmath0c . \n we model the temperature field within the liquid region with an advection - diffusion equation and impose an appropriate ( _ stefan _ ) condition for energy conservation at the water - slush interface . \n the water is everywhere incompressible . \n finally , the model is closed with an outer boundary condition at which the pressure head is assumed known . \n although we lack _ in - situ _ pressure measurements , circular water - saturated regions ( a few meters in radius ) are observed around the lake stars . \n hence , we assume that the differential pressure head falls to zero somewhere in the vicinity of this circular boundary . \n the actual boundary at which the differential pressure head is zero is not likely to be completely uniform ( as in figure 4 of knight  @xcite ) but treating it as uniform is a good approximation in the linear regime of our analysis . \n finally , we treat the flow as two - dimensional . \n thus , although the water in direct contact with ice must be at @xmath0c , we consider the depth - averaged temperature , which is above freezing . additionally , the decreasing pressure head in the radial direction must be accompanied by a corresponding drop in water level . \n therefore , although the driving force is more accurately described as deriving from an axisymmetric gravity current , the front whose stability we assess is controlled by the same essential physical processes that we model herein . \n our analysis could be extended to account for these three - dimensional effects . \n the system is characterized by the temperature @xmath1 , a darcy fluid velocity @xmath2 , pressure @xmath3 , and an evolving liquid - slush interface @xmath4 . \n the liquid properties are @xmath5 ( thermal diffusivity ) , @xmath6 ( specific heat at constant pressure ) and @xmath7 ( dynamic viscosity ) and the slush properties are @xmath8 ( permeability ) , @xmath9 ( solid fraction ) and @xmath10 ( latent heat ) . \n we non - dimensionalized the equations of motion by scaling the length , temperature , pressure and velocity with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . \n thus , our model consists of the following system of dimensionless equations :    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    with boundary conditions    @xmath18    and @xmath19 where ( [ temp1n ] ) describes the temperature evolution in the liquid , ( [ pres2n ] ) and ( [ continuityn ] ) describe mass conservation with a darcy flow ( [ darcyn ] ) in the slush , ( [ stefann ] ) is the stefan condition , and ( [ temp_bcn ] ) and ( [ pres_bcn ] ) are the temperature and pressure boundary conditions , respectively ( see figure [ fig : schematic ] ) . \n note that ( [ pres1n ] ) and ( [ continuityn ] ) can both be satisfied since the liquid region has an effectively infinite permeability . \n the dimensionless parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the system are given by @xmath22 which describe an inverse peclet number and a stefan number respectively . because the liquid must be less than or equal to @xmath23c \n , we make the conservative estimates that @xmath24c , @xmath25 , and use the fact that @xmath26c from which we see @xmath27 . using @xmath28 , and the field observations of knight  @xcite to constrain @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath31 ) , we find that @xmath32 . \n we therefore employ the quasi - stationary ( @xmath33 ) and large peclet number ( @xmath34 ) approximations , and hence equations ( [ temp1n ] ) - ( [ pres_bcn ] ) are easily solved for a purely radial flow with cylindrical symmetry ( no @xmath35 dependence ) and circular liquid - slush interface . \n this ( boundary layer ) solution is    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where equation ( [ bla ] ) has an approximate implicit solution for @xmath40 given by @xmath41    we perform a linear stability analysis around this quasi - steady cylindrically symmetrical flow . \n proceeding in the usual way , we allow for scaled perturbations in @xmath42 and @xmath4 with scaled wavenumber @xmath43 , non - dimensional growth rate @xmath44 , and amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . keeping only terms linear in @xmath20 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 , we solve ( [ pres2n ] ) subject to ( [ pres_bcn ] ) , substitute into ( [ u_matchn ] ) and satisfy ( [ continuityn ] ) and ( [ temp1n ] ) . \n this gives the non - dimensional growth rate ( @xmath44 ) as a function of scaled wave number ( @xmath48 ) :    @xmath49    equation ( [ stability ] ) can be approximated in @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 . \n the stability curve ( [ stability ] ) and the approximation ( [ stability_2 ] ) are plotted in figure [ fig : stability_curve ] . \n the essential features of ( [ stability ] ) are a maximum in the range @xmath53 , zero growth rate at @xmath54 and a linear increase in stability with @xmath48 for large @xmath48 . \n the long - wavelength cut - off is typical of systems with a peclet number , here with the added effect of latent heat embodied in the stefan number . \n this demonstrates the competition between the advection and diffusion of heat and momentum ( in a harmonic pressure field ) ; the former driving the instability and the latter limiting its extent . \n the maximum growth rate occurs at approximately @xmath55 with ( non - dimensional ) growth rate @xmath56    translating ( [ stability_kap ] ) and ( [ stability_sap ] ) back into dimensional quantities , we find that the most unstable mode has angular size given by @xmath57 and has growth rate given by @xmath58 \n field observations of lake stars can not be _ controlled_. a reasonable estmate for @xmath11 is the radius of the wetted ( snow ) region around the lake stars , and observations  @xcite bound the value as @xmath59 . \n this is simply because if there were significant excess pressure at this point then the wetting front would have advanced further . \n however , it is also possible that the effective value of @xmath11 , say @xmath60 , is less than this either because the wetted radius is smaller earlier in the star formation process or because the ambient pressure level is reached at smaller radii . here , we take @xmath40 to be the radius of the roughly circular liquid - filled region at the center of the lake star ( @xmath61 ) as the best approximation during the initial stages of star formation ( see figure [ fig : obs_schem ] ) . \n field observations show that @xmath62 ,  @xcite and hence @xmath63 . \n we note that equations ( [ stability_deg ] ) and ( [ stability_ap ] ) are more sensitive to @xmath64 than @xmath40 or @xmath11 independently may also be interpreted as the radius of the lake star ( @xmath65 ) . \n field observations show @xmath66  @xcite and hence @xmath67 . ] . with this interpretation of @xmath11 \n we find a reasonable estimate of @xmath29 as @xmath68 . \n using these parameter values , the most unstable mode should have wavelength between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . letting the number of branches \n be @xmath71 , then @xmath72 and we clearly encompass the observed values for lake stars ( @xmath73 ) , but note that values ( @xmath74 ) are never seen in the field .    despite the dearth of field observations , \n many qualitative features embolden our interpretation . \n for example , the stars with larger values of @xmath75 have a larger number of branches . \n moreover , for any value of @xmath75 , our analysis predicts an increase in @xmath76 with @xmath11 and @xmath29 . \n indeed , @xmath29 increases with @xmath13 ( higher water height within the slush layer ) and @xmath8 ( less well - packed snow ) . \n therefore , we ascribe some of the variability among field observations to variations in these quantities ( which have not been measured in the field ) and the remainder to nonlinear effects . because the dendritic arms are observed long after onset and are far from small perturbations to a radially symmetric pattern , as one might see in the initial stages of the saffman - taylor instability , the process involves non - linear cooperative phenomena . \n hence , our model should only approximately agree with observations . although a rigorous non - linear analysis of the long term star evolution process ( e.g.  @xcite ) may more closely mirror field observations , the present state of the latter does not warrant that level of detail . instead , we examine the model physics through simple proof of concept experimentation described presently . \n a 30 cm diameter circular plate is maintained below freezing ( @xmath77c ) , and on top of this we place a 0.5 to 1 cm deep layer of slush through which we flow @xmath78c water . \n given the technical difficulties associated with its production , the grain size , and hence the permeability , of the slush layer , is not a controlled variable . \n this fact influences our results quantitatively . in fourteen runs we varied the initial size of the water - filled central hole ( @xmath40 ) , that of the circular slush layer ( @xmath11 ) , and the flow rate ( @xmath79 ) , which determines @xmath29 . \n the flow rate is adjusted manually so that the water level ( @xmath80 ) in the central hole remains constant . ) . \n it is significantly more difficult to prepare a uniform permeability sample with a circular hole initially present ; these runs are therefore more difficult to interpret . ] fingering is observed in every experimental run and \n hence we conclude that fingers are a robust feature of the system \n . two distinct types of fingering are observed : small - scale fingering ( see figure [ fig : fingers ] ) that forms early in an experimental run , and larger channel - like fingers ( see figure [ fig : channels ] ) that are ubiquitous at later times and often extend from the central hole to the outer edge of the slush . \n since the channel - like fingers provide a direct path for water to flow , effectively _ shorting _ darcy flow within the slush , their subsequent dynamics are not directly analogous to those in natural lake stars . \n however , in _ all _ runs , the initial small - scale fingers have the characteristics of lake stars and hence we focus upon them . we note that because the larger channel - like fingers emerge out of small - scale fingers , they likely represent the non - linear growth of the linear modes of instability , a topic left for future study . \n finally , we measure the distance between fingers ( @xmath81 ) , so that for each experiment we can calculate @xmath82 , @xmath83 , from equation ( [ stability_deg ] ) , and @xmath84 , and we can thereby compare experiment , theory and field observations .    in figure [ \n fig : comp ] we plot @xmath85 versus @xmath86 for the various field observations for which we have estimates of parameters , the laboratory experiments described above , and the model [ equation ( [ stability_deg ] ) ] . \n there is a large amount of scatter in both the experimental and observational data and the data does not lie on the one - to - one curve predicted by the model . \n however , the experiments are meant to demonstrate the features of the model predictions , and the results have the correct qualitative trend ( having a best - fit slope of 0.34 ) \n . we also attempt to find trends in the experimental data not represented by the model by comparing @xmath87 vs. various combinations of control parameters ( @xmath88 ) including @xmath11 , @xmath40 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . \n for all plots of @xmath93 vs. @xmath94 , our model predicts a zero slope ( and y - intercept of 1 ) . a non - random dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath94 would point to failure of some part of our model . \n thus , to test the validity of our model , we perform significance tests on all non - flagged data with the null hypothesis being a non - zero slope . in all cases , \n the null hypothesis is accepted ( not rejected ) at the 95% confidence level . \n thus , although the agreement is far from perfect , the simple model captures all of the significant trends in the experimental data . \n by generalizing and quantifying the heuristic ideas of knight  @xcite , we have constructed a theory that is able to explain the radiating finger - like patterns on lake ice that we call lake stars . \n the model yields a prediction for the wavelength of the most unstable mode as a function of various physical parameters that agrees with field observations . \n proof of concept experiments revealed the robustness of the fingering pattern , and to leading order the results also agree with the model . \n there is substantial scatter in the data , and the overall comparison between field observations , model and experiment demonstrates the need for a comprehensive measurement program and a fully nonlinear theory which will yield better quantitative comparisons . \n however , the general predictions of our theory capture the leading order features of the system . \n we thank k. bradley and j. a. whitehead for laboratory and facilities support . \n this research , which began at the geophysical fluid dynamics summer program at the woods hole oceanographic institution , was partially funded by national science foundation ( nsf ) grant oce0325296 , nsf graduate fellowship ( vct ) , nsf grant opp0440841 ( jsw ) , and department of energy grant de -

out wavelengths to make precise estimates of oscillator strength ratios @xcite . \n a relative precision of about 0.2@xmath10 has been achieved in the @xmath11 transition matrix elements of rubidium @xcite and a relative precision of 0.19@xmath10 has been achieved for the @xmath12 line strength ratio for potassium @xcite . \n there are relatively few atomic oscillator strengths measured at this level of precision @xcite . \n the present investigation entails the determination of the polarizability of the k(@xmath13 ) ground state for different hyperfine levels . \n the calculations are similar to those used in the determination of the hyperfine stark shift and there have been a number of experiments and calculations on hyperfine stark shifts for the alkali atoms @xcite . \n the most important of these investigations are those related to the determination of the blackbody radiation shift of the @xmath14cs clock transition @xcite . \n the approach used to determine the influence of the hyperfine shift upon the dynamic polarizability is somewhat unorthodox . \n most calculations of the hyperfine stark shift are performed using third order perturbation theory @xcite . \n the hyperfine interaction operator alters the polarizability in two distinctly different ways . \n first of all , the hyperfine energy shifts directly enter the denominator in the oscillator strength sum rule used to calculate the dipole polarizability . \n second , the hyperfine interactions leads to the mixing of the ground @xmath1 state with excited bound @xmath15 and continuum @xmath16 states . \n this results in a change of the @xmath17 line strengths . \n these two effects have roughly same influence on the polarizability . \n the approach used to calculate the hyperfine polarizabilities utilizes existing information about the hyperfine interaction constants to determine the hyperfine energy shifts of the low lying states of potassium . \n we do not use a perturbation theory calculation to determine the impact of the hyperfine interaction on the line strength . \n instead , the dipole matrix element from the resonant transition is treated as a parametric function of the binding energy , and matrix elements adjusted for the hyperfine energy shifts are used in the calculation of the polarizability . \n the method was validated by a comparison with the previous calculated and experimental hyperfine stark shifts for @xmath2k @xcite . \n shifts in the primary tune - out wavelengths for the ground states of @xmath0k were found to be very closely related to the hyperfine energy shifts of the ground states . \n the first part of our calculation required the determination of the hyperfine energy shifts of the ground and low - lying excited states . \n rather than calculate this information directly , the information is sourced from experiment or other calculations . \n the potassium dipole polarizability is dominated by the resonant transition , so hyperfine splitting is only taken into consideration for the ground state and some of the low - lying excited states .    according to first - order perturbation theory , \n the energy for a hyperfine state @xmath18 is given @xcite by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the energy for the unperturbed fine structure state and @xmath21 is the hyperfine interaction energy . \n the hyperfine interaction energy can be written as @xmath22 where , @xmath23 @xmath24 is total angular momentum , @xmath25 is the nuclear spin , @xmath26 is the total electronic angular momentum of the associated fine structure state , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are hyperfine structure constants . \n it is usual to give the @xmath27 and @xmath28 coefficients in mhz where @xmath29 a.u . \n the energies of the different hyperfine states of @xmath2k , @xmath3k and @xmath4k are listed in table [ tab1 ] . \n the @xmath2k and @xmath4k isotopes are stable , while @xmath3k has a very long lifetime . \n the @xmath2k isotope is the most common at 93.3@xmath10 abundance . \n these tabulations are only include the @xmath1 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 states . \n the hyperfine energy shifts are largest for @xmath3k . \n the energy shifts for the @xmath1 ground states are about an order of magnitude larger than those of the @xmath8 excited states . \n similarly , the hyperfine splitting for the @xmath32 states are significantly larger than the splitting of the @xmath33 states . \n lcccccc & @xmath34 ( a.u . ) & @xmath27 ( mhz ) & @xmath28 ( mhz ) & @xmath24 & @xmath21 ( a.u . ) & @xmath35 ( a.u . ) +   + @xmath1 & @xmath360.15951645 & 230.859860 @xcite & -

{"ContextTokens": 2276, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "wavelength calibration is almost always needed in the process of producing useful astronomical spectra . \n to calibrate accurately is a non - trivial problem , in particular when working at high or very - high spectral resolution . \n fourier transform spectrographs ( fts ) are specially well - suited to this task , but they are not readily applied in conditions requiring high spatial or time resolution , so grating spectrometers are much more commonly used for astronomical observations . in this case , it becomes necessary to set reference positions corresponding to known wavelengths on the detector . \n this can be achieved by using very sharp observed telluric lines , but their location in the spectrum can not be chosen by the astronomer . \n it is very usual to find spectral calibration lamps available for use with an astronomical spectrograph . \n the emission lines produced in the lamps have been previously measured at the laboratory , and this method usually provides a valid reference frame . \n however , it is often impractical to expose the calibration lamp simultaneously with the astronomical target and , unless the spectrograph is installed at a very stable focal station , the position of the spectrum on the detector varies depending on the telescope position . \n accuracy is then limited by the instrument characteristics and observations of the calibration lamps are required between successive astronomical exposures . \n nonetheless , calibrations via arc or hollow cathode spectra are normally accurate enough for most purposes . \n ingenious techniques have been used to improve the accuracy of wavelength calibrations , such as placing gas cells at the entrance of the spectrograph ( e.g. , deming & plymate 1994 ) , but it is rare to find such systems available and convenient for regular observations .    on occasion \n the available lamps are not very rich in lines in the spectral range of observation . in some circumstances , \n an external check of the final precision in the translation into wavelengths would be desirable . \n one method for tackling problems such as these is to use solar spectra as templates . \n changes in the wavelengths of the lines in the integrated sunlight spectrum around the solar cycle have been proved to be very small , bellow some 15 m s@xmath1 ( jimnez et al . \n 1980 ; wallace et al . 1988 ; mcmillan et al . 1993 ; deming & plymate 1994 ) . at 5000 \n , this translates into @xmath2 0.3 m , so the solar spectrum does offer a very stable source . in most practical cases , \n the accuracy will be imposed by the spectral resolution achieved . during night - time observations , \n the solar flux spectrum is observable after reflection from the moon .    measurements of solar wavelengths in the integrated solar optical spectrum were published in 1929 by burns and collaborators ( burns 1929 ; burns & kiess 1929 ; burns & meggers 1929 ) , using photographic detectors and a grating spectrograph . \n the relatively recent solar flux fts atlases offer a much higher quality spectrum of the sun seen as a star . \n as the solar spectrum is so intense , on some solar telescopes no calibration lamps are deemed necessary , and the wavelength scale is set using the solar spectrum itself . \n reasonable precision can be reached using the spectrum at the centre of the disc to compare with previously measured disc centre wavelengths , thus avoiding differential shifts due to the limb effect . in this case , \n small scale motions have to be averaged out , integrating in time and/or space , in order to minimize errors . \n the _ kitt peak table of photographic solar spectrum wavelengths _ ( pierce & breckinridge 1973 ) has been extensively used by solar observers to set up the wavelength scale on their spectra . \n these observations , made on photographic plates , have been superseded in quality by the more recent fts observations at the centre of the disc . \n to improve on the various sets of photographically based measurements ( which date back to 1930 in the case of the solar flux spectrum ) , provide them in a homogeneous machine - readable format , use them to test spectral calibrations of very high resolution stellar spectra ( e.g. , allende prieto et al . 1995 ) , and improve the accuracy of our own solar observations , we have determined the position of the central wavelengths of 4947 atomic lines in the optical solar spectrum . \n the employed source solar atlases , prepared from fts data , and the fashion in which we performed the measurements is described in the succeeding sections . \n among other solar flux fts atlases , the _ solar flux atlas from 296 to 1300 nm _ \n ( kurucz et al . \n 1984 ) , which is available from the noao ftp site , provided us with a high - quality spectrum of the sun seen as a star . \n it was obtained at the mcmath telescope at kitt peak . \n the fts disc - centre spectrum included in the newer _ spectral atlas of solar absolute disk - averaged and disk - center intensity from 3290 to 12510  _ \n ( brault & neckel 1987 ; for details see neckel 1994 ) was also obtained at the mcmath telescope . \n the wavelengths of selected lines from the table of pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) , which was produced from observations with a grating spectrometer and a photographic detector at the same telescope , have been the base for placing its wavelength calibration on an absolute scale . \n we have measured line central wavelengths in this atlas , available to us as part of the idl kis library . a flux spectrum is also contained in this fts atlas , which shares the source data obtained by j. brault and collaborators with the atlas prepared by kurucz et al . \n ( 1984 ) . \n the atlases cited achieve signal - to - noise ratios of about 2500 and a resolving power @xmath3 400000 . \n a quantitative basis for confidence in these atlases has been established by comparison between central wavelengths of 1446 fei lines in the solar spectrum and at rest , performed by allende prieto & garca lpez ( 1998 ) . \n briefly , they found :    * the atlases have been corrected for all doppler shifts between the centre of mass of the sun and earth , and the maximum shift to the red exhibited by the lines studied is the gravitational shift : 636 m s@xmath1 , corresponding to a null convective blue shift . \n * there is no stronger than expected trend of the line shifts with wavelength . * \n a clean correlation exists between the equivalent width and the line shift , reaching a plateau near the gravitational redshift for lines stronger than 200 m . \n this work enlarges the measurements of allende prieto & garca lpez ( 1998 ) to many other species , with the aim of optimizing its use for wavelength calibration . the line list from thvenin ( 1989 , 1990 ) , including 6606 lines classified by moore et al . \n ( 1966 ) as singly blended or unblended , has been chosen as a guide to select the features to be measured . \n a fourth - order polynomial was fitted to the 50 m  wavelength interval around the line minimum to find the line centre as precisely as possible . in the electronic version of the atlases \n , this corresponds to 11 points for the solar flux spectrum and 25 points for the centre - of - the - disc spectrum . \n errors in the wavelength determination were estimated by translating the standard deviation of the fit into the corresponding units of the wavelength axis , neglecting the extremely low photometric noise . \n table 1 , available only in electronic form from the cds , lists the central wavelengths in the flux and disc - centre solar spectra , the errors of the measurements , and the element identification , excitation potential and solar oscillator strengths ( @xmath4 ; from thvenin 1989 , 1990 ) for 4947 lines between 3944 and 7960   included in thvenin s list . \n more than one line corresponding to the same feature is listed when the identification is not clear from the wavelengths published by thvenin .    a comparison between a limited sample of wavelengths ( 42 lines ) listed by pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) and those we have measured in the atlas of the disc - centre shows that the absolute scales agree ( difference : 79 @xmath5 6 @xmath6 10@xmath7  ) and that the relative differences are fully accounted for by a straightforward consideration of the expected errors in the photographic atlas ( @xmath2 2.5 m ) \n .    errors of the wavelengths measured in the flux spectrum can be as large as 100 m s@xmath1 , as quoted by kurucz et al . \n for the wavelengths in the spectrum of the disc centre , systematic errors are given from the comparison with the photographic atlas of pierce & breckinridge ( 1973 ) , which has been used as reference . \n they estimate the absolute accuracy from comparison with the interferometrically determined wavelengths of adam ( 1952 , 1958 ) and nichols & clube ( 1958 ) , arriving at 0.3 m . \n our systematic errors are then of the order of @xmath8 0.9 m , while fts intrinsic errors are about 10 m s@xmath1 ( neckel & labs 1990 ) , yielding a final precision of about 50 m s@xmath1 at @xmath9 5000  . \n these numbers allow us to claim that errors quoted in table 1 ( typically @xmath0 m s@xmath1 ) are conservative .    the present database updates others which were previously available based on photographic spectra , and the catalogue is presented in an homogeneous machine - readable format available via internet from the cds . \n the wavelengths measured conform a reference frame which can be used to calibrate or field test calibrations of astronomical spectra by comparing with the solar spectrum , and to set up an accurate wavelength scale for solar spectra , among other applications . \n we thank h. neckel for his help in dealing with his solar atlas . \n we wish to extend our gratitude to f. thvenin , who has kindly lent a digital copy of his line list , m. collados for fruitful discussions on the wavelength calibration of solar spectra , j. e. beckman for careful reading of the draft and h. h. r. kroll for performing the installation and maintenance of the kis computer libraries at the iac . \n nso / kitt peak fts data used here were produced by nsf / noao . \n allende prieto , c. , garca lpez , r. j. , lambert , d. l. , gustafsson , b. 1995 , in stellar surface structure , iau symp . \n 176 : poster proceedings , ed . \n k. g. strassmeier ( vienna : institut fr astronomie der universitt wien ) , 107", "StartTimeOffset": 1152168221244, "RequestID": "74b565e4728ab378e7dbb9cd50a2811a61932852", "TotalTokens": 2391}

induced relaxation . \n in fact , molecular observables , e.g. the magnetization , are deeply affected by the interaction of the spins with other degrees of freedom such as phonons @xcite . here \n we investigate the molecular spin - spin correlations through an approach based on a density matrix theory @xcite . \n the irreversible evolution of the density matrix @xmath26 can be determined through the secular approximation and focusing on time scales detectable by low - frequency techiques such as nmr . within this theoretical framework , a general expression for the quasi - elastic part of the fourier transform of cross correlation functions \n is given by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dimension of the hilbert spin space of the molecule , @xmath29 is the equilibrium population of the @xmath30th level and @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the @xmath30th eigenstate of the spin hamiltonian , while @xmath33 is the so called rate -

violating mode in the standard arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) evolution system @xcite when it is applied to a single non - rotating black - hole space - time@xcite . \n we also found that such a constraint - violating mode can be compensated for if we adjust the evolution equations with a particular modification using constraint terms like the one proposed by detweiler @xcite . \n our predictions are borne out in simple numerical experiments using the maxwell , ashtekar , and adm systems @xcite . \n there are also several numerical experiments to confirm our predictions are effective@xcite . \n however we have not yet obtained definite guidelines for specifying the above adjusting terms and their multipliers .    in this article \n , we show the essential steps in analyzing constraint amplification factors ( defined in  [ seccafdef ] ) . in  [ sec3 ] , we show that degeneracy of eigenvalues sometimes leads constraint evolution to diverge . \n this observation suggests the importance of checking the diagonalizability of characteristic matrices , and gives further insights for constructing an asymptotically constrained system . \n we begin by reviewing our proposal for an  adjusted system \" . \n suppose we have a dynamical system of variables @xmath0 , which has evolution equations , @xmath1 and the ( first class ) constraints , @xmath2 note that we do not require ( [ ueq ] ) to form a first - order hyperbolic form . \n we propose to investigate the evolution equation of @xmath3 ( constraint propagation ) , @xmath4 for evaluating violation features of constraints . \n the character of constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) , will vary when we modify the original evolution equations . \n suppose we modify ( adjust ) ( [ ueq ] ) using constraints @xmath5 then ( [ ceq ] ) will also be modified as @xmath6 therefore , finding a proper adjustment @xmath7 is a quite important problem . \n hyperbolicity analysis may be a way to evaluate constraint propagation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) @xcite \n . however , this requires ( [ ceq ] ) to be a first - order system which is easy to be broken . \n ( see e.g. detweiler - type adjustment @xcite in the adm formulation @xcite ) . \n furthermore hyperbolicity analysis only concerns the principal part of the equation , that may fail to analyze the detail evaluation of evolution . \n alternatively , we have proceeded an eigenvalue analysis of the whole rhs in ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) after a suitable homogenization , which may compensate for the above difficulties of hyperbolicity analysis . \n we propose to transform the constraint propagation equation , ( [ ceq ] ) and ( [ ceqadj ] ) , into fourier modes , @xmath8 then to analyze the eigenvalues , say @xmath9 , of the coefficient matrix , @xmath10 . \n we call @xmath9 and @xmath10 the constraint amplification factors ( cafs ) and constraint propagation matrix ( cp matrix ) , respectively . \n so far we have proposed the following heuristic conjectures @xcite :    * if the caf has a _ negative real - part _ ( the constraints are necessarily diminished ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a positive caf . * \n if the caf has a _ non - zero imaginary - part _ ( the constraints are propagating away ) , then we see more stable evolution than a system which has a zero caf . \n we observe that this eigenvalue analysis requires the fixing of a particular background space - time , since the cafs depend on the dynamical variables , @xmath11 . \n the cafs indicate the evolution of constraint violations ( definitely its fourier modes ) . \n it is natural to assume that a divergence of constraint norm is related to the numerical blow - ups . \n therefore we classify the fundamental evolution property of constraint propagation equation ( [ ceqf ] ) as follows :    * _ asymptotically constrained : _ violation of constraints decays ( converges to zero ) . * _ asymptotically bounded : _ violation of constraints is bounded at a certain value . * _ diverge : _ at least one constraint will diverge .    note that ( c1 ) @xmath12 ( c2 ) . \n we will derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) in the next section . \n hereafter , we consider a set of evolution equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a complex - valued vector , @xmath15 is a @xmath16 complex - valued matrix , and @xmath17 is assumed to have finite - valued initial data @xmath18 .    without loss of generality , the cp matrix @xmath19 can be assumed to be a jordan normal form , since within complex - valued operations all the matrices can be converted to this form . \n suppose that @xmath19 has @xmath20 different eigenvalues @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . \n let the multiplicity of @xmath23 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . \n @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath26 where the cell size of @xmath27 is @xmath28 . \n the jordan matrix @xmath27 is then expressed using a jordan block @xmath29 , @xmath30 note that @xmath29 is @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . \n the minimum polynomial of @xmath19 is written as @xmath35 if @xmath27 is diagonal ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , then @xmath37 for that @xmath38 . if @xmath19 is diagonalizable ( i.e. @xmath36 for @xmath39 ) , then @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . \n we then have the following statement . \n the solution of @xmath40 can be expressed formally as @xmath41 [ propa ]    a proof is available by mathematical induction . \n suppose that @xmath42 is @xmath43 which is the maximal size @xmath27 . by direct calculation \n , we have that @xmath44 yields ( [ kino ] ) with @xmath45-polynomial of degree @xmath46 . then we see that ( [ kino ] ) is satisfied in general .    from this proposition , the highest power @xmath47 in @xmath48polynomial in ( [ kino ] ) \n is bounded by @xmath49 . \n the matrix @xmath27 in ( [ cp2 ] ) can be directly extended to the full cp matrix , @xmath19 , in ( [ cp ] ) . \n therefore the highest power @xmath50 in all constraints is bounded by @xmath51      the following propositions [ prop1 ] and [ prop2 ] give us the next theorem . \n asymptotically constrained evolution ( violation of constraints converges to zero ) is obtained if and only if all the real parts of the cafs are negative . \n [ theoremc1 ]    all the real part of cafs are negative @xmath52 asymptotically constrained evolution . \n [ prop1 ]    proof ) we use the expression ( [ kino ] ) . \n if @xmath53 for @xmath39 , then @xmath54 will converge to zero at @xmath55 no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are . \n @xmath56    asymptotically constrained evolution @xmath52 all the real parts of the cafs are negative . \n [ prop2 ]    proof ) we show the contrapositive . \n suppose there exists an eigenvalue @xmath57 of which the real - part is non - negative . \n then we get @xmath58 of which the solution is @xmath59 . \n @xmath60 does not converge to zero . \n @xmath56      the following propositions [ prop3 ] and [ prop4 ] give us the next theorem .     asymptotically bounded evolution ( all the constraints are bounded at a certain value ) is obtained if and only if all the real parts of cafs are not positive and @xmath27 is diagonal when @xmath61 . \n [ theoremc2 ]    * corollary * _ asymptotically bounded evolution is obtained if the real parts of cafs are not positive and the cp matrix @xmath62 is diagonalizable . \n _    all the real parts of cafs are not positive and @xmath27 is diagonal when @xmath61 @xmath52 asymptotically bounded evolution . \n [ prop3 ]    proof ) we use the expression ( [ kino ] ) . \n when @xmath63 , @xmath64 will converge to zero no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are . \n when @xmath61 , we see @xmath37 from the assumption of diagonality of @xmath27 . \n so we see the @xmath48polynomial terms are constant and @xmath65 is bounded . @xmath56    asymptotically bounded evolution @xmath52 all the real parts of the cafs are not positive and @xmath27 is diagonal when @xmath66 . \n [ prop4 ]    proof ) we show the contrapositive . \n if there exists an eigenvalue of which the real - part is positive , then constraints will diverge no matter what the @xmath48polynomial terms are \n . therefore we try to show that constraints will diverge when all the real - parts of eigenvalues are non - positive , and there exists @xmath23 such that @xmath66 and its jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal . \n since jordan matrix @xmath27 is not diagonal , we see the power of @xmath48polynomial @xmath67 is greater than 1 in the expression ( [ kino ] ) . \n thus we have that ( [ kino ] ) will diverge in @xmath68 . @xmath56 \n two theorems will give us a guideline to analyze a constraint - violating mode of the system . \n the result supports our previous heuristic conjecture ( a ) , but also suggests an ill - behaving case when cafs are degenerated and its real - part is zero , when the associated jordan matrix is not diagonal . \n this indicates the importance of checking the diagonalizability of constraint propagation matrix @xmath19 .    along the line of our evaluation of constraint propagation equations ( [ cp ] ) \n , we propose a practical procedure for this classification in figure [ fig : flowchart ] . \n we think that this diagram will provide systematic predictions for obtaining a robust evolution system in any constrained dynamics . \n ( 85,75 ) ( -5,00 )    the present classification is only on the fixed background spacetime and only for @xmath69 . \n it is still not clear at what value the constraints are bounded if a limiting value exists . \n thus further modifications are underway . \n we are also applying the present classification scheme to various adjusted systems of the einstein equations ( adjusted adm , and further modified versions ) , together with numerical experiments . \n we hope to report on them in the near future . \n the current constraint analysis only concentrates to the evolution equations and does not include the effect of the boundary treatments . since the eigenvalues are evaluated locally , it will be possible to include the effect of numerical boundary conditions if they are expressed apparently in a part of the evolution equations . \n this is also the one direction to proceed our future research . \n meanwhile , we would like to remark that one of our proposed adjustments in @xcite contributes to enforce the computational ability of the black - hole excision boundary treatment @xcite .    by extending the notion of  norm \" or  compactness \" of constraint violations \n , it might be interesting to define a new measure which monitors a  distance \" between the constraint surface and an evolution sector in constraint dynamics . \n hs thanks the caltech visitors program for the numerical simulation of gravitational wave sources for their hospitality , where a portion of this work was completed . \n hs is supported by the special postdoctoral researchers program at riken . \n this work was supported partially by the grant -

{"ContextTokens": 3996, "GeneratedTokens": 179, "SynthesizedBody": "planets seem to be a common phenomenon with an estimated occurrence rate of at least one planet per star in the milky way  @xcite . \n even binary stars are found to have planets orbiting and we currently know about almost one hundred exoplanets orbiting binaries , out of which about ten are circumbinary . \n a common feature of all these planets around binary stars is that their orbits are well aligned with the orbit of the binary . \n the largest known deviation from co - planarity is 2.5@xmath5  @xcite . \n this alignment suggests that the stars condensed out of a single disk by fragmentation followed by planet formation in the same circumbinary disk through core accretion , a formation scenario which is supported by recent observations @xcite . however , there is a strong selection effect because well aligned systems are much easier to detect via transits . \n theoretically , @xcite and @xcite showed that for close binaries with separation less than 100 au , circumstellar disks will form within the central cavity of the circumbinary disk . \n such multiple protostellar systems have recently been found , e.g. , gg tau @xcite and l1551 irs  5 @xcite , both of which have circumstellar disks as well as a circumbinary disk which are well aligned . \n @xcite reported misaligned circumstellar disks in the binary star hk tau , but no circumbinary disk is present in that system . in this paper \n we report observations of a binary protostar , irs  43 , which also has three separate disks , two circumstellar and one circumbinary , but these are all substantially misaligned ( @xmath6 ) . \n irs  43 ( iras 16244 - 2434 ) is a binary protostellar system in the rho ophiuchus star forming region  ( d=120 pc ; * ? ? ? \n it is described in the literature as a class i object due to the shape of the sed  @xcite and hence is assumed to be of order 100,000 years old . \n irs  43 was discovered to be a binary by @xcite based on 3.6 cm continuum observations from the vla taken in 1989 . \n following these authors we will henceforth refer to the two stellar components as vla 1 and vla 2 , with vla 1 being the northernmost source and also the stronger of the two at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths . \n the binary was later confirmed by observations in the mid  infrared where , curiously enough , vla 2 is seen to be the stronger source @xcite . \n irs  43 was observed by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) on 2015 august 28 , spending approximately 1 hour on the source . \n 36 antennas were in use on that night providing baselines from 15 meters to 1465 meters . \n two phase calibrators , j16252527 and j16272426 , were observed approximately every 7 minutes . \n the precipitable water vapor level was around 2 mm at the time of observing . \n we used band 6 in our observations and receivers were tuned to 267 ghz ( 1.1 mm ) . \n of the four spectral windows , one was set up to measure the continuum at 252 ghz using the full 2 ghz bandwidth . \n the remaining three spectral windows were used to measure the lines hco@xmath1 j=3-2 at 267.6 ghz , hcn j=3-2 at 265.9 ghz , and hc@xmath7o@xmath1 j=3-2 at 255.5 ghz . the latter was not detected . \n hco@xmath1 was measured at a spectral resolution of 61 khz corresponding to 68 ms@xmath8 while hcn was observed at a slightly lower spectral resolution , 122 khz corresponding to 138 ms@xmath8 . \n careful recalibration of the data did not improve the quality significantly compared to the delivered version calibrated by alma staff , so we settled on using the original version as provided by alma . \n we did experiment with self - calibration of the continuum , but the improvement in signal  to  noise was negligible and did not reveal additional structure , so in the end we decided not to self - calibrate .    in this paper \n we also make use of archival data from the very large array ( vla ) as well as data published by @xcite and @xcite . two additional datasets on irs  43 were found in the nrao vla archive , project numbers ac0788 and af0443 , taken in 2005 and 2007 respectively . these two datasets were phase calibrated using casa and astrometric positions of the protostellar components measured and added to the list of vla astrometry . \n in addition we utilize continuum data from alma observations of irs  43 0.4@xmath90.3@xmath10 angular resolution from a larger survey of class i protostars in ophiuchus ( 2013.1.00955.s , pi : jes jrgensen ; e.  artur et al . \n , in prep . ) \n the continuum emission as observed by alma shows two distinct peaks , both of which are marginally resolved . \n the continuum is very compact with no trace of extended emission on scales larger than 0.3@xmath10 . \n the continuum is shown in green color in fig . \n [ rgb ] , restored with a 0.23@xmath110.15@xmath10 beam . \n a third and very strong continuum source can also be seen in fig . \n [ rgb ] some 800 au to the north - east of vla 1 and vla 2 . \n this source is known as gy263 and may or may not be gravitationally bound to irs  43 . \n the continuum emission originates from cold dust surrounding the the two protostars . \n if we assume a constant dust temperature of 15 k and a dust opacity @xmath12 at 1.1 mm of 2.7 @xmath13g@xmath8 , we can estimate the dust mass around the stars using , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance to the source and @xmath16 is the planck function for temperature @xmath17 . \n the continuum flux of vla 1 and vla 2 is 18.5 mjy and 1.9 mjy respectively , which gives total gas and millimeter dust masses of 770 m@xmath18 and 20 m@xmath18 after multiplying @xmath19 with the canonical gas - to - dust ratio of 100 . \n the fact that the continuum is only marginally resolved allows us to place upper limits to the size of the dust distributions . \n given a beam size of 0.3@xmath10 , the dust extends no more than 20 au from the stars . \n the dust around vla 1 may extend slightly further than that around vla 2 , but not more that 10%20% . \n the hco@xmath1 j=32 and hcn j=32 emission is shown in fig . \n [ rgb ] along with the continuum emission . \n both lines are strong and clear . in these two figures , \n the integrated red and the blue shifted emission is colored in red and blue . \n hco@xmath1 is seen to be a lot more extended than hcn , particularly in the direction along the declination , but both tracers show a clear circumbinary red / blue asymmetry . \n hco@xmath1 shows a x - shaped and slightly curved structure in both red and blue , which is not seen in hcn at all . \n this structure emits at large velocity offset only ( @xmath207  kms@xmath8 ) and is likely associated with an outflow or disk wind . \n the three disks are easily visible in hcn . in fig . \n [ rgb ] their axes are marked by white dashed lines . \n we can confirm that these structures are in fact keplerian disks , by looking at the velocity field as a function of position offsets . \n figure  [ pv_hcn ] shows the pv - diagrams along the axes shown in fig . \n [ rgb ] for the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk around vla 1 . \n the signal is not strong enough to prove that the velocity gradient across vla 2 is keplerian , but @xcite found a disk in co associated with vla 2 . \n we therefore assume that the velocity gradient seen in hcn across vla 2 is due to this disk and we adopt a position angle which lies along this gradient . in both pv - diagrams , \n a linear segment of emission at low velocities connects the red and the blue side across the center . \n this is expected for a keplerian disk of finite radius . \n the origin of this emission is well explained by  @xcite . \n the blue - shifted side of the circumbinary disk in hcn has an apparent warp .          in 2003 \n , @xcite published a study in which they had followed the proper motion of irs 43 using the vla over a 12 year period , from 1990 to 2002 . \n they produced a lower limit to the total mass ( 1.7 m@xmath21 ) and an upper limit on the period ( 360 yr ) as well as an estimate of the binary separation and absolute proper motion of the system . \n with our recent alma data and additional archival vla data , we can add 13 years to the fraction of measured orbital period , which allow us to produce a more accurate determination of the orbital parameters including reliable error bars . \n the positions and the derived quantities separation and position angle are shown in fig . \n [ astrometry1 ] . \n least square fits to the data are shown as well together with the reduced @xmath22 values of each fit . \n these values show that the fits are very robust . in the case of the binary separation , \n we have fitted both a linear function , allowing for a change of separation in time , as well as a constant , which would assume a circular orbit in the plane of the sky , i.e. , constant separation . \n based on the reduced @xmath22-values of the two fits , we can not determine whether the separation of the protostars is constant in time or not , but within the error bars the data is certainly consistent with a circular orbit lying in , or very close to , the plane of the sky . \n if we allow for a non - zero inclination , we find that the data is inconsistent with an inclination above 30 degrees from the plane of the sky . \n the least square fit parameters are given in table  [ leastsquarefit ] where we give the slope of the best fitting line to the position angle data as the angular velocity . \n cccc @xmath23 ( mas yr@xmath8 ) & -3.9 ( 0.9 ) & -12.5 ( 1.0 ) & -7.6 ( 0.5 ) + @xmath24 ( mas yr@xmath8 ) & -23.6 ( 0.9 ) & -25.4 ( 0.9 ) & -25.3 ( 0.4 ) + separation ( mas ) & & 615 ( 37 ) + separation ( au ) & & 74 ( 4 ) au@xmath25 + period ( years ) & & 444.2 ( 33.4 ) + stellar mass ratio & & 0.500 ( 0.018 ) + total mass ( m@xmath21 ) & & 2.01 ( 0.47 )        in order to determine the orbit of the binary , we fit , for each of the two stars a function of the form @xmath26 \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the position of the center of mass at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the velocity of the center of mass in the plane of the sky , @xmath15 is the projected separation of the stars , @xmath30 is the mass ratio of the stars , @xmath31 is the orbital frequency , and @xmath32 is the phase ( i.e. , position angle ) at @xmath28 . \n a total of 6 free parameters as the position of the center of mass is fixed by the positions of the stars together with the parameter @xmath30 . \n the fitting is done by a genetic algorithm ` pikaia ` @xcite . \n we ran 20,000 optimization runs with different random number generator seeds and each run would return a slightly different optimal solution . \n we then fitted gaussians to the distributions of output parameter values and taking the mean of these gaussian fits as the most probable parameter value . \n these values are shown in table  [ leastsquarefit ] along with the values of the least squares fit . \n the best fit provided by ` pikaia ` is perfectly consistent with the values found by least square fitting , but we also get a value for the additional mass ratio parameter , which we can not obtain directly from the data . \n surprisingly , the most probable value is 1/2 which means that the two stars carry the exact same mass . \n the total stellar mass that we obtain here , purely from the determination of the apparent orbital period , is very consistent with the mass of 1.9 m@xmath21 obtained by @xcite based entirely on radiative transfer modeling of the velocity field in the circumbinary gas . \n the trajectories of the two protostellar components and their measured positions on the sky are shown in fig . \n [ trajec ] . \n the dashed line shows the trajectory of the center of mass . \n the most curious misalignment in the irs  43 system is that of the circumbinary disk and the orbit of the binary itself . \n the orbital plane of the binary is strongly constrained by the constant separation of vla 1 and vla 2 in time to be close to the plane of the sky ( @xmath4 ) , whereas the circumbinary disk is seen nearly edge - on . \n not only does the aspect ratio of the circumbinary emission distribution prevent a line of sight inclination less than @xmath33 60@xmath5 , but the pv - diagram ( fig .  [ pv_hcn ] , left ) is also very well described by a keplerian profile using a mass of 1.8 m@xmath21 and an inclination of 70@xmath5 . \n this inclination is consistent with the inclination found by @xcite . \n if we use the slightly higher total mass of 2.01 m@xmath21 found by the ` pikaia ` fit , we need an inclination of 60@xmath5 to fit the pv - diagram . \n the red side of the hcn line has a strong non - keplerian peak at a radius of 300 au . \n this peak masks the keplerian signature on the red side at this radius , but the emission actually follows the kepler profile , although at a very low signal to noise , out to about 600 au or slightly more . \n it is not clear what causes the bright spot on the red side at 300 au . \n similarly , we can fit the pv - diagram of the circumstellar disk around vla 1 using a mass of 0.9 m@xmath21 and an inclination of 33@xmath5 ( 30@xmath5 , if we use 1.005 m@xmath21 ) . \n we can not determine the line of sight inclination of the circumstellar around vla 2 due to low singal to noise , but this disk has a velocity gradient which is offset by almost 90@xmath5 with respect to the other two disks . \n the orientation of the disk around vla 2 is further supported by the linear structure in hco@xmath1 , most likely an outflow , emerging from vla 2 toward north - west and almost perpendicular to the velocity gradient . \n the warp in the disk , most apparent in the blue - shifted hcn emission , is expected from simulations @xcite and it is also to be expected that a cavity in the circumbinary disk be carved by the binary @xcite . \n whether such a cavity can be seen in our data is not clear , but there is a hint of a drop in hcn intensity in the central parts of the circumbinary disk . \n higher resolution observations by alma could reveal this . \n the significant misalignment of this system suggests a formation scenario either driven by turbulent fragmentation  @xcite or that the system has recently been perturbed , e.g. , by ejection of a third stellar component . \n another possibility is that the misalignment between the central binary and the circumbinary disk may simply be a signature of formation of the binary in a cloud , with infall of material with misaligned angular momentum , occurring late in the formation of the circumbinary disk . \n this would imply that the material from which the system formed was not in solid body rotation as is often considered the initial condition for star formation , but rather that the formation was triggered in a cloud with significant turbulence or substructure . \n the question is whether irs  43 will eventually align and form a planetary system which is similar to all the well aligned systems found by kepler . \n @xcite showed that , in particular for light disks , a misalignment of the rotation axis of a protostar and its disk may survive for the entire life time of the disk . in the case of irs  43 , \n alignment of disks with binaries , tend to happen on the viscous time scale @xcite . \n for the two circumstellar disks , at the radius of 25 au , we estimate the viscous time scale to be between @xmath34 and @xmath35 years for values of the @xmath36-viscosity parameter @xcite between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . this system could take a very long time to align ( @xmath39 years ) , possible beyond the disk life times and certainly longer the the present age of irs  43 ( @xmath40 years , * ? ? ? * ) . \n this paper makes use of the following alma data : ads / jao.alma#2013.1.00233.s and ads / jao.alma#2013.1.00955.s . \n alma is a partnership of eso ( representing its member states ) , nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with nrc ( canada ) , nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) , and kasi ( republic of korea ) , in cooperation with the republic of chile . \n the joint alma observatory is operated by eso , aui / nrao and naoj .", "StartTimeOffset": 1174724403900, "RequestID": "0d94610bab9dedc64e8d52404d235376844f2bcf", "TotalTokens": 4175}
{"ContextTokens": 1016, "GeneratedTokens": 150, "SynthesizedBody": "in a pioneering investigation of the clusters in the large magellanic cloud , freeman , illingworfth & oemler ( 1983 ) surmised that `` [ t]here is no old , kinematical halo population among the clusters of the lmc . '' at that time radial velocities were only available for nine old clusters in the large cloud . \n presently 13 globular clusters are known to be associated with the large magellanic cloud ( schommer 1991 , schommer et al . \n 1992 , suntzeff 1992 , van den bergh 2000 , p. 104 ) . from their discussion of the kinematics of old clusters in the lmc schommer et al . \n ( 1992 ) concluded that : `` the oldest clusters still present an enigma ; they do not have the kinematics of an isothermal , or slowly rotating , pressure - supported halo . \n these objects rotate with an amplitude comparable to that of the younger disk '' . taken at face value \n this conclusion would appear to indicate that the oldest clusters in the large cloud formed quite differently from those in m33 ( schommer et al . \n 1991 , chandar et al . \n 2002 ) , in which the oldest ( globular ) clusters are observed to have halo kinematics , whereas younger ( open ) clusters exhibit disk - like motions . \n the view that late - type galaxies such as m33 ( m v = -18.9 ) and the lmc ( m v = -18.5 ) , which have similar uminosities , had very different evolutionary histories would not fit comfortably with most current views of galaxy evolution . \n this prompts one to ask how secure is the conclusion that the oldest massive clusters in the large cloud formed in a disk , rather than in the lmc halo ? \n in their table 2 schommer et al . \n ( 1992 ) provide radial velocities ( corrected for an eastward transverse velocity of 150 km s@xmath0 for the 13 oldest lmc clusters which belong to swb class vii ( searle , wilkinson & bagnuolo 1980 ) . \n these data are plotted in figure 1 , which shows that the rms velocity dispersion around the lmc hi rotation curve ( thin line ) is 28 km s @xmath0 , compared to a dispersion of 30 km s@xmath0 around the mean velocity ( dashed line ) of the swb vii clusters . \n this result shows that the h i rotation curve does not provide a significantly better fit to the the kinematics of the oldest lmc clusters than does a model in which these clusters are not assumed to be supported by rotation . in this respect \n the old clusters of class wwb vii differ significantly from the intermediate - age clusters of swb classes iv , v and vi which ( see figure 5 of schommer et al . \n 1992 ) clearly exhibit a significant rotational velocity component . \n it is interesting to note that the 30 @xmath16 km s@xmath0 velocity dispersion of the 13 swb vii clusters appears to be smaller , albeit only at the 2 @xmath2 level , than the 53 @xmath110 km s@xmath0 velocity dispersion that minniti et al . \n ( 2003 ) have recently found for 42 rr lyrae variables in the large cloud . \n however , it is noted that the velocity dispersion of the lmc rr lyrae variables is comparable to the 54 @xmath18 km s@xmath0 velocity dispersion that chandar et al . obtain for the old m33 globular clusters with @xmath3 kpc , but smaller than the 82 @xmath113 km s@xmath0 dispersion that these authors find for the old m33 halo clusters with @xmath4 kpc . \n by lumping old and intermediate - age lmc clusters together schommer et al . \n ( 1992 ) found that these clusters exhibited significant rotation . \n however , the data plotted in figure 1 show that the oldest ( swb class vii ) clusters do not exhibit a significant rotational component . in this respect \n the large cloud cluster system resembles m33 in which chandar et al . \n find that 85 @xmath1 5 percent of the oldest clusters have halo kinematics . \n it is therefore concluded that worries about the apparent difference between the kinematics of the oldest population components in m33 and in the lmc ( van den bergh 2000 , p. 83 ) were probably premature . \n i thank ken freeman for pointing out to me that the number of old lmc globular clusters might not be large enough to prove the conclusion that these clusters have disk kinematics . \n thanks are also due to peter stetson for statistical advice .", "StartTimeOffset": 1179631905450, "RequestID": "aa25475e2cd7e854ef8c6fd68c911dfc79fc6817", "TotalTokens": 1166}

detection are sought . \n these detectors should have a quantum efficiency that is similar to the quantum efficiency of ccds in the optical and a dark count rate below that of ccds . \n additionally , it is desirable that these detectors can time - resolve single photons ( spd ) . a review of spds is given in ref . \n @xcite .    in sections  [ seggern : \n sec : ccd ] to [ seggern : sec : pmt ] ( electron - multiplying ) ccds , qi spds from ref . \n @xcite and pmts are discussed , respectively , and the figures of merit are calculated . \n the results are compared in section  [ seggern : sec : concl ] . to calculate the count rate sensitivity , @xmath12 , a confidence level of @xmath16 is assumed . \n ccds are currently the prime choice for scientific visual imaging with a wide range of devices to choose from . \n the imaging area of ccds is segmented into columns each consisting of a series of mis capacitors . during data taking \n , these capacitors are biased into deep - depletion . \n incident photons are absorbed in the semiconductor material and produce free charges which are stored by the capacitors . \n these charges are integrated during an exposure . at the end of an exposure , \n the collected charges are transported to a read - out structure and digitized . \n hence , a ccd can not resolve single photons . \n in addition to the charges generated by incident photons , thermally generated free charges are produced and stored as well . \n these constitute the dark counts , which contributes to the overall noise . \n the process of read - out and digitization adds a second source of noise . \n hence , the total noise is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the read - out noise , @xmath19 the exposure time and @xmath20 the production rate of dark counts . \n o0.37     the lsw experiment alps at desy used a commercially available , low noise ccd camera with @xmath21 sized pixels ( pixis ccd )  @xcite . \n a dark count rate below @xmath22 was achieved by liquid cooling of the ccd chip and the camera was equipped with low - noise read - out electronics ( @xmath23 )  @xcite . \n thus , the read - out noise is the larger contribution to the total noise for exposures shorter than @xmath24 . \n if the signal can be focussed to a single pixel , a data set of 20 one hour exposures yields a figure of merit @xmath25 for a quantum efficiency of @xmath26 which is typical in the visible spectrum . \n electron multiplying ccds ( emccds ) amplify the charge signal before read - out in an avalanche multiplication register  @xcite . \n this allows to neglect the read - out noise and , hence , short exposure times are possible . \n but at the same time , the quantum efficiency is effectively reduced by a factor of two due to the additional noise from the multiplication process  @xcite . \n the original quantum efficiency , i.e.  without charge multiplication in an avalanche register , can be recovered by interpreting the read - out values in a binary fashion , i.e.  photon detected yes / no  @xcite , where a photon is counted if the digitized signal is above a threshold , @xmath27 . \n hence , the analysis can be reduced to that of a counting experiment . \n if contamination by noise and loss of signal due to the threshold can be neglected , this yields @xmath28 assuming the same values as above ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of data ) .    for nir wavelengths , \n the pixis ccd was found to have a reduced quantum efficiency of @xmath32  @xcite . \n the figure of merit is reduced accordingly for the pixis ccd ( @xmath33 ) and emccd ( @xmath34 ) . \n ingaas based ccds exist , which have a much smaller band gap than silicon and , therefore , a much higher quantum efficiency ( @xmath35 ) than the silicon - based pixis ccd . \n but these devices also have a dark count rate , which is six orders of magnitude above that of the pixis ccd  @xcite . \n therefore , these specialized ccds are of no help when improving the detector part of lsw experiments . \n to maintain a low dark count rate and achieve a high quantum efficiency at nir wavelengths at the same time , sensors operated at cryogenic temperatures can be used . \n most of the devices listed in ref . \n @xcite ( cryogenic or not ) have however dark count rates much above that of the pixis ccd \n . only transition edge sensors ( tes ) were found to have low dark count rates below that of the pixis ccd  @xcite . \n tes are bolometric sensors which are operated at @xmath36 . combined with a proper coating \n , high quantum efficiencies of @xmath16 can be reached  @xcite . \n the dark count rate and quantum efficiency expected for alps - ii ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) are assumed here as benchmark parameters  @xcite . \n the corresponding figure of merit for 20 hours of data is @xmath39 . \n the sensitive area of tes detectors and the pixels of a ccd are both of order @xmath40 . \n if the signal can not be focussed on such a small area , the pixels of a ccd can be binned . \n but , as discussed above , the integrated dark count rate increases at the same rate as the area of interest . accordingly , the figure of merit and the sensitivity on the coupling may worsen significantly . in this case , \n pmts are a very good alternative although they have a limited quantum efficiency ( @xmath41 ) and a limited spectral range ( @xmath42 )  @xcite . \n the sensitive area of a    o0pt    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     pmt consists of a photo - sensitive material with a low work function . \n incident photons produce free electrons which are directed to an electron multiplier by a focussing electrode . \n the high gain of the electron multiplier allows single photon detection . cooling the sensitive area reduces the dark count rate . \n for example , the ships helioscope uses a pmt with an active area of @xmath43 , which has a peak quantum efficiency of @xmath44 and a dark count rate of @xmath45 when cooled to @xmath46  @xcite . \n this corresponds to @xmath47 . \n surprisingly , of all spds used in qi experiments , only tes detectors have a sufficiently low dark count rate to improve significantly over conventional ccds \n . the figures of merit of the detectors mentioned in the above sections are summarized in tab . \n [ seggern : tab : comparison ] . of the presented alternatives , \n a tes is the best option . especially in the nir , \n a tes is superior to a ccd because its quantum efficiency does not deteriorate for these wavelengths . in the visible regime , \n ccds remain a viable option when only few resources are available for detector development . from the values listed in tab . \n [ seggern : tab : comparison ] , it seems that pmts are the worst option . \n their figure of merit is two orders of magnitude below that of ccds ( visible ) , which is caused mainly by their high dark count rate . \n however , considering their large sensitive area , pmts are the detector of choice if the signal can not be focussed very well . \n these findings are schematically summarized in fig . \n [ seggern : fig : findings ] . \n the study of the pixis ccd was kindly supported by g.  wiedemann ( hamburger sternwarte ) . \n 99 j.  redondo and a.  ringwald , contemp . \n phys .   * 52 * , 211 ( 2011 ) [ arxiv:1011.3741 [ hep -

{"ContextTokens": 1918, "GeneratedTokens": 108, "SynthesizedBody": "gravitational effects of dark matter have been observed in galaxies , clusters of galaxies , the large scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background radiation . \n these observations indicate that dark matter accounts for about @xmath0 of the matter density in the universe and for @xmath1 of its total energy density . it must therefore be considered today to be one of the essential ingredients of our universe . \n viable dark matter particles should be neutral , stable and weakly interacting , and , to be consistent with the observed large scale structure of the universe , behave as _ cold _ dark matter . since none of the standard model particles satisfies these conditions , dark matter provides strong evidence for new physics , and \n indeed most extensions of the standard model include dark matter candidates . \n wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) dark matter represents a generic scenario , that can naturally account for the observed dark matter density via freeze - out in the early universe . here \n , the dark matter candidate is a weakly interacting particle with a mass around the tev scale - the same scale that is currently being probed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . \n the idea behind minimal models of dark matter is to extend the standard model in a minimal way , so that dark matter can be explained . \n typically , these models feature a small number of additional fields and a new discrete symmetry that stabilises the dark matter particle . \n they include models such as the inert doublet model @xcite , the radiative seesaw model @xcite , and the singlet fermion model @xcite . \n the coexistence of two dark matter particles is yet another possibility that is currently being explored @xcite , as are coannihilations of dark matter and other particles @xcite .      in this model , \n the standard model is extended with an additional scalar doublet , @xmath2 , which is assumed to be odd under a discrete @xmath3 symmetry . \n the dark matter candidate is the neutral component of this new doublet ( @xmath4 ) and is then a wimp featuring gauge and scalar interactions .    at the tree level ( see fig . \n [ fig:1 ] ) , the @xmath5-@xmath4 scattering relevant for direct detection    tree -

{"ContextTokens": 3585, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "graphene is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) allotrope of carbon on a honeycomb lattice with one electron per @xmath3 orbital ( half - filling ) . \n its bare electronic spectrum is described in terms of a linearly dispersing , massless , chiral dirac field ( @xmath4 ) . since its isolation \n a few years ago @xcite it was realized that graphene displays a number of unique properties that are at odds with the standard theory of metals . \n @xcite one of the most important unresolved questions in graphene is the role of electron - electron interactions . @xcite \n even though , due to the vanishing of the density of states at the fermi energy , the electron - electron interactions are expected to remain unscreened and strong , it is not clear what is their influence in the properties of graphene .    in the present work we study the influence of the electron - electron interactions on the static dielectric function of graphene at half filling . \n we perform calculations to one order beyond the conventional random phase approximation ( rpa ) vacuum polarization bubble , by including self - energy and vertex corrections into the polarization loop . \n our main finding is that vertex contributions become important in the coupling regime @xmath2 , which in turn means that other non - rpa contributions should also be included . \n we were mainly motivated by the question whether the interactions can significantly affect the screening properties . \n this issue is particularly relevant in graphene for two reasons : ( 1 . ) \n the effective coupling constant @xmath0 ( see the precise definition below ) in graphene is large @xmath2 , and thus interactions are expected to be generically important , and ( 2 . ) despite of the above , to the best of our knowledge , no clear signatures of interaction effects have been observed so far in graphene . \n for example measurements of the compressibility @xcite have not detected electron correlation effects . \n in addition , screening of external charged impurities introduced in graphene is also expected to be sensitive to interaction effects , at least on theoretical level , @xcite and could be relevant for interpretation of recent experiments on charged impurity scattering . @xcite it is thus generally important to investigate the problem of how the correlations affect the effective charge of the carriers in graphene , which is determined by the vacuum polarization . \n we will assume that graphene at half filling ( i.e. when the chemical potential crosses the dirac point ) remains a homogeneous gas of quasiparticles , which in itself is not necessarily an innocent assumption due to the possibility of puddles , ripples , etc . \n @xcite however we assume that the system is homogeneous as the importance of the above effects is still unsettled . \n our starting point is the low - energy hamiltonian of graphene which can be written as ( we use units such that @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fermi velocity , @xmath8 is the chemical potential away from half - filling , @xmath9 is the 2@xmath102 identity matrix , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are pauli matrices . \n the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) reflects the effective lorentz invariance that exists in the non - interacting problem at low energies and gives rise to bizarre electronic behavior analogous to the one found in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . \n @xcite    in eq.([ham1 ] ) , @xmath13 is the electron - electron interaction , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential in 2d . \n the relative strength of the coulomb interactions to the kinetic energy is determined by graphene s  fine structure constant \" @xmath16 . unlike qed \n , the dirac fermion velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , @xmath17 , and hence the coulomb field can be treated as instantaneous ( @xmath18 ) . as a result \n , the coulomb interaction breaks the lorentz invariance of the problem leading to fundamental differences between the graphene problem and qed . from now on we absorb the dielectric constant of the medium @xmath19 into the definition of the effective charge @xmath20 . \n for example in the typical case of graphene on a sio@xmath21 substrate with dielectric constant @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the charge of the electron . \n keeping in mind that @xmath25 , one then finds the coupling constant @xmath26 . \n @xcite nevertheless , even in this situation when the relation @xmath27 is not strictly satisfied , perturbation theory is expected to give a good indication for the behavior of physical quantities . \n the rest of the paper is organized as follows . section ii deals with corrections to the polarization loop arising from the dressing of the electron propagators . in the section \n iii the true interaction ( correlation ) insertion , the vertex correction , is examined . \n section iv contains our conclusions . \n we concentrate on the most interesting case of zero fermi energy ( @xmath28 ) , when the low - energy physics is controlled by the proximity to the dirac point . \n the free dirac green s function is @xmath29 the interaction effects lead to the dressed green s function @xmath30 , where the self - energy @xmath31 is a sum of two terms with different matrix structure : @xmath32 , @xmath33 . at hartree - fock \n ( hf ) level ( first order in @xmath0 ) a divergent contribution appears , due to the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction @xcite where @xmath34 is an ultraviolet cutoff ( @xmath35 is the lattice spacing ) . \n one finds @xmath36 which implies that the effective velocity changes @xmath37 , and grows without bound at low energies @xmath38 . \n this should in principle lead to anomalies in thermodynamic and spectral properties of graphene . \n @xcite from theoretical viewpoint , most importantly , the single logarithmic behavior was found to persist to second order of perturbation theory as well , @xcite and consequently this is expected to be the case to all orders , reflecting the fairly simple ( at least at weak - coupling ) renormalization structure of the theory . \n we now turn to the calculation of the static polarization , @xmath39 . \n the frequency variable in @xmath40 is omitted from now on . the bare polarization bubble ( without any interaction lines in the loop ) \n is known to be @xmath41 from now on the trace stands for summation over spin ( s ) , valley ( v ) and pseudospin ( pauli matrix @xmath42 ) indices , i.e. @xmath43 the momentum sums are performed as @xmath44 . \n next , we calculate the bubble dressing due to the electron - electron interactions to first order in @xmath0 . \n the two diagrams at this order are shown in fig . \n we write the total polarization as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the contributions of fig . \n [ fig1](a ) and fig . \n [ fig1](b ) , respectively .        the self - energy dressing of fig . \n [ fig1](a ) can be written as ( the factor of @xmath48 originates from the two possible insertions ) @xmath49 at lowest order , the self - energy is simply the hartree - fock one , meaning that in ( [ pol1 ] ) we replace @xmath50 the large logarithm present in @xmath51 at low momenta , eq . \n ( [ hf ] ) , is expected to appear also in some form in @xmath52 . \n let us define the following quantities which appear in our results from now on @xmath53 @xmath54 after performing the frequency , and then momentum integrations in ( [ pol1 ] ) , and using the self - energy from ( [ se ] ) , we obtain @xmath55^{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   = \\frac{\\alpha}{16 } \\ \n \\frac{|{\\bf q}|}{v } \\ \n \\ln(\\lambda/|{\\bf q}| ) , \\ \\ \n \\lambda/|{\\bf q}| \\gg 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result means that the large logarithm in @xmath52 simply reflects the renormalization of the fermi velocity , i.e. this divergence is not independent , but can be simply reabsorbed into the velocity by replacing @xmath56 in the one - loop result @xmath57 . due to the simple logarithmic structure of the theory this \n is expected to hold to all orders of perturbation theory , i.e. all self - energy corrections lead to a replacement of the coupling @xmath0 in all final expressions with the  running \" coupling @xmath58 , accounting for the velocity renormalization . \n we therefore assume that the velocity renormalization procedure is performed in all higher order diagrams . at finite small chemical potential , @xmath59 , which is the case in any realistic experimental situation , the divergence is cut - off , @xmath60 . due to the slow variation of the logarithmic function or possible other factors ( such as strong dielectric screening ) , \n no significant variation of the velocity has been found in experiment . @xcite    an interesting effect , related to the interaction contribution @xmath52 , eq .  ( [ pol10 ] ) \n , was recently discussed in ref .   within the rg approach . \n our calculation , leading to eq . \n ( [ pol10 ] ) , provides an explicit perturbative confirmation of the rg results . \n if we imagine an external coulomb impurity with charge @xmath61 , probing the polarization of the vacuum , then the induced charge density , in momentum space , is @xmath62 . here \n while the first term leads to induced charge @xmath64 , localized in real space at the impurity site and with a screening sign , the interaction term @xmath65 has an opposite sign and decays as an inverse power law ( @xmath66 , with logarithmic corrections ) . \n this peculiar behavior simply reflects , however , the renormalization ( increase ) of the fermi velocity at low momenta , which leads to suppression of screening at large distances .    , given by eq . \n ( [ vertex ] ) . ] \n we proceed with the calculation of the vertex correction in fig . \n [ fig1](b ) . before evaluating this expression , it is useful to examine the ( possible ) singularity structure separately in the vertex operator , shown in fig . \n for simplicity we use the notation @xmath67 which stands for the more conventionally used form @xmath68 , where the variables denote both frequency and momenta ( @xmath69 is the bosonic momentum / frequency ) . \n since the coulomb interaction is non - retarded , we have the simple expression @xmath70 after evaluating the frequency integral , the result is a sum of an off - diagonal and diagonal parts ( with respect to the pauli matrix indexes ) , @xmath71 . more explicitly , @xmath72 we are interested only in the zero frequency limit ( and only in the real part of @xmath73 , since the imaginary part does not contribute to the polarization ) . \n in this case the off - diagonal piece vanishes identically , @xmath74 . \n this is expected to be the case since the coulomb interaction is diagonal and thus the vertex can not generate a static contribution with a different matrix structure . on the other hand \n the diagonal part is finite in the same limit @xmath75 an explicit evaluation shows that @xmath76 does not have any divergent contributions . \n for example at @xmath77 , @xmath78 while in the opposite limit @xmath79 for our purposes the exact formulas are not important ( we also do not show the dependence on the angle between @xmath80 ) ; our main conclusion at this stage is that the vertex does not have any divergent parts . \n we have also examined diagrams of higher order , such as  ladder \" and  crossed \" ladder vertex corrections , and have found that all of them are finite . therefore the vertex insertions into the polarization function are expected to give a finite contribution to that quantity , and below we evaluate the lowest order vertex correction numerically . \n it is clear that a ward identity relating divergent contributions in the self - energy and in the vertex does not hold here , unlike conventional qed where lorentz ( and gauge ) invariance guarantees cancellation between vertex and self - energy corrections , @xcite and charge is renormalized only through simple polarization loops in the photon propagator . on the other hand in graphene , where the only non - trivially renormalized quantity is the velocity @xmath7 \n , both the polarization operator and the vertex operator do not show any independent divergencies .    the diagram of fig . \n [ fig1](b ) now reads @xmath81 where the full expression for @xmath73 from eq . \n ( [ vertex ] ) should be used . \n an explicit calculation , starting by evaluation of the energy integrations , leads to the result @xmath82 taking into account : @xmath83 where @xmath84 stands for a vector product , we then arrive at the final formula @xmath85 it is clear on dimensional grounds that @xmath86 is linear in @xmath87 . \n this is in fact the case for polarization diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory . \n the four - dimensional integrals , appearing in ( [ pol20 ] ) , can not be evaluated analytically . \n we have found , as expected in light of our previous discussion of the vertex function , that the expressions converge in the ultraviolet limit . \n after computing the integrals numerically , we obtain the following result for the combination @xmath88 , which appears in the dielectric function , @xmath89 adding also the one - loop rpa result , we have finally ( where @xmath90 is the static dielectric constant , defined by the formula below ) @xmath91 @xmath92    we conclude that , at @xmath2 , the vertex correction is more than @xmath1 of the one - loop result . \n it also has a screening sign , i.e. it reduces the effective charge . \n one also expects that finite contributions will appear to all orders in @xmath0 . \n however , resummation of perturbation theory by simple means seems impossible , as the contributions in question are finite and accumulate over a wide range of momenta in the corresponding diagrams ( rather than within a specific integration window , from where divergent parts typically originate , and thus can be easily collected ) . even though the vertex contribution is a sizable one , two remarks \n are in order : ( 1 . ) it does not change drastically the structure of the theory , apart from contributing towards further screening of the interactions . \n the fact that perturbation theory is used with the intention of being applied at a rather strong coupling is in itself questionable . \n nevertheless , perturbation theory provides a clear indication that a significant contribution to screening exists beyond the conventional one - loop rpa result . on the other hand in the weak - coupling regime , @xmath27 , \n rpa is parametrically well justified as far as the static polarization properties are concerned ( although the rpa is not justified for the self - energy . \n it is also useful to compare our results to the situation in ordinary metals with a finite fermi surface . \n certain approximations are typically used to account for vertex corrections , such as the hubbard form of the dielectric function . when extrapolated to low momentum \n , the vertex contribution tends to decrease the screening length , @xcite i.e. it reduces further the range of the interactions . \n naturally in graphene , where the screening length is infinite ( for the case of zero chemical potential considered here ) , the vertex correction affects directly the effective charge , without changing the shape of the coulomb potential . \n finally we mention two recent related works , discussing interaction effects , that appeared while the present manuscript was being prepared . in ref . \n , the effect of self - energy and vertex corrections to lowest order ( @xmath0 ) on the minimal conductivity in graphene was discussed , with the conclusion that the corrections is of order @xmath93 . \n dynamical polarization properties were studied in ref .  , where the vertex diagrams were found to have logarithmically singular contributions near the threshold @xmath94 , leading to the possibility of a plasmon mode .    in summary , we have shown that vertex corrections can have sizable effect in the static vacuum polarization diagrams in the regime of strong coupling , while for small coupling their importance diminishes parametrically . \n the self - energy corrections are naturally absorbed into the renormalization of the fermi velocity . \n the non - rpa vertex diagram at lowest order of perturbation theory was found to decrease the effective charge , meaning that in principle correlation effects at higher order must also be taken into account . \n thus the ultimate asymptotic behavior of the static polarization function for @xmath2 remains an open problem .", "StartTimeOffset": 1202923676700, "RequestID": "255e8ac6cc807c7bd264082aa46ebb9f1275bf34", "TotalTokens": 3700}
{"ContextTokens": 3785, "GeneratedTokens": 193, "SynthesizedBody": "pattern formation is one of the most fascinating and challenging problems in natural science . \n complexity of nature has been making various kinds of beautiful patterns . \n we are surrounded by such beautiful patterns , e.g. , honeycomb structure in a convection system @xcite , diffusion limited aggregation pattern @xcite , self - affine mountain profiles @xcite , and so on @xcite . \n pattern formation phenomena can be observed not only in physical systems , but also in chemical , and biological systems . \n for instance , our human body structure is a result of highly controlled pattern formation . even in our everyday life \n , fluid system usually makes beautiful patterns such as a milk - crown structure @xcite . in order to understand the complex nature of such pattern formations , \n more comprehensive studies have to be carried out . \n especially , the pattern formation of soft matter is a growing research field since it relates to various scientific and industrial issues . here \n , we focus on the pattern formation of polymer gel . \n polymer gel is a typical example of soft materials which shows complex rheological property . \n it is well known that the pattern formation is caused by a volume phase transition of polymer gel . \n since the pattern formation was reported by tanaka group @xcite , it has been studied both by experimental and theoretical ways @xcite . in this phenomenon , the origin of pattern formation is thought a mechanical instability owing to the abrupt volume change . \n in contrast , we have found a novel pattern formation appearing on a gelation surface @xcite . \n the pattern itself looks similar to the previous ( volume phase transition based ) one . \n however , physical mechanisms behind them are completely different . \n the pattern formation we found occurs without volume phase transition . \n furthermore , no other sudden change can be observed during pattern formation . \n poly - acrylamide ( aa ) gel slabs have been mostly used to make the pattern . \n poly - aa gel is very popular for biologists because they often use it for electrophoresis \n . radical chain reaction ( polymerization ) governs the gelation of poly - aa . \n we found that ambient oxygen is necessary to make the pattern @xcite . \n the pattern formation occurs when the top of the sample is open to ambient air . \n then oxygen is absorbed from a surface of slab , and diffuses in pre - gel solution during polymerization process . \n when we decrease the concentration of ambient oxygen , the pattern becomes thin @xcite . \n the oxygen is known as an inhibitor in the radical polymerization ( gelation ) . \n the necessity of inhibitor in a diffusion system reminds us of the turing instability . \n it is caused by diffusion and nonlinear competing reactions between an activator and an inhibitor . \n such system is called reaction diffusion ( rd ) system . \n the importance of inhibitor ( oxygen ) suggests the system might be governed by the rd system . \n in addition , the typical length scale ( wavelength of the pattern ) were measured and analyzed based on the framework of rd system . \n then , the length scale was consistent with the rd system @xcite .    in our previous study @xcite , we demonstrated the universality of this kind of pattern formation . \n we found that dimethylacrylamide ( dmaa ) and sodium acrylate ( sa ) polymers are also able to create surface pattern formation under similar experimental conditions . \n thus we think this pattern formation is universal at least for quasi 2-dimensional ( 2d ) free surface radical polymerization ( gelation ) process . \n we have measured the effective surface roughness ( esr ) using 2d photo data of the pattern @xcite . \n the esr characterizes the degree of pattern formation . \n it indicates a large value for vivid pattern formation , and a small value for slight pattern formation . \n we varied three essential parameters ( oxygen concentration , initiator concentration , and temperature ) , and measured the esr of resultant patterns in order to examine the parameters dependence of the pattern formation . \n finally , we obtained an empirical scaling which combines three parameters into a single scaling parameter @xcite .    although the actual pattern formation is 3-dimensional ( 3d ) surface deformation , all analyses mentioned above are based on 2d photo data . \n typical photos of the surface patterns are shown in fig . \n [ fig : rand_stripe ] . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : rand_stripe ] , 3d deformation can be visualized by 2d gray scale pattern by an inclined illumination . \n however , 3d direct measurement should be applied for the real quantitative analysis of 3d deformation . \n one main focus of this paper is to introduce a 3d measurement system to analyze the pattern formation directly . \n a line laser displacement sensor and an automatic x - stage are used for this purpose . \n there is another research focus concerning the ordering of pattern formation . in fig . \n [ fig : rand_stripe ] , two kinds of patterns are shown , ( a ) random and ( b ) stripe . \n as reported in the previous paper @xcite , random pattern appears in relatively low temperature regime . \n and stripe pattern appears in relatively high temperature regime . \n usually , random structure should be observed in high temperature regime , since temperature is a source of thermal noise . in this sense , it is a counterintuitive result . \n the reason of this trend has been left unsolved . \n very recently , we realized the substrate rack of the apparatus ( constant temperature chamber ) , which is underneath the sample , has stripe shape . \n besides , the pattern aligns to that direction . \n therefore we guess that the stripe pattern might come from the substrate based external temperature field . in order to check this assumption , we use a heating wire array , and make a poly - aa gel slab on it . \n direction , wavelength , and amplitude of the resultant patterns are measured by the 3d measurement system , and controllability of them are discussed in this paper . \n finally , we investigate more general possibility of pattern control , using various shapes of external temperature field . \n the materials and methods to make gel slabs are basically same as previous studies @xcite . aa monomer ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 ) constitutes sub - chains , and methylenbisacrylamide ( bis , @xmath0 = @xmath2 ) constitutes crosslink . \n ammonium persulfate ( aps ) is used as an initiator of radical reaction , and tetramethylethlyenediamine ( temd ) is used as an accelerator of the radical polymerization . \n most of produced gels are composed by @xmath3 g aa , 6 mg bis , @xmath4 - @xmath5 mg aps , @xmath6 @xmath7l temd , and @xmath8 ml deionized water . \n the experimental procedure is very simple . \n pre - gel solution is made in a beaker and degassed under ultrasonic vibration . \n right after this procedure , the initiator is added and the solution is poured onto a petri - dish ( @xmath9 cm in diameter ) \n . then surface deformation ( pattern formation ) occurs spontaneously within about 2 hours . \n this pattern remains permanently after the gelation . \n typical thickness of gel slabs is approximately @xmath10 mm . \n the gel slabs are thin enough to be regarded as quasi-2d . \n we develop a 3d measurement system to directly measure the surface deformation of gel slabs . \n schematic image of the system is shown in fig . \n [ fig : surface3d ] . a line laser sensor ( keyence ljg-030 ) \n is mounted above a sample . \n this sensor is composed by a line laser unit and a 2d cmos detector so that the sensor is able to acquire an intersectional profile of a 3d deformed surface . the sample is held on an automatic x - stage ( coms pm80b-100x ) . \n the axis of this stage is placed perpendicular to the line of laser . \n sample is shifted by the x - stage after taking every intersection data . \n all instruments are controlled by a pc ( with labview 8.6 ) . \n collected data are reorganized to the 3d surface profile . \n this system has @xmath11 @xmath7 m horizontal resolution ( both of x- and y - direction ) , and @xmath5 @xmath7 m vertical resolution . \n recently , the system is also applied to measure the drop - granular impact cratering @xcite . \n first , we make a gel slab on a heating wire array as shown in fig .

[ \n fig : hw_3d ] . \n 3d measurement data corresponds to central @xmath17 ( mm@xmath18 ) region of samples . as seen in fig . \n [ fig : hw_3d ] , the surface becomes rather flat with slight stripes when the interval distance is small . \n by contrast , independent stripe patterns appear if the interval distance is large enough . \n however , it is hard to confirm the correspondence between the interval distance and the pitch of stripe patterns . in other words \n , we are not able to see clear evidence of wavelength controllability in these data . \n using 3d height map data , we now analyze the characteristic length scale of the patterns more accurately . \n we apply the fast fourier transform ( fft ) analysis to the 3d data ( fig . \n [ fig : hw_3d](e - h ) ) . the peak wave number obtained by fft analysis \n is translated to the wavelength @xmath19 ( characteristic length scale ) . \n measured @xmath19 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : lambda ] . horizontal axis in fig . \n [ fig : lambda ] indicates experimental conditions ( wire temperature and initiator amount ) . \n symbols represent the interval distance of heating wires as denoted in the legend . in fig . \n [ fig : lambda ] , we can not confirm clear trend of the wavelength data . \n it seems to fluctuate around an average value of @xmath10 mm . \n this value certainly agrees with the previous result @xcite . \n the result suggests that it is hard to control the wavelength of the patterns . \n the stripe patterned external temperature field makes a stripe patterned gel slab . \n however , it is impossible to control the wavelength ( pitch ) of the pattern . in the previous paper @xcite \n , we considered that the origin of the pattern formation is a sort of rd based instability . \n if it is true , the characteristic length scale ( wavelength ) should be determined by the diffusion length scale of the inhibitor @xcite . in rd system \n , the wavelength is intrinsically determined rather by internal conditions than by external conditions . \n the result obtained here is consistent with that consideration . \n only the direction can be controlled by the external temperature field . \n next , we measure the amplitude of surface deformation . \n the surface roughness @xmath20 ( standard deviation of height map data ) is computed on 3d data that are same as those used in fig . \n [ fig : lambda ] computation . \n the result is shown in fig . \n [ fig : w ] . \n although the data scatter a lot , there is not any clear trend , again . \n the characteristic amplitude order ( surface roughness ) is about @xmath21 mm .    according to the data in figs . \n [ fig : lambda ] and [ fig : w ] , controllability of the pattern formation is very limited . \n we are able to control global structure ( direction ) of the pattern , whereas both of the wavelength and amplitude controls are impossible . \n the length scales seem to be determined by other physical mechanisms like diffusion of inhibitor , and/or polymerization dynamics , etc .      here \n , we try a little bit more challenge of the pattern control . \n since global structure of the pattern formation is controllable , we make gel slabs on several shapes of external temperature fields . \n the fields are generated by heated metal molds that have square , circle , and heart shapes . \n the metal molds are heated by a heating wire binding the molds .    in fig . \n [ fig : molds ] , photos of the obtained gel slabs and corresponding temperature field shapes are displayed . \n as expected , we can control the global structure of resultant patterns . \n they are clearly affected by external temperature fields . \n furthermore , the wavelength seems to be independent of the temperature field . \n these characteristics are consistent with the result obtained by the wire array experiment . \n the obtained results so far conclude the difficulty of the length scale control . \n this pattern formation phenomenon itself is very robust . \n the fine parameter tuning is not necessary to make the pattern . in this sense , \n the pattern formation is a kind of self - organized phenomenon . \n it is hard to control the length scale due to the robustness of self - organization . on the other hand \n , we can easily control the global structure of the pattern formation . \n surface pattern deformation simply obeys external temperature field shape .    in ref.@xcite , we considered the transition from random to stripe patterns at a higher temperature region . in the previous experiments \n , temperature is controlled by a constant temperature chamber with a stripe shaped substrate rack . thus the environmetal temperature was controlled . \n in low temperature reigme , heat condution and gelation process is rather uniform . \n contrastively , heat conduction from the substrate rack can not be negligible in high temperauture regime . \n that is a reason of transition like behavior at a certain temperature . in the current experiment \n , we use a heating wire array to actively control the temperature field , and the environmental temperature is room temperature ( @xmath22 27-.3em ) . as a result \n , the created pattern obeys the temperature field . \n therefore , we think that the temperature gradient plays an essential role in this phenomenon . however , the precise measurement of the temperature field is not easy . \n the current temperature control system is too rough to measure and discuss such a delicate temperature field . \n the precise temperature field measurement is a future problem . \n the typical length scale of the pattern formation is in an order of @xmath21-@xmath23 mm . \n such macroscopic self - organized pattern is not so common in polymer science . in this report \n , we do not discuss the microscopic dynamics of polymerization , or microscopic polymer network structure . \n the relation between them ( macroscopic pattern and microscopic dynamics / structure ) is an open problem . \n numerical model may be helpful to understand the physics of this pattern formation . \n however , it will not be so easy . obviously , diffusion coefficients of monomer , growing polymer blobs , and oxygen , decrease drastically during polymerization ( gelation ) . and \n finally they will be almost arrested by the elasticity of gel . \n it is difficult to model such time dependent diffusion problem . \n in addition , large amount of memory must be needed to reproduce macroscopic pattern formation from microscopic polymerization dynamics model . \n macroscopic phenomenological model might be suitable for this type of problem . \n moreover , macroscopic pattern formation of soft matter might relate to the patterning problem of the bio - materials , such as brains , reptiles skin , and so on . \n wrinkling on old human s skin is also a kind of pattern formation . \n the pattern formation reported here is more or less similar to such bio - related pattern formation . \n but it just looks similar . \n it never means underlying physics conformity . \n we can not conclude anything about this similarity at this moment . \n we have examined the controllability of the spontaneous pattern formation occurring on a gelation surface . \n a heating wire array was utilized to make external temperature field . \n pre - gel solution was put on it during gelation . then the ordered structure that aligns to the array direction appeared . \n this implies that we can control the global structure of the pattern formation . \n we next varied interval of heating wires and put pre -

stage and has @xmath24 @xmath7 m resolution .    from the data analyses \n , we found that both of wavelength and amplitude can not be controlled by external temperature field . \n these length scales seem to be determined by internal parameter such as diffusion length scale . \n [ 1 ] mm diameter , but the contact is almost linear since the wire surface is rigid . in other words , \n the contact is 1-dimensional . \n the @xmath14 is interval distance between two successive wires . \n temperature of the wire can be controlled by applying voltage to the wire.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.7 ] ( distance between wires ) cases respectively , ( a , e ) @xmath25 mm , ( b , f ) @xmath26 mm , ( c , g ) @xmath27 mm , and ( d , h ) @xmath28 mm . in all cases , \n wire temperature is set as 30 27-.3em , and initiator amount is 9 mg . \n scale bars correspond to @xmath5 mm.,title=\"fig : \" ]", "StartTimeOffset": 1216562343612, "RequestID": "7de1e11fb5e4e2932a534f48b1900d7f6923838e", "TotalTokens": 3978}

optical trap ( mot ) with many atoms , but they used indirect methods such as fitting to a model curve , @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the density of trapped atoms , @xmath2 the loss rate due to collisions with background atoms , and @xmath3 a coefficient for two - atom collisional process among trapped atoms . recently , several groups have trapped a small number of atoms in a mot with a strong magnetic field gradient and could observe individual loading and loss events in real time . in this way , loading rate @xmath4 , one - atom loss rate @xmath5 , and two - atom loss rate @xmath6 have been directly measured @xcite .    the atom - number correlation function has also been measured from the observed sequence of instantaneous atom number in a trap @xcite . since no analytic solution is known for the master equation in the limit of non - negligible two - atom loss , the study of the atom - number correlation function has been limited to the case of no two - atom loss , for which the correlation function does not provide any further information other than the one - atom loss rate . \n in the present work , we provide a comprehensive frame work for investigation of the atom - number correlation function based on the master equation ( chaps . \n ii and iii ) . \n an approximate formula has been derived for the correlation function in the limit of non - negligible two - atom loss ( chap . \n iv ) and the validity of the approximate formula has been put to a test by numerical simulations ( chap . \n the time dynamics of the atom number @xmath7 in a trap is governed by loading and loss processes . \n the loading process occurs at a certain rate @xmath4 , called loading rate , which is determined by capture ability of the trap . \n the capture ability depends on such experimental conditions as laser intensity , laser beam size , laser - atom detuning and background source density of atoms but not on the number of atoms trapped already . \n we can assume @xmath4 as a constant under fixed experimental condition . \n the loss rates , on the other hand , are affected by the number of atoms in the trap . \n one - atom loss occurs when one of the trapped atoms collides with a fast - moving background atom of different kind . \n one atom loss rate is thus linearly proportional to the number of atoms @xmath7 already present in the trap . \n we define @xmath8 as the one - atom loss _ coefficient _ in such a way that the one atom loss _ rate _ @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 . \n two - atom loss process is due to the collision between two of the trapped atoms . \n there are several types of two - atom collision processes responsible for two - atom losses . \n they are ground - state hyperfine - changing collisions , ground - excited - state fine - structure changing collision and ground - excited - state radiative escape . \n whenever these collisions occur , the colliding two atoms can gain enough kinetic energy for escaping from the trap @xcite . \n therefore , the two - atom loss rate is proportional to the number of two - atom combinations for the atoms in the trap . in terms of \n @xmath11 the two - atom loss _ \n coefficient _ , the two - atom loss _ rate _ \n @xmath12 is then given by @xmath13 . \n the loading and loss processes occur randomly . \n due to random nature of these processes , it is more convenient to treat the problem in terms of the atom number distribution function @xmath14 than to deal with the time variation of the instantaneous atom number @xmath7 itself . in order to understand the connection between time evolution of @xmath15 and that of @xmath7 , \n let us suppose that we turn on the loading process at time @xmath16 and observe the atom number , initially zero , afterwards . \n the atom number will change randomly as depicted in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , but the center of fluctuation will increase to a steady - state value determined by the balance between the loading and loss processes .    . for each member of the ensemble \n , the atom number constantly fluctuates due to random loading and loss processes . \n ( b ) ensemble averaged atom number in time . \n ( c ) ensemble averaged atom number distribution at various times . \n , width=326 ]    if we repeat the observation infinitely many times , each observation will give a different time sequence in detail . \n however , if we average all of the observed time sequences with the initial starting time aligned , we obtain a distribution of atom numbers at any time @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath15 , and a sequence of averaged atom number as a function of time . \n alternatively , we can replace the infinitely many observations with an ensemble of identically prepared traps . \n the sequence of averaged atom number is then an ensemble average of the atom number @xmath18 . \n it is shown that the time evolution of the ensemble -

atom loss process @xmath27 cause a reduction in @xmath14.,width=288 ] \n if a density of atoms in a trap is low enough , the collisions among the trapped atoms can be neglected . \n if we assume @xmath28 , eq . \n ( [ eq : master ] ) is simplified as @xmath29 this equation corresponds to the well - known birth - death model @xcite . in the steady state \n , we have @xmath30 for all @xmath7 and the solution is a poisson distribution given by @xmath31 for all integers @xmath32 with @xmath33 , the mean atom number . \n a rate equation for the _ ensemble -

averaged atom number @xmath18 does not change in the steady state , equal to the mean atom number @xmath44 , the atom number @xmath7 itself is continuously fluctuating around its mean . \n we can replace the time average above with an ensemble average . \n let us denote the atom number at time @xmath17 in the @xmath45th ensemble member as @xmath46 . \n then we can rewrite the correlation function as @xmath47 where the summation over @xmath45 is performed over all members of the ensemble . \n we can regroup the ensemble into sub - ensembles in such a way that the members in each sub - ensemble have a common initial atom number @xmath36 . since @xmath48 values are distributed according to @xmath14 of eq . \n ( 3 ) , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath49\\ ; , % = \\sum_{n_{0}}^{\\infty}n_{0}p_{n_{0}}\\langle n(n_{0},\\tau)\\rangle   \\label{eq : cor -

averaged atom number @xmath18 at time @xmath52 when its initial value is @xmath36 at time @xmath16 . the correlation function \n is then simplified as @xmath53    a differential equation for the correlation function can be obtained by taking a derivative of eq . \n ( [ eq : cor - def3 ] ) with respect to @xmath42 . \n @xmath54 in the second line in eq . \n ( [ eq : one - cor - diff - eq ] ) , we used eq . \n ( [ eq : one - rate - eq ] ) , which is independent of the initial condition . by using the conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 \n , we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 and therefore , the normalized correlation function is @xmath59    the correlation function shows a decay behavior from @xmath60 to 1 with a characteristic correlation time @xmath61 . \n it is interesting to note that the atom - number correlation function exhibits bunching , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , when the atom number distribution is poissonian whereas a poisson distribution for photon number does not necessarily means bunching for a photon number correlation function . \n if the density of atoms in a trap becomes higher , the two - atom loss terms are no longer negligible , and thus the full version of the master equation , eq . \n ( [ eq : master ] ) , should be considered . \n however , the full master equation can not be solved analytically . \n instead , we rely on numerical solutions , either by monte - carlo simulation or an iteration method for given parameter values . such numerical studies are discussed elsewhere @xcite . in this work , \n we focus on approximate solutions to the master equation . \n the rate equation for @xmath18 with the two - atom loss terms can be derived from the master equation as @xmath64 in the steady state , we let @xmath65 . differently from the case of excluding two - atom loss terms , \n however , we do not get any information about @xmath66 other than the following relation between the variance and the mean . @xmath67    following the same line of reasoning from eq . \n ( [ eq : cor - def ] ) to eq . \n ( [ eq : one - cor - diff - eq ] ) with the rate equation eq.([eq : two - rate - equation ] ) , we can obtain a differential equation for the correlation function in the presence of non - negligible two - atom loss terms as follows . \n @xmath68 when @xmath69 , the slope of the correlation function becomes @xmath70 where @xmath71 . \n the relation of @xmath72 with the lower moments is obtained from the rate equation for @xmath73 in the steady state . \n @xmath74 after some lengthy algebra we finally obtain @xmath75 if @xmath28 , eq . \n ( [ eq : two - cor - slope ] ) reduces to eq . \n ( [ eq : one - cor - slope ] ) . \n the differential equation eq . \n ( [ eq : two - cor - diff - eq ] ) can not be solved exactly because of the complexity in the last term . however , in the limit of reasonably small two - atom loss , @xmath76 , the atom number distribution is approximately a poisson distribution with a variance @xmath77 . \n this is the most significant approximation in our analysis . \n the validity of this approximation will be discussed in the next section . in this limit \n , the mean value @xmath66 can be obtained from eq . \n ( [ eq : two - relation ] ) . \n @xmath78 and thus @xmath79 where @xmath80 . equation ( [ eq : two - mean ] ) reduces to eq . \n ( 7 ) when @xmath81 . \n our second approximation is that the correlation function is in the same form as that of eq . \n ( [ eq : one - cor - sol ] ) except for the decay constant . \n this is a reasonable approximation since the correlation function always starts from @xmath82 and goes to @xmath83 at infinity . \n therefore , we assume @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an effective decay constant to be determined . it can be determined by eq . \n ( [ eq : two - cor - slope ] ) . \n @xmath86 and thus @xmath87 the normalized correlation function is then given by @xmath88 using the approximation @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90    = 0.08 , @xmath91=0.04 and the two - atom collision constant @xmath92 is ( a ) 0.004 , ( b ) 0.04 and ( c ) 0.4 , respectively . \n a dashed curve represents a correlation function given by eq . \n ( [ eq : one - nor - cor ] ) neglecting two - atom loss . \n grey curves are the fit given by the approximate formula with @xmath93 treated as a fitting parameter . \n the resulting @xmath93 values are 0.94@xmath44 , 0.78@xmath44 and 0.50@xmath44 for ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively.,width=316 ] \n in order to check the validity of our approximate formulas eqs . \n ( [ eq : two - mean ] ) and ( [ eq : two - nor - cor2 ] ) , we solve the master equation numerically and compare the results with the approximate formulas in fig . \n [ fig : compare ] . under the condition of @xmath76 , \n ( [ eq : two - nor - cor2 ] ) agrees well with the numerical results as shown in fig . \n [ fig : compare](a ) . \n our approximation is valid in this limit . as @xmath92 \n is increased beyond this limit , however , the approximation starts to deviate from the simulation result as seen in fig . \n [ fig : compare](b ) , where we have @xmath94 . \n the approximation is still acceptable even under this condition although not as good as in fig . \n [ fig : compare](a ) . \n the deviation is severe in fig . \n [ fig : compare](c ) , under the condition of @xmath95 . \n the failure of the approximation is mostly due to the fact that the atom number distribution is assumed to be a poissonian . \n the atom number distribution function is not well approximated by a poisson distribution when @xmath92 becomes comparable to and larger than @xmath4 and @xmath8 , so the assumption , @xmath96 , fails . in general , the variance @xmath97 is smaller than the mean value @xmath66 . \n consequently , when @xmath69 , the approximate result is always larger than the true value . \n @xmath98 if we treat @xmath93 in eq . \n ( [ eq : two - nor - cor ] ) as a fitting parameter , we obtain better agreement between the numerical results and the approximate formula even for @xmath99 . for example , the grey curves in fig .  [ \n fig : compare ] are the fit given by eq . \n ( [ eq : two - nor - cor ] ) , agreeing well with the numerical results . \n we have derived approximate formulas for the mean atom number and the atom - number correlation function in the limit of reasonably small two - atom collision compared to the one - atom collision and the loading rates . \n the validity of the approximate formulas was confirmed by comparing them with numerical solutions . \n a.  willems , r.  a.  boyd , j.  l.  bliss , and k.  g.  libbrecht , phys . \n lett . * 78 * , 1660 ( 1997 ) . \n m.  p.  bradley , j.  v.  porto , s.  rainville , j.  k.  thompson , and d.  e.  pritchard , phys . \n lett . * 83 * , 4510 ( 1999 ) . \n m.  hennrich , a.  kuhn , and g.  rempe ,  phys . \n lett . * 94 * , 053604 ( 2005 ) . \n b.  darqui , m.  p.  a.  jones , j.  dingjan , j.  beugnon , s.  bergamini , y.  sortais , g.  messin , a.  browaeys , p.  grangier , science * 309 * , 454 ( 2005 ) . \n d.  sesko , t.  walker , c.  monroe , a.  gallagher , and c.  wieman , phys . \n * 63 * , 961 ( 1989 ) . \n b.  ueberholz , s.  kuhr , d.  frese , v.  gomer and d.  meschede , j. phys . \n b : at . mol . \n . phys . * 35 * , 4899 ( 2002 ) s. yoon , y. choi , s. park , j. kim , j. lee and k. an , `` a definitive number of atoms on demand : controlling the number of atoms in a - few - atom magneto - optical trap '' , arxiv : physics/0604087 . f.  ruschewitz , d.  bettermann , j.  l.  peng and w.  ertmer , europhys .  lett . * 34 * , 651 ( 1996 ) . c.  w.  gardiner , _ handbook of stochastic methods _ ( springer - verlag , 1983 ) . \n sungsam kang , seokchan yoon , youngwoon choi , jai - hyung lee , and kyungwon an , `` dependence of fluorescence - level statistics on bin time size in a few - atom magneto - optical trap '' , arxiv : physics/0604088 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1248485950416, "RequestID": "94c76af3a4a42b6219b23845c2c4385e12dbafe1", "TotalTokens": 4096}

time geometry in the vicinity of external gravitating bodies , this enabling high precision tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity to be carried out . \n there are important issues regarding the approximation to a geodesic that are being addressed by the motion of an actual extended body . on the one hand , in general relativity @xcite , \n the problem of an extended body is subtle due , not only to the non - linearity of the equations of motion , but also because of the need to deal with the internal structure of a compact body , constructed of continuous media , where kinetic variables and thermodynamic potentials , are involved , and where there may be intrinsically non - local effects arising from the internal structure of an extended body , such as tidal ones . \n moreover , there are problems concerning approximations that need to be made in order to describe a given extended body as a test particle moving along a geodesic , these being related with the fact that many of the common newtonian gravitational concepts such as centre of mass , total mass , or size of an extended material body do not have well defined counterparts in general relativity @xcite . \n the ehlers - geroch theorem @xcite , which generalized an earlier result by geroch and jang @xcite , provides a justification , under appropriate conditions , for the trajectory of an extended body , having a limitingly small gravitational field of its own , to be a geodesic :    _ a timelike curve @xmath0 on a 4-manifold of lorenzian metric @xmath1 must necessarily be a geodesic , if for each closed neighborhood @xmath2 of @xmath0 there exists , within each neighborhood of the metric @xmath1 ( with accompanying connection ) in @xmath2 , a metric @xmath3 whose the einstein tensor @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the ricci tensor and @xmath6 the scalar curvature of @xmath3 ) satisfies the dominant energy condition in @xmath2 , is non - zero in @xmath2 , and vanishes on @xmath7 . _ \n the conditions of the theorem are not specific to any equations of state that the material of a test body might be subject to , beyond its satisfaction of the dominant energy condition . \n this theorem , asserting that _ small massive bodies move on near - geodesics _ , thus achieves a rigorous bridge from general relativity to satellite experiments . \n this suggests a high level of suppression of non - gravitational and self - gravitational effects from the satellite s own small gravitational field , enabling us to consider that it has a very nearly geodesic motion and , hence , providing a genuine testing ground for general relativity effects . \n laser relativity satellite ( lares ) @xcite was launched on february 13 , 2012 from the european space agency s spaceport in kourou , french guiana . \n that launch also marked the first qualification flight of the new vehicle - rocket vega of the european space agency . \n the satellite is a tungsten alloy sphere of 18.2 cm radius and mass 386.8 kg ( fig . \n 1 ) , covered by 92 retro - reflectors to reflect the laser signals from the international laser ranging service stations . \n the orbit is circular to high accuracy , the eccentricity is 0.0007 , and inclination 69@xmath8.5 at semi - major axis 7820 km . \n the efficiency of lares is in the simplicity of its design , aimed at the suppression of non - gravitational orbital perturbations including atmospheric drag and the anisotropic thermal radiation from its surface due to the anisotropic heating of the sphere due to the solar and earth s radiations ( yarkovsky effect ) : it has the smallest ratio of cross - sectional area to mass of any other artificial satellite , including the previous two laser geodynamics satellites ( lageos ) and a single piece structure . \n ( lageos had a heterogeneous structure . ) \n the experience with the lageos satellites had proved the efficiency of laser ranging passive satellites for testing the frame - dragging effect predicted by general relativity @xcite . \n an important fact was the availability of the improved earth s gravity models of grace , providing the possibility of the accurate evaluation of their spherical harmonic coefficients . \n the obtained behavior for the residuals of the nodes of the lageos 1 and 2 confirmed the lense - thirring effect @xcite , i.e. the rate of drag of the longitude of the nodes @xmath9 to an accuracy of the order of 10% @xcite , where * j * is the angular momentum of the central mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the orbit of the test particle , respectively . \n the analysis of the first months of measurements @xcite confirmed the efficiency of the design of lares , even though its orbit is lower than that of both lageos : the acceleration due to the non - gravitational perturbations for lares achieves 2 - 3-times improvement with respect to lageos . \n it has to be stressed that until the launch of lares , the two lageos satellites had the smallest residual acceleration of any other artificial satellite . \n the creation of a general relativistic test particle moving along a geodesic in the earth s space - time gravitational field has to be considered as a principal achievement for high accuracy testing of any relativistic effect . \n these studies are able to constrain possible extensions of general relativity such as the chern -

{"ContextTokens": 2013, "GeneratedTokens": 169, "SynthesizedBody": "recent hst proper motion measurements of the magellanic clouds by kallivayalil et al . \n ( 20006a , b ) and @xcite indicate that they are presently moving at velocities substantially higher ( almost 100 km s@xmath1 ) than those provided by previous observational studies ( van der marel et al . \n 2002 , kroupa & bastian 1997 ) . \n such high velocities ( @xmath2 km s@xmath1 and @xmath3 km s@xmath1 for the lmc and smc , respectively ) are close to the escape velocity of the milky way and consistent with the hypothesis of a first passage about the galaxy ( besla et al . 2007 ) . \n a single perigalactic passage has serious implications for the origin of the magellanic stream . \n it definitely rules out the tidal stripping hypothesis ( ruzicka , theis & palous 2008 ) since in this scenario the loss of mass is primarily induced by tidal shocks suffered by satellites at the pericenters ( mayer et al . \n 2006 ) and the stream would not have time to form before the present time . \n indeed kinematical data suggest that the clouds are now just after a perigalactic passage . on the other hand , ram - pressure scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the relative velocity between satellites and the ambient medium . \n the high velocities of the clouds could therefore compensate the effect of the reduced interaction time with the hot halo of the mw and hydrodynamical forces would play a determinant role in forming the stream . \n + in @xcite ( hereafter m05 ) we have performed high resolution n - body / sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical and gravitational interaction between the lmc and the mw using orbital constraints by @xcite and a present time satellite velocity of 250 km s@xmath1 . \n we found that , after two perigalactic passages , the combined effect of tidal forces and ram - pressure stripping can account for the majority of the lmc s internal features and for the formation of the ms . \n more in detail , ram - pressure stripping of cold gas from the lmc s disk produces a stream with morphology and kinematics similar to the observed ones , while tidal stripping has longer time - scales and is not efficient in forming stellar debris , consistently with the lack of stars observed in the stream . \n nevertheless , at each pericentric passage the lmc suffers tidal heating which perturbs the overall structure of the satellite reducing the gravitational restoring force and therefore indirectly contributing to the loss of gas . \n + the main objection to this model , in light of the new proper motion measurements of the lmc , is that the time spent by the lmc within the hot halo of the mw would be to short to cover the full extension of the stream ( more than 100 degree ) by ram -

component galaxy models with a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a spherical dark matter halo . \n the density profile of the nfw halo is adiabatically contracted due to baryonic cooling . \n stars and cold gas in the disks follow the same exponential surface density profile . \n we also explore the eventuality of an extended lmc gaseous disk . in this model \n the gaseous disk is characterized by an additional constant density layer which extends up to eight times the scale length of the exponential disk . \n the mw model comprises also a small stellar bulge and an extended low density ( @xmath6 @xmath7 within 150 kpc from the galactic center and @xmath8 @xmath7 at 50 kpc ) hot ( @xmath9 k ) halo in hydrostatic equilibrium inside the galactic potential ( m05 ) . \n the mw model , with virial mass @xmath10 and concentration @xmath11 , is similar to model a1 of @xcite while the structural parameters of the lmc are chosen in such a way that the resulting rotation curve resemble that of a typical bulgeless late - type disk galaxy . in details , the satellite has virial mass @xmath12 , concentration @xmath13 and the same amount of mass in the stellar and gaseous disk component ( @xmath14 ) . \n the toomre s stability criterion is always satisfied and the parameter @xmath15 set equal to 1.5 and 2.0 at the disk scale radius in the different lmc models . \n i performed adiabatic simulations using gasoline , a parallel tree - code with multi - stepping ( wadsley et al . \n high resolution runs have @xmath16 particles , of which @xmath17 are used for the disks and @xmath18 for the hot halo of the mw . \n the gravitational spline softening is set equal to 0.5 kpc for the dark and gaseous halos , and to 0.1 kpc for stars and gas in the disk and bulge components .        in my best model \n the lmc approaches the mw on an unbound orbit ( fig . \n [ orbit ] ) with initial galactocentric distance of 400 kpc and velocity @xmath19 km s@xmath1 . \n after the perigalactic passage ( at @xmath20 kpc ) the velocity decreases faster than for a ballistic orbit as a result of dynamical friction . \n the escape velocity at a given lmc position is indicated by a red curve in the right panel and calculated assuming a spherical unperturbed host potential . due to the effects of dynamical friction , at late times \n the satellite lies on a nearly parabolic orbit . at the present time \n ( @xmath21 gyr , vertical lines in the plots ) it reaches a velocity of @xmath22 km @xmath23 at @xmath24 kpc from the galactic center , in good agreement with the new proper motion measurements . + in choosing the initial inclination of the lmc i made the approximation that it does not change during the interaction due to the effects precession or nutation of the disk plane . at the beginning of the simulation \n the disk moves almost face - on through the external medium , and ram - pressure affecting the whole disk perpendicularly . in proximity to the perigalactic passage the velocity vector changes rapidly and \n the angle between the satellite s disk and the proper motion is close to zero . at the present time the simulated disk has an inclination of about 30 degree with respect to the orbital motion ( kallivayalil et al . \n 2006a ) and is indeed moving nearly edge - on through the external hot gas , with ram - pressure compressing its eastern side . \n [ aitoff ] illustrates the present time distribution of stars and gas originating from the lmc s disk . \n the stellar disk becomes elongated while tidal debris start forming after the perigalactic passage . \n but all stars stay bound to the satellite . \n tidal heating does not perturb significantly the vertical structure of the disk that remains thin and does not create a warp , unlike what observed in m05 . \n bar instability develops at the perigalacticon only in the case of @xmath25 . + ram - pressure strips nearly @xmath26 of gas from the lmc s disk forming a continuous stream that lies in a thin plane perpendicular to the disk of the mw and extending up to @xmath27 degrees from the lmc ( fig . \n [ aitoffcirc ] ) . \n the location of the stream in the southern galactic hemisphere is comparable to the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 provided by observations . \n contrary to m05 there is no lmc s gas above the galactic plane . in m05 \n the material lying in the northern hemisphere is stripped from the satellite during the orbital period preceding the present one and the stream forms a great polar circle around the galaxy . the lack of gas at @xmath30 in fig . \n [ aitoffcirc ] is not due to inefficient ram - pressure at early times , but to the fact that , in order to reproduce the current location and velocity of the lmc , the satellite enters the mw halo exactly at @xmath31 . \n the morphology of the stream does not change significantly adopting an extended gaseous disk model ( top panel of fig . \n [ aitoffcirc ] ) , except for the region at the head of the stream , which appears broader ( bottom ) . \n i carried out high resolution gravitational / hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between the lmc and the mw using the orbital parameters suggested by the new hst proper motion measurements . \n i find that ram - pressure stripping exerted by a tenuous mw hot halo during a single perigalactic passage forms a stream whose extension and location in the sky are comparable to the observed ones . \n the stellar structure of the satellite is only marginally affected by tidal forces . \n + the numerical simulations were performed on the l sgi -

{"ContextTokens": 3789, "GeneratedTokens": 249, "SynthesizedBody": "coherent superposition states are an important aspect of quantum systems @xcite , one which is believed to make possible their use for more efficient realization of energy and information manipulation tasks @xcite . in the last few years , much attention has been given for the development , analysis , and application of a resource theory for quantum coherence ( rtc ) . \n for a recent review , see ref . \n it is certainly worthwhile recognizing the existence of several levels of incoherent operations ( io ) in the rtc @xcite . naturally , depending on its properties , different coherence functions may or may not be a coherence monotone under a specific element of a given set of io @xcite . \n this kind of observation points for the need of further investigations concerning the similarities and differences among the properties enjoyed by varied quantumness functions . \n here we shall pay special attention to the geometric quantum coherence function which is obtained using hilbert - schmidt s distance ( hsd ) . although the possible non - contractivity under general quantum operations of the hsd @xcite demands care when of its application for quantumnesses quantification @xcite , it is a fact that the hsd has been a handy tool for a variety of investigations in quantum information science @xcite . \n in addition to that , recently it was shown that the hsd leads to an observable upper bound for the robustness of coherence , which is a full quantum coherence monotone @xcite . \n besides , because of its friendliness for analytical calculations , the hsd can be a useful tool for starting on quantumnesses quantification , as happened , for instance , with quantum entanglement and quantum discord @xcite . \n our main goal in this article is obtaining the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) of multipartite qudit states and to use it to analyze the distribution and manipulation of quantum coherence in this kind of scenario . \n we shall then deal with two relevant - associated topics . \n we will look at the possibility of controlling the local and/or non - local coherences @xcite of a system by manipulating its local populations . and we will investigate the issue of a possible non - monotonic behavior of quantum distance measures under tensor products @xcite . \n the non - monotonicity under tensor products ( nmutp ) of a distance measure , investigated recently for the trace distance @xcite , is the possibility for an inversion in the dissimilarity relation between pairs of states when we consider their copies . \n that is to say , for four density matrices @xmath7 , it can happen that @xmath8 once there is no known analytical expression for the trace distance coherence for general states of systems with dimension greater or equal to three @xcite , and with the aim of unveiling the possible implications of the nmutp in quantum information science , here we shall analyze it using the hsd and look for its possible implications in coherence quantification . \n the remainder of the article is structured as follows . in sec . \n [ sec : hsd_nqudits ] we make use of bloch s representation to write the hilbert - schmidt distance between two generic @xmath1-qudit states as an euclidean distance between the associated rescaled bloch s vectors . in sec . \n [ sec : hsc_nqudits ] we use this result to obtain an analytical formula for the hilbert - schmidt coherence of @xmath1-qudit states . \n we instantiate this general result by looking at one - qubit ( sec . \n [ sec : qubit ] ) , one - qutrit ( sec . \n [ sec : qutrit ] ) , two - qubit ( sec . [ sec:2qubits ] ) , and two copies of one - qubit ( sec . \n [ sec : rho_rho ] ) states . after writing , in sec . \n [ sec:2qubits ] , the total hsc of two - qubit states in terms of its local and nonlocal parts , in sec . \n [ sec : rho_rho ] we study the possibility for controlling these quantities by manipulating the local populations of two copies of one - qubit states . \n the contrasting behaviors of hsc , @xmath6-norm coherence , and relative entropy of coherence in this regard are noticed . \n the non - monotonicity of the hsd under tensor products is investigated in sec . \n [ sec : nmutp ] , where we report the first example of an important implication of this kind of property of a quantum distance function . \n we summarize our findings and discuss related open questions in sec . \n [ sec : conclusion ] . \n let @xmath9 , the @xmath10 identity matrix , and @xmath11 be a basis for @xmath5 . \n we can use these operators to form a basis for @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and to write any @xmath1-qudit state as @xcite : @xmath14 if the matrices @xmath15 satisfy the algebraic relations @xmath16 then the unit trace of @xmath17 requires @xmath18 . besides , the other parameters @xmath19 , which are the components of the so called bloch s vector , can be obtained as follows : @xmath20    now let s regard the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) @xcite , @xmath21 between two generic @xmath1-qudit states . \n using @xmath22 we shall have @xmath23 thus , if we define the components of the _ rescaled bloch s vector _ as @xmath24 with the analogous holding for @xmath25 , the hsd between @xmath17 and @xmath26 can be written as the euclidean distance between the @xmath2 vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29    we observe that if the generators @xmath30 are hermitian , then the distinguishability of the two states gains a nice physical significance in terms of differences between the corresponding pairs of observables mean values . \n notice that for this kind of generator we have , e.g. , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . for a generic two - qudit density matrix , ref . \n @xcite showed an optimized way to compute numerically the components of the associated bloch s vector ( the fortran code produced for that purpose can be accessed freely in @xcite ) . \n incoherent states , @xmath33 , are represented by density matrices which are diagonal in some reference , orthonormal , basis @xmath34 . \n that is to say @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 being a probability distribution . \n the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) of a state @xmath17 is defined as its minimum hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) to incoherent states : @xmath37    for computing the hsc , one convenient choice for the @xmath5 generators is the @xmath10 generalized gell mann matrices @xcite : @xmath38 these three sets of matrices are named the _ diagonal _ , _ symmetric _ , and _ antisymmetric _ sets , respectively . \n the particular cases with @xmath39 and @xmath40 give the well known pauli and gell mann matrices , respectively .    if the reference basis is chosen to be the @xmath1-qubit _ computational basis _ \n @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , then the presence of any non - null component of the bloch s vector corresponding to generators from the symmetric and/or antisymmetric sets implies in the presence of off diagonal elements in the density matrix . \n thus , the more general @xmath1-qudit incoherent state is obtained utilizing the identity matrix and the generators from the diagonal set : @xmath43 above we used the notation @xmath44 .    as seen in eq . \n ( [ eq : hsd_nqudits ] ) , the hsd is given in terms of the sum of positive terms , which are equal to the square of the difference between corresponding components of the rescaled vectors . \n therefore , the minimum in eq . \n ( [ eq : hsc ] ) is obtained if we set @xmath45 for all @xmath46 and @xmath47 . \n thus we see that the optimal incoherent state under the hsd is @xmath48    we shall define the _ coherence vector _ , @xmath49 , as the vector obtained using the components of the rescaled bloch s vector in eq . \n ( [ eq : nbv ] ) corresponding to one or more generators from the symmetric and/or antisymmetric sets . \n hence the hsc of a @xmath1-qudit state can be cast as the euclidean norm of this dimension @xmath50 coherence vector : @xmath51 in the next sub - sections , we exemplify the application of this general result to some particular cases . \n in this example @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . \n so , the one - qubit hsc is given by @xmath55 in this section , and in the remainder of this article , when there is no chance for confusion , we omit the density matrix in the expression for the mean values .      here \n @xmath52 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . \n so , @xmath58      now @xmath59 , @xmath53 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 where the local part of the coherence was set to @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the one - qubit reduced states ( their hsc read as in eq . \n ( [ eq : c1qb ] ) ) . the non - local part of the coherence @xcite may be cast as @xmath64      as a special case of the class of states regarded in the last sub - section , let us look to two copies of one - qubit states : @xmath65 . for this kind of state \n we have @xmath66 and @xmath67    considering that the local populations are equal to @xmath68 with @xmath69 , we notice that although we can not control the local hsc by manipulating @xmath70 , we can change the non - local hsc by modifying the difference between those populations : @xmath71 . \n the result above is to be compared with the one for the @xmath6-norm coherence ( l1c ) , which , in contrast to the hsc , is a coherence monotone under the incoherent operations regarded in ref . \n the l1c is given by the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements of a density matrix . \n although @xmath72 is present in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath65 , it cancels out when we perform that sum , and we get @xmath73 with @xmath74 . \n so , we can not control the non - local l1c by tuning local populations . \n because of its operational interpretation @xcite , the relative entropy of coherence ( rec ) may be considered to be one of the main coherence quantifiers introduced up today . \n the rec is defined and given by @xcite : @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the density matrix obtained by setting the off - diagonal elements of @xmath17 to zero and @xmath77 is von neumann s entropy . using the additivity of von neumann s entropy under tensor products , i.e. , @xmath78 and the fact that @xmath79 , we see that the rec is also additive under tensor products , i.e. , @xmath80 . \n so , we shall be able to change the rec of the two copies of @xmath17 only if we can change its own rec . \n an interesting result we report here in this direction is that , contrary to what happens with the hsc and l1c , we can modify the rec of a qubit by controlling its populations . for a qubit state , \n @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83@xmath84 the form of the equation for @xmath85 is an indicative that the term @xmath72 , related to the populations , does not cancel out . \n we verify that this is indeed the case via an example , which is shown in fig . \n [ fig : rec ] .     for a fixed value of the @xmath6-norm coherence \n @xmath86 if we look at the bloch s sphere in the @xmath87 space @xmath88 , a constant value of @xmath89 ( or of @xmath90 ) will be associated with points in the lateral surface of a cylinder of physical states within the sphere . in this cylinder , for @xmath72 running from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , different values of @xmath93 shall lead to different values of @xmath94 . \n the uppermost and downmost circles of that cylinder surface touch the sphere surface , and in these circles lie pure states for which the bloch s vector norm , shown in the upper ( red ) curve , is equal to one . ] \n one can verify that , similarly to what happens with the trace distance ( td ) @xcite , the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) does not suffer from the non - monotonicity under tensor product ( nmutp ) issue for general pure states or for one - qubit collinear states . \n actually , one can show that this holds true for all @xmath95-norm distances @xcite . for general qudit states , the probability for random quartets of states to present \n the nmutp behavior of hsd decays with increasing the system dimension , also similar to what was seen for the td @xcite . for completeness , \n we show such probabilities in fig . \n [ fig : nmutp ] .    . \n ]    regarding the hilbert - schmidt coherence ( hsc ) , once @xmath96 we see that the nmutp behavior of the hsd can be revealed on its associated hsc if we manipulate @xmath97 accordingly ; what we will do by using an example . \n we will consider @xmath98 and @xmath99 , what gives us @xmath100 and @xmath101 so @xmath102 in order to invert the dissimilarity relation , we fix @xmath103 and change @xmath104 , which can vary from zero up to @xmath105 . as @xmath106 \n , we can use e.g. @xmath107 to get @xmath108 , and consequently @xmath109    these last two inequalities are a manifestation of the nmutp of hsd : @xmath110 in the last equation we used the fact that , under the hsd , @xmath111 . \n in this article , we started obtaining a closed formula for the hilbert - schmidt distance ( hsd ) between two generic @xmath1-qudit states in terms of the euclidean distance between the corresponding normalized bloch s vectors . \n we used this result to derive an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt quantum coherence ( hsc ) of @xmath1-qudit systems . \n this formula was then exemplified in simple cases and we applied it to investigated issues related to the distribution and transformation of quantum coherence in some composite systems .    after splitting the total hsc of two - qubit states into its local and non - local parts , we analyzed the possibility of controlling these coherences by tuning the local populations of two copies of a generic one - qubit state . \n related to that matter , we observed some interesting contrasting behaviors of the hsc , @xmath6-norm coherence ( l1c ) , and relative entropy of coherence ( rec ) . \n we noticed that it is not possible to change the local hsc and l1c by tuning local populations . \n however , contrary the what was seen for the l1c , we can control the hsc by doing that kind of operation . \n the rec of two copies of a qubit state can be changed only if the local rec is changed , what we showed being possible by the control of local populations . \n this raises yet another bold difference among these coherence functions . in future works \n , it could be fruitful to investigate this kind of issue considering another coherence quantifiers . \n we have identified the first important implication of the non - monotonicity under tensor product ( nmutp ) property of a quantum distance measure . \n we showed that the nmutp of hsd , when applied to some states , can indicate that although a configuration @xmath112 is more coherent than another state @xmath113 , two independent copies of the first state possess less hsc than two copies of the last . \n we emphasize that we succeeded in doing that at this moment mainly because we used the hsd . \n this unexpected result , obtained for the hsd , calls for further investigations of the nmutp issue regarding other quantum distance measures and also considering other of its possible consequences . \n this work was supported by the brazilian funding agencies : conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) , processes 441875/2014 -

connections ( ivoa spectral data model 1.01 , 2007)[multiblock footnote omitted ] , that is to describe all the possible universes of classes of data . \n note that such description and interrelationships are fundamental in scientific research also , with the only difference that , in the last case , researchers are focused on _ particular _ types of objects . \n figure [ fig : ivoa - sdm ] shows the spectrum data model generated by the data model working group . \n this data model aims to describe all the universe of tables in the vo that contain a spectrum , hence the data model must not only be valid for observed data , but also for theoretical spectra . \n this data model ( the generic description of a spectrum ) allows to formulate new questions for researchers that either produce or use theoretical spectra : does this data model describe theoretical spectra ? can all the `` boxes '' in the data model be filled ? and , if this is the case , what is the accuracy of a theoretical model ? \n do theoretical models have systematic errors ? and , do they have statistical errors ? \n in addition to the spectrum data model , this working group has also proposed a data model for astrophysical dataset characterization ( ivoa data model for astronomical dataset characterization 1.11 , 2007)[multiblock footnote omitted ] . \n this data model defines the information required to describe the parameter space of observed or simulated astronomical datasets . \n [ fig : ivoa - cdm ] is a draft illustration of the description of an atmosphere library like those used in population synthesis . \n again , a correct characterization of models is fundamental for their application to observations . \n all theoretical models have a limited range of validity , given by the computational algorithms , the resolution of the input data and other factors . \n usually , these limitations are described qualitatively in the reference papers , but unfortunately , it is not so common for these limitations to be introduced in the code that computes the models ( fortunately , there are some significant exceptions , like cloudy by * ? ? ? * ) . \n we stress again that an answer of the previous issues is fundamental in scientific research , since the basic way to obtain the physical parameters of an observed system is to compare observational data with theoretical models . \n only if these questions are solved in a quantitative way , will it be possible to evaluate the accuracy ( not the precision ) of our knowledge of the observed system .    in the case of stellar populations , \n theoretical models are provided by stellar population synthesis @xcite . \n the general case of population synthesis aims to decompose the observed light of the system under study in different stellar populations components , that is the contribution of classes of stars , each class with different effective temperature and gravity @xcite . in this case \n , no further information about the observed system can be obtained unless additional a priori information is considered . in the case of _ evolutionary _ population synthesis @xcite , the contribution of the different stellar classes is defined by the evolutionary status of the system , hence the knowledge of the contribution of the different stellar classes can be transformed into knowledge about the age , metallicity , stellar birth - rate ( i.e. star formation history , initial mass function and the amount of formed stars ) of the system . \n although evolutionary synthesis models are powerful , it is necessary to take into account that :    * the transformation between the contribution of stellar classes and the associated physical parameters requires some a priori hypotheses : a set of atmosphere models , evolutionary tracks and defined star formation properties ( i.e. stellar birth rate ) . \n * there are different evolutionary conditions that result in the same integrated spectra , so the physical parameters obtained from the analysis of observations are not necessarily unique . \n these a priori hypotheses , together with the computational algorithms and approximations used by different synthesis codes , define the range of use ( i.e. characterize ) of the results . \n they are also the principal source of systematic errors in model computations . on the other hand \n , the degeneracy of the possible solutions produces an intrinsic precision loss in any fit of observational data and theoretical models : the best - fit solutions are not necessarily the correct ones and the distribution of the goodness of fit is also needed for a correct interpretation of the observed data . in order to analyze these issues in detail , \n we need to understand what a synthesis model is . \n the first step needed to evaluate systematic errors , dispersion and the range of application in population synthesis models is to understand how synthesis models work . the main result of synthesis models is the luminosity due to an ensemble of @xmath0 individual stars , each with a given luminosity , @xmath1 . \n the total luminosity of the ensemble is :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the _ estimation of the mean _ luminosity of an individual star . \n however , in a system where individual stars are not resolved , we can not perform such a sum , since we do not know the individual @xmath1 values . in this case \n , we can obtain the total luminosity as the composition of different stellar populations ( or different stellar types ) . \n if we assume that a given stellar type @xmath4 _ can be represented _ by a luminosity @xmath5 and we have some rules that give us the proportion @xmath6 between different stellar types for different physical parameters ( @xmath7 $ ] ) , then    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the _ \n mean _ ( or average ) luminosity of an average star that represents the ensemble . \n note that this mean luminosity is not necessarily the luminosity of any _ real _ star , but it is a description of an underlying probability distribution of the possibles luminosities of real stars in the ensemble . as a trivial example , remember the half - alive half - dead schrdinger s cat solution in quantum mechanics . \n although eq . \n [ eq : ltot ] and eq . \n [ eq : lssp ] look similar , they do not provide the same quantity : the first case is the _ actual _ integrated luminosity of a given cluster and the second case is the _ \n integrated luminosity of all the possible clusters with @xmath0 stars and in the same evolutionary conditions . \n note also that the problem in population synthesis is not the classical statistical one of estimating @xmath10 , but the inverse one : obtaining the _ possible _ theoretical @xmath10 values compatible with the observed integrated luminosity @xmath11 . \n so , it is necessary to use the complete distribution of theoretical integrated luminosities rather than its mean value @xmath12 . \n this distribution provides a _ \n metric for goodness - of - fit _ to stellar population studies .     transformed into stars , with a given metallicity and a given age . ]     transformed into stars , with a given metallicity and a wide range of ages . ]    as an illustration of the effects of this intrinsic dispersion , we show in fig . \n [ fig : sspmean ] the 90% confidence interval of the integrated luminosity of a stellar cluster with @xmath13 transformed into stars for a given stellar birth rate , metallicity and age . \n it represents the integrated spectrum of _ all _ possible clusters with this number of stars , and evolutionary conditions . \n [ fig : sspvariance ] show the mean spectrum of a cluster with similar conditions but different ages . \n the 90% confidence interval in fig . \n [ fig : sspmean ] , with a single age , covers all the region defined by the mean values of the spectra at different ages . \n any fit of a real spectrum of such a cluster would produce a very precise result for the age , but the accuracy of this fit can not be known if the underlying probability distributions of integrated luminosities at different ages are not taken into account . \n we refer to @xcite for a more extensive analysis of the probabilistic formulation of population synthesis and @xcite for a more complete description about the metrics for goodness of fit . \n once the origin of the intrinsic dispersion of population synthesis models has been described , we are going to discuss the sources of systematic errors and how to take advantage of the ivoa characterization data model to define the region of application of synthesis models in its parameter space . \n we refer to @xcite for a more complete review on the systematic errors .    in the following \n , we will only consider the systematic errors related to stellar population synthesis computations itself , assuming that the systematic errors of the inputs are known . \n the main source of systematic errors are :    1 . \n atmosphere libraries @xmath5 : systematic errors in atmosphere libraries mainly depend on how realistic our assumption about the classification of stars in the different stellar types are ( see garca - vargas et al . \n contribution in these proceedings ) . \n such an evaluation must be implemented by synthesis models makers . \n + in addition to the systematic errors , the range of application of synthesis models depends in the coverage on the parameter space ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , metallicity , ... ) , that is the characterization of the library in this parameter space . \n tracks / isochrones and their combination with the star formation history @xmath16 : in the case of synthesis models , the shape of isochrones and the _ density _ of stars along the isochrone must fit observational data . \n small variations in these densities can produce big differences in the models . \n hence , it is crucial to know the uncertainties in the evolutionary tracks / isochrones used to evaluate the systematic error in synthesis models . currently , there are different groups working on the evaluation of systematic errors in evolutionary tracks , like deglinnocenti et al . and bressan et al . \n + additionally , since synthesis models describe the whole population , they also need to take into account evolutionary phases that are included in standard evolutionary tracks , like pre - main sequence evolution , final evolutionary stages like sn or cooling white dwarfs , etc . in general , synthesis models \n makers combine tracks of different groups to obtain a good coverage in evolutionary phases , but in doing so , they include a potential source of error due to different physics used in track computations \n . the evaluation of the associated systematic errors and the coverage of the models results due to these effects must be implemented by synthesis models makers . \n synthesis models algorithms : the final issue is the algorithms used in the model . the main problem is how to combine the different coverage and sampling ( support and precision respectively , following the characterization data model ) of the atmosphere libraries and isochrones in the @xmath17 plane ( see fig . [ \n fig : ivoa - cdm ] ) . in some cases , it is necessary to extrapolate the behavior of atmosphere libraries to regions not covered by the libraries . \n in addition , there are also differences in how the correspondence of the points in the isochrones and in the atmosphere libraries is done , ranging from how the libraries are interpolated to how the closest model to the given isochrone point is chosen . \n although the characterization of synthesis models is a task under development , it is currently possible to define its range of application by comparing the coverage of isochrones and atmosphere libraries and using the ivoa characterization data model for this task \n . it will not be the final solution of the problem of coverage , but it will enormously help towards the use of synthesis models in their correct range of application . \n synthesis models , as any other theoretical model , are affected by systematic errors . \n although the evaluation of such errors is a difficult task that only can be performed by synthesis models makers , the current ivoa description of spectrum data model allows to add these errors to the output .    in the case of statistical errors , the spectral data model does not apply directly to theoretical results since the goal of statistics is inferring the underlying distribution from which the data have been drawn , which is assumed to be known in the computation of theoretical models . \n however , the _ staterror _ box in the current spectral data model can be used to describe the _ intrinsic dispersion _ of theoretical models . \n the dispersion of synthesis models , although not recognized as such , is computed by several codes under the label of surface brightness fluctuations , so this piece of information is already available . \n finally , a proper characterization of isochrones and atmosphere libraries coverage allows to obtain a realistic characterization of synthesis models , and its range of application . \n this research has made use of the spanish virtual observatory supported by the spanish mcyt through grants aya2005 - 04286 and aya2005 - 24102-e . \n it has also been supported by the spanish mcyt through the project aya2004 - 02703 . \n mc is supported by a _ \n ramn y cajal _ fellowship .", "StartTimeOffset": 1295747268756, "RequestID": "c6871b569295edd1533017e8c7a1f87aed017793", "TotalTokens": 3006}

optical applications mentioned above , the field parallel to an atomic dipole has to be maximized . in these cases , \n the dipole axis is given by the quantization axis of the scenario at hand . in a classical sense , \n the term dipole axis designates the direction from which the polar angle @xmath0 is measured that parameterizes the angular dipole radiation patterns ( see also fig . [ \n fig : coords ] ) . \n however , one may also think of applications in which no particular emitter or source is present at the focus but one wants to maximize the electric field vector that points into a certain direction . \n this field vector can be thought of as being parallel to some imagined dipole moment . \n thus , we will adopt the terminology of ref . \n @xcite and often speak of virtual dipoles , i.e. , dipoles that _ would _ \n produce a certain kind of radiation pattern but are not present in reality . \n the term solid angle usually designates the integral over the covered polar angle and the covered azimuthal angle . here \n , we use this term in a slightly different context . \n it designates the covered solid angle weighted by a certain dipole emission pattern : @xmath1 , with @xmath2 for a linear dipole or @xmath3 for a circular dipole  @xcite , respectively . \n thus , the maximum achievable , weighted solid angle is @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 in the usual sense . \n we now derive an analytic expression that highlights the influence of the covered solid angle . \n the electro - magnetic field can be decomposed into its different multipole components . \n this has been exploited in ref . \n @xcite to calculate the field in the focal region for a given input field . \n however , since we are only interested in the field at the focus , which we take to coincide with the origin of our coordinate system , we only need to take care of the dipole components . \n furthermore , it has already been pointed out in ref . \n @xcite that each kind of dipole radiation creates predominantly its respective state of polarization at the focus / origin . \n this is exactly true for dipoles oriented along the optical axis of the focusing system . \n therefore , it is obvious that one only needs to create the radiation pattern of a single kind of dipole for most practical cases .    in order to calculate the ( time independent ) field in the focus , we use the debye - integral in the form given in ref . \n @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field on the focal sphere for a focal length @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath10 the wavelength of the light to be focused . \n furthermore , a term @xmath11 has already been dropped since we treat only the case @xmath12 . \n if only a single kind of dipole radiation is incident onto the focus , the field on the focal sphere can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a proportionality factor and @xmath15 is the polarization vector of dipole radiation in the far field with @xmath16 for a linear or circular dipole , respectively . \n the polarization vectors in spherical coordinates are given by @xcite @xmath17 and @xmath18\\mathbf{e}_\\vartheta   + [ \\pm i\\cos\\varphi - \\sin\\varphi]\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi)\\ ] ] with @xmath19 being the polar and azimuthal unit vectors . \n next , we require that independent of the covered solid angle the power @xmath20 incident onto the focus is a constant ( this would correspond to the case of , e.g. , a single photon that is focussed with lenses of different numerical aperture but always covers the whole lens cross section ) . \n the total power radiated through the surface of the focal sphere can be written as @xmath21 where the integration limits are given by the intervals of the azimuthal angle and the polar angle covered by the incident light . \n the above expression is solved for @xmath14 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the solid angle weighted by the dipole radiation pattern : @xmath24_{\\vartheta_1}^{\\vartheta_2 } \\cdot ( \\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)\\ ] ] for a linear dipole and @xmath25_{\\vartheta_1}^{\\vartheta_2 } \\cdot ( \\varphi_2-\\varphi_1)\\ ] ] for a circular dipole .    inserting the corresponding polarization vector @xmath15 and the factor @xmath14 into eq . \n [ eq : debye ] and performing the integration for a linear dipole as well as for circular dipoles , one obtains a general relation for the field component parallel to the virtual dipole : @xmath26 this emphasizes that in order to maximize the focal field component parallel to a given virtual dipole one has to ( i ) put as much of the incident power as possible into the corresponding dipole mode and ( ii ) maximize the solid angle covered by the incident radiation . \n it should be pointed out that the resulting field strength does not depend on the dipole type . \n we note that for full solid angle illumination the field given by eq . \n [ eq : focusfield ] delivers exactly the maximum possible electric energy density given by bassett @xcite . \n furthermore , eq . [ eq : focusfield ] constitutes the generalization of eqs . \n 8 and 10 of ref . \n @xcite , where the case of a linear dipole oriented along the optical axis of an objective obeying the sine condition is treated . \n however , the connection to dipole radiation was not established there . \n next , we want to derive the ideal radiation patterns incident onto the focusing device which are transformed into a dipole wave that moves towards the focus . for all devices treated here \n , we assume that they operate perfectly , i.e. , the wave incident onto the focus is assumed to have a uniform phase after reflection / refraction off the focusing device ( see also ref . \n @xcite ) . for example , a parabolic mirror might exhibit ( small ) deviations from the perfect parabolic shape . \n furthermore , the phase shift upon reflection is different for different angles of incidence . \n we presuppose that such effects are compensated for by , e.g. , appropriate correcting elements . \n the production of such elements and the measurement of imperfections might turn out to be a challenging but feasible experimental task @xcite .    the method is simply to start with a dipole wave which virtually emerges from the focus and trace it back through the optical element under consideration . \n we have chosen to formulate the ideal radiation patterns in terms of irradiances instead of field vectors , since the former quantity is the one usually measured in an experiment . \n furthermore , in the derivation of the apodization factors carried out below , energy conservation considerations require the use of irradiances and radiant intensities anyway . \n the ideal vectors fields can be constructed from the irradiance patterns and the polarization patterns derived in the next section . \n relation of the angles @xmath27 and @xmath0 to the cartesian coordinates : ( a ) dipole / quantization axis ( gray arrow ) parallel to the optical axis ; ( b ) dipole / quantization axis perpendicular to the optical axis . ] \n the derivation of the intensity patterns is pursued in the same way as it was done in ref . \n @xcite for a parabolic mirror and a linear dipole oriented parallel to the optical axis of the mirror . \n we designate by @xmath27 the angle that is enclosed by the optical axis of the focusing element and the propagation direction of a single ray which hits the optical element at a distance @xmath28 from the optical axis . here , we chose the optical axis to coincide with the @xmath29-axis ( cf . \n [ fig : coords ] ) . \n energy conservation demands that  @xcite @xmath30 which delivers @xmath31 with @xmath32 being an apodization factor . \n @xmath33 is the radiant intensity , i.e. , the light power emitted into an infinitesimal solid angle . \n @xmath34 is the irradiance of the incident plane wave , i.e. , the light power incident onto an infinitesimal surface area .    in what follows \n , we express the apodization factor as a function of the cartesian coordinates @xmath35 in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis : @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in the case of a parabolic mirror \n , @xmath27 is given through the relation @xcite @xmath38 which with the help of some algebra leads to @xmath39 for an aplanatic lens that fulfills the sine condition , i.e. , a lens where the refracted rays of same phase seem to emerge from a spherical surface around the focus , one has @xmath40 resulting in @xmath41 as a third focusing element , we consider an ideal thin lens , i.e. , a lens for which the refracted rays seem to emerge from a plane perpendicular to the optical axis . \n a practical realization of such a thin lens would be an idealized diffractive optical lens . \n one has @xmath42 which delivers @xmath43    next , for every point @xmath44 in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis we determine @xmath0 . \n the radiant intensity along this direction is given by the angular dipole radiation pattern @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a proportionality constant . \n finally , @xmath48 is also expressed in terms of @xmath35 and multiplied with the apodization factor @xmath49 yielding the irradiance @xmath50 .     ideal irradiance distributions for dipoles oriented parallel to the optical axis of the focusing device : ( a ) parabolic mirror , ( b ) aplanatic lens fulfilling the sine condition , ( c ) ideal thin lens \n . solid ( dashed ) lines denote the irradiance for a linear ( circular ) dipole radiation pattern . ]    if the dipole is oriented parallel to the optical axis , @xmath27 coincides with @xmath0 ( see fig . [ \n fig : coords]a ) . \n hence , the ideal irradiation is rotationally symmetric with respect to the optical axis and the angular dipole emission patterns given above can be written as @xmath51 . \n using eqs . \n [ eq : angle_pm ] , [ eq : angle_sc ] and [ eq : angle_te ] , respectively , and applying several trigonometric relations one obtains the ideal irradiance distributions . \n they are summarized in tab . \n [ tab : para ] and plotted in fig . \n [ fig : para ] . we have also introduced normalized coordinates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 . \n all remaining dimensional quantities have been lumped into a proportionality constant @xmath55 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one could calculate the overlaps also in the case of a lens obeying the sine condition . \n however , due to the divergence of the ideal irradiance values towards the boundary of the lens aperture the calculation of the overlap with the simple modes discussed above does not appear to be meaningful . \n similar arguments apply when the virtual dipole is oriented orthogonal to the optical axis . since the ideal irradiance patterns have no rotational symmetry , the overlaps will always be smaller than their counterparts for the dipole axis being parallel to the optical axis . \n we have derived the ideal radiation patterns with which one achieves the maximum possible field strengths for several focusing devices . besides using these radiation patterns , it is of utmost importance to maximize the covered solid angle , as it is shown by eqs . \n [ eq : focusfield ] and [ eq : focusfield_ovl ] . \n thus , the maximum possible electric field strength is achieved by covering the full solid angle . \n also , the maximum possible effect in the interaction of light with single atoms will also only be found for full solid angle coverage , since scattering as well as absorption of photons is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude at the location of the atom  @xcite . \n this finding is in contrast to the statements made in other publications , where it was claimed that the power scattered by a single atom is already maximized for half solid angle illumination @xcite . according with the papers of van enk and kimble @xcite , we want to state once more that for optimum interaction of light with single atoms one has to shape the radiation incident onto the atom to resemble an electric dipole wave .", "StartTimeOffset": 1309316686356, "RequestID": "faefb72574e4f1b890a7378cd58f6836b707a5e8", "TotalTokens": 3725}
{"ContextTokens": 4085, "GeneratedTokens": 76, "SynthesizedBody": "quark masses are fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) and thus it is desirable to determine their numerical values with the highest possible precision . in order to do so \n it is necessary to fix a renormalisation scheme which defines the quark mass . \n often physical observables are expressed through some `` short distance '' mass  @xcite to obtain predictions which are free of the renormalon problem . \n to do so , one frequently needs the relation between the on - shell and the @xmath0 mass . \n many authors contributed to the latter task  @xcite . in this contribution \n we present the recently published calculation  @xcite , where we have included the effect of a second nonzero quark mass to the relation between the quarks in those two schemes at the three loop level . after having reduced the problem to the calculation of master integrals we use two different ways to solve them , namely the differential equation and the mellin - barnes method . from the phenomenological point of view \n this result is important for the bottom - quark including effects from virtual charm - quarks . as a byproduct \n we also obtain the corresponding contribution to the wave function renormalisation constant . \n introducing the decomposition of the quark self - energy @xmath1 we can express the renormalisation constants , which are defined through @xmath2 by  @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 is the quark field renormalised in the on - shell scheme with mass @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the on - shell mass and bare quantities are denoted by a subscript 0 . \n thus , to obtain @xmath7 one only needs to calculate @xmath8 for @xmath9 . to calculate @xmath10 , \n one has to compute the first derivative of the self - energy diagrams . \n the mass renormalisation is taken into account iteratively by calculating one- and two - loop diagrams with zero - momentum insertions .    in the case of the mass renormalisation \n it is convenient to consider the ratio between the on - shell and @xmath11 renormalisation constants @xmath12 which is finite . \n here we have introduced the renormalisation dependent @xmath11-mass @xmath13 . \n in contrast to @xmath7 the wave function renormalisation constant contains next to ultraviolet also infrared divergences . \n thus it is not possible to construct a finite quantity by considering the ratio between the on - shell and @xmath11 renormalisation constant . \n = 1    in order to compute the on shell self energy we use qgraf  @xcite to generate the feynman diagrams and the various topologies are identified with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite . in a next step \n the reduction of the various functions to so - called master integrals ( mi s ) has to be achieved . \n for this step we use the so - called laporta method  @xcite which reduces the three - loop integrals to 26 mi s . \n we use the implementation of laporta s algorithm in the program crusher  @xcite . \n it is written in c++ and uses ginac  @xcite for simple manipulations like taking derivatives of polynomial quantities . in the practical implementation of the laporta algorithm one of the most time - consuming operations \n is the simplification of the coefficients appearing in front of the individual integrals . \n this task is performed with the help of fermat  @xcite where a special interface has been used ( see ref . \n the main features of the implementation are the automated generation of the integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite , a complete symmetrisation of the diagrams and the possibility to use multiprocessor environments .    in fig . \n [ fig::mi ] a graphical representation of the master integrals can be found . as indicated in the figure , \n many topologies contain more than one master integral . \n we have chosen two independent ways to compute the @xmath14-expansion of the master integrals . \n the first one relies on the differential equation method  @xcite . with this method \n we were able to evaluate all but four master integrals in analytic form . with the help of our second method , based on the mellin - barnes technique ( see , e.g. , ref . \n @xcite ) we can get numerical results for all master integrals . \n here we have used the mathematica package mb.m  @xcite . \n first we set up differential equations in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the second nonzero quark mass , for each of the individual integrals . \n each equation will contain the master integral itself and integrals belonging to the corresponding topology . \n the latter can again be reduced to the set of master integrals . \n for all the topologies which contain only one master integral ( e.g. all six - propagator integrals in fig . \n [ fig::mi ] ) this gives a \n simple  equation whereas for the other topologies we get two or three coupled equations , respectively . in the next step \n we expand the differential equations in @xmath14 . choosing an appropriate basis for the master integrals , all equations decouple order by order in @xmath14 . \n we can now solve for all integrals by repeated use of euler s variation of the constant method . \n the initial conditions we need are all known from the literature  @xcite . \n we were able to get analytical results for all master integrals in terms of harmonic polylogarithms ( hpl s  @xcite ) up to order @xmath17 . \n unfortunately we were not yet able to get analytical results in higher orders in @xmath14 for the four integrals belonging to the two topologies depicted as the leftmost ones in the second row of fig . \n [ fig::mi ] . for all other integrals we provide analytical results up to the order we need in our calculation . to calculate the mi s in terms of hpl s \n it is necessary that the ( pseudo)poles in the corresponding differential equations are all of the form @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , were these poles can occur up to arbitrary order . \n this is the case in all topologies except for the ones mentioned above . \n we have not found a proper change of variables to bring the differential equation into this form . as a consequence we only managed to integrate the integrals in these topologies up to the order @xmath17 . \n the remaining parts can e.g. be integrated numerically with mathematica .    to evaluate our results numerically and for general algebraic manipulations of terms involving hpl s we use the mathematica package hpl  @xcite . \n the mellin - barnes method as a tool for the evaluation of feynman integrals has become very popular in the recent years . \n the basic formula is @xcite @xmath21 which transforms a propagator like term into a complex contour integral . \n a common recipe to evaluate feynman integrals is the following : first one introduces feynman parameters for a loop variable . \n then one can perform the corresponding momentum integration . \n after that one applies formula ( [ eq::mb - basic ] ) to the denominators containing the feynman parameters . finally the feynman parameters can be integrated yielding the mellin - barnes representation of the original integral \n . this procedure has recently been automatised @xcite . \n the mellin - barnes integration is to be performed along a contour which reaches from @xmath22 to @xmath23 on the imaginary axis with indentations such that the poles of @xmath24 and those of @xmath25 are separated by the contour . \n mellin - barnes integrals usually have singularities for certain values of their parameters . \n if there are for example gamma functions of the form @xmath26 , it is not possible to find an appropriate integration contour when @xmath27 . \n the integral is therefore singular in @xmath14 and this is how uv poles of feynman integrals manifest themselves in their mellin - barnes representation . \n one has thus to regularise the integral , that is , identify the @xmath14 poles . \n this can be done by shifting the integration contour using the residue theorem . \n prescriptions to do so have been given in refs . \n @xcite and @xcite , the latter has been automatised , see refs . \n @xcite . \n finally the regularised integrals can be expanded in @xmath14 and evaluated by numerical integration , which is also implemented in the package mb.m @xcite , or by application of the residue theorem and summing up the residues . \n depending on the dimension of the integrals and the complexity of the integrand this can be done numerically or analytically .    to calculate the master integrals for this work \n we first simplified the mellin - barnes integrals by inserting the representations of known subtopologies . \n the regularisation has been done partly using mb.m and the approach of ref . \n @xcite . one- and two - dimensional mb - integrals were calculated via their sum representation , higher dimensional integrals using mb.m . \n the 4-line integrals can all be represented as mellin - barnes - integrals of maximal dimension 1 , which can be evaluated as single sums . \n for the 5 line master integrals we find representations of dimension 2 to 5 . \n the integrals with 6 lines have 3 to 5 dimensional representations . \n we find good agreement with the results obtained from the differential equation method . \n inserting the results for the master integrals into the final result we observe large numerical cancellations near @xmath28 between the contributions originating from different master integrals . on the other hand \n , the expansion for @xmath29 converges very fast , which is relevant for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . \n for this reason we decided to derive an expansion of our result including eighth order terms . \n the coefficients that could not be obtained analytically can be evaluated numerically from their mellin - barnes - representation , which is in our case at most two - dimensional . \n as an application of our result we want to discuss the charm quark effects in the relations between the pole , the @xmath11 and the @xmath32 quark mass . \n for illustration we use @xmath33  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the relation between the on - shell and the @xmath11 mass leads to @xmath37 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , ,    \\label{eq::mosmms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tree - level , one- , two- and three - loop results are shown separately . \n the contributions from the charm quark mass which vanish for @xmath38 are marked by a subscript @xmath39 . \n one observes that the higher order contributions are significant . \n in particular , the two - loop charm quark effects amount to 9  mev and the three - loop ones to 18  mev . \n a similar bad convergence is observed in the relation between the @xmath32 mass  @xcite @xmath40 and the pole mass @xmath41 . for @xmath42  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath43 and @xmath44 it is given by @xmath45 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , . \n \\label{eq::m1smos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the relation between the @xmath32 and the @xmath11 quark mass is much better behaved as can be seen in the following example where we have chosen @xmath46  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , . \n \\label{eq::mmsm1s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two - loop charm effects amount to only 4.7  mev and three - loop ones to 5.1  mev . \n we want to mention that in case only the linear approximation  @xcite of the charm quark mass effects is used the corresponding three - loop results in eqs . \n ( [ eq::mosmms ] ) and  ( [ eq::mmsm1s ] ) read @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . \n we would like to thank andrey grozin and matthias steinhauser for a fruitful collaboration on this subject . \n this work was supported the dfg through sfb / tr  9 . \n m.  beneke , phys . \n b * 434 * ( 1998 ) 115 [ arxiv : hep -

order methods to achieve an @xmath25-solution for several classes of convex problems ( see table [ t.complexity ] ) . \n if a first - order scheme attains the worst - case complexity of a class of problems , it is called optimal . \n a special feature of these methods is that the corresponding complexity does not depend explicitly on the problem dimension . from practical point of view , studying the effect of an uniform boundedness of the complexity is very attractive and such methods are highly recommended when the prescribed accuracy @xmath25 is not too small , whereas the dimension of problem is considerably large . \n [ t.complexity ]    .list of the best known complexities of first - order methods for several classes of problems with respect to levels of smoothness and convexity ( cf . \n @xcite ) [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ] \n in this paper , we propose several novel ( sub)gradient methods for solving large - scale convex composite minimization . \n more precisely , we give two estimation sequences approximating the objective function with some local and global information of the objective . for each of the estimation sequences , we give two iterative schemes attaining the optimal complexities for smooth , nonsmooth , weakly smooth , and smooth strongly convex problems . \n these schemes are optimal up to a logarithmic factors for nonsmooth strongly convex problems , and for weakly smooth strongly convex problems they attain a much better complexity than the complexity for weakly smooth convex problems . for each estimation sequence , \n the first scheme needs to know about the level of smoothness and the hlder constant , while the second one is parameter - free ( except for the strong convexity parameter which we set zero if it is not available ) at the price of applying a backtracking line search . \n we then consider solutions of the auxiliary problems appearing in these four schemes and study the important cases appearing in applications that can be solved efficiently either in a closed form or by a simple iterative scheme . considering some applicationsin the fields of sparse optimization and machine learning , we report numerical results showing the encouraging behavior of the proposed schemes . + * acknowledgement . \n * i would like to thank arnold neumaier for his useful comments on this paper . \n golub , t. , slonim , d. , tamayo , p. , huard , c. , gaasenbeek , m. , mesirov , j. , coller , h. , loh , m. , downing , j. , caligiuri , m. : molecular classification of cancer : class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring , science 286 , 531536 ( 1999 )                            nesterov , y. : a method of solving a convex programming problem with convergence rate @xmath29 , doklady an sssr ( in russian ) , 269 ( 1983 ) , 543547 . \n english translation : soviet math . dokl . \n , * 27 * , 372376 ( 1983 )", "StartTimeOffset": 1318714849128, "RequestID": "452e167c92696d1d925cf73eb9fca69bc6bdfa9f", "TotalTokens": 1485}

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) determined from uv extinction and ir emission measurements . \n this is consistent with the picture that the smc tail has been recently stripped from the smc body during a tidal encounter @xcite and evidence that the gas and dust in the smc tail have not been stripped from the lmc or are due to infalling material from the inter - galactic medium . looking more closely , our infrared measured smc tail gas - to - dust ratio is higher than the smc body gas - to - dust ratio of 7@xmath18 mw @xcite that was determined using ir emission measurements and a similar method . \n in addition , the smc gas - to - dust ratio of 12@xmath18 mw is higher than the expected value from of 5 - 8@xmath18 mw @xcite for the 1/5 - 1/8 solar metallicity of the smc tail region @xcite . this may indicate there has been destruction of the dust in the smc tail or that there is colder dust that is not detected by the mips 160  observations . \n possible plausible dust destruction mechanisms include a harder radiation field due to less dust shielding and shocks due to the tidal interaction @xcite . \n two cluster regions are detected in the mips observations indicating the presence of young , embedded star formation . \n the local gas - to - dust ratio was measured for these two regions to be 2.54.4@xmath18 mw . \n these ratios are lower than the gas - to - dust ratio measured for the entire smc tail ( 12@xmath18 mw ) and lower than that expected for the metallicity of the smc tail ( 5 - 8@xmath18 mw ) . \n this suggests there has been dust formation and/or a significant amount of ionized gas is present in these regions . as both regions harbor known hii regions \n @xcite , the latter is clearly part of the answer . \n this letter presents the detection of dust in the smc tail and a preliminary analysis of its dust - to - gas ratio \n . a more complete analysis of the dust in the whole smc ( bar , wing , and tail ) will be presented by bot et al . \n ( in prep . ) . \n this work is based on observations made with the _ \n spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through a contract issued by jpl / caltech to space telescope science institute .", "StartTimeOffset": 1327379700630, "RequestID": "7f413392ec9328bc8f45f97ddc78fb2888acfd2c", "TotalTokens": 3721}

including thermoelastic dissipation , surface dissipation and dissipation due to lattice defects@xcite . for fused silica fibers with diameter less than a few mm , \n the dissipation in the surface is much more important than losses in the bulk material ; in this regime the dissipation decreases with increasing the diameter of the fiber  @xcite . \n the surface loss in fused silica has not been fully explained by any single loss mechanism , although hypotheses have been proposed for several contributing processes , including adsorbed water @xcite , surface bond oscillations @xcite , microcracking @xcite , and absorbed alkali molecules@xcite . \n a vacuum annealing treatment was shown by numata and collaborators to improve the quality factors of fused silica for all resonance frequencies  @xcite . \n annealing in air also improves the quality factor , but can cause surface defects and increase surface losses  @xcite .    in the work presented here , we measured the quality factor of the transverse vibrations of fused silica rods , with large diameters ( up to 12 mm ) to reduce dissipation from the surface . \n we were especially interested in exploring the effects of an annealing treatment , which we performed in an argon atmosphere . \n the measurement method was the same as with previous experiments performed in our laboratory at syracuse university  @xcite . \n the quality factor of the rod was measured using the ringdown method . \n the sample was suspended in a vacuum chamber by an all silica isolation chain of fine fibers and massive isolation bobs , as shown in fig . \n [ setup ] . \n our samples were made of suprasil  2 , suprasil  312 and suprasil  312  sv fused silica from heraeus amersil , inc . \n the material was supplied as cylindrical rods about 20 mm in diameter . \n each of our samples was made in the syracuse university glass shop using a glass lathe and a natural gas flame . \n the section of the sample that was to be measured was drawn to the required diameter and length from the original material . \n the length of the measurement rod for all samples was between 24 and 29  cm ; diameters were 3  mm , 8  mm or 12  mm . \n the end result of the fabrication process was a structure made from one piece of material , consisting of the measurement rod , an isolation bob 10  cm in length and 20  mm in diameter and a smoothly tapering section between these two rods @xmath2 to @xmath3  cm in length . \n the process of preparing the sample took about 2  hours . \n the subsequent annealing treatment was performed in a continuous flow of high purity argon gas to remove any expelled impurities and prevent the adsorption of impurities . \n samples were heat treated for 10  days : 3  days were devoted to slowly heating the sample , which was then held at the annealing temperature of 950  @xmath4c for 1  day . \n finally , the sample was cooled over 6  days to room temperature . \n we chose the long annealing period and long cooling period in order to decrease internal density fluctuations that could be responsible for additional dissipation . \n as shown in papers  @xcite , annealed silica samples have decreased levels of density fluctuations , as shown by a lower level of rayleigh scattering . \n the rayleigh scattering intensity is also lower in slowly cooled samples , for a given annealing temperature . \n flexural modes of the measurement rod were excited by the gradient of an applied electric field oscillating at the resonance frequency . \n the source of electric field was a comb capacitor placed near the end of the rod . \n after excitation the capacitor was grounded and the mode was allowed to ring down . \n we used the shadow method for measurement of the vibration of the sample . \n a light beam from a diode laser cast a shadow of the sample on a split photodiode . \n the photocurrents from the two halves of the detector were fed through a differential amplifier , whose output in turn went to a bandpass filter , a lock - in amplifier and computer data acquisition system . \n the signal of the detector contains the spectral component corresponding to the oscillation of the sample . for extraction of the amplitude of the oscillation \n , we applied a reference sinusoidal signal to the lock - in amplifier , with frequency slightly offset from that of the resonance . \n hence , our data was a damped time series with frequency @xmath5 hz . \n the amplitude decay time @xmath6 was fitted from the recorded time series . \n the quality factor was calculated using the formula @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mode frequency . \n the time of each measurement was about 5  @xmath6 , ranging for different modes from 3 hours to 8 days . \n all measurements were made at room temperature , at a working pressure of @xmath9  torr . \n for each sample , we measured the quality factor of three or four modes . \n the quality factor of each mode was measured three times ; repeated results had a difference not higher than  @xmath10 . \n the statistical error of the fits was less than  @xmath11 . \n .dissipation of fused silica samples before and after annealing . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 lists the minimum measured loss level for each sample before and after annealing . these loss levels are plotted against the samples volume - to - surface ratio in fig .  [ graph ] . \n the line drawn in the figure was taken from the phenomenological model of gretarsson and harry  @xcite for suprasil  2 fused silica fibers with diameter less than about 1 mm . \n the line shows the scaling of dissipation expected if it were limited by surface losses , without significant levels of bulk losses in the material . \n every data point in the figure is the smallest dissipation measured for each sample ; usually this is seen in the second resonant mode . \n we have not fitted the thermoelastic losses for our samples , because thermoelastic losses are negligibly low for samples of the diameters we used in the flexural modes that we measured . \n the highest quality factor was obtained for an annealed sample  8 mm in diameter produced from suprasil  312 . before annealing the sample \n had the best quality factor ( @xmath12 ) of any unannealed sample . \n this sample was accidentally broken and then it was fixed ( we lost about 5 cm length at the end of the sample ) . \n the best @xmath1 after the repair was @xmath13 . \n the best value for the annealed sample was @xmath14 ( the loss angle @xmath15 ) at a resonant frequency of 384  hz . \n note that we obtained rather different results with different brands of fused silica . \n all of our best results were obtained with suprasil  312 . \n samples of 312  sv showed substantially improved @xmath1 after annealing , but even then the quality factors were poorer than unannealed suprasil  312 . \n we found the strongest effects from annealing in our thickest samples . \n our 8 and 12  mm samples showed @xmath1 improvement of order a factor of 2 , while our thinnest sample showed only a small improvement . \n this last observation is similar to what was seen by the moscow group  @xcite . \n we can compare our results with the @xmath1 measured by numata and collaborators for modes in the range 30 to 100  khz on a fused silica cylinder sample  @xcite . \n these results for suprasil  312 show frequency - dependent @xmath1s , with @xmath1 decreasing with increasing frequency . \n ( comparison of the pattern of @xmath1s to the mode shapes allowed a model to be made of contributions from bulk losses , surface losses , and suspension losses . ) \n notably , the @xmath1 values improved after annealing . \n samples were annealed in a vacuum furnace for 24  hours at 980  @xmath4c . \n the best @xmath1 from these experiment was @xmath16 before annealing ( improving after annealing to @xmath17 ) , at a frequency of about 33  khz . \n our @xmath1 at lower frequencies is much higher , but fits with the frequency dependence seen in the numata experiments . \n significant differences in values of the quality factors for samples from different material were noted in numata s work . \n willems  @xcite has measured the quality factor of many modes of large unannealed samples of suprasil 312 and 311sv . \n the gravest mode of the 312 sample had a @xmath1 of 120 million ( at a frequency of 11 khz ) , about 50% better than the best @xmath1 seen in our unannealed samples . \n other modes had poorer @xmath1 , but there were many with @xmath1 within a factor of 4 of the best . \n the best @xmath1 of the 311sv sample was 50 million , again about 50% better than the best @xmath1 seen in our unannealed 311sv samples . \n the higher frequency modes of the two samples had quite comparable quality factors . \n willems argues that this last fact demonstrates that the two samples have , in fact , similar dissipation levels overall , but it is also possible that the gap in best @xmath1 is consistent with differences between 312 and 312 sv like those seen in our own work . \n further study will be required to untangle the comparison between 312 and 312sv .    in fig . \n [ graph ] we drew the phenomenological law from gretarsson and harry  @xcite for comparison with the results of our measurements . \n note that very few of our data points fall close to the line . \n ( perhaps this is because our data set is rather heterogeneous ; it includes measurement of annealed and unannealed samples of three different brands of silica . ) \n nevertheless , one can clearly see a trend to higher @xmath1 at larger diameters , in qualitative agreement with the prediction that losses are dominated by surface effects , as opposed to dissipation in the bulk . \n our best result , @xmath14 , shows that the quality factor of fused silica after annealing has reached a value comparable to that of sapphire at room temperature  @xcite . this has led to renewed consideration of fused silica as a possible test mass material for advanced ligo@xcite . \n however , it must be noted that advanced ligo would require silica with the low optical absorbtion of suprasil 312  sv , where mechanical dissipation is not quite as good . \n research on this question is in progress  @xcite . \n we thank john chabot , the glassblower at syracuse university , for his skill and care in drawing the fused silica samples . for useful discussions , \n we thank phil willems , kenji numata , gregg harry , and riccardo desalvo . \n this work was support by syracuse university and by national science foundation grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 1340581267152, "RequestID": "590158e639a21058a2d44d60563ddd34302c8924", "TotalTokens": 2576}

known supersoft x - ray binary in the lmc ( schaeidt  1993 , pakull  1993 ) , are correlated with short - lived optical low states ( pakull  1993 , reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . as first suggested by brian warner \n , the birthday of whom we are celebrating here , at the sss workshop in garching in 1996 , the 3 year macho light curve ( southwell  1996 ) suggests a strong similarity to the vy scl stars . \n vy scl stars are a subclass of nova - like , cataclysmic variables which are bright most of the time , but occasionally drop in brightness by several magnitudes at irregular intervals ( bond 1980 , warner 1995 ) . \n ( 2 ) searching among unusual cataclysmic variables : one possible galactic source , v sagitae , has been suggested by studying the properties of several unusual cataclysmic variables ( patterson  1998 ) . \n steiner & diaz ( 1998 ) note the similarity of @xmath2 other galactic systems to v sge .    in the following \n , i will describe both strategies and review the evidence for transient , luminous supersoft x - ray emission in the two cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) v751 cyg and v sge during their optical low states . \n full details of the correlated x - ray and optical observations of 7   have appeared elsewhere ( greiner  1999 ) , so we only summarize the relevant information here . \n the distinct lightcurve of 0513  and its similarity to vy scl stars led us to decide to monitor the light curves of the known vy scl stars . \n when 7  started to drop in brightness somewhere between 1 march and 11 march 1997 ( fig . \n [ lc751 ] ) we performed a target - of - opportunity rosat hri observation ( 4660 sec ) on 3 june 1997 . a new x - ray source , rx j2052.2 + 4419 , was discovered within 1  of v751 cyg , at a mean count rate of 0.015 cts / s . during a second rosat hri observation on dec . \n 28 , 1997 the count rate and x - ray spectrum are nearly identical to the june values . \n in contrast , 7  was not detected during the rosat all - sky survey on nov . \n 19/20 , 1990 giving a 3@xmath3 upper limit of 0.019 cts / s in the pspc . \n in addition , it was also not detected during a serendipituous pointing on nov . \n 11 , 1992 providing an upper limit of 0.0058 cts / s in the pspc . on both occasions \n 7  was in its optical bright state . \n this suggests an anti - correlation of optical and x - ray intensity in 7 .    a new method ( prestwich  1999 ) to extract reliable spectral information from hri data allowed to craft a response matrix for a given observation . \n fits using this response matrix to all the source photons of v751 cyg show that simple black - body models with kt of a few tens of ev are consistent with the data , whereas higher temperature models ( 0.5 kev ) can be ruled out ( fig . \n [ ufs ] ) . an iue observation performed in 1985 ( during an optical high state ) \n was used to derive the extinction towards 7  based on the broad absorption centered at 2200  : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 = 1.1@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 . \n this implies a distance of the order of 500 pc . with this @xmath6 the x - ray spectral fitting gives @xmath10 ev ( see fig . \n [ ufs ] ) . at this temperature , \n the bolometric luminosity on 3 june 1997 is 6.5@xmath710@xmath11 ( d/500 pc)@xmath12 erg / s . \n thus , during its optical low state , 7  was emitting soft x - rays with a temperature and luminosity which confirm that it is a transient supersoft x - ray source . \n the appearance of 4686   emission in optical spectra taken in sep . \n 1997 also indicates the presence of @xmath1354 ev photons . \n cyg , like the other members of the vy scl star group , accretes at a few times 10@xmath14 yr@xmath1 . \n if the mass of the white dwarf in 7  is small , this may allow nuclear burning , as the high x - ray luminosity suggests . \n the 7  values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are consistent , within the uncertainties of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the relation @xmath19 found for 5 ssb ( van teeseling  1997 ) implying that , if nuclear burning is the correct interpretation of the x - ray flux during the optical low state , then nuclear burning may continue during the optical high state . \n the discovery that 7  is a transient supersoft x - ray source arose from the similarity in the optical light curve of rx j0513.96951 and vy scl stars . \n 0513 ( schaeidt  1993 , pakull  1993 ) shows @xmath204 week optical low states which are accompanied by luminous supersoft x - ray emission ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . \n it is generally assumed that the white dwarf accretes at a rate slightly higher than the burning rate , and thus is in an inflated state during the optical high state . \n changes in the irradiation of the disk caused by the expanding / contracting envelope around the white dwarf have been proposed as explanation for the 1 mag intensity variation ( reinsch  1996 , southwell  1996 ) . \n the explanation of the x - ray / optical variability of 7  could be similar to rx j0513.96951 : variations change both the photospheric radius and the disk spectrum . \n if the white dwarf has a small mass , than photospheric radius expansion is reached at 1@xmath710@xmath21 /yr ( cassisi  1998 ) . \n the explanation for the character of the optical and uv observations is not yet clear , but it seems certain that the illumination of the donor and disk play important roles in determining what we see . if the x - ray source during the optical low state indeed is very luminous one may expect a strong heating effect on the secondary as well as on the accretion disk . \n the heating of the secondary in 7  is probably comparable to that in sss because the illumination depends on the ratio of companion radius and binary separation which is similar in both kind of systems . \n unfortunately , no photometry has been obtained during the optical low state to immediately test for this effect in 7 though it is anyway not expected to produce a strong modulation due to the low orbital inclination . \n the question of the illumination of the accretion disk has to be addressed separately for optical low and high state . \n there is ample evidence in some vy scl stars that during the optical low state the accretion disk has vanished . though we have no direct evidence for this in 7  due to the lack of optical observations , the disk is certainly optically thin thus drastically reducing the efficancy of illumination . in the optical high state \n the illumination depends on whether hydrogen burning stops or whether it continues on an inflated white dwarf at a temperature below the sensitivity range of rosat : if the burning stops then there are no soft x - rays which could be reprocessed . \n if the nuclear burning continues , reprocessing may still not be strong because the amount of reprocessing depends on the size of the accretion disk ( orbital period ) and only for large disks also on the flaring of the disk . \n for v751 cyg \n the disk is so small that any flaring is probably insignificant compared to the angle which the white dwarf subtends with respect to the disk . \n even if flaring were significant , reprocessing of the radiation from the white dwarf will begin to have a dominant effect on the local disk temperature ( king 1997 , knigge & livio 1998 ) if the white dwarf luminosity @xmath22 @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the albedo of the disk surface ) . \n that is , a disk around a 1  white dwarf accreting at 10@xmath25 /yr will be dominated by reprocessing only if the white dwarf temperature is @xmath132@xmath710@xmath26 k @xmath5 17 ev . \n this is seemingly just a value between the temperatures of sss ( 3050 ev ) and v751 cyg ( 15 ev ) . \n thus , one difference of the systems could be that the disk in v751 cyg is not flared and therefore not dominated by reprocessing while the sss disks are flared and dominated by reprocessing and thus are optically much brighter than the vy scl disks . \n it has recently been suggested ( steiner & diaz 1998 ; patterson  1998 ) that v sge ( and possibly also wx cen , v617 sge and ) have properties very similar to ssbs . \n these suggestions are based on the following characteristics , shared by these four stars but rare or even absent among canonical cataclysmic variables : ( 1 ) the presence of both and emission lines , ( 2 ) a @xmath27/h@xmath24 emission line ratio @xmath132 , ( 3 ) rather high absolute magnitudes and very blue colours , and ( 4 ) orbital lightcurves which are characterized by a wide and deep eclipse . \n v  sge has been the target of three dedicated pointed pspc and hri observations ( one of these splits into 3 separate observation intervals ) , and in addition is in the field of view of another pspc observation . \n a detailed comparison of the optical states of v sge and archival rosat observations has shown that during optical bright states , v  sge is a faint hard x - ray source , while during optical faint states ( @xmath28 mag ) , v  sge is a ` supersoft ' x - ray source ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) . \n spectral fitting confirms that v  sge s x - ray properties during its soft x - ray state may be similar to those of supersoft x - ray binaries , although a much lower luminosity can not be excluded . \n the model that has been suggested for 0513cannot explain the observational data of v  sge . \n first , the optical brightness changes of v  sge are very rapid : both the faint-/bright - state transitions as well as the succession of different faint states may occur on timescales of 1day ( compared to the smooth decline of several days in 0513 ) . \n such very rapid changes are only possible if the white dwarf envelope expands and contracts on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale and the mass of the expanding envelope is rather small ( @xmath29 ) . \n such a small envelope mass is difficult to accept for a white dwarf with stable shell burning ( e.g. prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) . \n second , the expected optical eclipse would become deeper when the system becomes brighter , opposite to what has been observed ( patterson  1998 ) . \n it is possible to explain the different optical / x - ray states of v  sge by a variable amount of extended uneclipsed matter , which during the optical bright states contributes significantly to the optical flux and completely absorbes the soft x - ray component ( greiner & teeseling 1998 ) . a simple wind model for the recently observed radio flux density of v  sge implies a mass - loss rate of the order of 10@xmath30/yr ( lockley  1997 ) . with their ( assumed ) terminal velocity of 1500 km / s \n this wind zone is completely opaque for x - rays up to 0.7kev , even if the wind is assumed to be circumbinary instead of arising from one component . \n since the radio measurement has been obtained during optical high state , it supports the above described scenario . \n as shown above , both strategies to search for new sss were successful . \n this is very promising , and opens up the way to use optical observation strategies besides x - ray observations to identify new sss . \n the surprising part of this development is that both , 7  and v sge , are short - period cvs , and if true , their transient supersoft source nature would establish a direct link between classical cvs and canonical sss which typically have orbital periods inthe 0.53 days range . \n for both sources , v751 cyg and v sge , the estimates for their x - ray luminosity ( under reasonable assumptions on @xmath6 ) are @xmath20 10@xmath31 erg / s . \n this is at the lower end of the stable burning region . \n two issues are relevant in this respect : ( 1 ) as for most cvs , the available evidence for vy scl stars suggests that the white dwarfs have a low mass . at these low masses \n the accretion rate necessary for steady - state burning ( consistent with fujimoto 1982 ) is 13@xmath710@xmath25 /yr ( sion & starrfield 1994 , cassisi 1998 ) , and correspondingly the luminosity is lower than the canonical values for sss . \n ( 2 ) even at rates below the steady - state burning level there could be a range where the hydrogen flashes are rather mild . \n a recent study of this parameter space has shown that the luminosity between the flashes remains at the surprisingly high value of @xmath2010%30% of the burning luminosity ( rappaport 1999 ) . \n _ acknowledgement : _ \n i m grateful to the organizers of this symposium for the exciting atmosphere which stimulated many fruitful discussions . \n jg is supported by the german bundesministerium fr bildung , wissenschaft , forschung und technologie ( bmbf / dlr ) under contract no . 50or96098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1358098387944, "RequestID": "9df2f2fee8808397b45aa41ce8310d1beddd1d39", "TotalTokens": 3571}

dependent wavefunction @xmath2 is symmetrical along @xmath57 axis . \n thus in the @xmath57 direction , @xmath67 where the last term equals eq . \n ( [ s ] ) . in this way , \n the electronic polarization @xmath45 gained from bm is , approximately , equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics , i.e. , both of their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are the same . \n figure 3 shows the harmonic spectrum from an ensemble of hydrogen atoms interacting with ilf ( laser confocal parameter @xmath68 mm , gas density @xmath69 atoms/@xmath70 described by a truncated lorentzian in the @xmath71 direction with @xmath72 mm @xcite ) , which has a clear plateau region and cutoff at the @xmath73th order . \n in bm , harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory has even harmonics ( see fig . \n 1 ) , but they are removed in the spectrum associated with an ensemble of atoms ( see fig . \n the reason is that an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center @xcite , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre . here \n we will numerically show that two electron trajectories are enough to get rid of the unphysical even harmonics if the initial positions @xmath32 of the two electrons are centrally symmetric . \n let s take two electrons as an example with the initial positions @xmath74 a.u . , @xmath41 and @xmath75 a.u . , @xmath76 , respectively . \n the corresponding atomic dipole moment @xmath34 along the laser polarization direction is @xmath77 $ ] and the power spectrum gained from eq . \n ( 4 ) is shown in fig . \n 4 ( solid curve ) , which has only odd -

dependent schrdinger equation have the same relative intensity should be studied in the future . \n in summary , we introduce bm into the intense laser - atom physics to discuss hhg . \n it allows us to follow the time evolution of each electron trajectory in an atomic system . \n we find that the power spectrum from an individual electron trajectory has the even unphysical harmonics . \n but the even harmonics are coherently removed in the ensemble of atoms and the power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics . \n the reason of the appearance of the even harmonics is an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion center , but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre . \n sanz a s , borondo f and miret -

{"ContextTokens": 2308, "GeneratedTokens": 203, "SynthesizedBody": "the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) has been a puzzle for over 35 years , but now there is strong evidence that this will be explained by a large population of absorbed agn . if these are to explain the bump in the xrb spectrum at 30kev , however , the total energy output of this population must exceed that of broad - line agn by at least a factor of @xmath1 , with wide ranging implications @xcite . \n this hidden population could also explain the apparent discrepancy between the black hole densities predicted by ordinary qsos and recent observations of local galaxy bulges @xcite , @xcite .    deep x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm will soon test this obscured agn hypothesis , although existing surveys with rosat , asca and bepposax have already revealed what could be the ` tip of the iceberg ' of this population . \n several unambiguous cases of obscured qsos have been detected ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) while at the faintest x - ray fluxes there is growing evidence for a large population of x - ray luminous emission - line galaxies , many of which show clear evidence for agn activity @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . \n arguably the most convincing evidence for the obscured agn model came from the ultra - deep survey of hasinger , schmidt et al ( @xcite , @xcite ) . using the keck telescope to identify sources from the deepest x - ray observation \n ever taken they found that most of these x - ray galaxies could be classified as agn . \n exciting new work has also been undertaken at harder energies with asca and beppo - sax ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) resolving @xmath2 of the @xmath3kev xrb . \n increasing numbers of these sources have been identified with absorbed agn . \n deep sub - mm observations offer the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the high redshift universe . beyond 100@xmath4 m , \n both starburst galaxies and agn show a very steep decline in their continuum emission , which leads to a large negative k - correction as objects are observed with increasing redshift . \n this effectively overcomes the ` inverse square law ' to pick out the most luminous objects in the universe to very high redshift @xcite . \n since the commissioning of the scuba array at the james clerk maxwell telescope a number of groups have announced the results from deep sub - mm surveys , all of which find a high surface density of sources at @xmath5 m ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n the implication is the existence of a large population of hitherto undetected dust enshrouded galaxies . in particular , \n the implied star - formation rate at high redshift ( @xmath6 ) is significantly higher than that deduced from uncorrected optical - uv observations , roughly a factor of two higher than even the dust - corrected version of the optically derived star - formation history @xcite . \n the recent detections of the far - infrared / sub - mm background by the dirbe and firas experiments provide further constraints , representing the integrated far - infrared emission over the entire history of the universe ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n since most of this background has now been resolved into discrete sources by scuba , the implication is that most high redshift star - forming activity occurred in rare , exceptionally luminous systems .    in other words , at high redshift ulirg - like starburst galaxies dominate the cosmic energy budget , in stark contrast to the situation today where ( to quote andy lawrence ) ` ulirgs are little more than a spectacular sideshow ' @xcite . \n considerable excitement has been generated recently by the possibility that many of these scuba sources could be agn . \n whether these agn are actually heating the dust is another matter ( see section 5 ) but there are now several independent lines of argument which suggest that agn are present in a significant fraction of these scuba sources . at the very least , the implication is that much of the star formation in the high redshift universe occurred in galaxies containing active quasars . \n first we present the arguments predicting an agn contribution , followed by recent observational evidence .      * * the analogy with ulirgs : * in many ways a significant agn fraction would not be a surprise . \n the scuba sources are exceptionally luminous systems , essentially the high redshift equivalents to local ulirgs . at the luminosities of the scuba sources ( @xmath7 ) we note that a least @xmath8 of local ulirgs show clear evidence for an agn @xcite . * * predictions based on agn luminosity functions : * one can estimate the agn contribution by transforming the x - ray luminosity function to the sub - mm waveband using a template agn sed . \n we estimate that @xmath9 of the sources in recent scuba surveys could contain agn , perhaps higher if one allows for compton - thick objects @xcite . \n major sources of uncertainty are in the extrapolation of local agn seds to high redshift , the dust temperature and in assuming the same underlying luminosity function for obscured agn . \n note that an independent but very similar analysis by manners et al ( in preparation ) predicts a lower fraction ( @xmath10 ) . \n * * re - radiating the absorbed energy : * another approach , also based on obscured agn models for the xrb , does not rely on uncertain seds but instead on thermally re - radiating the absorbed energy directly in the far - infrared @xcite . \n this method also predicts a significant agn fraction among the scuba sources ( @xmath11 ) although the exact prediction is strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature . * \n * scuba observations of high - z quasars : * observations of the most luminous , very high redshift quasars ( @xmath12 ) suggest that many are exceptionally luminous in the far - infrared / sub - mm , with sub - mm luminosities comparable to arp 220 @xcite . whether this emission is due to dust heated by the quasar or associated with starburst activity \n is unclear , but the lack of any correlation between the quasar power and the sub - mm luminosity would favour a starburst origin for the far - infrared emission . if one assumes that all high redshift quasars have similar sub - mm luminosities this would lead to a very large agn fraction in the deep scuba surveys ( @xmath13 ) . in reality \n , however , some weak correlation between quasar power and the associated starburst is likely to exist , which would reduce this fraction significantly . \n further sub - mm observations of high - z quasars are required to investigate these correlations .      * * the seds of detected scuba sources * : a recent analysis of the multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of scuba sources has suggested that @xmath14 are likely to be agn @xcite . * * spectroscopic identification : * although the identification of many scuba deep survey sources remains elusive ( perhaps indicating their exceptionally high redshift ) there are growing indications that a significant fraction harbour agn . \n the first clear - cut identification turned out to be an obscured qso @xcite and since then various surveys have been able to place limits on the agn fraction . from a study of @xmath15 sub - mm sources , barger and collaborators \n have placed a lower limit of @xmath16 on the fraction showing evidence for agn activity @xcite . \n of seven sub - mm sources studied in detail by ivison et al , at least @xmath17 show evidence for an agn @xcite . \n these estimates are in good agreement with the predictions of the various models outlined above . \n forthcoming deep x - ray surveys with chandra and xmm will push significantly fainter than ever before . in the soft x - ray band , \n we expect to reach at least an order of magnitude fainter than the deepest rosat surveys , while in the hard x - ray band the improvement is even more dramatic ( figure 1 ) \n . the puzzle of the xrb should therefore soon be solved , and we expect to detect large numbers of obscured agn and study their properties in detail . \n in addition , we will be able to detect typical quasars to very high redshift ( @xmath18 ) and hence assess the importance of quasar activity during those early epochs . \n these deep x - ray observations are potentially ideal for identifying agn in sub - mm surveys . \n the source densities expected are very similar ( @xmath19 deg@xmath20 ) and hence with the resolution of chandra in particular it will be possible to pick out the agn directly from their x - ray flux , with very little confusion . \n the @xmath21mjy survey of the uk scuba consortium is ideal for such a study ( figure 2 ) . \n this is the only wide area scuba survey being conducted , covering @xmath22 square arcminutes in @xmath23 contiguous regions . \n one of these regions is in the lockman hole ( which will be covered by chandra in pv time ) . \n the other is concentrated on the n2 region of the elais survey , where we have deep chandra and xmm observations planned ( pi : almaini ) . \n we will be able to detect the hard x - ray emission from the hidden agn _ and _ obtain a measurement of the absorbing column . \n if the equivalent width is high enough , in some cases xmm may even allow a redshift determination from an iron line detection \n several independent arguments now point to the conclusion that a significant fraction ( @xmath24 ) of the luminous sub - mm sources detected by scuba will contain agn . \n this points to a very important link between x - ray astronomy and the newly emerging sub - mm field , both of which provide probes of the obscured , high redshift universe . \n if a significant agn fraction is confirmed with forthcoming chandra / xmm surveys , considerable uncertainties will still remain . is the dust heated by the agn or by stellar processes ? \n if the agn is responsible , and their contribution is large , the recent conclusions about star - formation at high redshift may require significant revision . \n on the other hand the dust may be largely heated by stellar activity ( see @xcite ) but with the interesting implication that much of the star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies containing active quasars . \n it has recently been postulated that perhaps all quasars could go through an obscured phase during the growth of the black hole , a process which could be intimately linked with the formation of the galaxy bulge itself ( see @xcite ) . \n future surveys combining x - ray and sub - mm observations will provide a powerful tool for disentangling these processes .", "StartTimeOffset": 1370094755028, "RequestID": "4cce07cb806b095671d60869f7b190fd4268e258", "TotalTokens": 2511}

itoh et al . , 1992 ) and neutrino bremstrahlung for the liquid phase ( itoh and kohyama , 1983 ) . \n for the conductive opacities we used the analytic fits given by itoh et al . \n ( 1983 ) for high densities . \n in this paper , we give the first results of our white dwarf models including neutrino emission , that is m - r relations of the fully degenerate helium wds for masses greater than 0.4 @xmath0 are presented . \n figure 1 . shows the m - r relations for helium wds calculated by hamada and salpeter ( 1961 ) , althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) , vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) and our results . in this figure , plus sign shows our results obtained at the temperature @xmath5= @xmath6 k using the density values given in table 1a of hamada and salpeter ( 1961 ) for helium core ( cross sign shows the results of hamada and salpeter ) . \n the difference in mass and radius is about 1% . \n as seen from the figure the static mass - radius relations are modified by thermal effects and neutrino emission particularly for wds of low mass . \n these thermal effects and neutrino emission can cause deviations from the zero temperature m - r curve which are almost of the same order as hamada - salpeter corrections to the standard chandrasekhar m - r curve . \n we repeated the calculations for a different central temperature @xmath5= 5x@xmath6 k. the resulting data is also shown ( circle sign ) in the figure . \n the increase in @xmath5 causes the curve to shift upward for the masses smaller than 0.7 @xmath0 . \n we plot on the same figure also the results of althaus and benvenuto ( 1997 ) for zero temperature ( star sign ) and for @xmath5= 5x@xmath6 k helium wd models ( full box sign ) . \n the models of vennes et al . \n ( 1995 ) for masses smaller than 0.7 @xmath0 are shown by open box sign . \n their models have larger radii than the other models plotted in the same figure due to the high effective temperature ( 49000 k ) they used which means higher central temperature .    in our calculations with internal temperature of 5x@xmath6 k , we found r=0.015 @xmath7 for 0.5 @xmath0 wd . the effective temperature of 0.5 @xmath0 wd star can be assigned to be in the range 17x@xmath8 - 17.5x@xmath8 k using the results of atweh and eryurt - ezer ( 1991 ) for the lower boundary of convection zone of helium wds in the case of strong convection . \n they give the depth of convection zone for this effective temperature range between 30 and 60 km . \n therefore , about 7% difference in the radii of 0.5 @xmath0 wds at the mentioned interior temperature , between our study and the study of althaus and benvenuto , is not due only to the absence of helium atmosphere in our study but also due to neglecting star s thermal history . \n detailed evolutionary models are necessary for better interpretation of observations of wds . \n we would like to thank prof . \n d. eryurt - ezer for her suggestions in this study . \n 99    althaus l.g . , and benvenuto o.g . \n : 1997 , astrophys . \n j. 477 , 313 atweh z.m . , and eryurt - ezer d.:1991 , astrophys . \n space sci . \n 187 , 27 benvenuto o.g . , and \n althaus l.g . : 1998 , mnras 293 , 177 chandrasekhar , s. : 1939 , an introduction to the study of stellar structure ( chicago : univ . \n chicago press ) hamada t. , and salpeter e.e . : 1961 , astrophys . \n j. 134 , 683 itoh n. , and kohyama y.:1983 , astrophys . \n j. 275 , 858 itoh n. , mitake s. , iyetomi h. , and ichimaru s.:1983 , astrophys . \n j. 273 , 774 itoh n. , adachi t. , nakagawa m. , kohyama y. , and munataka h.:1989 , astrophys . \n j. 339 , 354 ;

nucleolar volume ratios in normal tissues and benign as well as malignant tumors do not differ quantitatively . \n nucleoli volumes of normal tissues , however , are found to be significantly smaller than the volume of nucleoli in cancerous tissues @xcite . \n similarly , the mechanical stiffness of various cell components has been found to vary significantly in healthy and diseased tissues . in @xcite , \n the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells was investigated using atomic force microscopy , showing that cancer cells are more than @xmath3 softer than healthy cells . \n other cancer types , including lung , breast and pancreas cancer , display similar stiffness characteristics . furthermore , using a magnetic tweezer , @xcite found that cancer cells with the lowest invasion and migratory potential are five times stiffer than cancer cells with the highest potential . \n likewise , increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) was reported to promote hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) cell proliferation , thus being a strong predictor for hcc development @xcite . moreover \n , enhanced cell contractility due to increased matrix stiffness results in an enhanced transformation of mammary epithelial cells as shown in @xcite . \n conversely , a decrease in tissue stiffness has been found to impede malignant growth in a murine model of breast cancer @xcite . \n various experimental techniques have been utilized in order to quantitatively assess the material properties of individual cell constituents in both healthy and diseased tissues . \n the inhomogeneity in stiffness of the living cell nucleus in normal human osteoblasts has been investigated by @xcite using a non -

like behavior of the envelope . \n @xcite estimated the elastic moduli of both cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocellular carcinoma cells based on force - displacement curves obtained from atomic force microscopy . \n in addition , @xcite used micropipette aspiration techniques in order to further elucidate the viscoelastic behavior of human hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells . based on their study , @xcite concluded that a change in the viscoelastic properties of cancer cells could affect metastasis and tumor cell invasion . \n the increased compliance of cancerous and pre -

nonlinear setting by means of implicit dynamics calculations . \n the nucleus , the largest cellular organelle , occupies about @xmath4 of the total cell volume in mammalian cells @xcite . \n it contains the nucleolus , which is embedded in the nucleoplasm , a viscous solid similar in composition to the cytosol surrounding the nucleus @xcite . in this study , \n the cytosol is modeled in combination with other organelles contained within the plasma membrane , such as mitochondria and plastids , which together form the cytoplasm . for simplicity , we idealize the plasma mebrane , nuclear envelope , cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as being of spheroidal shape . \n we model the plasma membrane , a lipid bilayer composed of two regular layers of lipid molecules , in combination with the actin cytoskeleton providing mechanical strength as a membrane with a thickness of @xmath5 nm @xcite . \n similarly , we model the nuclear envelope , a double lipid bilayer membrane , in combination with the nuclear lamin meshwork lending it structural support as a @xmath6 nm thick membrane . \n we define the cytoplasm , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus as spheres with radii of @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , and @xmath9 m and subsequently scale them by a factor of @xmath10 in two dimensions in order to obtain the desired spheroidal shape . \n we assume an average nuclear diameter of about @xmath11 m , as reported in @xcite . \n diameters for both cytoplasm and nucleolus follow from @xcite and @xcite , who report nucleus -

strain elastic moduli conversions , with a poisson s ratio of @xmath20 to simulate a nearly incompressible material , in order to match experimental values with constitutive parameters . \n we vary the stiffness of both cellular components and extra - cellular matrix ( ecm ) within a pathophysiologically - relevant range in order to investigate the effect of cell softening and ecm stiffening on eigenfrequencies . finally , we assume both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm to have a mass density of @xmath21g/@xmath22 , a value reported by @xcite as an average cell density , and we set the density of the nucleolus to @xmath23g/@xmath22 @xcite . \n .set of constitutive parameters ( bulk modulus @xmath19 and shear moduli @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) used in the eigenfrequency analyses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the spectral gap , or gap in the lowest eigenfrequencies , between healthy and cancerous cells and tissues provides a first hint of sharp differences in the response of healthy and cancerous tissue to harmonic excitation . \n in particular , the preceding analysis shows that the fundamental frequencies of the cancerous tissue may be in close proximity to eigenfrequencies of the healty tissue , which appears to undermine the objective of selective excitation of the cancerous tissue . \n however , a complete picture requires consideration of the relative energy absorption characteristics and growth rates of resonant modes . to this end , we consider the modal decomposition of the displacement field @xmath24 where @xmath25 are eigenvectors obeying the orthogonality and normalization condition ( [ e45dls ] ) and @xmath26 are time - dependent modal amplitudes obeying the modal equations of motion @xmath27 in this equation , @xmath28 is the corresponding eigenfrequency , @xmath29 is the external force vector and @xmath30 is the corresponding modal force . for a harmonic excitation of frequency @xmath31 , eq .  ( [ kc3v7h ] ) \n further specializes to @xmath32 where now @xmath33 is a constant modal force amplitude . at resonance , @xmath34 \n , the amplitude of the transient solution starting from quiescent conditions grows linearly in time and the transient solution follows as @xmath35 we thus conclude that the growth rate of resonant modes is @xmath36    figure  [ fig : fn ] shows the growth properties of @xmath37 for two different cases . in the first case , a cancerous cell is excited at its resonant frequency of @xmath38rad / s , whereas the healthy cell is excited at its closest resonance frequency of @xmath39rad / s . in the second case , \n eigenfrequencies of @xmath40rad / s and @xmath41rad / s are investigated . \n the simulations reveal that the growth rate of the resonant response of the cancerous cells is much faster than that of the healthy cells , which opens a window for selectively targeting the former . \n the preceding analysis has been carried out with a view to understanding the resonant response of cells and tissues under harmonic excitation in the harmonic range . in this section \n , we seek to confirm and extend the conclusions of the harmonic analysis by carrying out fully nonlinear implicit dynamics simulations of the transient response of healthy and cancerous cells under resonant harmonic excitation . in this analysis , a geometry of ratio @xmath42 is considered , figure  [ fig : mesh ] , together with material parameters of table  [ tab : parameters ] . \n we restrict attention to the long wavelength limit , i.  e. to ultrasound radiation of wavelengths larger than the cell size . in keeping with this limit \n , we enforce harmonic displacement boundary conditions directly as shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] in order to mechanically excite the cell . \n the strength of the harmonic excitation used in the calculations is @xmath43@xmath44 m .    in the simulations , we track the transient amplification of the cell response up to failure . \n we assume that failure occurs when the stress in the cytoskeletal polymer network , which constitutes the structural support for cell membranes , reaches a threshold strength value . \n @xcite found that the macroscopic network strength can be traced to the microscopic interaction potential of cross - linking molecules and other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments . here \n , we assume a rupture strength of the order of @xmath45pa based on strength values of a single actin / cross - linking protein bond reported in @xcite . \n figure  [ fig : transient ] shows the fully - nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous cells at the resonant frequency of the latter . \n it can be seen from the figure that stresses in both the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell grow at a much faster rate than in healthy cells . for the harmonic excitation under consideration , the strength of the nuclear envelope of the cancerous cell reaches the rupture strength at time @xmath46s , while , at the same time , the level of stress in the healthy cells is much lower . \n figure  [ fig : kineticpotential ] furthermore illustrates the kinetic and potential energy of the nuclear envelope during excitation at resonance of both healthy and cancerous cells .    from transient response simulations , the energy that needs to be supplied until the point of rupture is reached is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the applied traction on the boundary @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the displacement vector , @xmath51 is the force acting on surface node @xmath52 at time @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the corresponding displacement vector . \n for a cell geometry with a ratio of @xmath55 and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 , calculations give a value of @xmath57pj for the energy per cell required for lysis . \n assuming an average cell size of 20 @xmath58 m , a time to lysis of 70 @xmath58s and a tumor of 1 cm in size , this energy requirement translates into a power density requirement in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 .     and a cancerous potential of @xmath56 . \n shown is the frobenius norm of first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] \n in this study , we have presented numerical calculations that suggest that spectral gaps between hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy cells can be exploited to selectively bring the cancerous cells to lysis through the application of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation , while keeping healthy cells intact . \n we refer to this procedure as _ oncotripsy_. a normal mode analysis in the harmonic range reveals the existence of a healthy - to - cancerous spectral gap in ground frequency of the order of @xmath60 rad / s , or @xmath61 khz . \n further analysis of the growth rates of the transient response of the cells to harmonic excitation reveals that lysis of cancerous cells can be achieved without damage to healthy cells . \n these findings point to oncotripsy as a novel opportunity for cancer treatment via the application of carefully tuned ultrasound pulses in the frequency range of 80 khz , duration in the range of 70 @xmath58s and power density in the range of 0.8 w/@xmath59 . \n this type of ultrasound actuation can be readily delivered , e.  g. , by means of commercial low -

{"ContextTokens": 3423, "GeneratedTokens": 58, "SynthesizedBody": "almost since the discovery of charm mesons , mixing of @xmath0 mesons have been sought in analogy to the well - known @xmath1 mixing . \n due to very effective gim suppression , the expected mixing rate in the charm system is much smaller than for kaons . only very recently , \n the babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations have reported the first evidence of charm mixing . \n these results have renewed the interest from the theory community as the observed mixing rate could be caused by physics beyond the standard model or at least provide additional constraints on new physics . \n none of the mixing measurement have a significance above four standard deviations , but several have similar precision for the mixing parameters . by combining the measurements we therefore obtain more precise values for the mixing parameters and exclude the no - mixing hypothesis with larger confidence . combining the different mixing measurements is not completely straightforward , since not all measurements are sensitive to the same charm mixing parameters . \n the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) in 2006 created a subgroup with the responsibility of providing averages of charm physics measurements . \n one of the high priority tasks of this group is to combine the charm mixing measurements into world - average values for the fundamental mixing parameters . \n the first average assuming cp conservation was shown at fpcp @xcite . besides those results \n , we here report the first results of combining mixing measurements where we allow for cp violation . \n mixing is present in the @xmath0 system if the mass eigenstates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , differ from the flavor eigenstates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n generally one can write @xmath6 . \n the variables of fundamental interest are the mass difference , @xmath7 and decay width difference , @xmath8 between the two mass eigenstates . \n traditionally , in charm mixing one uses the dimensionless variables , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average decay width . \n cp violation in mixing or in the interference between mixing and decay would manifest itself as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively is for the moment assumed to be independent of decay mode . ] . \n in addition cp violation could show up in the decay itself giving rise to decay mode dependent parameters . \n most measurements do not directly measure @xmath14 . \n for instance in mixing measurements using @xmath15 decays there is a unknown strong phase , @xmath16 , so the results obtained are for @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the averaging procedure , we first combine measurements of the same parameters to obtain the more precise observables . \n most measurements are performed using likelihood fits and the combination is therefore performed by multiplying likelihood functions from each measurement and finding the new maximum . by combining likelihoods , correlations between observables and possible non - gaussian tails are taken into account . for measurements which are not using likelihoods , \n we construct a likelihood using symmetrized , gaussian uncertainties . to combine different types of measurements , \n the different combined likelihoods are recalculated as a function of @xmath19 minimizing over any other variables . \n @xmath16 is included since there is both a direct measurement @xcite and by combining the @xmath15 measurement with the other measurement of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one can also get a precise measurement of @xmath16 . \n when plotting confidence contours for @xmath14 we minimize the likelihood over @xmath16 . \n the combining of likelihood functions is currently only done for the cp conserving case . in principle \n it can be done also for the cp violating case by simply having two more variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in the final likelihood function . \n unfortunately not all likelihoods are currently available for the measurements which allow for cp violation . \n a simple combination is therefore performed by forming a @xmath24 of all measurements expressed in terms of the fundamental mixing parameters . \n the @xmath24 assumes gaussian errors , but correlations between observables in each individual measurement is taken account by using the full covariance matrix for each result . \n the following averages were performed by adding log likelihoods from fits where cp conservation was assumed . \n one can observe charm mixing by finding a difference in the lifetime measured in decays to cp eigen states such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the mixed - cp decay @xmath27 . \n we combine six results @xcite from such analyzes . \n all of these measure @xmath28 . in the limit of cp conservation one has @xmath29 . \n the average of the six measurements is @xmath30 . \n this is @xmath31 from the no - mixing hypothesis . \n as can be seen from figure  [ fig : ycp ] , this average is mainly driven by the recent belle measurement . \n values and the hfag average.,width=302 ]      wrong - signed semileptonic decays provide a clean way of searching for charm mixing , but the measurements are only sensitive to the integrated mixing rate @xmath32 . \n four measurements @xcite are combined and give an average of @xmath33 . \n in addition to the semileptonic decays , @xmath34 can also measured in the analysis of fully hadronic decays . \n the semileptonic result is therefore combined from two hadronic analyzes @xcite and in addition an analysis of tagged decays at the @xmath35 @xcite . \n the combination is illustrated in figure  [ fig : rm ] and gives an average value of @xmath36 . in the transformation to a likelihood in @xmath14 \n , we ignore the non - physical region of @xmath37 . \n decays are averaged with results from multi - body hadronic charm decays.,width=302 ]      one can measure @xmath20 and @xmath21 directly using a time - dependent dalitz plot analysis of @xmath38 decays . \n two measurements @xcite have been published and these have been averaged by hfag and gives @xmath39 and @xmath40 . combining this average with the averages above for @xmath34 and @xmath41 using likelihoods mapped as a function of @xmath14 we obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \n contours of the combined likelihood function at the levels corresponding to @xmath44 to @xmath45 confidence levels are shown in figure  [ fig : xy ] . \n note that the confidence levels shown correspond to two - dimensional coverage probabilities of 68.27% , 95.45% , etc . \n , and therefore @xmath46 etc .     from the combination of @xmath41 , @xmath47 and @xmath14 from the time - dependent dalitz analysis of @xmath48.,width=302 ] \n as mentioned above , one can measure @xmath50 and @xmath51 using the doubly - cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) decay @xmath49 . \n the likelihood functions are available for two measurements @xcite of this type . \n these are combined and gives the averages @xmath52 and @xmath53 . \n the corresponding likelihood contours are shown in figure  [ fig : kpi ] .    . \n the wiggles in the 4 and @xmath45 contours for @xmath54 is a binning effect . \n , width=302 ]      the combined likelihood for @xmath49 decays can be expressed as a function of @xmath19 ignoring the part with @xmath54 . \n this likelihood can be combined with the likelihood from the combination of the other mixing results in section  [ sec : nonkpi ] which do not depend on @xmath16 . \n an additional constraint comes from a cleo - c measurement @xcite of @xmath55 , where a small dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath21 is ignored in the combination . \n figure  [ fig : all ] shows the likelihood contours in @xmath14 after minimizing over @xmath16 . \n the region around the central value is almost unchanged with respect to the result without the @xmath49 decays ( figure  [ fig : xy ] ) . \n this is also reflected in the over all average for @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are @xmath56 the @xmath49 measurements do not contribute much to the central value , because of the poorly known phase @xmath16 . \n however they do help exclude the no - mixing hypothesis and cause the dip seen in the contours close to @xmath57 . \n at @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 with respect to the minimum . \n this corresponds to a significance of the combined mixing signal of @xmath59 . \n the combination also gives an improved value for @xmath16 . \n this can be seen in the projection of the likelihood after minimizing over @xmath20 and @xmath21 in figure  [ fig : delta ] . \n the combination gives @xmath60 . without the cleo - c measurement of @xmath16 \n , there would be an equally good second minimum at @xmath61 . \n , from combining all mixing measurements . \n , width=302 ] \n measurements of charm mixing can be done without assuming cp conservation by fitting @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons as separate samples . \n most of the measurements above have done that and we therefore can combine those to also provide constraints on the cp violating parameters . when allowing for cp violation , the measured parameters are related slightly differently to the mixing parameters . for the lifetime ratio measurements , one has @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the measured relative lifetime difference for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for @xmath49 decays , \n the @xmath50 and @xmath51 measured for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 . for @xmath38 \n decays the measurement directly gives @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while for the @xmath34 analysis the results are not separated and therefore just measure @xmath32 . \n the measurement of @xmath16 from cleo - c is not done separately for @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons and is not included in the combined result allowing for cp violation .    in total 22 measurements \n are combined in a @xmath24-fit to extract seven parameters , the four mixing and cp violation parameters , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and three characterizing @xmath49 , namely @xmath16 , the dcs rate @xmath70 , and the direct decay rate asymmetry @xmath71 . \n the fit gives @xmath72 and the following mixing parameters @xmath73 the mixing parameters are almost unchanged with respect to the cp conserving average . \n this is also seen from the confidence levels shown in figure  [ fig : xycpv ] . \n one can also draw the @xmath44 to @xmath45 confidence level contour for @xmath23 versus @xmath22 using @xmath74 . \n this is shown in figure  [ fig : qp ] . \n the no - cp violation hypothesis is seen to lie well within the @xmath75 contour . \n the combined results for the @xmath49 parameters are @xmath76 there is little change in @xmath16 with respect to the cp conserving average and no evidence for direct cp violation as @xmath71 is consistent with zero .     from combining mixing measurements with cp violation allowed . \n the dashed blue curve shows the @xmath75 contour from the cp conserving case for comparison.,width=302 ]     from combining mixing measurements with cp violation allowed.,width=302 ] \n evidence of charm mixing has been reported from several experiments in the last year . \n a new subgroup of hfag has performed an average of these and other existing charm mixing results . \n the combined result has a signal significance in excess of 5 standard deviations and gives the mixing parameters @xmath77 cp violation parameters have also been combined and gives @xmath78 this is fully consistent with no cp violation being present in charm mixing . \n hfag intends to periodically update these averages as new results become available in order to provide the most precise mixing parameters to the community . \n 99 b.  aubert _ et al . _ [ babar collaboration ] , phys . \n lett .   * 98 * , 211802 ( 2007 ) [ arxiv : hep -

homogeneous @xmath73 dss ( e.g. schemes a and c , since scheme b is based on non - mds code , it is excluded in this study as its availability is calculated in a different manner ) can be computed by the following equations :    @xmath74    @xmath75    let @xmath76 where @xmath77 . the condition @xmath78 will induce @xmath79)$ ] . \n it can be seen that if @xmath80 , then @xmath81)\\leq1\\leq\\chi$ ] . \n therefore , @xmath78 for all @xmath80 . \n we run the simulations for the case of @xmath82 and @xmath83 and obtain the result in fig . \n [ fig : dataavailable ] . \n it can be seen that for @xmath84 , data availability of non - homogeneous dss scheme outperforms the homogeneous dss scheme . for @xmath85 \n , the non - homogeneous schemes also have a big improvement when @xmath86 has a high online availability . \n therefore , it can be seen that our proposed non - homogeneous dss schemes achieve a higher data availability than the traditional homogeneous dss . \n the gap between the two becomes larger when the online availability of the super node increases , e.g. when @xmath86 is greater than 25% of @xmath87 , the data availability of the proposed non - homogenous over homogenous dss is increased by 10% .    ] \n we proposed three distributed storage schemes for _ non - homogeneous dss _ with high rate @xmath8 codes . \n two of the schemes make use of mds code , and can achieve optimal repair bandwidth of @xmath1 at smaller finite field @xmath7 and 75% smaller fragment @xmath3 than @xcite . \n small @xmath3 and @xmath7 are desirable , because they reduce the update bandwidth and complexity . \n another scheme based on non - mds code can achieve a smaller repair bandwidth than the optimal bandwidth based on mds code by @xmath2 for 1-node failure . \n we further demonstrate that in such non - homogeneous dss , if we can ensure one super node with a higher online probability than the other nodes , we can achieve a higher data availability than the homogeneous dss . \n this research is partly supported by the international design center ( grant no . \n idg31100102 & idd11100101 ) . \n li s work is supported in part by the national science foundation under grants no . \n ccf-0829888 , cmmi-0928092 , and eager-1133027 . \n papailiopoulos , a.g . \n dimakis , v.r . \n cadambe , `` repair optimal erasure codes through hadamard designs , '' _ the 49th annual allerton conference on communication , control and computation _ , pp.1382 -

{"ContextTokens": 3528, "GeneratedTokens": 228, "SynthesizedBody": "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary filling the roche lobe . \n the matter transferred from the secondary forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf . \n instabilities in the accretion disk result in various kinds of activities seen in cvs . \n the two most relevant instabilities are thermal and tidal instabilities , which are responsible for dwarf nova - type outbursts and superhumps , respectively ( see @xcite for a review ) . in systems having orbital periods longer than three hours , thermal instability governs the general behavior . \n accretion disks become thermally stable at high mass - transfer rates ( @xmath0 ) , while disks becomes thermally unstable in low @xmath0 . \n the former corresponds to novalike ( nl ) variables , which do not show outbursts , while the latter corresponds to dwarf novae , which show semi - periodic outbursts . \n close to the thermal stability border , there exist systems called as z cam stars , which show both standstills , the state corresponding to a nl variable , and a state exhibiting dwarf nova outbursts . the origin of interchanging states in z cam stars can be naturally understood with an assumption of varying @xmath0 from the secondary : the high @xmath0-state corresponds to standstills , while the low @xmath0-state the dwarf nova phase . \n there exist a small group of nl variables which show temporary reduction or cessation of @xmath0 from the secondary , namely vy scl - type stars @xcite . \n the low states ( reduced @xmath0-states ) of vy scl stars are hard to interpret in the scheme of the standard disk instability theory . \n if the disk follows the same evolution as in z cam stars in response to the temporary reduction of @xmath0 , the system should undergo dwarf nova outbursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) . \n observations usually show the contrary : the system undergoes a smooth decline from the high to low states ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    an important clue to understanding \n the vy scl - type behavior came from the detection of transient supersoft x - rays from a vy scl - type system , v751 cyg @xcite . from the detection of supersoft x - rays during the low state of v751 cyg , @xcite suggested that steady nuclear burning is taking place on the white dwarf of v751 cyg . @xcite \n further suggested the possibility that vy scl - type stars comprise a low - mass analog of supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxs ) . \n this discovery is consistent with the observed high temperature of white dwarfs in vy scl - type systems ( cf . \n @xcite , table 2.8 ) . \n @xcite proposed that , in the presence of the heating from the hot white dwarf , the irradiation on the accretion disk suppresses the thermal instability , which can reproduce the observed light curve of vy scl - type system in their low - high transitions . \n this effect , combined with the suggestion by @xcite , would be a promising candidate for the explanation of the behavior of vy scl - type stars . in this paper , we report on the discovery of large - amplitude oscillations with a period of 2.65 d , in a vy scl - type system v425 cas @xcite , which we regard as a further evidence for the effect of irradiation . \n a fading of v425 cas was detected by one of authors ( t. kinnunen ) in 1997 august . \n the object soon returned to its high state , and remained at around mag 14.5 until early 1998 . \n the object was again caught in faint state at the beginning of the next observing season ( 1998 august ) . \n we observed the system with a ccd in three seasons , 1998  early 1999 , late 1999  early 2000 and early 2000 . \n the ccd observations were done using an unfiltered st-7 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt - cassegrain telescope . \n the exposure time was 30 s. the images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and analyzed using the java@xmath1-based psf photometry package developed by one of the authors ( t. kato ) . \n the magnitudes were determined relative to gsc 3985.1444 ( tycho-2 magnitude : @xmath2 ) , whose constancy was confirmed using gsc 3985.1525 . \n the log of observations are given in the table ( @xmath3 represents the number of frames ) . \n .log of observations ( 1 ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n [ fig : figure1 ] shows the light curve of the 19981999 season , when the object stayed 1.02.0 mag below the high - state level . \n large - amplitude , rapid variations are clearly seen with a time scale of a few days . \n such a large - amplitude , short - term variation was never observed in any hydrogen - rich cvs , including vy scl - type stars . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig1.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure2 ] shows the result of period analysis , using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method @xcite . \n the strongest period is seen at @xmath4 d. no other significant period was found between @xmath5 d and @xmath6 d. since our observations were basically sampled once per night , we can not completely rule out the possibility of a shorter period . \n we have searched signals around the orbital period of v425 cas ( 0.1496 d , @xcite ) and found no significant period representing the overall light variation . \n this strongly indicates that the variation is not related to its orbital motion . the low inclination angle ( 25@xmath7 , @xcite ) \n also makes unlikely orbital modulations as a major cause of variation . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig2.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure3 ] shows the light curve in the 19981999 season folded by this 2.65 d period . \n the averaged light curve clearly shows 0.60.7 mag modulations , having a rapid rise and a slower decline . \n the profile of the light curve resembles those of dwarf nova outbursts with short recurrence times . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig3.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure4 ] shows the light curve in the 19992000 season , in which the object was at a similar brightness level as in the 19981999 season ( the averaged magnitudes of these two seasons agree within 0.05 mag ) . \n nevertheless , the 2.65-d period had completely disappeared . \n period analysis of the data did not yield any significant periodicity . \n ( 88mm,60mm)fig4.eps    ( 88mm,60mm)fig5.eps    fig . \n [ fig : figure5 ] shows the light curve in the late 2000 season . \n the object had further faded by @xmath81.0 mag at the beginning of this season . \n there is an evidence of a further fade in 2000 november  december . \n it is likely the object was entering a deep low state during this season . \n the large amplitude ( up to 1.5 mag , and 0.60.7 mag in average , which is close to a factor of two flux variation ) of the variations far exceeds those of known ( local ) disk oscillations , such as quasi - periodic oscillations , in cvs . \n the amplitude more suggests that dwarf nova - type disk instability is taking place , which is also consistent with the observed profile of variation . \n the main difference from the ordinary dwarf novae is the extreme shortness of the recurrent time . \n dwarf novae with orbital periods around that of v425 cas have typical recurrence time of ten to a hundred of days , the shortest known one being am cas having a recurrent time as short as 8 d ( cf . \n the recurrence time of dwarf novae is basically governed by the two factors , namely the viscous drift time in low @xmath0 systems and the build - up time in the outer disk torus in high @xmath0 systems ( cf . \n the shortest limit of recurrence time is regulated by the latter factor , which makes the recurrence time approximately inversely proportional to @xmath0 . above the critical @xmath0 , \n the disk becomes thermally stable , and this determines the shortest limit . according to calculations by @xcite , the expected minimum period is slightly below @xmath810 d , which is in good agreement with the am cas case . \n a different mechanism is therefore needed to explain the extremely short recurrent time in v425 cas .    a clue to this problem \n can be found in another example of a striking departure of recurrence time from the disk - instability theory : \n purr \" type outbursts observed during the outburst of an x - ray transient , v518 per = gro j0422 + 32 @xcite , which had a recurrence time of @xmath810 d , which is several times to an order of magnitude shorter than the expected recurrence time from the disk instability model . \n @xcite argued that x - ray irradiation on the accretion disk can effectively increase the disk temperature , and suppress the instability in inner portions of the disk , producing small - scale purr - type outbursts ( for model calculations , see @xcite ) . \n this scheme could apply to accretion disks in cvs , if there is an appropriate source of irradiation . \n @xcite required an x - ray luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 in producing purr - type outbursts . \n since the observed x - ray luminosity during a low state of the vy scl - type star v751 cyg was estimated to be @xmath11 erg s@xmath10 @xcite , the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems is expected to be enough to produce similar purr - type outbursts in cvs ( cvs generally have smaller accretion disks than in x - ray transients , which would make even a lower @xmath12 to work equally efficiently ) . \n we thus regard the present discovery of dwarf nova - like oscillations in v425 cas as another promising evidence for the effect of irradiation in vy scl - type systems . \n the disappearance of this kind of oscillations in the 19992000 season may be explained , in the same context , by the reduction of irradiation , due to the exhaustion of the accreted matter after a long - lasting of low - accretion state . \n the termination of accretion or the exhaustion of the accreted matter probably led to a further fade observed within the following eight months . \n yet another intriguing similarity is found in dwarf nova - like oscillations in helium cvs ( am cvn stars ) . \n two examples are known : cr boo ( @xmath1319 hr , @xcite ) and v803 cen ( @xmath142023 hr , @xcite , @xcite ) . \n @xcite proposed that this oscillation in cr boo can be understood as an extension of outbursts in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae , using the known relations ( kukarkin - parenago s relation and bailey s relation ) in hydrogen - rich dwarf novae . \n however , the assessment of the period should require calculations in helium accretion disks . \n @xcite applied the dwarf nova - type thermal and tidal instability model to the helium disk systems , and obtained a recurrence time of @xmath848 d , which is too long to explain the observed oscillations in cr boo and v803 cen . \n this recurrence time was more appropriately demonstrated in  normal outbursts \" of cr boo @xcite between its superoutbursts recurring with a period of 46 d. @xcite suggested that lower - amplitude , short - period oscillations observed by @xcite may result from the reflection of the cooling and heating waves in the outer region of the accretion disk , and not the full - disk outburst . \n the mechanism responsible for this effect was not clear at the time of the suggestion by @xcite , but the relatively strong x - ray flux in both stars inferred from rosat observations , the effect of x - ray irradiation would be a promising explanation . emerging evidences on the observable effect of irradiation in cvs on their outburst behavior , as demonstrated in the present observation , may be also a key to understanding the mystery of outbursts in helium cvs . \n our long - term ccd photometry of v425 cas , during its faint state in 19982000 , revealed the presence of totally unexpected , unprecedented large - amplitude ( 0.51.5 mag ) oscillations with a time scale of a few days . \n the period analysis of oscillations has demonstrated that this oscillation is well represented by a single period of 2.65 d. the amplitude and mean profile of variation strongly suggests that variation is caused by dwarf nova - type disk instability . \n the shortness of the period is more difficult to explain . by taking recent discoveries of supersoft x - rays in a low state vy scl - type star into account , we proposed that the suppression of the thermal instability of the inner accretion disk by irradiation can be responsible for this large - amplitude variation in v425 cas . \n this effect of irradiation may also apply to helium cataclysmic variables , which show similar short - period , large - amplitude oscillations , which were proposed to be dwarf nova -

{"ContextTokens": 2913, "GeneratedTokens": 123, "SynthesizedBody": "the term acoustic casimir force ( acf ) refers to the force between two parallel plates when they are placed in an acoustic random field . \n this is a classical analog of the quantum casimir force that results from quantum vacuum fluctuations @xcite . \n acoustic casimir forces were first proposed by larraza and collaborators @xcite , who measured the effect in audible frequencies for plates separated a few millimeters . \n the plates were placed in a close tank that acted as a reverberation chamber , and the average acoustic field of intensity @xmath0 was generated with pressure drivers in a frequency range @xmath1 $ ] . in the acoustic casimir force , \n only the frequencies in a finite bandwidth spectrum are taken into account , the bandwidth being determined by the physical limits of the acoustic sources used . unlike the unbounded spectrum of the quantum case , the acf has very interesting physical consequences . \n the most significant being that the acoustic casimir force changes from attractive to repulsive depending on the plate separation and the frequency bandwidth . \n the change in sign of the force due to a finite bandwidth has also been observed in the fermionic casimir effect between two metals , where the force is obtained after an integration over all possible energy states up to the fermi level @xcite .    in this paper , an external classical sound source \n is assumed in the calculation of the acf . \n it differs from the phononic casimir effect , that is caused by a random phonic field induced by thermal fluctuations @xcite . \n the magnitude of the phononic casimir pressure is comparable to the quantum casimir effect at separations of the order of @xmath2 m. the phononic pressure has been shown to influence the pull - in dynamics of micro electromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite . \n consider two parallel plates separated a distance @xmath3 and characterized by their acoustic reflectivities @xmath4 . \n the plates are in an acoustic field of random white noise of frequency bandwidth @xmath1 $ ] and spectral intensity @xcite @xmath5 . the acoustic casimir pressure ( acp ) \n is calculated from @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 . \n the wave vector @xmath8 has components @xmath9 parallel to the plates and @xmath10 perpendicular to the plates . \n the speed of sound in the medium between the plates is @xmath11 . \n equation ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) was derived @xcite assuming rigid plates , so that no sound is generated by them . also , diffraction effects are neglected . \n the basic idea behind eq ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) is the subtraction of the pressure outside the plates from the pressure due the modes that can exists between the plates when the boundary conditions are satisfied . \n if the lower frequency of the bandwidth is set to zero , the acp is always attractive @xcite . if we consider and infinite bandwidth @xmath12 and perfect acoustic reflectors @xmath13 , the acp calculated using eq.([lifshitz2 ] ) gives a attractive force for all separations , @xmath14    to scale down the acp from macroscopic systems to submicron systems , we require high frequencies . \n typical commercial transducers can operate up to @xmath15 mhz , and with a high acoustic power output . \n the feasibility of high intensity , high frequency transducers in micro systems can be exemplified by the experiments of degertekin @xcite that actuated atomic force microscopes cantilevers using focused ultrasonic transducers in the frequency range of 100 - 300 @xmath16 . \n also , sub - terahertz have been achieved with superlattice structures @xcite . \n the intensity of ultrasonic transducers is around 50 @xmath17 @xcite . \n however , high intensity focused ultrasonic transducers can have an intensity of several orders of magnitude greater ; several thousands watts per square centimeter @xcite . \n to study the effect of the acoustic casimir force in mems , we consider a one degree of freedom simple lumped model . \n it consists of two parallel plates , one fixed the other attached to a spring of elastic constant @xmath18 . \n the equilibrium separation is @xmath19@xmath20 . when the plates are at a distance @xmath3 , the elastic force is @xmath21 . \n the system in enclosed in an acoustic resonant cavity as shown in figure 1 . \n although this model is the simplest when studying pull - in dynamics , it is helpful in the overall understanding of the pull - in dynamics and in our case , how it changes in the presence of the acoustic casimir force . for these systems , \n the electrostatic force is the most common form of actuation for mems . \n to get an idea of the pressure magnitudes involved in the acoustic casimir effect , we compare the acp for perfect acoustic reflectors and an infinite bandwidth , eq.([lifshitz3 ] ) , with the pressure between two parallel plates of area @xmath22 with a potential difference between them . \n we consider two cases , when the potential difference is of @xmath23@xmath24 and of @xmath25@xmath24 , as shown in figure 2 . in these cases , they are of the same order of magnitude . \n recall , that the acp is proportional to the spectral intensity @xmath5 , that we can vary to get a casimir pressure of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic case . in figure 1 \n we chose @xmath26@xmath27 . \n the important aspect of the acp we want to emphasize is that it may change sign when the plate separation changes . as explained in ref . \n @xcite , the repulsive casimir pressure happens when the separation between the plates equals an integral number of half - wavelengths associated with the lower frequency of the band - width @xmath28 . in this case \n , the wave vector @xmath29 between the plates and the contribution of the stress tensor is mainly that perpendicular to the plates . \n outside the plates this condition is not met and the for the same frequency the wave vector can be at any angle of incidence . in figure 3 , we present the acp as a function of separation for two different frequency band widths @xmath30 $ ] @xmath16 ( solid line ) and @xmath30 $ ] @xmath31 ( dotted line ) . the repulsive acp should occur when @xmath32 , that is , close to any of the following separations : 11.8682 , 23.7365 , 35.6047 , 47.473 , 59.3412 , 71.2094 , 83.0777 , 94.9459 , 106.814 , 118.682 , 130.551 , 142.419 . for the mhz bandwidth these positions are in microns and for the ghz bandwidth in nanometers . \n this shows that the acp is applicable to devices of any size by a suitable choice of the frequency bandwidth . \n the peaks where the repulsive acp occurs get broader as the separation increases . at large separations , the system is less sensitive to variations in frequency . if @xmath33 be the peak width , the change in the frequency within this interval is @xmath34 . \n larger @xmath33 imply a small change in the frequency @xmath35 as well as in wave vector . \n thus , within @xmath33 at large separations @xmath29 within the plates \n .    controlling the lower frequency of the bandwidth allows us to select where the acp changes sign . \n consider the acp for the bandwidth @xmath36$]@xmath37 . \n this , is shown in figure 3 . \n there is a narrow peak centered at @xmath38 @xmath39 or @xmath40 , where a repulsive acp is present , while for other separations we have a constant negative pressure . \n again , changing the bandwidth from mhz to ghz allows us to work with different size systems . \n let us recall that for the simple lumped system actuated by electrostatic forces @xcite there is an upper limit for the value of the potential difference after which the electrostatic force overcomes the elastic force and the top plate jumps to contact . \n the voltage @xmath41 and plate separation @xmath42 where the pull - in occurs are @xmath43 this is why we choose the acp to have a positive peak at this particular separation . \n now , we show that having the acoustic casimir pressure , the dynamics of the plate changes and the pull - in voltage can be increased . \n having another force besides the electrostatic attraction has been considered in the study of pull - in dynamics , for example dispersive forces @xcite .    to find the critical value of the voltage where the pull - in occurs , we begin with the equation of motion of the top plate @xmath44 where @xmath45 the permittivity of vacuum . introducing the dimensionless separation @xmath46 we have @xcite @xmath47 the wavevector components with a tilde are normalized to @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in eq.([dimensionless ] ) we have introduced the parameters @xmath50 which shows the relative importance of the electrostatic force to the elastic force , and @xmath51 that compares the acoustic casimir force with the elastic force . since the voltage appears in @xmath52 \n we find that @xmath53 where we define @xmath54 is the integral term that multiplies @xmath55 in eq . \n ( [ dimensionless ] ) .    if @xmath56 , the solution of eq . ( [ lam1 ] ) corresponds to the pull - in voltage given in eq.(3 ) . for the the value of @xmath19@xmath20 used here yields @xmath57@xmath20 . in fig(3 ) , we choose the frequency bandwidth to have a positive pressure at this separation . as we now show , the additional acp can increase the value of the pull - in voltage .    for different values of @xmath55 , we plot the bifurcation diagram @xmath52 vs @xmath58 in fig . \n the vertical line is a visual aid that indicates the position of the maximum of the curve . \n the points to the left of the maximum are stable equilibrium point while all the points to the right are unstable points and for those values of @xmath52 and @xmath59 the elastic force is overcome and the plates will jump to contact @xcite . for the particular selection of the acp used the position of the maximum does not change for different values of @xmath55 , since @xmath60 , as seen in fig . \n so , for this particular choice of frequency the bandwidth is still @xmath61 . \n however , the pull - in voltage will change . using the definition of @xmath52 in eq . \n ( [ lam1 ] ) and evaluating at @xmath42 we have @xmath62^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the pull - in voltage in the electrostatic case , eq.([pullin ] ) , since @xmath55 is proportional to the acoustic intensity . \n thus , the pull - in voltage can be increased by increasing the acoustic intensity . \n in conclusion , we have presented a theoretical calculation of the acoustic casimir force in frequency ranges suitable for applications in the micrometer range . in particular , we showed that by selecting a particular frequency bandwidth the acp can be repulsive or attractive , or change sign as a function of plate separation . \n the lower frequency of the bandwidth and the acoustic intensity are two parameters that can be tuned to control the dynamics of electrostatic actuated mems extending the value of the pull - in voltage for simple - lumped systems . \n the acp calculations were done for a micrometer size and nanometer size systems . \n however , these therefore , a fine - tuned acp can be used to increase the mechanical stability of mems structures . in future work , by considering oscillating acp , as shown in fig . \n ( 2 ) , we will analyze the possibility of using the acoustic casimir effect as a mechanical actuator for micropumps @xcite . \n another area of interest where the analogy between the quantum case and the acoustic can be exploited is in the use of acoustic metamaterials @xcite , where negative volume densities and reflectivities are possible . \n $ ] mhz ( solid line ) and @xmath30$]ghz ( dotted line ) . the change in sign from attractive ( negative ) to repulsive ( positive ) happens when @xmath64 . \n the acp was calculated using eq . \n ( [ lifshitz2 ] ) and assuming an acoustic reflectivity of @xmath65 . \n the horizontal axis is in microns for the mega hertz bandwidth and nano meters for the giga hertz bandwidth . for this figure @xmath26@xmath27 for the solid line and @xmath66@xmath27 for the dotted line . . \n ]    $ ] mhz(ghz ) for the solid ( dotted ) lines , the separation at which the acp is positive can be fixed . in this case \n a sharp repulsive pressure is obtained at a separation of @xmath38@xmath20(solid line ) or @xmath38@xmath67 ( dotted line ) . the units of the horizontal axis are the same as in figure 3 . ]    , we calculate the force from the acp presented in figure 3 . in this case , the position of the maximum does not change . \n the different curves correspond to different values of the parameter @xmath55 . \n the vertical line is a visual aid and is located at @xmath68 . from top \n to bottom the different curves correspond to the values of @xmath69 . ]", "StartTimeOffset": 1422001976340, "RequestID": "5024ef3b9f2ff94bfeb6f82c56ac6904e49ca57c", "TotalTokens": 3036}

term behavior will be dominated by the fluctuator that couples most strongly to the qubit , while the others mainly dampen further oscillations of the coherence vector ( fig .

dot and four - dot encoding respectively ( fig . \n [ fig : decaytimes ] b ) . \n thus , the ratio of the effective coupling strengths is a good measure for the superiority of the 4qd encoding versus the 2qd encoding \n the former will be better provided that @xmath35 , and the larger the ratio the greater the improvement . \n the 2qd and 4qd qubits couple differently to charge traps , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 respectively , where @xmath38 is the distance between the qubit and each charge trap . \n the 4qd qubit has thus effectively a smaller `` horizon '' than the 2qd qubit . \n hence , generally a charge trap would have to be situated closer to the 4qd qubit than a 2qd qubit to induce the same decoherence . \n since the noise on the qubit is generally dominated by the closest fluctuator , whose typical distance is inversely proportional to defect density , the average relative effectiveness of the encoding is therefore expected to increase with decreasing charge trap density , which is confirmed by computer simultations ( fig . \n [ fig : trapdensity ] ) .     coupled to 100 charge traps . @xmath39 and @xmath40 . \n a total of 200 quantum trajectories were simulated and averaged . \n for all simulations , the 2qd qubit was @xmath41 nm long and the 4qd qubit was a @xmath41 nm square ( e.g. p donors in si , see ref .  ) . \n both were located @xmath41 nm below the layer in which the charge traps were located . \n charge trap transition rate was @xmath42hz.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        , bars indicate the @xmath43 ranges . at high densities , \n the mean charge trap spacing is comparable to the size of the qubit , leading to saturation effects.,scaledwidth=45.0% ] \n the results in the previous section show that the 4qd encoding can substantially increase short - term coherence times for an ideal geometry . \n however , any physical implementation is likely to deviate from the perfect symmetry of the ideal quantum dot structure . \n the scheme s sensitivity to such deviations is thus an important practical consideration . \n non - ideal geometry , e.g. due to imperfect qd placement , will introduce a dipole moment , spoiling decoupling from external fields and reducing robustness to charge trap noise . \n however , as the magnitude of this dipole is comparable to , and linear in the displacement , and given that fabricational precision should be at least a fraction of qd spacing for qip purposes   nm accuracy ) of p donors in si has been demonstrated  @xcite . ] , the extra dipole for the 4qd qubit should be much smaller than for a 2qd qubit , hence the encoding should still offer a noticeable advantage .    to quantify the effect of asymmetry due to placement errors in the quantum dots \n , we performed extensive simulations computing the effective couplings for various randomly perturbed 2qd and 4qd architectures for different charge trap densities and a wide range of charge distributions . \n the simulations show that for reasonable errors ( @xmath44 placement error ) , the efficiency of the scheme is only modestly affected over a wide range of fluctuator densities ( fig . \n [ fig : perturb ] ) . \n ( expressed as a fraction of the array side - length ) . \n this was repeated 1000 times for each of 500 fluctuator distributions . \n we plot of median w.r.t fluctuator distributions of the mean over the perturbations of the decoupling ratios as a function of error magnitude for different effective fluctuator densities . \n even with a 10% displacement error ( i.e. @xmath45 ) , the 4qd qubit is still effective.,scaledwidth=45.0% ] \n we now consider implementing a universal set of quantum gates , @xmath46 . ideally , we would like all states involved during gate operations to belong to the dfs . \n this suggests an adiabatic holonomic control scheme  @xcite . \n however , the requirement of additional quantum dots for generating holonomies , charge symmetry constraints on auxiliary dot positioning , and the complexity of pulse sequences all offset possible advantages of holonomic control . \n alternatively , rapidly modulating tunneling between dots can implement the required logical gates quickly . \n if the gate time is short enough , transient population in non - dfs states , should have minimal coupling to electric field fluctuations . \n intra - dot charging should effectively suppress double occupation , which can be further enhanced by ensuring all spins are parallel so that each orbital can not have more than one electron . \n we describe the four dot system as a two -

dfs states involved . with vertical tunneling only , \n the available state space is spanned by four states , @xmath60 . \n hence the hamiltonian with no tunneling is , @xmath61 in the above basis , and where we have taken the ( degenerate ) ground state energy to be @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the energy of the non - diagonal states @xmath64 due to coulomb repulsion of the two electrons . \n we now switch on equal tunneling with rate @xmath65 in the vertical direction , @xmath66 for convenience , we normalize @xmath67 , and scale @xmath65 relative to this . \n the eigenstates of @xmath68 are @xmath69 where the eigen - energies are @xmath70 . \n tunnelling between dots mixes the states so that @xmath71 are no longer eigenstates of @xmath72 . \n transitions between @xmath73 and @xmath74 can not occur directly but only via transient occupation of the non - dfs states .    in order to achieve a @xmath75 rotation around an axis @xmath76 lying on the equator of the bloch sphere ( which is equiavalent to a @xmath55 gate up to @xmath77 rotations ) @xmath78 , \n we require @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be rational . \n this leads to the conditions , @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . \n these requirements derive from the fact that the amplitudes of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 should be equal in magnitude when the amplitudes of the non - dfs states are zero , leading to @xmath85 , and the gate time @xmath86 . \n when @xmath87 , we achieve the operation with @xmath88 . \n if @xmath89 , we perform a logical not ( @xmath90 ) . \n the minimum gate time for a @xmath75-gate is @xmath91 when @xmath92 even and @xmath93 ( fig . \n [ fig : sigmax ] ) . if @xmath94 , the time required to implement the gate increases . \n coulomb repulsion favors the diagonal charge configurations but transient population in the other states will still occur . for @xmath95 , \n the gate time is on the order of @xmath96 but the maximum transient population scales as @xmath97 . \n the integrated population in the non -

we therefore developed fully independent , custom packages that enable optimal modeling and fitting of interlaced 2d spectra . \n we find that these tools work very well , even on the deepest ( 17-orbit ) grism data that are currently available ( see below ) . \n a further complication is that the grism spectra are often difficult to interpret without information from other wavelengths , as correct identification of faint emission lines usually requires some prior information on the likely redshifts of the objects \n . data at other wavelengths are also crucial for measuring stellar masses , rest - frame colors , star formation rates , and other parameters . with these goals in mind \n we have created photometric catalogs in the 3d - hst fields , as a first and necessary step to interpret the grism spectra . \n we are providing the g141 grism spectra in the only region of the survey which was observed multiple times : the hubble ultra deep field . \n we have used this field to test our fitting procedures and to extract and analyze the deepest near - ir spectra of faint galaxies currently available . \n the g141 spectra are based on a combination of 8 orbits of 3d - hst data and 9 orbits of candels supernova follow - up data . \n an analysis of the 17-orbit spectrum of a candidate @xmath12 galaxy in this field was presented in brammer et al.(2013 ) . \n we provide @xmath0 spectra and redshifts over the @xmath13 udf . \n this density of @xmath14 spectra per arcmin@xmath15 far exceeds what has been achieved in any other survey or can reasonably be done from the ground .      as part of our commitment to release all ancillary data used in the 3d - hst program we are providing our reduced wfc3 mosaics of all five 3d - hst / candels fields as part of data release v3.0 . \n the mosaics include the deep and wide @xmath16 data obtained as part of the candels program , the 3d - hst @xmath8 imaging , and the early release science observations ( and udf flanking fields ) in goods - south . \n the candels project has also released several of the imaging mosaics . \n our reduction uses the same tangent point and pixel scale as candels , which means 3d - hst and candels objects can be trivially matched and compared . \n we are preparing to release our photometric catalogs in these five fields , including derived photometric redshifts and stellar population parameters . the catalog release ( v3.1 ) \n will be accompanied by a paper describing the reduction of the mosaics and the making of the catalogs ( skelton et al . \n , in preparation ) . \n information on the 3d - hst survey , as well as links to the data release , publications , pointing layout , and other information can be obtained from the 3d - hst website :          we have created several tools to explore the data release . for the ultra deep field we provide an html table with image thumbnails and spectra , which can be ordered according to i d , magnitude or redshift . \n an interactive image browser displays grism redshifts on udf objects and allows users to scroll around the field using a google maps - like interface . \n clicking on an object brings up the html table with the object at the top . \n * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/spectra/udf/web/udf_3dhst_redshift_v1.0.html[udf html catalog with rgb thumbnails , spectra , and fits ] * * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/spectra/udf/web/hudf_ijh.html#03:32:39.73,-27:46:11.3[udf interactive image browser ] *      * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/photometry/rgb/aegis3/aegis_ijh.html#14:20:19.49,+53:02:03.8[aegis @xmath17 rgb mosaic ] * * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/photometry/rgb/cosmos3/cosmos_ijh.html#10:00:17.97,+02:18:05.5[cosmos @xmath17 rgb mosaic ] * * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/photometry/rgb/gs3/gs_ijh.html#03:32:14.96,-27:42:25.9[goods-south @xmath17 rgb mosaic ] * * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/photometry/rgb/gn3/gn_ijh.html#12:37:21.09,+62:12:46.8[goods-north @xmath18 rgb mosaic ] * * * http://monoceros.astro.yale.edu/release_v3.0/photometry/rgb/uds3/uds_ijh.html#02:17:37.17,-05:13:30.1[uds @xmath18 rgb mosaic ] *    * acknowledgements : * the 3d - hst survey , programs hst - go-12177 and hst - go-12328 , is based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 . financial support for this program is gratefully acknowledged . besides data from the 3d - hst survey itself we used observations from programs 11600 ( pi : weiner ) , candels ( 12060 - 12064 and 12440 - 12445 ;

magnet current so as to minimize the bunch length out of the alpha magnet . \n once this is done , the ctr signal is a good relative measure of the bunch length . \n to prepare the rf gun to produce a high - brightness beam one must first scan the alpha - magnet current to find the minimum bunch length . \n typically the rf gun is powered anywhere from 1.5 to 1.7 mw , and the heater current is adjusted to produce 1 to 2 nc in a train of 23 s - band bunches . the gun power and beam current \n are kept constant during the scans . \n prior to the scan , the beam is focused on the yag using quads before and after the alpha magnet , with the alpha magnet `` close '' to the setting required for minimum bunch length . during the scan \n , the rf gun phase must be adjusted linearly to compensate for path length changes in the alpha magnet . to maximize scan resolution , \n the interferometer is set to maximize the golay detector signal . \n figure  [ fig3 ] shows a typical alpha - magnet scan showing a peak at 175 amperes . \n the curve represents the output of the golay detector from a gated integrator amplifier . \n once the minimum bunch length has been found , an alpha - magnet scraper scan is performed . \n simulations show a microbunch profile that has a low - emittance , high - energy core beam and a high - emittance , low - energy tail . the scraper scan is performed to optimize removal of the low - energy tail . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows a typical scraper scan where the ctr signal is plotted vs scraper position . \n the edge of the core beam is at approximately 9.5 cm . \n figure  [ fig5 ] shows a plot of ctr signal vs beam current , as measured by a beam position monitor ( bpm ) adjacent to the ctr foil , taken during the scraper scan . \n included with the data is a quadratic fit , showing the expected quadratic dependence of the coherent radiation on the number of particles . \n once the scraper position is determined , the interferometer is used to measure the autocorrelation of the digitized gated integrator ctr signal . \n figure  [ fig6 ] shows the autocorrelation measured for a beam of 1 nc in 23 s - band micropulses . \n autocorrelation processing begins with taking the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the autocorrelation , which gives the square of the bunch spectrum . \n the method of lai and sievers is then used to reconstruct the phase spectrum from the amplitude spectrum by computing a principal value integral . \n once the phase spectrum is obtained , an inverse fft is performed to derive the microbunch profile . \n additional processing is performed to correct for the reduced response of the golay detector at low frequencies ( long wavelengths ) . \n since any bunch spectrum approaches low frequencies quadratically , a quadratic fit is performed for frequencies from the golay detector 3-db point to a user - selectable higher frequency , typically including 3 to 5 frequency points  @xcite . \n the fit is then used to extrapolate quadratically to dc from the golay detector 3-db point . \n figure  [ fig7 ] shows the amplitude spectrum derived from the measured autocorrelation and the corrected spectrum for low frequencies . \n the main effects of this low - frequency correction is to broaden the derived bunch profile and flatten the dips in the autocorrelation adjacent to the peak . \n these dips are unphysical since the autocorrelation is always positive . \n figure  [ fig8 ] shows the derived bunch profile from the the corrected autocorrelation spectrum . \n the overall profile contains a high - current peak ( @xmath1 100 amperes ) , a lower current shoulder , and is overall about 400 fs wide . \n this beam was used for sase measurements . \n the beam prepared as described above was accelerated to 217 mev . \n the emittance was measured in the transport line using the standard three - screen technique , giving a normalized emittance of approximately 10 @xmath0 mm . \n the energy spread is estimated to be  0.1% . \n the beam was transported to the undulator hall and passed through five aps undulators with diagnostics stations between them . \n figure  [ fig9 ] shows the measured photon intensity ( corrected for spontaneous background ) at each undulator diagnostic station . \n the solid line is an exponential fit to the data showing a gain length of 1.3 m for both undulator radiation and coherent transition radiation data  @xcite , in agreement with a calculation using the previously listed peak current , emittance , and energy spread . \n the rf thermionic gun beam was quite stable once tuning was completed . \n one limitation of the beam is that the microbunch length is on the order of the electron slippage length . the final saturated power is therefore expected to be lower for this beam . \n the authors thank j. lewellen , s. milton , and j. galayda for useful comments and suggestions . \n m. borland , `` an improved thermionic microwave gun and emittance -

{"ContextTokens": 2897, "GeneratedTokens": 244, "SynthesizedBody": "in a recent paper , tananbaum et al . ( 1997 ) have reported a detailed analysis of a rosat pspc observation of j2310 - 43 , a very peculiar and interesting galaxy firstly discovered as a luminous x - ray source ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) in an _ einstein _ \n ipc image ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) . \n the ipc data showed that the x - ray source is spatially extended . \n this , combined with the fact that the galaxy is a cd in cluster ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) supported the hypothesis that the x - ray emission is due to the cluster , rather than to the activity of the galaxy itself . however , on the basis of the x - ray spatial and spectral analysis of the pspc data , tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) suggested that only 20% of the total x - ray emission comes from the cluster , while the bulk is associated with a nuclear activity of the galaxy . \n optical spectroscopy of the galaxy ( tucker , tananbaum & remillard 1995 ) , however , did not reveal the emission lines or the excess blue continuum expected if j2310 - 43 contains an active nucleus . \n another interesting possibility considered by tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) , is that j2310 - 43 is related to the bl lac phenomenon . \n the lack of emission lines in the optical spectrum would apparently support this view . \n furthermore , the broad band energy distribution of j2310 - 43 , i.e. the position of the object in the @xmath6 plane ( tananbaum et al . \n 1997 ) , falls at the edge of the region occupied by bl lac objects ( stocke et al . \n on the other hand , the same authors show that the ( b - v ) color observed in j2310 - 43 is consistent with that of a normal elliptical galaxy and it is rather different from that of a typical bl lac object . \n the resulting picture is rather intriguing with contradicting or inconclusive evidences as for the presence of  nuclear activity \" . indeed \n tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) leave open the question whether j2310 - 43 belongs to the tail of the bl lac population or to a different class of objects and point out similarities with the optically dull galaxies with strong nuclear x - ray emission discovered by elvis et al . \n ( 1981 ) . \n the spectroscopic data on j2310 - 43 , however , were limited to the 4700- 6700   interval thus excluding two regions critical for the understanding of the nature of the source : that of the ca ii break ( expected at @xmath74355 ) and of the @xmath0 line ( expected at @xmath77145 ) . \n in fact agns showing no @xmath8 and [ oiii ] lines but exhibiting a broad @xmath0 line are known to exist ( stocke et al . \n 1991 ; see also halpern , eracleous & forster 1997 ) . \n for these reasons the possibility that j2310 - 43 is hosting a reddened seyfert nucleus or a bl lac object could not be completely ruled out .    with the aim of further studying j2310 - 43 and understanding its real nature we have therefore secured two optical spectra covering the wavelength range 3700  @xmath9 9800 . \n spectroscopy of j2310 - 43 was carried out with the eso 3.6 m telescope on 1996 december 10 . \n observations were made with efosc1 in longslit mode , using a 1.5 arcsec wide slit and two different grisms , b300 and r300 , with wavelength coverage from 3700   to 6800   and from 6200   to 9800 , respectively . \n the dispersions achieved with the two grisms , scaled to the tek512 ccd detector , were 6.3  / pixel ( b300 ) and 7.5  / pixel ( r300 ) . \n the exposure time was of 600 sec with the grism b300 and of 300 sec with the r300 . \n the data were reduced using the iraf - longslit package . \n the wavelength solution was obtained using a he - ar reference spectrum while the correction for the instrument response was based on the observation of a photometric standard ( ltt 377 ) . \n we did not make an absolute flux calibration , thus the flux density scale of the spectra is in arbitrary units . \n the calibrated spectra are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] . \n the spectra presented in figure  [ fig1 ] cover a wavelength range considerably larger than that of the spectrum discussed in tucker , tananbaum & remillard ( 1995 ) . \n in particular , the region of the [ oii ] , caii break ( @xmath2 4355 ) and the region where h@xmath10 is expected ( 7145 ) are fully covered . \n no emission lines appear in the spectrum , which shows only the typical absorption features of a `` normal '' early type galaxy . from the main absorption features seen ( ca ii h&k , g band , h@xmath11 , mgi 5175 , na i d ) we have computed a redshift of @xmath12 , confirming the value found by tananbaum et al . ( \n 1997 ) . \n the first result worth noting is the absence of h@xmath10 in emission . \n the fact that no emission lines are present from [ oii ] to [ nii ] definitively put to rest the possibility that a seyfert nucleus is hiding in j2310 - 43 . \n secondly , we note that a pronounced ca ii contrast is detected . \n we have computed its amplitude following dressler & shectman ( 1987 ) , i.e. by estimating the average fluxes ( expressed in unit of frequency ) between 3750-3950  ( @xmath13 ) and between 4050-4250   ( @xmath14 ) in the rest - frame of the source ; the contrast is then defined by : @xmath15 we have found , using the central part of the spectrum to minimize the stellar contribution , a ca ii contrast of 38% @xmath1 4.0% , which is below the mean value found for a `` normal '' elliptical galaxy ( @xmath2 50% , dressler & shectman 1987 ) .    if one considers the `` canonical '' limit of 25% for the definition of a bl lac object ( stocke et al . \n 1991 ) then j2310 - 43 can not be considered a bl lac . on the other end march et al . \n ( 1996 ) have proposed that objects with a ca ii contrast below 40% are likely to have an extra source of continuum , besides stellar , and consequently they have to be considered as possible low - luminosity bl lac candidates . \n the observed contrast can be used to set limits on the presence of such a non - stellar continuum , at least in the wavelength range 3700  @xmath9 4300  ( object rest frame ) . to this end , we have considered the spectrum of a `` normal '' galaxy , showing a ca ii contrast of about 60% . \n then , we have `` added '' a non - stellar continuum to the spectrum , in the form of a power - law ( @xmath16 ) with a spectral index ranging from 0 to 2 , and we have computed the ca ii contrast as a function of the fraction of non - stellar over stellar continuum . \n our results show that the ca ii contrast is about 40% if the non - stellar contribution is approximately equal to the stellar continuum , ( integrated between 3750  and 4250 ) . \n values of the contrast of @xmath17 25% ( the limit used to define a bl lac object ) are obtained when the non - stellar contribution is about 3 times or more higher than the stellar continuum . \n thus , in j2310 - 43 , which has a ca ii `` contrast '' of @xmath18 , the non - thermal component can still be present but at an intensity level comparable or lower than the fraction of the stellar continuum falling in the extraction region within the slit aperture . \n we have also extracted the spectrum of j2310 - 43 considering only the outer region of the galaxy , thus minimizing the contribution of the nucleus , and we have found that the ca ii `` contrast '' increases to 47%@xmath15% . we consider this as a further evidence that j2310 - 43 harbors in its nucleus a weak source of non - thermal continuum that can be detected only if the stellar contribution falling in the aperture is kept at a minimum . \n these results are consistent with the observed color of j2310 - 43 ( determined for the whole galaxy ) that indicates a negligible non - stellar contribution in the optical band , as discussed by tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) .    in conclusion , \n the spectroscopic observations of the galaxy j2310 - 43 presented here support the interpretation that this object represents the faint tail of the bl lac population , in which the extra source of continuum is present but does not contribute significantly to the optical spectrum . \n further observations ( polarization , radio spectral index , high resolution x - ray spectroscopy , etc . ) \n are obviously needed to characterize the presence of such non - thermal continuum emission in j2310 - 43 . \n it is worth noting that a similar object ( e0336 - 248 ) has been recently discovered by halpern et al . \n also in this case , the computed ca ii `` contrast '' ( 33% ) does not meet the nominal criterion of @xmath17 25% for classification as a bl lac object . nevertheless , these authors have produced convincing evidence for the presence of a non - stellar continuum in the spectrum of e0336 - 248 and , consequently , for its classification as a weak bl lac object . \n clearly , a re - assessment of the ca ii `` contrast '' criterion for the definition of a bl lac is needed . \n tananbaum et al . \n ( 1997 ) ask  how common are sources such as j2310 - 43 ? \n \" we have reason to believe that they may be more common than currently recognized . \n we have recently initiated a survey of radio emitting x - ray sources ( the rex survey , caccianiga et al . \n 1997a , 1997b ) with the aim of selecting a new large sample of bl lac objects and radio loud quasars . to enter the sample , a source has to be detected in a pointed rosat pspc observation _ and _ in the vla nvss survey , above \n well defined flux limits and thresholds . during the optical identification program of the rex sources we have already found six objects that are similar to j2310 - 43 . \n the properties of these objects will be presented and discussed in detail elsewhere ; here we recall that , like j2310 - 43 , they have x - ray luminosity in the range @xmath19 ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and radio luminosity in the range @xmath20 ( 1.4 ghz ) . \n they are all radio loud ( @xmath21 0.35 ) and they all have a caii  contrast \" between 25% and 40% and no emission lines in their spectrum . \n they do not seem to lie preferably in a cluster environment . \n we note that these six objects have been found out of @xmath22 new spectroscopic identifications . \n it is unfortunate however that , given the very low identification rate so far obtained for the rex survey , we can not , at present , make an estimate of the space density of these objects . \n we thank h. tananbaum for useful comments on an earlier version of this paper and a. wolter for bringing to our attention the work on e0336 - 2248 . this work has received partial financial support from the italian space agency ( asi contract 95-rs-72 dmd . \n 161fae/2 , asi ars-96 - 71 dmd . \n caccianiga , a. , della ceca , r. , maccacaro , t. , & wolter , a.,1997a , submitted to apj caccianiga , a. , della ceca , r. , maccacaro , t. , ruscica , c. , & wolter , a. 1997b , mem . \n astr . it . \n 68 , 325 dressler , a. , & shectman s. 1987 , aj , 94 , 899 elvis , m. at al . \n 1981 , apj , 246 , 20 halpern , j.p . , \n eracleous , m. , & forster , k. 1997 , aj in press march , m.j.m . , \n browne , i.w.a . , \n impey , c.d . , & smith , p.s . \n 1996 , mnras 281 , 425 stocke , j.t . \n 1991 , apjs , 76 , 813 tananbaum , h. , tucker , w. , prestwich , a. , & remillard , r. 1997 , apj 476 , 83 tucker , w. , tananbaum , h. , & remillard , r. 1995 , apj , 444 , 532", "StartTimeOffset": 1469451973944, "RequestID": "4e98e302317ff678f0d194f9fa554f9eb9b21c47", "TotalTokens": 3141}

axis source psf is affected . \n if the selection # xmmea_em to the mos event list is applied to generate spectra of on - axis sources , only the bad column is marked bad but not the adjacent columns . \n this missing column is taken into account by _ arfgen _ in the computation of the effective area .    ]    if the more conservative selection flag flag==0 is used for the analysis , also the two adjacent columns are masked , therefore 3 columns are removed , causing the loss of up to 10 -

house calculations for arbitrary mixtures more versatile and expedient . \n regarding data accuracy , there is excellent overall agreement between the opal @xcite and op results as discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . \n rosseland mean opacities are sensitive to both the basic atomic data used and the assumed abundances of the chemical elements . \n what had been a good agreement between theory and the helioseismological data was found to be less good using revised solar abundances from @xcite . \n the revised op opacities have been instrumental in discussions of that problem @xcite . \n the modelling of stellar interiors , on the other hand , is being renewed with the solar experience . \n present ( _ wire _ , _ most _ , _ corot _ ) and future ( _ kepler _ ) space probes and the well established solar methods are giving the field of asteroseismology remarkable growth and the guarantee of invaluable data @xcite . \n in future work on stellar models it may be desirable to take account of revisions in abundances similar to those performed for the sun .    for some types of stars \n , models must take into account microscopic diffusion processes , e.g. radiative levitation , gravitational settling and thermal diffusion , as they can affect the internal and thermal structures , the depth of the convection zone , pulsations and give rise to surface abundance anomalies @xcite . as reviewed by @xcite , \n such processes are relevant in the description of chemically peculiar stars , horizontal - branch stars , white dwarfs and neutron stars , and in globular cluster age determinations from population  ii turnoff stars . \n furthermore , in order to solve the outstanding discrepancy of the atmospheric li abundance in old stars with that predicted in big - bang nucleosynthesis , @xcite have proposed li sinking deep into the star due to diffusion . \n this hypothesis has been recently confirmed in the observations by @xcite . \n the opcd_2.1 release includes data and codes to compute the radiative accelerations required for studies of diffusion processes . \n it should be noted that the radiative accelerations are summed over ionization stages and that data for the calculation of diffusion coefficients are calculated assuming that the distribution over ionization stages of the diffusing ions is the same as that in the ambient plasma . \n the validity of this approximation is discussed by @xcite .    in some cases , \n particularly when element stratification depends on stellar depth , calculations of mean opacities and radiative accelerations must be repeated at each depth point of the model and at each time step of the evolution , and thus the use of codes more efficient than those in opcd_2.1 may be necessary . \n this becomes critical in the new distributed computing grid environments where the network transfer of large volumes of data is a key issue . in the present work we have looked into these problems , and , as a solution , report on the implementation of a general purpose , interactive server for astrophysical opacities referred to as opserver . \n it has been installed at the ohio supercomputer center , columbus , ohio , usa , from where it can be accessed through a web page or a linkable subroutine library . \n it can also be downloaded locally to be run on a stand - alone basis but it will demand greater computational facilities . in section  2 \n we discuss the computational strategy of the codes in opcd_2.1 followed by a description of opserver in section  3 . in section  4 \n we include some tests as an indication of its performance with a final summary in section  5 . \n we highlight here some of the key features of the codes in opcd_2.1 . for a chemical mixture specified by abundance fractions @xmath0 \n , they essentially compute two types of data : rosseland mean opacities ( rmo ) and radiative accelerations ( ra ) .      for the frequency variable @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , rmo \n are given by the harmonic mean of the opacity cross section @xmath3 of the mixture @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean atomic weight . \n the @xmath3 is a weighted sum of the monochromatic opacity cross sections for each of the chemical constituents @xmath6 and is conveniently tabulated on the @xmath7-mesh @xmath8 where @xmath9 ^ 2}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 . \n the rationale behind the @xmath7-mesh is that it enhances frequency resolution where @xmath11 is large @xcite . \n similarly , the ra for a selected @xmath12 element can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is its atomic weight and @xmath15 the speed of light . the function @xmath16 is given in terms of the effective temperature @xmath17 and fractional depth @xmath18 of the star by @xmath19 with @xmath20 the dimensionless parameter @xmath21 depends on the cross section for momentum transfer to the @xmath12 element @xmath22 - a_k(u)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a correction to remove the contributions of electron scattering and momentum transfer to the electrons . both @xmath24 and @xmath23 , which are hereafter referred to as the mono data set ( @xmath251  gb ) , \n are tabulated in equally spaced @xmath7 intervals to facilitate accurate interpolation schemes . \n the computational strategy adopted in the opcd_2.1 release is depicted in the flowcharts of figure  1 where it may be seen that calculations of rmo and ra are carried in two stages . in a time consuming stage  1 , rmo and ra are computed with the mixv and accv codes , respectively , on a representative tabulation of the complete temperature  electron - density @xmath26 plane . in mixv \n the chemical mixture is specified in the input file mixv.in as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hydrogen and metal mass - fractions , @xmath30 the number of elements , and @xmath31 and @xmath0 are the metal nuclear charges and fractional abundances . in accv , \n the input data ( accv.in ) are @xmath32 where now @xmath12 runs over the @xmath30 elements of the mixture , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the nuclear charge and @xmath35 abundance multipliers of the test @xmath36 element . \n input data formats in either mixv.in or accv.in give the user flexible control over chemical mixture specifications .    as shown in figure  1 , the intermediate output files mixv.xx ( @xmath2585 kb ) containing @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass - density , and acc.xx ( @xmath25470 kb ) with @xmath39 are written to disk . \n they are then respectively read by the codes opfit and accfit in stage  2 for fast bicubic interpolations of rmo and ra on stellar depth profiles @xmath40 specified by the user in the opfit.in and accfit.in input files . \n the final output files are opfit.xx containing @xmath41 and accfit.xx with @xmath42    in this computational approach , performance is mainly limited by the summation in equation  ( [ sum ] ) which implies disk reading the mono data set ; for instance , in mixv it takes up to @xmath2590% of the total elapsed time . \n opcd_2.1 also includes other codes such as mx and ax which respectively compute rmo and ra for a star depth profile . \n the chemical mixture can be fully varied at each depth point using the specifications in equations ( [ mix1][mix2 ] ) , the rmo and ra being obtained in a one - step process using bicubic interpolations without splines . \n these methods are thus suitable for cases with multi - mixture depth profiles @xcite . further details of all the opcd codes are contained in the reference manual . \n in opserver the computational capabilities of the codes in opcd_2.1 are greatly enhanced by the following innovative adaptations .    1 . \n the codes are restructured within a client  server network architecture whereby the time consuming stage  1 is performed on a powerful processor while the fast stage  2 is moved to the client , e.g. a web server or a user workstation . in this arrangement performance \n could be affected by the client  server transfer of the mixv.xx and acc.xx intermediate files , but since they are never larger than 0.5 mb , it is not expected to be a deterrent with present - day bandwidths . in a local installation where both the client and server reside on the same machine \n , communication is managed through shared buffers in main memory ; \n i.e. the corresponding data in mixv.xx and acc.xx are not written to disk . \n the codes are transcribed as a subroutine library  to be referred to hereafter as the oplibrary  which can be linked by the user stellar modelling code for recurrent subroutine calls that avoid data writing on disk . \n that is , the input data in the mixv.in , accv.in , opfit.in and accfit.in files and the output tables in the opfit.xx and accfit.xx files ( see figure  1 ) are now handled as subroutine parameters while the intermediate mixv.xx and acc.xx files are passed via shared main - memory buffers . \n chemical mixtures are again specified with the formats of equations ( [ mix1][mix2 ] ) which allow full variation at each depth point in a single subroutine call . \n rmo / ra are computed with the complete mono data set always loaded in main memory thus avoiding lengthy and repeated disk readings . \n this is achieved by implementing opserver on a dedicated server where mono is permanently resident in ram , or in the case of a local installation , by disk - reading it once at the outset of a modelling calculation . \n when accessing the remote server , client data requests are addressed through the http protocol , i.e. in terms of a uniform resource locator ( url ) . \n this allows data fetching from the central facility through an interactive web page or a network access subroutine , the latter being particularly suitable for a stellar model code that is to be run in a distributed grid environment . \n the do - loop that computes the summation of equation  ( [ sum ] ) has been parallelized in openmp which provides a simple , scalable and portable scheme for shared - memory platforms . \n as shown in figure  2 , the current opserver enterprise is implemented as a client  server model at the ohio supercomputer center ( osc ) . \n the web server communicates with the supercomputer via a socket interface . \n earlier versions were developed on an sgi origin2000 server with the powerfortran parallelizing compiler . \n the current version runs on a linux system with fortran openmp directives . \n opserver offers three user modes with full functionality except when otherwise indicated in the following description . \n * mode  a * : :    in this mode opserver is set up locally on a stand - alone basis ( see    figure  2 ) . \n the facilities of the osc are not used . \n a new opcd release    ( opcd_3.3 ) is    downloaded , followed by ( i ) installation of both the oplibrary and the    mono data set and ( ii ) linking of the oplibrary to the user modelling    code . \n computations of rmo / ra are preceded by the reading of the    complete mono data set from disk and therefore requires at least 1  gb    of ram . \n * mode  b * : :    in this mode , the oplibrary is downloaded , installed and linked to the    user code , but stage  1 is performed remotely at the osc ( see    figure  2 ) . \n this option has been customized for stellar modelling in a    distributed grid environment that would otherwise imply ( i.e. mode  a )    the network transfer , installation and disk - reading of the mono data    set at runtime . \n it is also practical when local computer capabilities    ( ram and/or disk space ) are limited . \n the functions provided by the mx    and ax codes have not been implemented . \n * mode  c * : :    in this mode rmo / ra computations at the osc are requested through an    interactive web page which allows    both stage  1 and stage  2 to be carried out remotely or , alternatively ,    stage  2 locally by downloading the mixv.xx/acc.xx intermediate files    ( see figure . \n 1 ) with the browser for further processing with local    opfit / accfit executables . \n opserver benchmarks were initially carried out on an sgi origin2000 multiprocessor at the osc with an earlier release of opcd . \n for the standard s92 mixture @xcite , the mixv code took up to 140  s to compute the mixv.xx file , of which 126  s were dedicated to disk - reading and 14  s to the actual computing of the mean opacities . \n opserver took on average @xmath43  s to compute mixv.xx which was not written to disk unless requested . in figure \n 3 we show the acceleration obtained on the origin2000 through parallelization where the calculation of mean opacities is reduced to 2  s with 8 processors . \n further significant acceleration is prevented by data transfer overheads . \n on more recent workstations , the local performances of the codes in opcd_2.1 and opserver depend on processor speed and ram and cache sizes . \n for instance , on a powermac g5 ( powerpc 970fx processor at 2.0 ghz , 1 gb of ram and l2 cache of 512 kb ) the first time mixv is run it takes for a single s92 mixture 103.8  s to compute the rmo , but on subsequent runs the elapsed time is reduced to an average of @xmath44  s. similarly , opserver takes 103.3  s which is then reduced to @xmath45  s on subsequent runs . \n once the mono data set is loaded in ram by opserver ( mode a ) , calculations of rmo for a single s92 mixture only take @xmath46  s and @xmath47  s for ra for the test element ar . in mode \n b , where stage 1 is carried out remotely at the osc and the mixv.xx and accv.xx files are transferred at the relatively low rate of 1.88 kb / s , computations of rmo and ra take @xmath48  s and @xmath49  s , respectively . \n the noticeable longer time taken for the latter is due to the transfer time taken for the larger accv.xx file . \n rosseland mean opacities and radiative accelerations can be computed from op data in any one of the following ways . \n ( i ) download the original opcd_2.1 package as described by @xcite and perform all calculations locally . \n \\(ii ) mode a , download the upgraded opcd_3.3 package , install opserver and perform all calculations locally by linking the subroutines in the oplibrary \n . calculations with opserver are more efficient but require large local computer memory . \n \\(iii ) mode b , as mode a but with stage 1 performed remotely at the osc . \n mode b is convenient if fast calculations are required but local computer memory is limited or when stellar modelling is to be carried out in a grid environment . \n \\(iv ) mode c , perform all calculations remotely at the osc through an interactive web page whereby files are downloaded locally with the browser . \n we acknowledge the invaluable assistance of juan luis chaves and gilberto daz of cecalcula during the initial stages of opserver . \n we are also much indebted to the ohio supercomputer center , columbus , ohio , usa , for hosting opserver and for technical assistance ; to the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg , france , for hosting the opcd releases ; and to drs josslen aray , manuel bautista , juan murgich and fernando ruette of ivic for allowing us to test the opserver installation on different platforms . \n fd would like to thank s.  rouchy for technical support . \n akp and fd have been partly supported by a grant from the us national science foundation . \n asplund m. , grevesse n. , sauval a. j. , 2005 , in barnes t. g. , bash f. n. , eds , asp conference series vol . \n 336 , cosmic abundances as records of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis . astronomical society of the pacific , san francisco , p.25 badnell n. r. , bautista , m. a. , butler , k. , delahaye f. , mendoza c. , palmeri p. , zeippen c. j. , seaton , m. j. , 2005 , mnras , 360 , 458", "StartTimeOffset": 1487156805378, "RequestID": "36eb4a1cc7863872b90b65a56b99c713a4b6341f", "TotalTokens": 3784}

based lpso structure , it is therefore essential to further address the preferential energetics at finite temperature . to investigate the formation near the melting point , the short - range order ( sro ) parameter is of great significance  @xcite  @xcite \n however , comprehensive theoretical approach to address sro in disordered phase of multicomponent alloy including a large number of atoms like mg -

plane and inter - plane pair clusters , re - zn ( gd - al ) , zn - zn(al - al ) , and mg - mg clusters , which construct re - zn ( gd - al ) l1@xmath0 clusters as illustrated in fig.[fig : fig2 ] . \n these clusters probabilities were measured from those at @xmath30 = 1500 k.     +     cluster consisted of re(gd ) and zn(al ) . \n black and white spheres represent re ( gd ) and zn ( al ) respectively . \n translucence gray triangles are ( 111 ) planes for fcc structure . \n red and blue lines represent in - plane and inter - plane cluster s bondings , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] +    to investigate the stability of solute pair clusters consisted of re and zn ( gd and al ) , we also calculated solute energy of each pair cluster into mixed structure . \n we arranged re - zn ( gd - al ) pair cluster into hcp , fcc and intermediate region of pure - mg mixed structure and compared total energies with that of pure mg on mixed structure . \n we performed first - principles calculations using a dft code , the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite  @xcite , to obtain the total energies for mg - re - zn and mg - gd - al alloys . \n all - electron kohn - sham equations were solved by employing the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method  @xcite  @xcite . \n we selected the generalized - gradient approximation of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( gga - pbe ) form  @xciteas the exchange - correlation functional . \n the plane - wave cutoff energy was set at 350 ev throughout the calculations . \n brillouin zone sampling was performed on the basis of the monkhorst - pack scheme  @xcite . \n the k - point mesh is set to 4@xmath314@xmath314 and the smearing parameter was 0.15 ev  @xcite . \n figure [ fig : fig3 ] is the temperature dependence of pair clusters probabilities of mg - y - zn , mg - gd - al and mg - la - zn system . \n first , let us focus on the inter - plane pair clusters probability . in mg - y - zn and mg - gd - al system , y - zn and gd - al inter - plane pair cluster \n s probabilities are increasing . \n this is consistent with the forming l1@xmath0 cluster consisted of y(gd ) and zn(al ) . \n moreover , the probability of mg - mg and y - zn(gd - al ) clusters become numerically superior to that of zn - zn cluster after introducing stacking fault into hcp structure , which agrees well with the tendency of phase separation into mg- and re - zn - rich phases along perpendicular direction . as a results of other mg - re - zn system ( re = dy \n , ho , er , tb ) , re - zn probabilities have the same tendencies , which are also shown in appendix . on \n the other hand , in mg - la - zn system that dose not form lpso structure , la - zn inter - plane pair clusters probability of mixed structure is not increasing compared with that of disordered phases at @xmath30 = 1500k . \n ( fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) . forming re - zn \n ( gd - al ) pair cluster is a necessary requirements for constructing l1@xmath0 clusters ; this preference of inter - plane pair clusters in disordered phases therefore have close relationship with the formation of lpso structure \n . then , mg - re - zn lpso system is classified by the formation process . \n type 1 is that the lpso phase forms during solidification ( re = y , dy , ho , er in this study)@xcite@xcite and type 2 is that a phase precipitates from @xmath19-mg solid solution with soaking at 773 k ( re = tb in this study )  @xcite . \n these results of sro in mg - re - zn systems mean that there is a slight difference between the preference of sro with respect to formation process of lpso structure . \n next , we discuss the relationship between the in - plane pair cluster s probability and formation of lpso structure . as shown in upper part of fig.[fig : fig3 ] , y - zn and gd - al in - plane pair cluster s probabilities of the mixed structure are decreasing compared with those of hcp structure , which is the same tendency for the other systems that form lpso structure ( fig.[fig : fig4 ] ) . \n let us consider this tendency of sro from the viewpoint of the solute energy of pair cluster into mixed structure consisted of pure - mg . \n solute energies of in - plane cluster of re(gd ) and zn(al ) into fcc region were lower than those into hcp region . as a result of this estimation of solute energy , re - zn ( gd - al ) clusters \n can be more stable on in - plane layer in fcc region than hcp region . \n thus , although the probabilities of re - zn ( gd - al ) in - plane clusters on a structure with only hcp stacking sequence are increasing , this tendency is considered to become opposite on the mixed structure , @xmath32 , the pair cluster probabilities in hcp region will be decreasing after introducing stacking fault . on the other hand , in fcc region on the mixed structure , re - zn ( gd - al ) in - \n plane clusters are stable in terms of solute energy . \n the sro in fcc region on the mixed structure should therefore be increasing , which is consistent with the forming l1@xmath0 clusters in fcc region . \n this opposing tendency of sro between fcc and hcp region should result in the tendency of sro of re - zn ( gd - al ) in - plane cluster on the mixed structure . in the previous study , \n the interfacial energy of a disordered phase with an introduced stacking fault is lower than the linear average energy for hcp and fcc stacking sequences and the interface gains  negative `` energy ''  @xcite . \n thus , introducing stacking faults into hcp region has an effect not only to the stabilizing but also the preference of sro , which exhibits introducing stacking faults should play an essential role for the forming of lpso structure . \n to assess the formation of mg - based lpso structure , we systematically investigate the preference of sro of mg - re - zn ( re = y , la , er , ho , dy , tb ) and mg - gd - al ternary alloy systems through first - principles calculation combined with the information of disordered state on a lattice under spatial constraint . in the system forming lpso structure , re - zn and gd - al pair cluster probabilities are increasing due to introducing stacking faults into hcp region . in the contrast , mg - la - zn system that is not forming lpso dose not show that tendency , which means that the preference of sro of pair cluster has the profound relationship with forming the characteristic structure in lpso . \n this work is supported by a grant -

{"ContextTokens": 3539, "GeneratedTokens": 197, "SynthesizedBody": "the discovery made by of a handful of x - ray emitting kiloparsec - scale jets opens a new window on the study of the physics of relativistic jets . \n the x - ray emission offers the possibility to observe directly the sites of particle acceleration , and allows us to calculate important physical quantities such as the transported power . for this purpose \n it is of primary importance to establish the mechanism responsible for the observed x - ray emission . \n recently chartas et al . \n ( 2000 ) and schwartz et al . \n ( 2000 ) reported the discovery of the x - ray emission from the jet of a distant powerful quasar pks  0637752 ( @xmath4 ) . from the shape of the spectral energy distribution \n , one can exclude that the origin of the x - rays is synchrotron emission from the same electron population responsible for the radio continuum . \n this is because the observed optical flux is well below ( about a factor of 10 ) the line connecting smoothly the radio and x - ray emission . \n schwartz et al . \n ( 2000 ) , in discussing several possibilities for producing the observed x - rays from knot wk7.8 ( notation from schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , exclude bremsstrahlung emission and inverse - compton scattering of photons originating in the quasar . \n the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scenario implies a magnetic field well below the equipartition value , so schwartz et al . \n conclude that a viable explanation is de - beamed ssc emission \n . however , this solution also presents problems which we address here .    in this letter \n we discuss the possibility that x - rays are produced through inverse compton scattering of photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . \n the observed superluminal motion in the jet on parsec scales , together with the close alignment between parsec and kiloparsec scale jets ( e.g. , tingay et al . 1998 , schwartz et al . 2000 ) suggests that the kiloparsec scale emission could be beamed , with a doppler factor as high as 10 - 15 . \n this effect was possibly not taken into account in the cmb model discussed by chartas et al . \n ( 2000 ; see their fig \n if the x - ray jet of pks  0637752 is indeed sufficiently doppler beamed , inverse compton scattering of cmb photons can easily explain the observed x - ray emission . in   2 we discuss in detail the implications of an ec / cmb vs an ssc model and in \n 3 we summarize our conclusions . \n througout the letter we assume @xmath5 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath6 . \n given the observed spectral energy distribution of knot wk7.8 in pks  0637752 , the most plausible mechanism responsible for the x - ray emission is inverse compton scattering , although other mechanisms , such as synchrotron emission from a second electron population can not be ruled out . \n possible sources of soft photons include the synchrotron photons themselves ( ssc ) or a radiation field external to the jet ( external compton , or ec ) . given the large distance of the jet from the nucleus , we can exclude that an important contribution comes from the stellar and nuclear radiation of the quasar ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) .    among other possible external sources of soft photons , \n the cmb is particularly important . \n its energy density , at the redshift of the source , is a factor @xmath7 times the local value . \n more importantly , in the frame of the relativistic electrons in the jet , it is enhanced by a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma ( e.g. , ghisellini et al . \n 1998 ) .    for any ssc or ec model , \n it is possible to constrain the allowed values of magnetic field and doppler beaming factor using standard formulae ( e.g. , tavecchio , maraschi & ghisellini 1998 ) . \n we assume that the radiating region is approximately spherical , with radius @xmath10  cm ( corresponding to @xmath110.3  arcsec ; schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , filled with tangled magnetic field with intensity @xmath12 , and characterized by doppler factor @xmath13)^{-1}$ ] . \n the particle distribution is a power law with index @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the observed radio spectral slope ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ; @xmath17 ) , and with low and high energy cut - off @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . \n note that the x - ray spectrum also has this spectral index , @xmath20 ( chartas et al . 2000 ) , as expected in either ec or ssc models .    using standard expressions for synchrotron and inverse compton emissivities , corrected for doppler beaming , and using the observed radio , optical , and x - ray fluxes as constraints , for both models \n the allowed values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 describe a line . \n these are shown in figure  1 for the ssc and ec / cmb models . \n also shown in figure  1 are lines corresponding to equipartition between magnetic field and radiating particles for two values of the assumed @xmath18 ( the line is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath22 ) . \n the ssc line depends primarily on the ratio of observed x - ray to radio luminosity . \n the condition for the ec / cmb model has a different slope due to the role of additional beaming of the cmb radiation in the rest frame of the emitting plasma  i.e. , the electrons `` see '' a beamed cmb flux from the forward direction ( e.g. , dermer 1995 , ghisellini et al . 1998 ) . for the ssc emission , \n a greater degree of beaming implies a lower synchrotron energy density in the jet frame , which in turn implies lower values of the magnetic field for a given compton / synchrotron luminosity ratio ( solid line in fig .  1 ) . \n in the ec / cmb model ( dashed line in fig .  1 ) , in contrast , the amplification of the external radiation increases with @xmath21 , implying a larger energy density of soft photons in the jet frame , and thus a higher magnetic field for a given @xmath23 .    from figure  1 \n it is clear that the ssc model implies a very large deviation from equipartition unless the source is significantly de - beamed , with @xmath24 ( schwartz et al . \n 2000 ) , while the ec / cmb model is compatible with equipartition for a moderate value of the doppler factor , @xmath25 . \n this is consistent with measurements of superluminal motion in the pks  0637752 jet on vlbi scales ( lovell 2000 ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( implying @xmath28 ) . \n we computed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) for both the synchrotron plus ec / cmb and the synchrotron plus ssc models for a homogeneous sphere filled with relativistic electrons ( as described by tavecchio et al . \n the cmb spectrum is modeled as a blackbody and the compton scattering calculation takes into account the full klein - nishina cross - section . in figure  2 \n we compare our best results with the observed radio , optical and x - ray fluxes from knot wk7.8 ( from chartas et al . \n 2000 ) . \n the ec / cmb spectrum is obtained using equipartition values for the parameters , @xmath29  g and @xmath30 ( see fig .  1 ) . for the small angles implied by vlbi observations , @xmath31 \n , we can also assume @xmath32 . \n the electron distribution is described by a power law with low- and high - energy cutoffs , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and normalization @xmath35  @xmath36 . \n the value of @xmath18 was chosen so that the low energy spectral break of the ec / cmb component lies in the range @xmath37 . \n we could fit the spectrum with values in the range @xmath38 ; for lower @xmath18 the ec emission would over - predict the observed optical flux , while for higher values the x - ray spectrum would have a very steep slope . \n the value of @xmath19 is fixed by the optical point and by the values of @xmath12 and @xmath21 . for the above parameters the ssc contribution is several orders of magnitude below the ec / cmb emission and \n is not visible in the figure . \n the predicted x - ray spectral slope matches well the observed slope ( @xmath39 ; chartas et al . \n 2000 ) . \n we calculated the ssc spectrum for the marginally unbeamed case , @xmath40 and @xmath41  g ( see fig .  1 ) , as a sort of `` best case '' scenario . for larger \n beaming ( @xmath42 ) , the magnetic field is even farther from equipartition ( @xmath43  g ) , while for lower doppler factor ( a very de - beamed jet ) , the jet may approach equipartition but the total implied energy grows very large ( see further discussion below ) . \n the low- and high - energy cut - offs of the electron distribution are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and the normalization is @xmath46  @xmath36 . \n the high value of @xmath18 is imposed by the necessity of truncating the ssc spectrum below the soft x - ray band in order not to overproduce the optical flux . \n if , as in fig 2 , the low - energy tail of the ssc spectrum gives a significant contribution to the optical flux a strong uv emission from the jet would be expected . \n note also that the predicted x - ray spectrum is somewhat harder than actually observed . \n given @xmath12 and @xmath21 , together with the observed synchrotron flux , we can calculate the total kinetic power transported by the jet : @xmath47 ( e.g. , celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ) , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the energy densities of protons , electrons , and magnetic field , respectively . \n the constraints are quite interesting in the case of the ec / cmb model , because most of the jet energy is in the less relativistic electrons ( given their steep energy distribution ) , and it is those electrons that produce most of the x - ray emission . for minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath33 as derived above , and assuming equal numbers of electrons and ( cold ) protons , we find @xmath51  erg  s@xmath2 , consistent with the jet power estimated for the most powerful blazars ( e.g. , celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ; tavecchio et al 2000 ) . \n this is also consistent with the kinetic luminosity required to power the lobes of giant radio galaxies ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) . \n in contrast , the ssc model requires an unreasonably high value of the jet power . for @xmath40 , even if @xmath52 ( which would imply @xmath53 ) and for the lowest possible electron cutoff energy , @xmath54 from the spectral constraints discussed above , we find @xmath55  erg  s@xmath2 irrespective of the proton contribution since the average energy of the electrons is larger than the proton mass . for the de - beamed case \n the situation becomes far worse . also , the de - beamed model implies that the jet , the projection of which is very well aligned from vlbi to kiloparsec scales , must actually bend away from us through a 90-degree angle .    in the ec / cmb model the radiative power of the knot \n is dominated by the @xmath56-ray peak . \n its beaming - corrected value ( sikora et al . \n 1997 ) is @xmath57  erg  s@xmath2 . \n the position of the @xmath56-ray peak , @xmath58 , is very well constrained because the cmb peak frequency ( @xmath59 ) is known and the values of the doppler factor ( @xmath21 ) and the maximum lorentz factor ( @xmath19 ) are well constrained by the assumption of equipartition . \n the corresponding @xmath56-ray power for the minimally beamed ssc model ( @xmath40 ) is @xmath60  ergs  s@xmath2 , and this value increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath21 .    even for the ec / cmb model , \n the kinetic power of the jet is very high compared to the observed luminosity , implying very low radiative efficiency . \n ( the efficiency is higher for the ssc model and it increases as @xmath61 decreases . ) \n the electrons emitting via synchrotron in the optical band and via ec / cmb in the @xmath56-rays have relatively short lifetimes , @xmath62  s ( compton cooling dominates synchrotron cooling ) and can travel for at most @xmath63  kpc . \n this is consistent with ( @xmath64 times ) the size of the knot , which can therefore arise from a single acceleration site . \n given the close alignment of the jet with the line of sight , its minimum de - projected length is @xmath65  mpc , and _ in situ _ reacceleration beyond knot wk7.8 is required in either case . \n we conclude , from spectral , equipartition and jet power arguments , that inverse compton scattering of cmb photons is the most likely emission mechanism for the observed x - rays from pks  0637752 . \n we have shown that the x - ray emission from knot wk7.8 in the pks  0637752 jet likely originates from upscattering of cmb photons provided the jet is still relativistic on kiloparsec scales . \n the physical parameters in the emitting region are consistent with equipartition for moderate values of the doppler beaming factor , @xmath25 , which also agrees with observed superluminal motion in this jet ( albeit on much smaller scales ) . \n given a high degree of relativistic beaming , the size of the knot is also consistent with the diffusion length for the radiating electrons . \n modeling the radio - to - x - ray continuum constrains the value of the minimum lorentz factor of the emitting electrons to be @xmath3 . \n this is the first such constraint from spectral modeling . generally , the synchrotron emission from these electrons is self absorbed ( here , @xmath66  hz ) . \n minimum values for electron energy have been inferred from general arguments ( e.g. , reynolds et al . \n 1996 ) or the lack of faraday depolarization ( e.g. , wardle et al . 1998 ) , but a direct probe of @xmath18 is possible only when the observed spectrum describes a sharp break in the compton - scattered radiation . \n the estimated kinetic power of the jet , @xmath67  ergs  s@xmath2 , is then consistent with that of other powerful blazar jets . \n the ssc model requires far less reasonable assumptions , notably that the parsec - scale jet is nearly aligned with the line of sight but the kiloparsec - scale jet is roughly in the plane of the sky , and implies a jet kinetic power at least one order of magnitude larger . \n observations of the jet in the uv could help discriminating between the two possibilities .    with the favored ec / cmb model ( and also in the ssc case ) \n , the x - ray jet has remarkably low radiative efficiency , suggesting pks  0637752 should have powerful extended radio lobes or be in an early phase of evolution . \n ft is grateful to stsci for hospitality during the preparation of this work . \n this work was supported in part by nasa grant nag5 - 9327 . \n ft and lm acknowledge partial support from grants cee erbfmrx - ct98 - 0195 and murst - cofin-98 - 02 - 15 - 41 . \n rms acknowledges support from nasa contract nas38252 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1502735510682, "RequestID": "38197dbf4c8e1db8f29618e90bc49c7e9570a8dc", "TotalTokens": 3736}
{"ContextTokens": 2798, "GeneratedTokens": 286, "SynthesizedBody": "galactic globular clusters are surprisingly rich in luminous x - ray sources @xcite . \n scenarios involving tidal capture by two stars @xcite and/or exchange reactions involving three stars @xcite are widely believed to be the sources of these strongly interacting binaries in clusters . the remarkable correlation between stellar encounter rate and number of x - ray sources in globular cluster cores \n @xcite supports this viewpoint . \n accreting white dwarf - main sequence star binaries  the cataclysmic variable ( cv ) stars  are almost certainly produced by the same mechanisms in clusters , and should also be plentiful in globulars @xcite . perhaps the best cluster to search for this predicted population is ngc 6397 . at a mere 3.3 kpc @xcite \n it is the closest globular cluster to the sun . \n thus even cvs resembling the least luminous known such objects ( with @xmath0 ) in this cluster should be detected with deep hst imagery . \n the initial discoveries of multiple x - ray sources @xcite and h@xmath1-bright stars @xcite in ngc 6397 were rapidly followed by spectrographic identification of essentially certain cvs with hydrogen and helium emission lines @xcite . remarkably , \n all four cvs in this cluster with hst spectra show significant , and in three of four cases , prominent heii 4686 . \n this line is seen almost exclusively in magnetic cvs and nova - like variables @xcite , prompting @xcite and @xcite to suggest that magnetic cvs might well be the dominant cv population in globular clusters .    about half of all known field cvs @xcite are dwarf novae ( dn ) . \n most field dn have been discovered because they undergo 2 - 5 magnitude outbursts every few weeks to months @xcite . \n in contrast , strongly magnetic cvs are _ not _ observed to undergo dn outbursts . \n this is because dn eruptions are likely caused by a disk instability @xcite , and the accretion disks of magnetic cvs have been truncated or are absent . \n since large archival hst datasets of globular cluster images are available , we have been systematically looking for erupting dwarf novae in the cores of all such clusters @xcite . here \n we report the results of a search of ngc 6397 to determine if any of the magnetic cv candidates undergo eruptions . \n remarkably we do find dwarf nova eruptions of two of the putative ngc 6397 magnetic cvs . \n the hubble space telescope has imaged ngc 6397 during 5 separate epochs from 1996 to 2003 . \n our own 2003 datasets focused on stis uv imagery , heretofore unavailable and particularly useful in detecting cvs . \n the dates of observation , pi and number of hst program , filters used , number of frames and total exposure time in each filter are given in the observing log which is table 1 . \n we have carried out visual inspection and aperture photometry of each of the nine known cvs ( referred to by @xcite as cv1 through cv9 ) in every available archival hst image . while a modest level of variability ( up to a few tenths of a magnitude ) is detectable in all nine cvs , and two of the objects ( cv1 and cv6 ) \n now have measured photometric periods @xcite , none is yet reported to show a dwarf nova - like outburst . \n the hst images of cv2 and cv3 are shown as photo - montages in figures 1 and 2 , respectively . the median brightness in every epoch , and in every available filter \n is shown with mean filter wavelength running from blue ( left ) to red ( right ) . \n we also show the 5-epoch light - curves of these two objects in figure 3 . \n each cv has been imaged in the wfpc2 f814w filter in epochs 1 , 2 and 3 , and in the stis ccdclear filter in epochs 4 and 5 . \n we have normalized epochs 1 - 3 with the first observation of each cv in epoch 1 , and epochs 4 - 5 with the first observation in epoch 4 . \n the key result of this paper is that the putative magnetic cataclysmic variables cv2 and cv3 are clearly detected as erupting dwarf novae . \n cv2 is seen to brighten ( in epoch 5 ) in the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) uv filter images . \n it is 2.7 magnitudes brighter than it was in epoch 4 . \n cv3 is seen in eruption in the second epoch in visible and near infrared pass - band images taken with the hst wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) . \n it is 1.8 magnitudes brighter in eruption than in quiescence . \n it is also seen in an intermediate brightness state ( between eruption and quiescence ) in blue and near - uv wfpc2 images in epoch 3 . \n the rise time of cv3 in epoch 2 ( about 2 days ) is well in accord with field dwarf nova rise times . \n the hst spectra of cv1 , cv2 and cv3 are presented in @xcite ; that of cv4 is given in @xcite . \n heii emission with equivalent widths in the range 6 - 15   appear in the spectra of all four objects , as do strong balmer lines . \n in particular , @xcite found for cv2 and cv3 , respectively , heii 4686 equivalent widths of 11 and 15  . \n the h@xmath2 equivalent widths of these same two objects are 32 and 59  , respectively . \n the disks in all four objects are faint ( @xmath3 ) . \n @xcite has carefully compared the disks and heii line ratios of cvs 1 - 4 with those of other cataclysmic systems . \n we refer the interested reader to that careful and exhaustive analysis , simply quoting here edmond et al.s conclusions regarding cvs 1 - 3 :    `` they do not appear to be recent novae or nova - likes because of their faint disks ( with extra evidence from their heii 4686   line ratios ) , nor do they appear to be dwarf novae because they have moderately strong heii lines . \n the final option is magnetic systems . to conclude , cvs 1 - 3 do not appear to be dwarf novae , but they could be dq her - type systems . \n a possible alternative to the dq her hypothesis is that some of the ngc 6397 cvs are old novae ( possibly in deep hibernation between outbursts ; see shara et al . \n 1986 ) . '' \n figures 1 and 2 of this paper convincingly demonstrate that cv2 and cv3 are , in fact , erupting dwarf novae despite their prominent heii emission . \n intensive monitoring with hst is essential to determine if all of the cv candidates in ngc 6397and other globular clusters  eventually erupt as dwarf novae . \n the hibernation scenario of cvs @xcite postulates that old novae eventually display dwarf - nova like outbursts . \n one old classical nova in the globular cluster m80 has been recovered @xcite at dwarf nova - like luminosity , and one recent erupting classical nova in a globular cluster ( of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ) has been reported @xcite . \n cv2 and cv3 could be hibernating old novae , but we have , at present , no observational proof that they once underwent nova eruptions . \n edmonds suggestion that the ngc 6397 cvs might be dq her - like magnetic systems ( also known as ips or intermediate polars ) might seem to be disproved with the observed dwarf nova eruptions of cv2 and cv3 . however , there are a few well - documented cases of ips that undergo dwarf nova eruptions , including gk per , ex hya , xy ari , do dra , tv col , ht cam and v1223 sgr . \n most dwarf novae show some heii emission ( see e.g. @xcite for a compilation ) , so cv2 and cv3 are certainly not unique in this respect . \n a comparison of the heii and h@xmath2 line strengths for the cvs in ngc 6397 and for field ips is presented by @xcite . \n both the line strengths and line ratios of heii and h@xmath2 for cv2 and cv3 are comparable to those of other low mass transfer rate ips , with ex hya being a particularly good match . \n @xcite have presented a model for dwarf nova - like outbursts in magnetic cvs , which they apply to tv col and gk per . if the white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable has a strong magnetic field , the inner region of the accretion disk is disrupted . \n they found that disruption of the inner disk region leads to shorter outbursts , and , for disk instabilities starting near the inner disk edge , to much longer intervals between outbursts . \n the outbursts of most ips tend to be rare , short and of only moderate amplitude . as an example \n , @xcite has noted that the ex hya outbursts occur at @xmath4 year intervals , last less than 4 days and are of only @xmath5 magnitude amplitude . if the many globular cluster cv candidates identified by chandra @xcite and hst @xcite are also intermediate polars then the remarkably small numbers of erupting dwarf novae found by hst in globular clusters @xcite can be explained . in particular , a population of even dozens of ips will only occasionally show a dwarf nova near maximum light . under this scenario \n we can predict that more of these cvs will eventually be seen to erupt if individual clusters are searched on dozens or hundreds of occasions . \n we have observed ngc 6397 with hst during 5 separate epochs . \n two of the four spectrographically confirmed cvs are observed to undergo dwarf nova eruptions with amplitudes of at least 1.8 and 2.7 magnitudes . \n these eruptions were somewhat unexpected , as both objects display moderately strong heii 4686 emission lines , generally associated with non - erupting , magnetic cvs . \n the dwarf nova - like eruptions reported in this paper can occur in intermediate polars , suggesting that some of the ngc 6397 cvs ( and by implication some of the cvs in other globular clusters ) are indeed magnetic systems . \n the apparent rarity of erupting dwarf novae in globular clusters with large cv candidate populations is reconciled if those cvs are infrequently erupting intermediate polars . \n support for program # 8630 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . \n , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 . \" \n l|l|c|c|c|c|c|c 1 : 3/6/96 & king & 700s,6@xmath6500s , & 4@xmath6500s , & 6@xmath640s,8s,1s & & & 2@xmath640s,8s,1s + & # 5929 & 28@xmath6400s,2@xmath680s , & 16@xmath6400s , & & & & + & & 2@xmath610s & 2@xmath680s,2@xmath610s & & & & + 2 : 4/3/99 & grindlay & & & 24@xmath640s,2@xmath68s & 1000s,4@xmath6900s & 38@xmath640s & 24@xmath640s + & # 7335 & & & 2@xmath61s & 18@xmath6800s,7@xmath6700s & 2@xmath68s,2@xmath61s & 2@xmath68s,2@xmath61s + & & & & & 2@xmath6140s & & + 3 : 11/4/01 & noll & 3@xmath6160s & 2@xmath6160s & & & & 3@xmath640s + & # 9313 & & & & & & + stis epochs & pi / prog . \n i d & clear ccd & ccd lp & clear mama & f25qtz & f25srf2 & + 4 : 3/28/03 & shara & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath6180s & & 533s,865s & & + & # 8630 & & & & 6@xmath6600s & & + 5 : 5/16/03 & `` '' & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath6180s & 3@xmath61000s & & 2@xmath6600s,883s & + & & & & & & 2@xmath61021s & +", "StartTimeOffset": 1506668014026, "RequestID": "d1dd1a9a4420abe739386bb4716373fa0a4548e7", "TotalTokens": 3084}

4.6 gev ) and aims at @xmath0 -charm physics @xcite . \n particle identification ( pid ) plays an essential role in the experimental study . \n one of the main sub - detectors , the time - of - flight ( tof ) system , responding for trigger and pid , consists of a barrel and two endcap . \n its capability of pid is determined by the flight time difference of particles species and the time resolution of the detector . \n the current tof system based on plastic scintillation and photmultiplier is built in 2001 @xcite . \n the calibration result of endcap tof system show that the time resolution for electrons in bhabha events is 148 ps , which is significantly worse than the resolution for mouns in dimu events ( 110ps , the designed goal ) . \n it s also found that scattering in mdc endplate materials can significantly influence the measured times of electrons in bhabha events @xcite . \n these findings indicate that the contribution to timing performance from multiple scattering interaction in the endcap material between the main drift chamber ( mdc ) and the etof is important . \n improvement is needed for the etof system to better meet the besiii physics goals . \n the r&d for this upgrade began in 2010 . \n monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation serves as an important tool to guide the upgrade , by comparing the performance of tof based on different technologies and optimizing the prototype design . in this paper a detailed simulation study , including all main features of the besiii etof system , is performed . the geant4 @xcite package ( geant version 4.09.02.p01 ) , commonly used in high energy experimental physics , is taken as the simulation tool . \n the besiii etof system is located between a helium - based multilayer mdc and a csi(tl ) crystal calorimeter ( emc ) inside the besiii spectrometer . \n the cross - sectional view of the etof system is shown in fig.[1 ] . \n please note although not shown in the figure , there are some materials , such as cables and readout electronics equipment , located between the endplate of the mdc endcap and the etof .        because the description of the detector structure and materials in the full besiii mc framework is quite complicated and difficult to modify and tune , \n we develop a simplified model to do this job for the etof system . \n the main structure in our simulation is shown in fig.[2 ] . \n basically it consists of three parts . \n the left part is the mdc volume , filled with a gas mixture of 60% he and 40% c3h8 . \n the field and sensitive wires in the mdc are not simulated , since their contribution to multiple scattering is small . \n the middle part , including the endplate of mdc and the readout electronics and cables , contains the major material budget between the mdc and etof . \n the composition and equivalent thickness of the materials in this part are estimated by using the full besiii mc framework . \n virtual ( non - interacting ) particles are emitted toward the mdc endcap region with @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3@xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the polar angle as shown in fig.[2 ] ) . \n for each step the virtual particle travelled , the material composition and equivalent thickness ( along z direction ) are recorded and accumulated until the virtual particle hit the etof . \n we find four major media dominate the material budget , namely aluminum , printed circuit board ( pcb ) , copper and plastic . \n their equivalent thicknesses are 21.12 mm , 9.77 mm , 0.58 mm and 9.59 mm , respectively . \n the right part is the etof system , in which the detailed structure depends on the detector technology used and will be addressed in the following part of the paper . \n the magnetic field of besiii is a uniform field of 1 tesla along the z direction . \n the current tof endcap , each consisting of 48 trapezoidal - shaped plastic scintillation ( bicron 404 ) modules , is located at 1330 mm away from the interaction point ( ip ) along the beam direction ( z axis in the global besiii coordinate system , as in fig.[2 ] ) . for each scintillator module , \n the length is 431 mm and the thickness is 48 mm , coving an azimuthal angle range of 7.5@xmath7 , as shown in fig.[3](c ) . \n more details can be found in reference @xcite . \n to simulate the bhabha events , which play an important role in the offline calibration of besiii tof system , electrons with momentum of 1.5gev / c are emitted from the ip . the injection direction with respect to the z axis \n is chosen to be @xmath3@xmath6 @xmath8 so that the extrapolated hit point locates near the center of the etof module in the radial direction . in the simulation \n we use standard geant4 electromagnetic ( em ) physics process including ionization , multiple scattering , bremsstrahlung and the gamma interaction with default settings for production thresholds of secondary particles . \n particles hitting the etof are electrons , positrons and gamma s . \n the hit position distributions on etof module , of primary electron , secondary electron / position and gamma , are shown in fig.[4](a),(b ) and ( c ) respectively . \n the etof module boundaries are also shown in the figures . in order to test the worst case , \n the extrapolated hit points are chosen to be at the center of an etof module ( so the hit multiplicity is highest ) .        to further understand the feature of the secondary charged particles and the effect on etof timing , we show in fig.[5 ] the radial hit position distribution on etof of the secondary electron and positron , as a function of transverse momentum ( pt ) . \n two notable bands can be seen in the figure , one with higher pt and r close to 64 cm , while another with very low pt and r close to 54 cm . \n combined with fig.[4](b ) , we can conclude a rough scenario that the band near r=64 cm mainly comes from bremsstrahlung gamma conversion to electron / position pair , mostly following the direction of primary electron , while another band located at r=54 cm are those low energy ( thus also low pt ) electrons and positions generated from the em shower generated by the primary electron or from energetic ionization . in strong magnetic field these low energy electrons or positions basically travel along the field line , thus their hit position on etof reflects the position where they are generated , which is r54 cm from fig.[2 ] ( @xmath9 1.1 m @xmath10sin(@xmath6 ) ) .        for each primary electron , \n a large number of secondary electron , positron and gamma are produced in mdc endcap region causing multi - hit on a scintillator module . \n more quantitatively , we define the multi - hit rate as the fraction of events with 2 or more hits on one etof readout cell . \n we find the multi - hit rate of scintillator - based etof is about 71.5% . \n multi - hit can badly influence the timing performance of etof by distorting the output signal shape and amplitude that are hard to be calibrated at offline . \n note there is no tracking information available for these secondary particles in the calibration .    to study the effect of the complex hit position distribution structure and the high multi - hit rate on etof timing , we make a semi - quantitative calculation by evaluating the hit time and position information . \n for each track , the measured arrival time is the sum of particle flight time from the ip all the way to etof and the signal s transmission time to the readout end . \n we assume a simple one - dimensional linear timing dependence on the hit position . in the scintillator \n , the signal transmission time can be expressed as ( r - r0)/v , where r0 is the radial position of the photomultiplier , and v is the effective transmission velocity in scintillator . \n r0 is 47.2 cm in current besiii etof design and v-1 is measured to be 80 ps / cm @xcite . in each event , \n the earliest arrival time at the photomultiplier among all hits is taken as the measured tof . \n the tof distribution is shown in fig.[6 ] . beside the nominal tof peak at around 6.2 - 6.4 \n ns caused by primary electrons , another peak with much smaller tof around 5.5 ns is clearly visible in fig.[6 ] . \n the left peak is about 0.9 ns earlier in time than the nominal peak - this is understood as a consequence of secondary electron / positron band at low energy and low r in fig.[5 ] . in fig.[5 ] , the difference in r for the two main bands is  10 cm . \n consider the transmission velocity of fluorescent photons in scintillator , their arrival time difference will be 0.8 ns , agreeing well with the fig.[6 ] . \n the difference in flight time from the ip to etof is relatively small , since electron or position travels at a velocity very near to the speed of light . \n our simulation also confirms this point . \n furthermore , similar feature was observed with the full besiii mc framework ( including fluorescent photon generation and transmission ) , as well as the calibration results with experimental bhabha data collected by besiii @xcite . \n the consistency of these results validates the reliability of our simulation . \n the simulation results of scintillator - based etof show that the multiple scattering effects , mainly from the mdc endcap materials , can cause multi - hit on the etof s readout cell and make the hit position distribution structure on the etof s readout cell complex by producing secondary particles in the materials and significantly influence the performance of etof . \n furthermore , the complex hit position distributions also indicate that the tracking accuracy is also worse in the endcap region than that in the barrel region , which consequently makes the position - dependent time calibration difficult .    to reduce the multi - hit probability and simplify the hit position distribution structure , smaller readout cell size is favored . \n however , reducing module size means increasing readout channels , which is not suitable for scintillator - based etof since the pm dedicated in strong magnetic field is rather expensive . \n the mrpc , first developed by lhc - alice tof collaboration @xcite , is a new type gaseous detector with good time resolution , high detection efficiency . \n furthermore , it can be designed with a smaller readout cell structure and the cost of each readout cell is much lower . \n it is considered a suitable candidate for the upgrade of besiii etof system . \n the r&d for such an upgrade began in 2010 . \n in each endcap there are 36 trapezium - shaped mrpc modules . \n fig.[7 ] shows the top and side view of an mrpc module appropriate for besiii . \n it has a double - stack structure with twelve gaps . \n floating glass sheets are used as the resistive plates . \n the thicknesses are 0.4 mm and 0.55 mm for the inner and outer glass , respectively . \n the gap between the glasses is 0.22 mm . \n the thickness of the honeycombs , readout pads , pcb and mylar boards are also shown in fig.[7 ] . \n the mrpc is placed in a aluminum box with a thickness of 1 mm which is filled with a standard gas mixture for mrpc . \n the component of the gas is 90% freon + 5% sf6 + 5% c4h10 @xcite . \n two types of mrpc modules with different readout pad structure are designed for the upgrade . \n the dual - readout mrpc module has 12 readout pads of 2.5 mm wide , with the length ranging from 8.6 cm to 14.1 cm . \n signals are readout at both ends of the pad . \n the single readout mrpc module has a similar structure except that each readout pad is divided into two from the center ( see fig.[3 ] ) . in order to study the improvement with this upgrade \n , the scintillator - based etof system is replaced with the proposed mrpc based etof system in the simulation setup shown at fig.[2 ] . \n the hit position distributions on mrpc based etof module , of primary electron , secondary electron / positron are shown in fig.[4](a ) and ( b ) respectively . \n the module boundaries are also shown in the figures like that of scintillator - based etof case . \n note in fig.[4](c ) the mrpc pad boundaries are not shown since mrpc are intrinsic not sensitive to gamma ( usual efficiency @xmath11 0.1% ) . \n it s found that the multi - hit rate is 21.8% or 16.7% for mrpc etof with dual - readout or single - readout module design , dropping significantly from scintillator - based etof s 71.5% . \n note the readout cell of mrpc based etof is much smaller than that of scintillator - based etof and all three components in fig.[4 ] ( primary electron , secondary electron / position and gamma ) contribute for a scintillator while gamma hits are not accounted for mrpc .    with a significantly reduced multi - hit event rate and simpler hit position distribution structure \n , one can expect better timing performance and easier calibration for a mrpc - based etof rather than a scintillator - based etof . to compare the timing performance of both types of etof \n , we also make a semi - quantitative calculation for mrpc based etof in a similar way as the scintillator .    on the mrpc readout pad , \n electric pulses propagate to the fee - fed end . for each track , the signal transmission time on the readout pad is calculated as l / v , where l is the distance between the hit and the feed - out end , and v is the propagation velocity of the electric pulse . for mrpc modules used in besiii etof , v-1 is measured to be 45 ps / cm @xcite , near twice faster than that in an etof scintillator . \n also in each event , only the earliest signal arrival time is taken as the measured tof . for single - readout mrpc \n the signal is chosen to be feed - out from the left end , while for dual - readout mrpc , the time measured is chosen as the average measurement from both sides . \n the tof distribution of a mrpc etof is shown in fig.[8 ] . \n it s obvious that the false timing from secondary particles is greatly suppressed compared to the scintillator etof case . \n we make a comparison of timing performance from all three kinds of etof design ( two detector technology , and two readout pad design for mrpc ) and show the result in fig.[9 ] . \n again we see clear improvement with mrpc - based etof . for the two kinds of mrpc readout design , the single - readout method has better timing property due to less multi - hit rate compared to the dual - readout one . \n however , one should know for single - readout mrpc , the timing is hit position dependent thus requires precise tracking which is not easy at besiii endcap region . \n dual - readout mrpc basically does not need very good tracking since the hit position uncertainty cancels out in time averaging from both ends . \n further investigation need more detailed simulation and experimental efforts and is beyond the scope of this paper .            to further quantify the difference in timing for the three kinds of etof design \n , we calculated the fraction of events in which the time difference ( with respect to time=0 in figure [ 9 ] ) larger than 30 ps , 50 ps , 80 ps , 100 ps and 150 ps . \n the results are shown in table.[tabone ] . \n we can clear see that the upgrade can further reduce on the adverse influence of the multi - hit on the timing of etof . \n @*6l    types&@xmath12t@xmath1330ps&@xmath12t@xmath1350ps&@xmath12t@xmath1380ps&@xmath12t@xmath13100ps&@xmath12t@xmath13150psscintillator & 40.0% & 36.2% & 33.3 % & 32.1 % & 30.0% + dual -

based on scintillator or mrpc . \n the simulation results show that multiple scattering process in the material budget between mdc endcap and etof will produce a large number of secondary particles that will affect the timing of the plastic scintillator used in current besiii etof system , causing a high multi - hit rate ( 71.5% ) and a double - peak structure in the tof spectrum for bhabha events . \n the timing peak with tof abnormally small is contributed by the secondary particles with very low energy and is about 0.9 ns earlier to the nominal timing peak . \n these results are consistent with the offline calibration results with experimental bhabha data . \n the multi - hit rate of mrpc is much lower ( 21.8% for dual - readout mrpc and 16.7% for single - readout mrpc design ) , and the timing performance of mrpc is also better . \n this work was supported by national science foundation of china , no.10970003 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1518181658814, "RequestID": "bd75cd2f36a81b500faa8baabcd78b34a3accc55", "TotalTokens": 4092}

called standard cooling scenario that turns out to be possible not only in neutron star matter but in strange quark matter too , altering some of the conclusions made in the earlier investigations significantly . \n we use the mit bag model including @xmath1-corrections ( cf . \n @xcite ) to model the properties of absolutely stable strange matter . \n its equation of state and quark - lepton composition , which is governed by the conditions of chemical equilibrium and electric charge neutrality , is derived for that range of model parameters , that is , bag constant @xmath2 , the strange quark mass @xmath3 , and strong coupling constant @xmath4 , for which strange matter is absolutely stable ( energy per baryon @xmath5 less than the one in iron , @xmath6  mev ) . in the limiting case of vanishing quark mass , \n the electrons are not necesaary to maintain charge neutrality . in the realistic case of finite strange quark masse @xmath7 , the electrons can nevertheless vanish above some density which depends on @xmath8 . \n it was pointed out by duncan et al . \n ( 1983 ) ( see also @xcite ) that the neutrino emissivity of strange matter depends strongly on its electron fraction , @xmath9 . \n for that reason we introduce two different , complementary parameter sets denoted sm-1 and sm-2 ( see tab . \n [ tab : parameter ] ) , which correspond to strange matter that contains a relatively high electron fraction ( sm-1 ) , and @xmath10 ( sm-2 ) for the density range being of interest here . \n the quark _ direct _ urca processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as their inverse ones are only possible if the fermi momenta of quarks and electrons ( @xmath13 , @xmath14u , d , s;e@xmath15 ) fulfill the so - called triangle inequality ( e.g. , @xmath16 for process ( [ eq : dtou ] ) ) . \n this relation is the analogue to the triangle inequality established for nucleons and electrons in the nuclear matter case ( direct urca process , @xcite ) . \n if the electron fermi momentum is too small ( i.e. , @xmath9 is too little ) , then the triangle inequality for the above processes ( [ eq : dtou ] ) and ( [ eq : stou ] ) can not be fulfilled , and a bystander quark is needed to ensure energy and momentum conservation in the scattering process . \n the latter process is known as the quark _ modified _ urca process , whose emissivity is considerably smaller than the emissivity of the direct urca process . \n if the electron fraction vanishes entirely , as is the case for sm-2 , both the quark direct and the quark modified urca processes become unimportant . \n the neutrino emission is then dominated by bremsstrahlung processes only , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote any pair of quark flavors . for the emissivities associated with the quark direct urca , quark modified urca , and quark bremsstrahlung processes \n , we refer to refs . \n price ( 1980 ) , iwamoto ( 1982 ) and duncan et al . \n ( 1983 ) . \n it has been suggested ( see @xcite ) that the quarks eventually may form cooper pairs . \n this would suppress , as in the nuclear matter case , the neutrino emissivities by an exponential factor of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gap energy , @xmath22 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath23 the temperature . \n unfortunately , there exists up to now neither a precise experimentally nor theoretically determined value of the gap energy . \n so to provide a feeling for the influence of a possibly superfluid behavior of the quarks in strange matter too , we choose @xmath24  mev as estimated in the work of bailin & love ( 1979 ) . \n ( such a @xmath21 value is not too different from the nuclear - matter case , where the proton @xmath25 gap , for instance , amounts @xmath26  mev ( cf . \n @xcite ) , depending on the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the microscopic model . ) \n the outcome of our superfluid strange matter calculations will be labeled sm-1@xmath27 and sm-2@xmath27 . \n among the x -

ray energy band does not allow one to determine what kind of atmosphere one should use , we consider both the blackbody model and the hydrogen - atmosphere model , drawn in in figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] as solid and dashed error bars , respectively . \n the kind of atmosphere possessed by a specific pulsar could be determined by considering multiwavelength observations ( see @xcite ) . \n all error bars represent the @xmath28 error range due to the small photon fluxes . \n the pulsars ages are determined by their spin - down times assuming a canonical value of 3 for the braking index . in reality \n the braking index may be quite different from 3 . \n its variation between 2 and 4 , for instance , would change the age of geminga as indicated by the horizontal error bar shown at the bottom of figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] . \n the thermal evolution of strange stars and neutron stars was simulated using the evolutionary numerical code described in schaab et al . \n ( 1996b ) ( see also @xcite ) . \n the neutron star models are based on a broad collection of eoss which comprises relativistic , fieldtheoretical equations of state as well as non - relativistic , schroedinger - based ones ( see @xcite for details ) . as a specific feature of the relativistic models , they account for all baryon states that become populated in dense neutron star matter up to the highest densities reached in the cores of the heaviest neutron stars constructed from this collection of equations of state . \n neutron stars are known to loose energy either via standard cooling or enhanced cooling . both may be delayed by superfluidity . \n consequently all four options have been taken into account here . \n these are labeled in figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] as ns-1 ( enhanced cooling ) and ns-2 ( standard cooling ) for normal neutron star matter , and ns-1@xmath27 and ns-2@xmath27 ( delayed cooling ) for superfluid neutron star matter . \n the parameters of ns-1@xmath27 and ns-2@xmath27 are listed in tab .  4 of ref . \n schaab et al . \n ( 1996b ) . in analogy to this , \n the corresponding strange - star cooling curves are sm-1 ( enhanced cooling ) and sm-2 ( standard cooling ) for normal strange quark matter , and sm-1@xmath27 and sm-2@xmath27 ( delayed cooling ) for superfluid quark matter . \n all calculations are performed for a star mass of @xmath29 , about which the observed pulsar masses tend to scatter . \n the band - like structure of the cooling curves is supposed to reflect the uncertainties inherent in the equation of state of neutron - star and strange - star matter . \n these have their origin , in the case of neutron stars ( bands filled with dots ) , in the different many - body techniques used to solve the nuclear many - body problem , and the star s baryon - lepton composition . in the latter case , \n strange - star matter , the solid bands refer to different bag values , @xmath2 , which vary from 137 to 148 mev for sm-1 , and from 133 to 146 mev for sm-2 . \n all values correspond to absolutely stable strange matter . \n one might suspect that the large gap between the cooling tracks of the sm-1 and sm-2 models in fig . \n [ fig : nsf ] can be bridged steadily by varying the strong coupling constant @xmath8 in the range 0.10.15 . \n however it turns out that the gap can be filled only for @xmath8-values within an extremely small range . \n this is caused by the sensitive functional relationship between @xmath8 and the neutrino luminosity @xmath30 , which is rather steep around that @xmath8-value for which the electrons vanish from the quark core of the star . \n all other values of @xmath8 give cooling tracks which are close to the upper or lower bands , respectively . \n this behavior might be compared with the case of neutron stars , where the neutrino luminosity depends sensitively on the star s mass . \n one sees from figs . \n [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] that , except for the first @xmath0 years of the lifetime of a newly born pulsar , both neutron stars and strange stars may show more or less the _ same _ cooling behavior , provided both types of stars are made up of either normal matter or superfluid matter . \n ( we will come back to this issue below . ) this is made possible by the fact that both standard cooling ( ns-2 ) as well as enhanced cooling ( ns-1 ) in neutron stars has its counterpart in strange stars too ( sm-2 and sm-1 , respectively ) . \n the point of time at which the surface temperature drop of a strange star occurs depends on the thickness of the nuclear crust that may envelope the strange matter core ( cf . \n @xcite ) . in the present calculation , \n strange stars possess the densest possible nuclear crust , which is about 0.2 km thick . \n thinner crusts would lead to temperature drops at even earlier times , and thus an earlier onset of the photon cooling era . \n figures [ fig : nsf ] and [ fig : sf ] indicate that the cooling data of observed pulsars do not allow to decide about the true nature of the underlying collapsed star , that is , as to whether it is a strange star or a conventional neutron star . \n this could abruptly change with the observation of a very young pulsar shortly after its formation in a supernova explosion . in this case \n a prompt drop of the pulsar s temperature , say within the first 30 years after its formation , could offer a good signature of a strange star ( see @xcite ) . \n this feature , provided it withstands a rigorous future analysis of the microscopic properties of quark matter , could become particularly interesting if continued observation of sn 1987a would reveal the temperature of the possibly existing pulsar at its center .    finally , we add some comments about the possibility that only the neutron star is made up of superfluid matter but not the strange star . in this case one \n has to compare the models sm-1 and sm-2 ( see fig . \n [ fig : nsf ] ) with models ns-1@xmath31 and ns-2@xmath31 ( see fig . [ \n fig : sf ] ) yielding to an overall different cooling history of neutron stars and enhanced - cooling strange stars ( sm-1 ) . therefore , the standard argument pointed out quite frequently in the literature that strange stars cool much more rapidly than neutron stars applies only to this special case . \n .bag constant , @xmath2 , strange quark mass , @xmath3 , and the qcd coupling constant , @xmath4 , for the two sets of parameters denoted sm-1 and sm-2 . \n the energy per baryon , @xmath5 , for two and three flavor quark matter is given too .

? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n star formation in such an environment is thought to be assisted by some external trigger , and the filamentary clouds themselves have probably been created by large - scale motions of the interstellar gas . \n the most plausible scenario , suggested by the arc - like structure is , that energetic stellar winds and/or supernova explosions of high - mass stars at lower galactic latitudes lifted the gas above the galactic plane and compressed it to form stars . in this case \n the apparent filament is a projection of a shell , and its line - of - sight extent may be comparable to its length . \n the distribution of ysos relative to the clouds does not support this scenario . \n the young stars of l1333 are located at the high - latitude side of the cloud , with the oldest member , oksh@xmath126 , lying farthest from the cloud . the lack of h@xmath12 emission stars , as well as yso - like _ iras _ and 2mass point sources on the low - latitude side of the filament suggests star formation propagating toward lower latitudes , and a source of trigger at higher galactic latitudes . \n a possible candidate trigger source is the collision of high velocity gas with the giant radio continuum emitting region _ \n loop  iii _ \n , described by @xcite . \n our target objects are located near the far side of loop  iii @xcite . \n @xcite has shown that loop  iii collided with high velocity gas originating from a galactic supershell some @xmath29 ago . \n the collision has been well modelled for latitudes @xmath30 . at lower latitudes , \n however , the behaviour of the supershell and its collision with the local interstellar matter has not yet been studied . in order to reveal the geometry of the possible collision in the latitude range @xmath31@xmath32 \n , the velocity distributions of both molecular and atomic gas have to be studied in detail . \n closer to the galactic plane the high velocity gas of the supershell might have decelerated before reaching our galactic neighbourhood .    in this scenario \n the high - density regions , created by the colliding surfaces , have small line - of - sight extent . \n the ages obtained for _ iras _  02086 + 7600 , oksh@xmath125 , and oksh@xmath1216 , taking into account their accuracies , support this scenario . \n oksh@xmath126 was , however , born apparently before the collision . \n the weak - line t  tauri stars to the west of the cloud complex make the pattern of star formation of this region even more complicated . \n they indicate a prolonged star formation in the region . \n the age distribution of the wttss suggests star formation propagating from lower to higher galactic longitudes . \n more accurate age determinations and more detailed mapping of molecular velocity distribution are needed to clarify the picture . \n we identified five low - mass ysos in the small filamentary molecular complex associated with the dark cloud lynds  1333 . \n their masses are in the interval 0.150.8m@xmath33 , and they are 15 million years old . \n we confirmed that _ iras \n _  02086 + 7600 is a class  i yso associated with the l1333 complex , and found its age to be comparable to those of the cttss born in the same cloud . \n the relative distribution of ysos and clouds suggests that the star formation might have been triggered by the collision of high velocity gas with loop  iii . \n this work is partly based on observations with nordic optical telescope operated on the island of la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias . \n the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen . \n our results are partly based on observations obtained at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto , operated jointly by the max - planck institut fr astronomie and the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( csic ) . \n we are indebted to francesco palla for sending his data set on pre - main sequence evolution , and to lszl szabados for careful reading of the manuscript . financial support from the hungarian otka grants \n t034584 , t037508 , ts049872 , t042509 , and t049082 is acknowledged . \n sn acknowledges support from the chilean _ centro de astrofsica _ fondap no . \n 15010003 and serbian ministry of science and environmental protection grant no .", "StartTimeOffset": 1531232560842, "RequestID": "a13cb021afefce2b6a1ab9b8a1f8b03ae30dc7de", "TotalTokens": 3680}

[ fig1]b , \n respectively ) are generally in perfect agreement , except for the very broad resonances that lie deep in the complex plane , i.e. , in the region @xmath91 .    for the four - sphere system with large separation @xmath15 between the spheres \n the cycle - expansion method is most efficient for the calculation of a large number of resonances . \n the reason is that the assumption of the cycle - expansion that the contributions of longer periodic orbits in the expansion of the gutzwiller - voros zeta function ( [ z_gv ] ) are shadowed by pseudo - orbits composed of shorter periodic orbits is very well fulfilled . \n the harmonic inversion method also allows for the calculation of a large number of resonances , but requires a larger input set of periodic orbits . \n in contrast , the quantum computations for this three - dimensional system are very inefficient due to an unfavorable scaling of the dimension of the matrix @xmath81 in eq . \n ( [ m_4sphere ] ) . \n for this reason , the quantum computations presented here have been restricted to the region @xmath88 . \n of course , a more efficient quantum method for the four - sphere system than that of ref . \n @xcite may in principle exist . \n however , to the best of our knowledge no such method has been proposed in the literature to date . \n in summary , we have applied gutzwiller s periodic orbit theory to a system with three degrees of freedom , viz .  the four - sphere scattering problem . for the first time \n , semiclassical resonances have been obtained for a billiard system with genuinely three - dimensional periodic orbits . for this system \n we have discussed the scaling properties of both quantum and semiclassical calculations and have demonstrated the superiority of semiclassical methods over quantum computations , i.e. , semiclassical resonances could easily be obtained in energy regions which are unattainable with the established quantum method \n . these results may encourage the investigation of other systems with three or more degrees of freedom with the goal to develop powerful semiclassical techniques , which are competitive with or even superior to quantum computations for a large variety of systems . \n interesting future work will also be the investigation of the four - sphere system when the spheres are moved towards each other . \n in particular , the case of touching spheres with @xmath92 is a real challenge , because the cycle - expansion does not converge any more . for touching spheres the symbolic dynamics \n is pruned in a similar way as in the three - disk problem @xcite . however , contrary to the closed three - disk system @xcite , the four touching spheres do not form a bound system which means that the method of ref . \n @xcite combining the cycle - expansion method with a functional equation can not be applied . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation and the deutscher akademischer austauschdienst . \n thanks the engineering and physical sciences research council ( uk ) for support under grant number gr / n19519/01 . \n .  thanks j.m .  and g.w .  for the kind hospitality at the institut fr theoretische physik during his stay in stuttgart .", "StartTimeOffset": 1535102771616, "RequestID": "f9750031f1386f6a41e7f94162ae9365e09a5d3d", "TotalTokens": 4136}

prey systems with markovian local rules based in the lotka - volterra model lotka , volterra . \n one of the problems that has been object of study is the connection between the time oscillations of population densities and spatial pattern distribution of the individuals of each species .    here \n we study the coexistence of a two - species system by considering a probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) which is a modified version of the automaton devised in @xcite . \n the model , to be called anisotropic predator - prey pca possess local rules that are similar to the ones of the cellular automaton proposed in @xcite  and was introduced by us in order to explore the effect of spatial anisotropy in the temporal oscillations . \n we report dynamic mean - field approximations which take into account the spatial dependence of densities and pair correlations of sites . in the next section we present the model . in sec . \n 2 we show the equations for the time evolution of species densities and show the spatial dependence of these equations . in sec . 3 and 4 \n we perform dynamic simple and pair mean - field approximations . \n last section summarize the model , method and results . \n the physical space occupied by the species is represented by a regular lattice of @xmath0 sites in which each site can be in one of three states . at each site of the lattice \n we attach a stochastic variable @xmath1 that takes the values @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 according whether the site @xmath5 is empty , or occupied by a prey or occupied by a predator , respectively . \n the state of the system can be represented by the vector @xmath6 . \n the time evolution equation for @xmath7 , the probability of state @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 where the sum is over the @xmath11 configurations of the system and @xmath12 is the transition probability from a state @xmath13 to state @xmath8 , given that at the previous time step the system was in state @xmath14 . \n since we are considering probabilistic cellular automata , all the sites are updated simultaneously . in this case \n we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the conditional transition probability per site .      the stochastic rules , embodied in the transition rate @xmath17 , \n are set up in order that the allowed transitions between states are only the ones that obey the cyclic order shown in fig . \n prey can only born in empty sites ; prey can give place to a predator in a process where the prey dies and the predator is instantaneously born ; finally predator can die leaving an empty site . \n the empty sites are places where prey can proliferate and can be seen as the resource for prey surveillance . \n the death of predators complete this cycle , reintegrating to the system the resources for prey . \n the anisotropic predator - prey pca has three parameters : @xmath18 , the probability of birth of prey , @xmath19 , the probability of birth of predator and death of prey , and @xmath20 , the probability of predator death . \n two of the process are catalytic : the occupancy of a site by prey or by a predator is conditioned , respectively , to the existence of prey or predator in the neighborhood of the site . \n the third reaction , where predator dies , is spontaneous , that is , it occurs , with probability @xmath20 , independently of the neighbors of the site . \n we assume that @xmath21 with @xmath22 . \n the transition probabilities of the anisotropic predator - prey pca are described in what follows :    \\(a ) if a site @xmath5 is empty , @xmath23 , and if at north or east there is at least one prey , then it can be occupied by a prey , @xmath24 , in the next time step , with a probability proportional to the parameter @xmath18 and to the number of prey @xmath25 at north and east of site @xmath5 . \n \\(b ) if a site is occupied by a prey , @xmath24 , then the site has a probability of being occupied by a new predator , @xmath26 , in the next time step if there are prey at north or east . in this process \n the prey dies instantaneously . \n the transition probability is proportional to the parameter @xmath19 and the number of predators at north and east of site @xmath5 . \n \\(c ) if site @xmath5 is occupied by a predator , @xmath27 , it dies spontaneously with probability @xmath20 . \n the anisotropic cellular automaton is a variation of the automaton introduced in @xcite . \n here each site of a regular square lattice interacts with its first neighbors only at two preferential directions . \n this anisotropic neighborhood consists of the northern and eastern neighbors of each site as shown in fig . \n the set of transition probabilities per site is given by @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the sum is over the neighbor sites localized at east and north of site @xmath32 and correspond to the number of neighbors of site @xmath5 occupied by prey individuals and predators individuals , respectively . \n we have considered this probabilistic cellular automaton with the purpose of verifying the effect of anisotropy in the properties of the time oscillations of the predator - prey system . \n the rules considered are in some sense inspired in the north - east - center ( nec ) cellular automaton @xcite , which also consider an unsymmetrical neighborhood of northern and eastern sites . \n the present stochastic dynamics predicts the existence of states , called absorbing states , in which the system becomes trapped . \n once the system has entered such a state it can not escape from it anymore remaining there forever . \n there are two absorbing states . \n one of them is the empty lattice . \n the other absorbing state is the one in which the lattice is full of prey . \n this situation occurs if there are few predators and they become extinct . \n the remaining prey will then reproduce without predation filling up the whole lattice . \n the existence of absorbing stationary states is an evidence of the irreversible character of the model or , in other words , of the lack of detailed balance @xcite . \n however , the most interesting states , the ones that we are concerned with in the present study , are the active states characterized by the coexistence of prey and predators .      the densities of prey , predator and empty sites are defined as @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 respectively . \n the lower index @xmath5 is used to denote the site and the upper index @xmath9 stands for the time . \n the pair correlation of two neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath36 one being occupied by prey and the other by predator is defined as @xmath37 in this definition the sites @xmath5 and @xmath36 are two neighboring horizontal sites , the site @xmath36 being at the east of @xmath5 . for two neighboring sites placed \n vertically we use the notation @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the neighbor of @xmath5 to the north . \n the evolution equation for the densities can be obtained by using the rules of the automaton and the evolution equation for the probability @xmath40 . using equations ( [ master ] ) , ( [ regra1 ] ) , ( regra2 ) and ( [ regra3 ] ) , we obtain the time evolution equation for the density of prey at site @xmath5 , @xmath41+p_i(1)-\\frac{b}{2 } \\left [ p_{ij}\\left (   \\begin{array}{c } 2 \\\\   1% \\end{array } \\right)+p_{ik } (   \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 2% \\end{array } ) \\right ] ,   \\label{dens1}\\ ] ] where we have used prime and unprimed to denote quantities at time @xmath42 and @xmath9 , respectively . \n again , @xmath43 denotes a pair correlation of a site @xmath5 which is empty and its neighbor at the north @xmath36 which is occupied by a prey and @xmath44 denotes the pair correlation of the site @xmath5 which is is empty and its neighbor to the east @xmath39 which is occupied by a prey . \n note that site @xmath5 is the site to be updated . \n the time evolution equation for the density of predators at site @xmath5 is given by @xmath45+(1-c)p_i(2 ) . \n \\label{dens2}\\ ] ]    the evolution equations for correlations of two neighbor sites are given by equations which involves clusters of two , three and four neighbors to the north and east and they are too cumbersome . \n we will write them in the pair approximation in the next subsection \n .    we will assume in the present analysis that the densities and the pair correlations are homogeneous so that the correlations of sites placed horizontally or vertically are the same . in other words the systems exhibits a specular symmetry along the southwest - northeast line ( see fig . \n [ nec ] ) . \n therefore , @xmath46 and @xmath47 \n we will first analyze the equations ( [ dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) for the densities of prey and predators by means of a simple mean field approximation @xcite . in this approximation \n we write the probability of a given cluster of sites as the product of the probabilities of each site . in our analysis \n we maintain the space dependence of each probability . \n this is necessary since the rules that define the model are not isotropic . \n we will use the notations @xmath48 where the index @xmath49 stands for a site at the @xmath49 layer . \n a layer is defined as the sites belonging to a line perpendicular to the southwest - northeast axis , as shown in fig . \n [ nec ] . using this approximation and considering equations ( [ dens1 ] ) and ( [ dens2 ] ) \n we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 . due to this relation \n there is no need for the equation for the density of empty sites . \n the analysis of the above set of equations show that the stable solutions are of two types : a prey absorbing state , where the all lattice is full of prey ; and an active solution with prey and predators densities constant in time and space . \n so , we have just homogeneous and nonoscillating solutions when we treat the anisotropic pca by means of simple mean - field approximation . at this level of mean - field approximation the space anisotropy does not play any role in determining the kind of coexistence of species . \n now we consider the evolution equations for one - site correlations and two site ( pair ) correlations . \n the evolution equations for the pair correlations depend on clusters of three and four sites . following the approach of the pair approximation @xcite we write the clusters of three and four sites as products of pair correlations and one - site correlations \n . however , we must be careful in doing this approximation because we are maintaining the spatial anisotropy dependence of the one and two site correlations . \n for example , the correlation of a site at layer @xmath49 in state @xmath2 , a site at layer @xmath53 in state @xmath2 and a site at layer @xmath54 in state @xmath3 , is written in the pair approximation as @xmath55 there are more complex clusters that appear in the evolution equation for pair correlations . \n for example , the following cluster of four sites is approximated by @xmath56 observe that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two independent variables . \n now we use the notation @xmath59 \n @xmath60 @xmath61    using the pair approximation we derive the following equations for pair correlations , @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79    the equations for the densities are @xmath80 and @xmath81    therefore , we get a set of eight equations that we have iterated to find the solutions . \n we considered periodic boundary conditions and an initial condition where half of the lattice with a set of densities and the other half with another set of densities .    for @xmath82 and great values of @xmath20 \n the system attains a stationary state which is the absorbing prey state . \n decreasing @xmath20 there is a transition to an active state , coexistence of species , and we found very interesting solutions which are characterized by travelling waves of the densities of each species . in fig . \n [ oscespac ] we show , for a particular set of the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the prey and predators oscillations as a function of space and for a fixed instant of time . \n we can see that the behavior of the space oscillations are very complex and very different from a sinusoidal wave . \n we remark that our assumption concerning the spatial dependence of densities and pair correlations underlying our mean - field approach could not easily be conceived a priori . \n it was set up by considering the type of local dynamics with unsymmetrical rules and from the results of monte carlo simulations for the present pca @xcite . to further clarify this point we show in fig . \n [ snap ] a snapshot generated by simulation of the present pca on a square lattice where each site can be occupied by prey , predators or can be empty . \n periodic boundary conditions were used and the system evolved in time according to the rules defined by eqs . \n ( [ regra1 ] ) , ( [ regra2 ] ) and ( [ regra3 ] ) . a synchronous update was used . \n we see that the distribution of individuals of each species is not homogeneous but exhibits a pattern composed by layers of prey and predators . \n these layers are displayed in a manner perpendicular to the southwest - northeast direction , the direction along which the oscillations occur as can be seen in fig . \n we have found that the spatial oscillations do not occur independently of the time oscillations , since the spatial layers of prey and predators are not static but are like fronts moving along the southwest - northeast direction . \n the spatial pattern oscillations are intimately associated to local time oscillations of the species kelly , tome2007 . \n these features were incorporated in the present mean - field analysis of the model . \n we have considered a predator - prey probabilistic cellular automaton with anisotropic local stochastic rules . \n we studied this model by means of dynamic mean - field approximation at two orders : simple mean - field approximation and pair mean - field approximation . \n due to the anisotropy these approximations only can be performed if we consider the spatial dependence of probabilities . \n the simple mean - field approximation for this automaton just provides the prey absorbing state and active spatial homogeneous solutions which are also constant in time . \n the pair mean - field approximation gives much more rich results and show that the active states characterized by time oscillations of species densities are inhomogeneous in space . \n therefore , we have spatiotemporal patterns of coexistence . \n this is in accordance with previous monte carlo simulations @xcite where we have found local time oscillations connected to inhomogeneous spatial distributions of species individuals .", "StartTimeOffset": 1545709745478, "RequestID": "317f3715bd77356912d6d91649ca0f3be3a6b272", "TotalTokens": 3445}

{"ContextTokens": 3572, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of the dynamics of stars and gas in galaxies have provided important evidence for the existence of dark matter halos around galaxies . \n these studies have also shown that tight relations exist between the baryonic and dark matter components . \n the latter findings provide important constraints for models of galaxy formation , as their origin needs to be explained .    however , dynamical methods require visible tracers , which typically can be observed only in the central regions of galaxies , where baryons are dynamically important . in this regime , the accuracy of simulations is limited and the physics complicated . \n hence the interpretation of observations is complicated and one needs to proceed cautiously . \n in addition assumptions about the orbit structure need to be made . instead \n , it would be more convenient to have observational constraints on quantities that are robust ( both observationally and theoretically ) and easily extracted from numerical simulations . \n an obvious quantity of interest is the virial mass of the galaxy . \n fortunately , in recent years it has become possible to probe the outer regions of galaxy dark matter halos , either through the dynamics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. , prada et al . 2003 ) or weak gravitational lensing . in these proceedings \n we focus on the latter approach , which uses the fact that the tidal gravitational field of the dark matter halo introduces small coherent distortions in the images of distant background galaxies . \n this signal can nowadays be easily detected in data from large imaging surveys . \n it is important to note , however , that weak lensing can not be used to study individual galaxies , but ensemble averaged properties instead .    since the first detection of this so - called galaxy - galaxy lensing signal by brainerd et al . \n ( 1996 ) , the significance of the measurements has improved dramatically , thanks to new wide field ccd cameras on a number of mostly 4 m class telescopes . \n this has allowed various groups to image large areas of the sky , yielding the large numbers of lenses and sources needed to measure the lensing signal . \n results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provided a major improvement ( e.g. , fisher et al . \n 2000 ; mckay et al . 2001 ) over early studies . \n apart from the increased surveyed area , an important advantage of the more recent sdss studies ( mckay et al . \n 2001 ; guzik & seljak 2002 ) is the availability of ( photometric ) redshift information for the lenses and sources . \n this has enabled studies of the dark matter properties as a function of baryonic content .    here , \n we highlight recent progress by presenting results from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2005 ) . recently hsieh et al . \n ( 2005 ) derived photometric redshifts for a subset of the rcs and we use these results to study the virial mass as a function of luminosity . \n we also present measurements of the extent of dark matter halos and discuss measurements of their shapes . \n we conclude by discussing what to expect in the near future , when much larger surveys start producing results . \n -band luminosity bins . to account for the fact that the lenses have a range in redshifts , \n the signal is scaled such that it corresponds to that of a lens at the average lens redshift ( @xmath0 ) and a source redshift of infinity the mean restframe @xmath1-band luminosity for each bin is also shown in the figure in units of @xmath2l@xmath3 . \n the strength of the lensing signal clearly increases with increasing luminosity of the lens . \n the dotted line indicates the best fit nfw model to the data . \n [ gtprof],width=453 ] \n one of the major advantages of weak gravitational lensing over most dynamical methods is that the lensing signal can be measured out to large projected distances from the lens . \n however , at large radii , the contribution from a particular galaxy may be small compared to its surroundings : a simple interpretation of the measurements can only be made for ` isolated ' galaxies . \n what one actually observes , is the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function . \n this can be compared directly to models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , tasitsiomi et al . 2004 ) . \n alternatively , one can attempt to select only isolated galaxies or one can deconvolve the cross - correlation function , while making some simplifying assumptions . in this section \n we discuss results for ` isolated ' galaxies , whereas in the next section , which deals with the extent of dark matter halos , we use the deconvolution method .    a detailed discussion of the results presented in this section can be found in hoekstra et al . \n the measurements presented here are based on a subset of the rcs for which photometric redshifts were determined using @xmath4 photometry ( hsieh et al . 2005 ) . \n we selected galaxies with redshifts @xmath5 and @xmath6 , resulting in a sample of @xmath7 lenses . \n however , to simplify the interpretation of the results , we proceed by selecting ` isolated ' lenses . to do so \n , we only consider lenses that are at least 30 arcseconds away from a brighter galaxy ( see hoekstra et al . , 2005 for details ) . \n note , that bright galaxies are not necessarily isolated . for such galaxies , however , we expect the lensing signal to be dominated by the galaxy itself , and not its fainter companions . \n we split the sample into 7 luminosity bins and measure the mean tangential distortion out to 2 arcminutes from the lens . \n the resulting tangential shear profiles are shown in figure  [ gtprof ] for the bins of increasing rest - frame @xmath1 luminosity . \n the results for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band are very similar . \n we estimate the virial mass for each bin by fitting a a nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) profile to the signal . \n the resulting virial mass as a function of rest - frame luminosity is presented in figure  [ ml_all ] . \n these findings suggest a power - law relation between the mass and the luminosity , although this assumption might not hold at the low luminosity end . \n we fit a power - law model to the measurements and find that the slope is @xmath10 for all three filters . \n this results is in good agreement with results from the sdss ( guzik & seljak , 2002 ) and predictions from models of galaxy formation ( yang et al . \n as stressed by guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) , the observed slope implies that rotation curves must decline substantially from the optical to the virial radius .    ._lower \n panels : _ observed rest - frame virial mass - to - light ratios . \n the results suggest a rise in the mass - to - light ratio with increasing luminosity , albeit with low significance . \n [ ml_all],width=453 ]    for a galaxy with a luminosity of @xmath11 we obtain a virial mass of @xmath12 . \n we note that if the mass - luminosity relation has an intrinsic scatter , our mass estimates are biased low ( tasitsiomi et al . \n the amplitude of this bias depends on the assumed intrinsic scatter . \n the results presented in tasitsiomi et al . \n ( 2004 ) , however , do indicate that the slope of the mass - luminosity relation is not affected . \n the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function is the convolution of the galaxy distribution and the underlying galaxy dark matter profiles . \n provided we have a model for the latter , we can ` predict ' the expected lensing signal . \n such an approach naturally accounts for the presence of neighbouring galaxies . \n it essentially allows us to deconvolve the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function , under the assumption that all clustered matter is associated with the lenses . \n if the matter in galaxy groups ( or clusters ) is associated with the halos of the group members ( i.e. , the halos are indistinguishable from the halos of isolated galaxies ) our results should give a fair estimate of the extent of galaxy halos . \n however , if a significant fraction of the dark matter is distributed in common halos , a simple interpretation of the results becomes more difficult .     and \n scale radius @xmath13 for a fiducial galaxy with @xmath14 , with an nfw profile . \n the corresponding values for @xmath15 are indicated on the right axis . \n the contours indicate the 68.3% , 95.4% , and the 99.7% confidence on two parameters jointly . \n the cross indicates the best fit value . \n the dotted line indicates the predictions from the numerical simulations , which are in excellent agreement with our results . \n [ size_nfw],width=396 ]    we use such a maximum likelihood approach to place constraints on the properties of dark matter halos . \n a detailed discussion of the results can be found in hoekstra et al . \n the analysis presented here uses only @xmath16 imaging data from the rcs , and therefore lacks redshift information for the individual lenses . \n nevertheless , these measurements allow us to place tight constraints on the extent and masses of dark matter halos . \n in our maximum likelihood analysis we consider @xmath13 and @xmath17 ( or equivalently the mass @xmath15 ) as free parameters . \n figure  [ size_nfw ] shows the joint constraints on @xmath17 and scale radius @xmath13 for a fiducial galaxy with @xmath18 , when we use an nfw profile for the galaxy dark matter profile . \n numerical simulations of cdm , however , show that the parameters in the nfw model are correlated , albeit with some scatter . \n hence , the simulations make a definite prediction for the value of @xmath17 as a function of @xmath13 . \n the dotted line in figure  [ size_nfw ] indicates this prediction . \n if the simulations provide a good description of dark matter halos , the dotted line should intersect our confidence region , which it does . \n this result provides important support for the cdm paradigm , as it predicts the correct `` size '' of dark matter halos . \n it is important to note that this analysis is a direct test of cdm ( albeit not conclusive ) , because the weak lensing results are inferred from the gravitational potential at large distances from the galaxy center , where dark matter dominates . \n most other attempts to test cdm are confined to the inner regions , where baryons are , or might be , important . \n another prediction from cdm simulations is that halos are not spherical but triaxial instead . \n we note , however , it is not completely clear how the interplay with baryons might change this . \n for instance , kazantzidis et al . ( \n 2004 ) find that similations with gas cooling are significantly rounder than halos formed in adiabatic simulations , an effect that is found to persist almost out to the virial radius . \n hence , a measurement of the average shape of dark matter halos is important , because both observational and theoretical constraints are limited . \n weak gravitational lensing is potentially one of the most powerfuls way to derive constraints on the shapes of dark matter halos . \n the amount of data required for such a measurement , however , is very large : the galaxy lensing signal itself is tiny , and now one needs to measure an even smaller azimuthal variation \n . we also have to make assumptions about the alignment between the galaxy and the surrounding halo . \n an imperfect alignment between light and halo will reduce the amplitude of the azimuthal variation detectable in the weak lensing analysis . \n hence , weak lensing formally provides a lower limit to the average halo ellipticity . \n hoekstra et al . \n ( 2004 ) attempted such a measurement , again using a maximum likelihood model . \n they adopted a simple approach , and assumed that the ( projected ) ellipticity of the dark matter halo is proportional to the shape of the galaxy : @xmath19 . \n this yielded a a best fit value of @xmath20 ( 68% confidence ) , suggesting that , on average , the dark matter distribution is rounder than the light distribution . \n note , however , that even with a data set such as the rcs , the detection is marginal . a similar , quick analysis of imaging data from the cfhtls and virmos - descart surveys give lower values for @xmath21 , suggesting that the rcs result is on the high side . \n recently , an independent weak lensing measurement of halo shapes was reported by mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) , based on sdss observations . for the full sample of lenses \n they do not detect an azimuthal variation of the signal , which is somewhat at odds with the hoekstra et al . \n ( 2004 ) findings . however , as mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) argue , the comparison is difficult at best , because of different sensitivity to lens populations , etc . and differences in the analyses . however , the approach used by mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) has the nice feature that it is more ` direct ' , compared to the maximum likelihood approach . \n the latter ` always gives an answer ' , but in our case it is difficult to determine what scales or galaxies contribute most to the signal . interestingly , \n mandelbaum et al . \n ( 2005 ) also split the sample into blue ( spiral ) and red ( elliptical ) galaxies . \n the results suggest a positive alignment between the dark matter halo and the brightest sample of ellipticals , whereas the spiral galaxies might be aligned perpendicular to the disks . \n although the signal in both cases is consistent with 0 , it nevertheless provides an interesting that deserves further study . \n the results presented in the previous two section provide a crude picture of what weak lensing studies of galaxy halos can accomplish with current data sets . for galaxy - galaxy lensing studies \n both the rcs and sdss data sets provide the most accurate results , with sdss having the advantage of a larger number of galaxies with ( photometric ) redshift information . \n even though these are early results ( the galaxy - galaxy lensing was first detected less than a decade ago ) , already we can place interesting constraints on the properties of dark matter halos and the stellar contents of galaxies . \n much larger surveys have started . \n for instance , the second generation rcs aims to image almost 850 deg@xmath22 in @xmath23 . \n these data provide more than an order of magnitude improvement over the results discussed in these proceedings . \n the kilo degree survey ( kids ) will start observations soon using the vlt survey telescope . \n this survey will image @xmath24 deg@xmath22 ( to a depth similar to that of rcs2 ) in five filters , thus adding photometric redshift information for most of the lenses . \n the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey will also provide important measurement of the lensing signal induced by galaxies . \n it is much deeper than rcs2 or kids , but will survey a smaller area of @xmath25 deg@xmath22 , with cosmic shear measurements as the primary science driver . \n nevertheless its signal - to - noise ratio of the measurements will be comparable to the rcs2 , but it will have the advantage of accurate photometric redshift information from the 5 color photometry . thanks to its added depth , it is also well suited to study the evolution of galaxy properties . \n dedicated survey telescopes such as panstarrs or the lsst will image large portions of the sky , thus increasing survey area by another order of magnitude to a significant fraction of the sky . \n one of the most interesting results from these projects will be a definite measurement of the average shape of dark matter halos . \n we can expect much progress on this front in the next few years . although there is much reason for optimism \n , we also need to be somewhat cautious : the accuracy of the measurements is increasing rapidly , but it is not clear to what extent the interpretation of the results can keep up . \n the early results , presented here , have statistical errors that are larger than the typical model uncertainty . \n however , as measurement errors become are significantly smaller , it becomes much more difficult to interpret the measurements : some more subtle effects arising from neigbouring galaxies or satellite galaxies can no longer be ignored . \n instead , it will become necessary to compare the lensing measurements ( i.e. , the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function as a function of galaxy properties ) to results of simulations directly . \n these future studies will provide unique constraints on models of galaxy formation as they provide measures of the role dark matter plays in galaxy formation . \n much of the work presented here would not have been possible without the efforts of the members of the rcs team . \n in particular i acknowledge the work of paul hsieh and hun lin on the photometric redshifts and howard yee and mike gladders on their work on rcs in general .", "StartTimeOffset": 1586976561492, "RequestID": "0892baa301440320dfbe6fb74b083fe37b20a162", "TotalTokens": 3730}

positive real numbers , or complex numbers with positive real parts , we can conclude that this system is not stable at the equilibria points . \n moreover , we could identify that the proposed system has a rotational symmetry about the @xmath13-axis , and shows dissipative behaviour contracting the volume element @xmath38 to @xmath53 . \n the lyapunov exponents yield to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , showing the chaotic nature of the system . \n the fractional dimension of the system @xmath54 has also been given . \n overall , the analysis shows that this is a new chaotic system with two scrolls . \n 32 [ 1]#1 [ 1]`#1 ` urlstyle [ 1]doi : # 1          ml  cartwright and je  littlewood . on non -

{"ContextTokens": 2720, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "we are given a subroutine which for every one of @xmath0 possible inputs gives us a @xmath1 or a @xmath2 as output . \n the subroutine is in a `` black box '' , so we are not allowed to see what algorithm it uses . \n the problem is to find an input for which the subroutine gives @xmath2 ( a `` marked '' input or `` element '' ) or to say that there is no such input . \n classically there is no other way than to try out many inputs on the subroutine . on the other hand , \n if the subroutine also works for superpositions of inputs    @xmath3    we can use grover s quantum searching algorithm @xcite to find a `` marked element '' ( an input that yields @xmath2 ) which gives us a quadratic speedup relative to the classical method . \n in particular when we know the number @xmath4 of marked elements , grover s algorithm will find one of these elements with high probability using only about @xmath5 queries to the subroutine . \n a slight modification of this algorithm can actually increase the success probability to @xmath2 while using at most one more query ( see below ) . \n all this also works when we are only told that the number of marked elements is either @xmath4 or @xmath1 . \n on the other hand , when we do nt know the number of marked elements , grover s algorithm does nt perform that well . in particular to get a certainly correct answer any algorithm will use on the order of @xmath0 queries as for the classical case @xcite . \n if we allow for some error probability , a grover type quantum search still helps . note that when the quantum algorithm outputs a candidate marked element \n , we can check it with just one more query . \n thus the only error that can happen , is that the algorithm wrongly says that there are no marked elements . \n thus the error is so - called one sided and we have not only a quantum monte carlo algorithm ( bqp ) but actually a quantum - rp algorithm . \n so the problem now is : given @xmath0 and some upper bound on the error probability @xmath6 , find an algorithm that uses as few queries to the black box as possible . \n note that by error probability we mean the error probability for the worst case , which here in particular means the number of marked elements for which the algorithm performs worst . \n a simple , but not optimal , solution to this problem is to run grover s algorithm many times for some random number of iterations (= number of queries ) between @xmath1 and @xmath7 , which is about the optimum for just one marked element . \n we choose the number of iterations of each run uniformly at random from the given range . from the evolution of the state vector ( of the qc ) in grover \n s algorithm ( see below ) it is easy to see that in each such run and for any number of marked elements ( except @xmath1 ) the probability of finding a marked element is about @xmath8 . \n actually a careful analysis ( see below ) shows that for the worst - case number of marked elements @xmath4 , it s about @xmath9 . by repeating this \n many times we get asymptotically at most about the following number of queries :    @xmath10      the proposed algorithm again basically consists of many runs of grover s algorithm , each for some numbers of iterations ( = number of queries ) . \n it consists of 2 parts plus possibly a third one to improve it a bit . \n the first part checks for all numbers of marked elements from @xmath2 to some maximum @xmath11 , each time running grover s algorithm for the appropriate number of iterations , which is about @xmath5 for @xmath4 marked elements . \n if the maximal error probability @xmath6 which we allow is below about @xmath12 we have to use the exact version of grover which is guaranteed to work for a given known number of marked elements . \n the total number of queries of this first step is about :    @xmath13    which i ve obtained by approximating the sum with an integral . \n the second part consists of a number of grover runs for a random number of iterations smaller than the last grover run of the first part . \n thus we choose the number of iterations uniformly at random from the range @xmath14 . \n this i propose to do @xmath15 times . \n thus the second part consists of at most the following number of queries :    @xmath16    it turns out that this choice of the number of grover runs in the second part which gives equal number of queries for the first and second parts is optimal .    in the second part we have probability about @xmath8 to find a marked element in every run , \n provided the number of marked elements is larger than @xmath11 . \n say the actual ( worst case ) probability is some @xmath17 ( which is a bit smaller than 1/2 and which we will determine below ) , then @xmath18 and we get the following number of queries for the total algorithm as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath6 :    @xmath19    note the ( admittedly small ) improvement relative to the simpler algorithm described above . \n note also that @xmath6 as a function of @xmath20 for a fixed @xmath0 goes as    @xmath21    which is of course better than the exponential we could achieve by just running the same probabilistic algorithm over and over . \n it turns out that the worst case detection probability @xmath17 actually occurs for a number of marked elements @xmath4 close to @xmath0 . \n so if we want we can add a third part to the algorithm where we take care of this worst case by just classically checking a number of random inputs to the black box . to achieve the maximum allowed error probability @xmath6 \n this only takes a number of queries that is of a smaller order than the number of queries used in the first two parts , thus we can neglect the cost of this third part .    in the remainder of the paper \n i will determine the maximal error probability @xmath17 for a grover run with a random number of iterations and i will also give a simple argument that an exact version of grover s algorithm can be constructed for a known number @xmath4 of marked elements , which has been known before ( i think it s by peter hoyer , but ca nt find a reference ) . \n first we have to review grover s algorithm :      each iteration of grover s algorithm consists of the following four steps :    @xmath22    the initial state is the uniform amplitude superposition of all possible @xmath0 inputs to the black box . \n the first step involves querying the oracle , while the second and fourth steps involve hadamard transforming each of the @xmath23 qubits ( thus here we have @xmath24 ) . \n we can write the initial state as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the set of marked elements while @xmath27 and @xmath28 . \n it turns out ( and is easy to see ) that after any number of applications of the 4 steps of grover s algorithm the state remains of the above form , thus a superposition with real coefficients of the uniform amplitude superposition of all unmarked ( basis- ) states and of the uniform amplitude superposition of all marked states . \n the actual calculation consists simply of applying the 4 above steps to each of these 2 states . in every iteration \n the state vector gets rotated by some angle @xmath29 , so after @xmath30 iterations we have :    @xmath31    where @xmath29 is given by    @xmath32    it is easy to check that @xmath33 which will facilitate the subsequent calculations . \n the probability of finding a marked element after @xmath30 steps is @xmath34 . if we choose the number of iterations uniformly at random from the range @xmath35 we get the success probability    @xmath36    where the summation is easily accomplished because we can write the trigonometric functions in terms of exponentials @xmath37 which gives us geometric series . \n also we used @xmath33 . note that , as stated above , @xmath38 . \n now we have to look for the minimum of @xmath17 ( = worst case ) over the range @xmath39 of marked elements . \n the lower end of this range corresponds to @xmath40 . \n the following plot shows @xmath17 as a function of @xmath29 ( here for @xmath41 ) \n . note that @xmath42 while @xmath43 . \n the point @xmath44 is where @xmath45 first reaches @xmath8 . \n significant for us is the next local minimum @xmath46 and the last local minimum @xmath47 , where i have taken the limit @xmath48 to get these values . \n these two values are the absolute minimum ( in our range ) and the next larger local minimum . if we include the third part of the algorithm ( classical checking ) we do nt have to worry about @xmath49 , thus @xmath50 . then asymptotically the number of queries becomes ( from equation [ res ] ) : \n @xmath51    the second graph above shows how the success probability evolves in grover s algorithm for 3 cases of interest . \n the range shown in the plot is the range which we use in the second part of the algorithm , thus from 0 to about @xmath52 iterations . \n the thick solid line is for @xmath11 marked elements , for which the average probability over this range is @xmath8 . \n the dashed graph corresponds to the first local minimum in the first plot , whereas the dotted graph gives the last local minimum which occurs for only few unmarked elements . \n here i give a simple argument why grover s algorithm can easily be modified to give a correct answer for a known number @xmath4 of marked elements . the problem with standard \n grover is that @xmath53 never exactly becomes @xmath2 . \n our task now is to modify the 4 steps in grover s algorithm so that we get a smaller rotation angle @xmath54 . \n imagine we apply these ( modified ) 4 steps to the initial ( uniform amplitude ) state . \n usually in the 1 . \n step we change the phase of the marked states by @xmath55 which allows us to increase the amplitude of the marked states to @xmath56 . if we do nt change the phase it is easy to see that the 4 steps of grover s algorithm do nt change the initial state at all , thus the amplitude of the marked states remains @xmath57 . by continuity \n it is now clear that we can adjust the absolute value of the amplitude of the marked states to any value between these extremes . to get the amplitude back to real and positive \n we then call the black box once more to rotate the phase of the marked elements by the right amount \n .    actually one can avoid this last ( additional ) call to the black box by also choosing a different phase change in step 3 , but this is not so easy to explain . \n of course there are also various other ways to make grover s algorithm exact . \n the algorithm we have constructed is clearly not optimal . \n it s order _ is _ optimal , as stated in corollary 3 on page 6 of @xcite , but the performance can obviously still be improved by a multiplicative constant . \n my guess is that the number of queries can be reduced by at least a factor of @xmath58 , but probably by a factor of @xmath59 or more . \n unfortunately no bound on the multiplicative constant is specified in @xcite .    in the second part of the algorithm we choose the number of iterations of grover at random . \n this is not very elegant and certainly not optimal , but it makes the algorithm and the assessment of its performance easy . \n a general observation is that zero error algorithms are a rather academic and unphysical concept . \n any computer has some failure probability , this is especially true for quantum computers . \n fortunately fault tolerant techniques allow us to greatly increase the reliability . \n essentially the error probability can be reduced exponentially in the resources we invest into fault tolerance which allows us to attain a reliability that is good enough for all practical purposes . \n so what about my use of the exact variant of grover s algorithm ? \n actually we do nt really need the exact version , we merely need to be able to greatly reduce the error without using many more queries . in a fault \n tolerant implementation we actually anyways ca nt really apply phase rotations by any amount because we only can use a finite `` universal '' set of gates . \n the better we want to approximate a given phase rotation the more such gates we have to use . \n fortunately the number of gates necessary typically only increases as the logarithm of the precision of the approximation .", "StartTimeOffset": 1614928577388, "RequestID": "3b3c5834706c7c57d981c8001d193106862e007f", "TotalTokens": 2861}

zero neutrino masses ( see @xcite for a review ) . \n oscillation experiments do not give us any information on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , only on the mass differences between the different mass eigenstates and mixing angles . \n the current best upper bounds on the neutrino mass from particle experiments come from the troitsk @xcite and mainz @xcite tritium beta decay experiments that found upper bounds on @xmath0 of @xmath8ev ( 95% c.l . ) . \n the katrin experiment @xcite that will start taking data in 2010 , is expected to lower this limit on @xmath0 by an order of magnitude to @xmath9ev ( in the case of no detection ) after three years of running . \n effects of neutrino masses can also be seen in cosmological observables , and the best upper limits on the absolute scale of the neutrino mass today come from cosmology . \n both cmb and the large scale structures ( lss ) of the galaxy distribution are probes that are sensitive to the neutrino mass , the observable quantity being the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath10 . \n the upper bounds on @xmath11 from cosmology range from @xmath12ev @xcite to @xmath13ev @xcite ( 95% c.l . ) , depending on the data @xcite and cosmological model @xcite used .    on the experimental side \n there is a claim of detection of the absolute scale of the neutrino mass from the heidelberg - moscow neutrinoless double beta decay experiment , with an effective electron neutrino mass of @xmath14ev ( 99.73% c.l . ) \n @xcite . however , these results are regarded somewhat controversial . \n the cosmological implications of this result are discussed in @xcite . \n we know that neutrinos are massive , and since we have no current priors on the neutrino mass in the allowed cosmological range , one should always marginalize over @xmath11 when constraining other cosmological parameters . \n @xmath11 turns out to be partially degenerate with several of the standard cosmological parameters , such that this marginalization over @xmath11 weakens the bounds on the other parameters in our model . \n thus , any prior knowledge of @xmath11 from non - cosmological experiments will serve to break degeneracies and improve the constraints on other cosmological parameters . \n the katrin experiment will provide us with such a prior on @xmath11 in a range that is relevant for cosmology . in this paper \n we investigate how the results from katrin will affect our estimates of other cosmological parameters . \n limits on the neutrino mass when combining results from katrin and wmap have been studied in a recent paper by that hst et al . \n our emphasis in this paper is on how other cosmological parameters are affected when the results from katrin are used as an external prior . \n section [ sec : cosmology ] contains a short review on the effect of massive neutrinos in cosmology . in section [ sec : data ] we will present the data and methods that we will use in our analysis , including the assumed priors from the katrin experiment . then we will present our results in section [ sec : results ] . \n a comparison of @xmath15 values found when introducing the katrin priors is presented in section [ sec : chisq ] . \n finally we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] . \n all our results are derived within the standard cosmological paradigm of a flat @xmath16cdm model , using the following free parameters : @xmath17 . \n here @xmath18 denotes the energy density of energy component @xmath19 ( m = matter , b = baryons , @xmath16=cosmological constant , cdm = cold dark matter ) relative to the total energy density of a spatially flat universe . \n the matter density , @xmath20 , is the sum of all non - relativistic components , such that @xmath21 . \n the parameter @xmath22 is the dimensionless hubble parameter , defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations , while @xmath25 gives the tilt of the primordial power spectrum . finally , @xmath26 is the optical depth at reionization . for more details on the parameter definitions , \n see the description of the cosmomc code @xcite . \n the effect of massive neutrinos on cosmological observables is parameterized by @xmath27 , the sum of the neutrino masses , and is related to the neutrino energy density by the simple relation @xcite @xmath28 . \n we will also extend the parameter space by including @xmath29 , the equation of state parameter of dark energy , as a free parameter . \n we will assume @xmath29 to be constant . \n this parameter may be interesting to study , as it is fundamental in the understanding of the nature of dark energy , and since it is known to be slightly correlated with @xmath11 @xcite . \n it should be stressed that this analysis rests on the assumption of a standard thermal background of 3 weakly interacting neutrino species . \n alternatives to this picture are studied in e.g. @xcite and @xcite . \n recent reviews of the role of massive neutrinos in cosmology can be found in @xcite . in this section \n we will only give a brief description of the most important effects of @xmath11 on relevant cosmological observables . \n we will throughout this work assume that the neutrino mass eigenstates are degenerate , such that @xmath30 . \n in the mass range that we will operating in , it has been shown that this is a valid simplification when it comes to cosmological observables @xcite . \n effects on the cmb from massive neutrinos manifest themselves mainly on the level of background evolution . in the neutrino mass \n ranges relevant to us , the neutrinos will still be relativistic at the time of matter - radiation equality , and must be regarded as a radiation component when it comes to the background evolution of the universe . increasing @xmath11 ( and thus also @xmath31 ) , keeping @xmath20 constant , will thus postpone the time of matter - radiation equality . this will enhance the acoustic peaks in the cmb power spectrum and give a small horizontal shift of the peaks to larger scales . \n this effect is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : p ] . to compensate for this effect , one can increase @xmath20 and decrease @xmath32 . \n it is already obvious that @xmath11 will be correlated with both @xmath32 and @xmath20 ( and thus also @xmath4 when we stick to the assumption of spatial flatness ) . \n another effect comes from neutrino free - streaming , which will smoothen out gravitational wells on scales below an @xmath27- dependent neutrino free streaming scale @xcite . on scales smaller than this , \n the acoustic oscillations will be enhanced , increasing the height of the peaks in the cmb power spectrum . \n neutrino masses affect the lss power spectrum in an even more distinct way . again \n , massive neutrinos will suppress structure growth on scales below a free streaming scale given by @xcite @xmath33 the smaller @xmath11 , the larger scales will be affected , and the larger @xmath11 , the more suppression of power on the scales affected . \n the effect of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum can be seen in figure [ fig : p ] . \n again , @xmath20 is kept constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated for by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly . \n cmb ( left panel ) and lss ( right panel ) power spectra with different values of @xmath11 . here \n @xmath20 is held constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   cmb ( left panel ) and lss ( right panel ) power spectra with different values of @xmath11 . here \n @xmath20 is held constant , and increasing @xmath11 has been compensated by decreasing @xmath34 correspondingly.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] \n our analysis include both observations of cmb , lss , sn1a , information about baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and constraints from the cluster mass function from weak gravitational lensing . \n we have also applied priors on @xmath32 and @xmath35 . \n the cmb data used in our analysis , comes from the temperature @xcite and polarization @xcite data from the 3-year data release from the wmap team . \n the wmap experiment is a satellite based full -

hat prior on the age @xmath44 of the universe : @xmath45 .      the katrin @xcite experiment measures the energy distribution of electrons from tritium beta decay . \n the exact shape of the end of this spectrum will depend on how much of the energy that is bound in the outgoing electron neutrinos , and thus also be a probe of the electron neutrino mass . \n if katrin does not detect @xmath0 , they are expected to place an upper limit on @xmath9ev ( 90% c.l . ) . \n they expect to reach an uncertainty of @xmath46 .    here \n we have adopted this uncertainty for two cases , one assuming @xmath1ev ( i.e. , no detection by katrin ) , and one assuming @xmath2ev ( giving @xmath47ev ) . \n further we have assumed the gaussian distribution of @xmath48 around these values @xcite , and used this as a prior in our cosmological parameter analysis .      employing the publicly available markov chain monte carlo code cosmomc@xcite \n we have studied our seven -

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in this paper we have investigated whether constraints on @xmath0 from the katrin experiment will affect our knowledge on cosmological parameters . \n this has been done for two scenarios , one where @xmath1ev , and one where @xmath2ev . \n we have carried out the analysis both with a simple 7-parameter model with a cosmological constant , and extending the parameter space to include the equation of state for dark energy , @xmath29 , as a free parameter .    when using wmap data only , we find that knowledge from the katrin experiment will contribute significantly to constrain a wide range of cosmological parameters , regardless of which of the @xmath0 scenarios we use . \n for instance will the significance of @xmath3 depend on what katrin tells us about @xmath0 . \n other parameters that are sensitive to the value of @xmath0 are @xmath20 , @xmath4 , @xmath38 and @xmath32 .    adding more cosmological data sets , both from sn1a , galaxy catalogues and other priors , the situation changes a bit . in this case \n @xmath11 is strongly constrained from above by cosmology alone , such that an additional katrin prior in the case of @xmath1ev has little effect on our cosmological parameter constraints . however , \n if katrin measures a neutrino mass of @xmath2ev , there will be significant shifts in several of the parameter distributions . \n one should also note that several of the extra cosmological data sets added here may be affected by uncontrolled systematics ( see @xcite ) . \n therefore , having cosmological constraints from wmap+katrin without any additional cosmological data sets will be interesting regardless of the possibility to add other cosmological data sets to obtain similar results .    in the case of @xmath29 \n the most interesting result occurs in the scenario of a katrin defection of @xmath2ev and using the full range of data sets . in this case \n , @xmath50 is favored at a @xmath51 level . \n it should also be mentioned that there are degeneracies between parameters from different cosmological inflation models and neutrino masses ( see @xcite ) . \n this means that a katrin prior on @xmath11 will be important also for constraining inflationary models .    to conclude , we find that the expected limits on @xmath0 from katrin , will be a useful input to constrain cosmological models , regardless of the value of @xmath0 . \n if katrin detects a non - zero value of @xmath0 , this would be especially interesting . \n we wish to thank ole hst , klaus eitel and hans kristian eriksen for useful comments and suggestions . \n the work of e is supported by the research council of norway , project number 162830 .", "StartTimeOffset": 1621040449680, "RequestID": "03e832319df324774acc7379cce6d3f948c3493a", "TotalTokens": 3904}
{"ContextTokens": 2243, "GeneratedTokens": 210, "SynthesizedBody": "the principal way to trace molecular gas in galaxies is with the rotational lines of the co molecule , due to co s relatively high abundance ( about @xmath4 of h@xmath3 ) and low excitation requirements ( @xmath5 k ) . \n the high abundance of co generally makes it optically thick , especially in the lowest ( @xmath6 ) transition , with the result that the _ effective _ critical density is quite low , @xmath7 @xmath8 , and the excitation temperature @xmath9 approaches the kinetic temperature in most molecule - rich regions . unlike co , h@xmath3 itself has no permitted rotational transitions , and can only be observed in infrared ( quadrupolar or rovibrational ) lines that require more extreme ( @xmath10 k ) excitation conditions . \n the main disadvantage of co is that its high opacity makes it a poor tracer of column density . \n indeed , the theoretical basis for using co as a column density tracer is the _ virial hypothesis _ : the co emission comes from an ensemble of virialised clouds that do not shield each other in position - velocity space . for a virialised cloud , \n the size @xmath11 , density @xmath12 , and linewidth @xmath13 are related by : @xmath14 then the co luminosity is proportional to the h@xmath3 mass , assuming roughly constant density and temperature : @xmath15 however , the assumption of virial equilibrium in molecular clouds has been questioned ( e.g.  ballesteros - paredes & mac low 2002 ) , and in regions where co comes predominantly from a diffuse intercloud medium  as has been suggested for starburst galaxies ( solomon et al.1997 , downes & solomon 1998)the linearity between co emission and h@xmath3 column density is likely to break down . \n co is also not as self - shielding at h@xmath3 , and might be dissociated even in regions where h@xmath3 is present . \n finally , its abundance relative to h@xmath3 will vary according to the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and so it is unlikely to be detectable in very low metallicity regions . \n other methods to trace molecular gas include observations of far - infrared and submillimetre emission from dust , and ultraviolet ( uv ) h@xmath3 absorption towards continuum sources . \n dust emission is usually optically thin and depends only linearly on temperature in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum , although there are additional uncertainties arising from the adopted grain size distribution and gas - to - dust ratio . \n alton et al .  ( 2002 ) show that the 850@xmath16 m dust emission from the disk on ngc 6946 matches the co emission very well . \n the uv absorption technique is biased against high gas columns because of extinction , but does provide a powerful tool to study _ diffuse _ h@xmath3 . \n tumlinson et al .  ( \n 2002 ) find that the diffuse h@xmath3 fraction in the magellanic clouds is very low , @xmath11% compared to @xmath110% in the galaxy .    for the remainder of this paper , \n we assume that co can be used as a quantitative tracer of h@xmath3 within the disks of normal spiral galaxies . \n our general knowledge of the co distribution in galaxies is still based on the single - dish survey of some 300 galaxies conducted with the fcrao 14-m telescope ( young et al . \n 1995 ) . using multiple - pointing observations for 193 of the galaxies , \n young et al.concluded that co is usually peaked toward galaxy centres : only in 28 galaxies was there an indication of a molecular ring or off - centre co peak . at higher resolution , however , the picture is not so simple . \n the bima survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song ) , which imaged the distribution of co emission in 44 nearby spirals at 69  resolution and included single - dish data for full flux recovery , finds that the co distribution in spiral galaxies is generally very heterogeneous ( regan et al . \n 2001 , helfer et al . \n even when azimuthally averaged , large departures from a smooth exponential profile are seen , due to the very clumpy distribution of molecular gas ( which responds strongly to spiral arms , bar perturbations , etc . ) . in addition , only 20 of the 44 song galaxies exhibit their maximum co surface brightness within the central beamwidth , with six galaxies showing no detectable co emission at all in this region ( helfer et al . \n 2003 ) .    with the higher resolution imaging , the distributions of molecular gas and stars can be compared on scales relevant for studying the effects of internal dynamical processes . \n even though many galaxies in bima song do not show central co peaks , the majority do display a co excess in the inner @xmath120  above the exponential profile , where the stellar bulge contributes a similar excess to the stellar light profile ( regan et al . \n 2001 , thornley et al . \n representative profiles are shown in figure 1 . \n concentrating on the 27 bima song galaxies with the most extended co detections , thornley et al . \n ( 2003 ) have found that such co excesses occur in both early and late - type galaxies , and are nearly universal in galaxies with some bar contribution ( type sab or sb ) . \n this suggests that at least some of the central excesses are due to bar - driven inflow of molecular gas ( sakamoto et al .  1999 , \n sheth et al . \n however , roughly half of the selected galaxies without significant bar contributions also show such central excesses , suggesting that significant bars are not required to produce gas inflow . \n it is notable that the hi radial distribution is almost always much flatter than the co , and often shows a central depression , as if the atomic gas has undergone a phase transition to form h@xmath3 . \n recent comparisons of single - dish co maps and vla hi imaging by crosthwaite et al . \n ( 2001 , 2002 ) highlight this dichotomy . \n wong & blitz ( 2002 ) found that for seven galaxies with high - resolution co and hi data , the hi / co ratio increases with radius as roughly @xmath17 , consistent with being determined largely by the hydrostatic pressure of the ism , as predicted by elmegreen ( 1993 ) . in this interpretation \n , star formation is rarely found in low - pressure regions such as the halo or outer disk because the dominant phase of neutral gas there is atomic . \n the fcrao survey indicated that co emission scales roughly linearly with star formation tracers ( e.g. rownd & young 1999 ) except in merging or interacting galaxies ( young et al . \n 1996 ) , which show enhanced star formation rates . \n kennicutt ( 1998 ) , averaging co , hi , and h@xmath18 fluxes within the optical disks of 61 galaxies , found a strong correlation between the sfr and the total gas content , consistent with a schmidt ( 1959 ) law : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the surface densities of the star formation rate ( in @xmath22 ) and total gas mass ( in @xmath23 ) respectively . \n the correlation of sfr with hi or co individually was much poorer , suggesting that the gas involved in star formation can quickly cycle between atomic and molecular phases . \n how does the star formation law behave on smaller scales ? \n wong & blitz ( 2002 ) compared co , hi , and h@xmath18 emission in seven galaxies from the bima song sample , and found that the schmidt law continues to hold for azimuthally averaged rings spaced by @xmath11 kpc . \n the exact slope of the power law depends on how one chooses to correct for h@xmath18 extinction ; an extinction - free sfr indicator , such as the total ir emission ( kewley et al . \n 2002 ) might yield a more accurate slope than h@xmath18 . \n regardless , the correlation of sfr with co is considerably stronger than that with hi , as the hi profile is often declining or flat in the inner regions , whereas star formation is generally centrally peaked ( figure 2 ) . \n it is unclear whether the poor correlation of sfr with co found by kennicutt ( 1998 ) may be due to differences in galaxy selection , as the galaxies studied by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) are relatively strong co emitters . \n if sfr generally correlates with molecular rather than atomic gas , then the schmidt law index of @xmath21.5 may derive from a roughly linear relation between sfr and h@xmath3 coupled with a weak dependence of the molecular fraction @xmath24 on @xmath25 : @xmath26 this implies that star formation is a two - step process involving molecular cloud formation , and contrasts with the conventional interpretation that the index results from the free - fall ( dynamical ) time being the natural timescale for star formation : @xmath27 indeed , it has long been known that the star formation timescale is much longer than the free - fall time ; this inefficiency of star formation is reflected in the numerical factor in eq . \n [ obeqn ] and @xmath28 in eq . \n [ theqn ] . \n recently , two studies have tried to explain the observed schmidt law using the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) that results from interstellar turbulence , as revealed in simulations by ( e.g. ) wada & norman ( 2001 ) . \n elmegreen ( 2002 ) hypothesises that only that part of the density pdf above @xmath29 @xmath8 proceeds to form stars on a dynamical timescale , whereas kravtsov ( 2003 ) assumes a much lower critical density of 50 @xmath8 but a much longer star formation timescale of 4 gyr . in both cases , \n the presence of a critical density ensures that only a small fraction of the galactic gas is involved in star formation at a given time . \n detailed case studies of nearby galaxies such as m33 and the lmc may be able to shed further light on this issue . \n we thank eva schinnerer for providing the iram pdb image of ngc 4736 used in the talk , and leo blitz for extensive discussions over the past few years on many of the topics covered here . \n this work was supported by a bolton fellowship awarded to t.w . by the csiro atnf .", "StartTimeOffset": 1627263139986, "RequestID": "4cedaad84faaa1b92aa0273b5b348973ff54c742", "TotalTokens": 2453}

dependent hamiltonian connecting @xmath35 and @xmath36 . \n in sec . 2 we describe the lie algebra of poincar group as eqs .  . if the group is linearly represented , i.e. represented by a homomorphism from the group to linear operators , then the lie algebra is nothing but the commutator algebra of the generators . \n however , as is well - known , in quantum theory , symmetry group @xmath37 is represented projectively in general  @xcite : unitary operators @xmath38 form a linear representation up to phase factor , which means @xmath39 setting @xmath40 without loss of generality and expanding @xmath41 around @xmath42 , we get , from eq .  , the algebra of the generators , wherein there appear central charges corresponding to the phase factor @xmath43 . the associative law of the products of @xmath41 s @xmath44 gives some constraints , called the cocycle condition , on the the phases @xmath45 . if we multiply @xmath41 by a phase factor @xmath46 and redefine @xmath47 as @xmath41then the phase becomes @xmath48 . in most cases , \n this redefinition of @xmath41 could makes the phase factor to disappear  @xcite \n .    in our case of ( 1 + 2)-dimensional poincar group , the algebra of the generators @xmath8 has the central charges in the righthand side of eq .   : for example , @xmath49 & =   p_i + c_{0 , 0i } ,         \\label{projkh}\\\\   i [ k_i , p_j ] & =   \\delta_{ij } h     + c_{j , 0i } ,    \\label{projkp}\\\\   i [ j , p_i ] & = -

zero central charge in the other configuration . \n the casimir energy is the difference between the vacuum energies of two different configurations , in our case @xmath35 and @xmath36 . \n the hamiltonian of the @xmath23-th mode scalar field given by @xmath59 has the mass parameter @xmath60 and hence become time - dependent when connecting these two configurations . \n we set the time - dependence of @xmath61 as , for example , @xmath62 as shown in fig . 1 .    , width=283 ]    in the regions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the hamiltonian , denoted as @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively , is time -

dependent hamiltonian connecting these static configurations . * \n even if we could choose the additive constant of the hamiltonian so as to make the representation of the poincar group linear ( no central charge in the algebra ) in the one configuration , the representation of the group become projective ( nonzero central charge in the algebra ) in the other . \n a few comments are order . \n first , the additive constants such as @xmath82 in eq . \n are divergent and the discussion in this paper is formal : we should investigate the energy density @xmath88 ( the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian density @xmath89 ) instead of the total energy @xmath82 ( the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath90 ) . in particular , we are to consider , instead of eq .  , the commutator between @xmath78 and the boost operator denisity @xmath91 , which may suffer from the singular schwinger terms appearing in the commutator among the components of stress tensor @xcite . \n second , we have focused on the @xmath23-th mode @xmath20 in most of the present paper . \n we should sum up all of the modes and treat the resulting divergence using some regularization . \n detailed study of these two points will be a subject of further research . \n we thank the anonymous referee for noticing the importance of the expectation values and commutators of stress tensor and the related references . \n one of the authors ( m. m. ) thanks c. hattori , m. matsuda , and t. matsuoka for discussion .", "StartTimeOffset": 1648023130374, "RequestID": "677ced967a71ccc53fa47af1923198c8b3a645f5", "TotalTokens": 3430}
{"ContextTokens": 2584, "GeneratedTokens": 68, "SynthesizedBody": "in theoretical extensions of the standard model , all the new particles are not necessarily on the heavy side ; the prediction of very light ( sub - ev ) scalar or pseudoscalar particles that are very weakly interacting is actually quite generic . \n looking for signatures of such `` axion - like particles '' ( or alps ) therefore represents another exciting possibility to probe the kind of physics there can be at very high scales , associated with these new degrees of freedom , which is complementary to collider searches . \n it is thus not surprising that a lot of ongoing effort is made to scan the parameter space of these hypothetical particles , actively searched for mostly via their electromagnetic coupling . \n current experimental developments include for instance light - shining - through - a - wall experiments such as alps , which is being upgraded  @xcite , or projects of next - generation helioscopes such as the international axion observatory  @xcite . \n due to their mixing with photons , these spinless particles are moreover not only of interest in particle physics but also in astrophysics , as their existence would change the properties and the propagation of light emitted from distant sources . \n a sizeable signal could be expected as the distances involved are huge , even if the alps are only coupled very weakly . in this context , various phenomena have in fact already been interpreted as possible astrophysical hints for the existence of alps , especially in the low - mass region of the parameter space : namely alps with masses @xmath0  ev and couplings to photons @xmath1@xmath2  gev@xmath3 . for a recent summary of the motivations for these particles from theory and of their implications , see refs . \n @xcite and references therein .    in this work \n @xcite , we consider light coming from quasars . \n the fact that these high - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are among the brightest and furthest steady light sources known in the universe makes them particularly appealing to look for signals of alps and to constrain their parameter space . \n we focus on the window of astrophysical interest and show that constraints can be derived using both linear and circular polarisation data . \n polarimetry is an extremely valuable tool to search for axion - like particles as the interaction of these particles with photons , in external magnetic fields for instance , would change the polarisation of light  @xcite . \n suitable interaction lagrangians read @xmath4 and lead to similar phenomenological consequences ; henceforth we focus on pseudoscalars . in a nutshell , \n one expects from the mixing that even unpolarised light will develop a non - vanishing degree of linear polarisation and that , in general , linear and circular polarisation will convert at least partially into one another as a consequence of phase - shifts induced by the mixing . as is well - known and readily seen from eq . \n , this is because , in an external magnetic field , such spinless particles only couple to one direction of polarisation  @xcite .    the mixing can actually be very efficient at modifying polarisation and can therefore be constrained by precise measurements . \n the limits derived from the absence of rotation of the linear polarisation of uv light from agn  @xcite are a recent example of this .    in this work , \n we follow a different idea , which is to consider the spectroscopically defined quasar classes known to have the smallest intrinsic polarisations in visible light , and to compare the predictions of the mixing with observations . as already discussed by harari and sikivie in ref . \n @xcite , light from distant sources should be characterised by at least some amount of polarisation if axion - photon mixing happens along the way . \n we do this for both linear ( @xmath5 ) and circular ( @xmath6 ) polarisation . \n quasar polarisation measurements at optical wavelengths can be found in the literature with uncertainties below 0.1% . \n light from quasars is known to be intrinsically linearly polarised , as differences can be seen in different spectroscopic types , and the polarisation is at the 1%-level for the least polarised ones . \n if there are many catalogs of linear polarisation measurements , the same can not be said about circular polarisation : it has rarely been studied , despite being measured in the same way as the linear one by simply adding a quarter - wave retarder plate . following the predictions of the mixing , new dedicated observations of quasar circular polarisation in visible light \n have therefore been carried out  @xcite . \n for observational reasons , most of the objects are located towards the north galactic pole direction , which points to the center of the local supercluster ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite . \n no evidence for non - vanishing circular polarisation could be found at the 3@xmath7-level however  @xcite . \n we will not repeat here the discussion leading to our subsample ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) or the method used to obtain our limits , as all the necessary details can be found in ref . \n let us simply emphasise again that we have aimed at being as conservative as possible : taking only into account the influence of the magnetic field in the supercluster , allowing the magnetic field to get a longitudinal component most of the time ( and allowing other quantities to fluctuate ) , as well as considering initially unpolarised light to make sure that the final polarisation due to the mixing is not overestimated for example .    using a conservative method leading to robust results \n , we can safely say that the mixing of light with axion - like particles is strongly constrained by the good - quality measurements of polarisation , and especially of circular polarisation , even when bandwidth effects are taken into account  @xcite . \n however this might say something about the magnetic fields or the electron density , and not about alps . \n this is why we provide here the evolution of our limit with the maximum transverse magnetic field strength and with the mean electron density . \n the only reported detection available in the literature for the magnetic field in the local supercluster plane favours a collection of @xmath8 g magnetic field domains that are coherent over @xmath9  kpc  @xcite , averaging to a field 510 times weaker at the supercluster scale . \n if we use this result , the 2@xmath7-limit we obtain is @xmath10  gev@xmath3 for @xmath11  ev ; as emphasised in our paper  @xcite , this limit can however be easily rescaled for any other value of the magnetic field strength as it always appears together with the coupling constant in the equations .    on the other hand , in order to give the evolution of our limit with the average electron density , we can take advantage of the fact that , for alp masses much smaller than the plasma frequency @xmath12 the two dimensionless quantities that determine the evolution of the stokes parameters then become independent of @xmath13 , leading to a plateau  @xcite . here , we give in fig . \n [ fig : ap_electrondensity ] the evolution of this plateau for various values of the average electron density @xmath14 ; the case illustrated in the paper  @xcite is given by @xmath15  @xmath16 , which is the value usually considered in superclusters . \n the information is summarised by saying that points in the parameter space are excluded at 1@xmath7 , 2@xmath7 and 3@xmath7 when the average probability that they contradict the observations is respectively 68.3% , 95.5% and 99.7% . \n as anticipated in the paper , the limits on the coupling constant @xmath17 for nearly massless pseudoscalars would be more stringent for values of the plasma frequency smaller than the one we have considered , which reflects the fact that the mixing then becomes more efficient . \n conversely , if the electron density in the local supercluster were to actually be much higher than that , then no constraint could be put on such particles as the mixing would then simply not take place in that medium .     on the average electron density . \n the maximum transverse magnetic strength used here is @xmath18 g . ] \n [ sec : figures ] \n we thank the ifpa group for the financial support received to attend this workshop , and acknowledge useful discussions with jean - ren cudell and damien hutsemkers . \n r.  bhre , b.  dbrich , j.  dreyling - eschweiler , s.  ghazaryan , r.  hodajerdi , d.  horns , f.  januschek and e .- a . \n knabbe _ et al . \n _ , jinst * 1308 * ( 2013 ) t09001 [ arxiv:1302.5647 [ physics.ins-det ] ] . j.  k.  vogel , f.  t.  avignone , g.  cantatore , j.  m.  carmona , s.  caspi , s.  a.  cetin , f.  e.  christensen and a.  dael _ et al . \n _ , arxiv:1302.3273 [ physics.ins-det ] . \n a.  payez , ph.d . \n thesis , arxiv:1308.6608 [ astro-ph.co ] . see the introduction and chap .  1 \n . k.  baker , g.  cantatore , s.  a.  cetin , m.  davenport , k.  desch , b.  dbrich , h.  gies and i.  g.  irastorza _ et al . \n _ , annalen phys . \n * 525 * ( 2013 ) a93 [ arxiv:1306.2841 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  ringwald , phys . \n dark univ . \n * 1 * ( 2012 ) 116 [ arxiv:1210.5081 [ hep - ph ] ] . \n a.  payez , j.r . \n cudell and d.  hutsemkers , jcap * 1207 * ( 2012 ) 041 [ arxiv:1204.6187 [ astro-ph.co ] ] . \n l.  maiani , r.  petronzio and e.  zavattini , phys . \n b * 175 * ( 1986 ) 359 . \n g.  raffelt and l.  stodolsky , phys . \n d * 37 * ( 1988 ) 1237 . \n d.  harari and p.  sikivie , phys . \n b * 289 * ( 1992 ) 67 . \n p.  sikivie , phys .  rev \n .  lett . \n * 51 * ( 1983 ) 1415 [ erratum - ibid . \n * 52 * ( 1984 ) 695 ] . \n d.  horns , l.  maccione , a.  mirizzi and m.  roncadelli , phys . \n d * 85 * ( 2012 ) 085021 [ arxiv:1203.2184 [ astro-ph.he ] ] ;

{"ContextTokens": 3552, "GeneratedTokens": 191, "SynthesizedBody": "one of the most prevalent methods for testing the fatigue properties of a material is to construct a constant amplitude strain - life curve . in this method , a sample \n is strained cyclically between two strain levels until failure . \n this test is performed on a number of identical samples at different strain magnitudes , and the results are plotted as a strain - life curve . \n this `` @xmath0 '' curve can be fitted to the basquin - manson - coffin , @xcite ( bmc ) equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is half of the strain range , @xmath3 is the elastic strain , @xmath4 is the plastic strain , @xmath5 is the fatigue strength coefficient , @xmath6 is the elastic modulus , @xmath7 is the fatigue strength exponent , @xmath8 is the fatigue ductility coefficient , @xmath9 is the fatigue ductility exponent , and @xmath10 is the number of reversals until failure . the low cycle fatigue regime is considered a product of plastic deformation , and the high cycle portion is related primarily to elastic deformation . \n this approach gives a reasonably accurate prediction of sample life at constant amplitude cyclic strains . \n however , parts in service are rarely subjected to idealized constant amplitude cyclic strains and instead undergo variable amplitude loading . the palmgren - miner ( pm ) \n rule is a widely used approach for predicting part lifetime under variable amplitude loading . \n this method hypothesizes that the damage caused by each stress state in a variable amplitude load history is a function of the number of times that the particular cyclic stress state occurs and the number of cycles it would take for the sample to fail from a constant amplitude history at that stress state .  @xcite mathematically the palmgren - miner rule is written , @xmath11 where the sum is taken over all stress states with @xmath12 denoting a particular state , @xmath13 is the number of cycles at the @xmath12th stress state , @xmath14 is the number of cycles to failure if the sample is cycled under constant amplitude loading at the @xmath12th stress state , and @xmath15 is a constant . \n based on the assumptions made by the model , @xmath15 should be @xmath16 ; experimentally it is found to range between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . \n this variability is evidence of the failure of the palmgren - miner rule to accurately predict fatigue lifetimes . \n although it is well known that the palmgren - miner rule is inaccurate , its conceptual simplicity and the minimal amount of data necessary for implementation makes it a popular method for estimating fatigue life . \n improving upon the palmgren - miner rule has been a major focus of researchers studying variable amplitude fatigue . \n a good review of cumulative damage and life prediction theories through the end of the last century is presented by fatemi and yang . \n @xcite . in recent years models \n have been developed based on a variety of techniques that couple theories of fracture mechanics and empirical observations . \n @xcite other methods take into account the residual stresses caused by the plasticity of the material at the crack tip , and crack tip closing phenomena . \n @xcite although these modeling methods are more accurate than the palmgren - miner rule , they require substantially more experimental data to fit the necessary parameters .    in this paper \n a new method , free of fitting parameters , is demonstrated for estimating strain life under variable amplitude loading . \n it is unique from other models in that the only data used for input is the constant amplitude strain - life curve and the cyclic stress - strain response . using this model it is possible to accurately predict the variable amplitude strain life of specimens using a relatively small amount of experimental data that can easily be generated . in the section following this introduction the analytical details of the model \n are presented . \n next the experimental procedure and model implementation are explained . in the results and discussion section the measured and predicted strain lifetimes \n are presented and compared . \n the theoretical lifetimes predicted from this model are compared to lifetime predictions presented in the literature . in the final section \n the paper is succinctly summarized . \n in this model the total damage , @xmath19 , is the sum of the damage of all reversals , @xmath20 , ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , @xmath23 in this definition @xmath20 is the normalized damage caused by the @xmath12th reversal and failure occurs when @xmath24 . \n the damage caused by each reversal is determined using the well - known constant amplitude strain - life relation . using this approach , \n the strain history is incorporated as damage accumulation . the damage accrued in each step \n is calculated using a relatively simple algorithm and constant amplitude strain - life data . \n following examples from ref . \n @xcite , the damage during fatigue is assumed to be due to a single critical crack propagating across the width of the specimen . a good description of the crack growth per reversal , for a constant amplitude strain , is given by the hyperbolic sine function . \n for a crack size , @xmath25 , the rate of crack tip advance , after @xmath26 reversals , can be written @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the total number of reversals to failure for the given strain amplitude , and @xmath28 is a scaling factor , which will be discussed in more detail later . eq . \n ( [ dadn ] ) is a natural expression of damage per reversal , and has the same functional form as has been used to describe changes in crack growth rates previously . \n @xcite it accurately reflects the phenomena in that during the initial stages of damage the rate of crack propagation is low and as damage is accrued the rate of crack growth increases . \n other expressions for the rate of crack tip advance , which are phenomenologically similar , are presented elsewhere and will not be discussed here . \n @xcite    using eq . \n ( [ dadn ] ) for damage , the normalized damage due to the @xmath12th reversal is expressed , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of reversals required to achieve the accumulated damage , @xmath19 , were the damage due to a constant amplitude strain range , @xmath31 . \n the number of reversals to failure at this constant strain range is @xmath10 . \n the denominator normalizes the damage per reversal such that at failure the total damage is 1 . \n the current state of damage , @xmath19 , is known and is expressed as the sum of incremental damage , @xmath20 , from eq . \n ( [ di ] ) , @xmath32 where @xmath30 is the number of damaging reversals to cause the damage @xmath19 at the constant amplitude strain @xmath2 . \n the summations in eqs . \n ( [ di ] ) and  ( [ dt ] ) can be approximated as integrals , which allows eq . \n ( [ dt ] ) to be solved to find @xmath33    the general approach for calculating a specimen life under variable amplitude loading goes as follows . \n begin by determining the initial total damage . \n this is typically near zero , if the part begins pristine and the strain - life curve is well defined at all strains of interest . \n a case for non - zero starting damage will be discussed later in section [ modelimplementation ] . \n the strain range for the first tensile reversal is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is calculated using eq . \n ( [ di ] ) and the bmc relation , eq . \n ( [ bmc ] ) , which is fit to constant amplitude strain life data . \n the value of @xmath35 is added to @xmath19 . \n the next tensile strain is @xmath36 . \n the lifetime at this strain range along with @xmath19 , are used to calculate @xmath30 from eq . \n ( [ nt ] ) , which is used in eq . \n ( [ di ] ) to calculate @xmath37 , which is again added to @xmath19 . \n this process continues until @xmath24 , at which point failure is predicted . \n an algorithm for implementing this model is demonstrated in section [ modelimplementation ] . \n published experimental data are used to validate the model . \n @xcite pereira et al .  tested p355nl1 steel and compared their experimental results to an effective strain damage model based on the work of duquesnay . \n @xcite colin and fatemi published experimental data for 304l stainless steel and 7075 t6 aluminum . \n @xcite    the load histories used in the calculations were recreated from the descriptions detailed by pereira et al . , and colin and fatemi . \n @xcite the p355nl1 specimens were subjected to a variety of load blocks , including a high to low scheme , a low to high scheme , a low to high to low scheme , and random loading , examples of which are shown in figs . \n [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] . \n the 304l stainless steel fatigue - life results were prepared for periodic , fully - reversed overloads , shown in fig . \n [ fig5 ] , and random loading . \n the 7075 t6 aluminum samples were subjected to random loading . unlike the shaped loading blocks , the random load history was not reproduced from the literature , but instead a strain history file was created using a random number generator , filtering the random number stream to ensure that each iteration reversed the strain . a representative sample of the random reversal data is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] \n the model described in section [ model ] above was implemented using the algorithm detailed in this section and applied to the strain history data discussed in section [ experiment ] . \n to begin , the first two strains from the strain history were converted to stresses using the ramberg - osgood stress - strain relationship , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 were fit from the cyclic stress - strain behavior . \n the morrow mean stress correction @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean stress , was used to calculate @xmath43 . \n the value of @xmath43 was used with @xmath44 to calculate @xmath30 from eq . \n ( [ nt ] ) . \n finally , the damage from this reversal , @xmath20 , was determined from eq . \n ( [ di ] ) . \n the damage was added to the total damage , @xmath19 . \n if the total damage was greater than @xmath16 , then the specimen was deemed to have failed due to this reversal , otherwise the procedure was continued using the new value of @xmath19 and the next strain taken from the strain history . \n this was repeated until failure occurs , when @xmath45 . \n the constant @xmath28 , in eq .  ( [ dadn ] ) , appropriately scales the incremental damage . for this implementation \n it was selected to be @xmath46 , where @xmath47 was from the bmc equation and @xmath48 was taken as @xmath49 . in this way , @xmath28 scales with the applied strains and the incremental damage , @xmath50 , has the correct functional relationship to the strain amplitude .    the integrated @xmath50 curve , which expresses total damage as a function of the number of cycles , has a general shape that is well known . \n @xcite careful inspection of experimental data of damage as a function of number of cycles reveals that a smooth well fitting curve does not always intercept the damage axis at @xmath51 . in many experiments \n , damage has been observed to accumulate rapidly to around 5 to 10% early in the specimen s life , and then slow to the @xmath50 crack propagation model that is well known . \n @xcite to account for the rapid damage accumulation that occurs during the initial cycling , the starting damage was assigned to be @xmath52 for all of the variable amplitude lifetime prediction data presented here . \n a comparison of the published experimental data and the predictions of this work can be seen in figs . \n [ fig6][fig10 ] . in figs .  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] the experimental data for p355nl1 steel , from pereira et al . , is shown for a maximum strain of 1.05% and 2.10% for the loading blocks discussed in section [ experiment ] above . \n @xcite the experimental results are compared to those predicted from the present model in addition to the model of pereira and duquesnay . \n the current model is in good agreement with both the experimental and theoretical results from peirera et al . \n the experimental results from colin and fatemi for 304l stainless steel are shown in figs . \n [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] for the loading blocks discussed above at various strain ranges . \n @xcite the results for 7075 t6 aluminum are shown in fig . \n [ fig10 ] . \n the accuracy of the present model is compared to the predictions of the palmgren - miner rule both with and without the smith - watson - topper correction . \n the current model is again in good agreement with the experimental results . \n it is worth noting that the model presented here agrees with the experimental data both when the palmgren - miner results are non - conservative by an order of 2 or 3 and when they agree well with experiment . \n this is evidence that the results form the current work are more profound than a simple lifetime reduction from the palmgren - miner rule . \n the strength of the present model is due to the natural inclusion of the strain history when determining the inflicted damage caused by a strain reversal . \n both the effect of the immediately preceding strain and the effect of the relative age of a specimen are included . to calculate @xmath53 a strain and the immediately preceding strain \n must be known to determine the applied strain range and the mean stress correction . \n the damage inflicted by a particular strain reversal depends not only on the amplitude , but also on the total state of damage at the instant of the reversal . \n take the example of a periodic , fully - reversed , overload . \n if one considers the integrated @xmath50 curve for a constant amplitude cyclic strain , applying a fully reversed overload would advance the position of the subsequent constant amplitude reversals on this curve substantially . from the shape of the curve \n , it is apparent that an overload early in the specimen s life that increments the damage will have a more substantial impact on the specimen s total life , compared to an overload applied later . \n the more recent models , such as those of @xcite , include residual strains and crack - tip plasticity or crack tip closure phenomena . \n these models account for the cumulative damage through localized plasticity near the crack tip , or a change in the effective stresses due to crack tip closure . \n they are more accurate than the palmgren - miner model and other simple models because they account for the ordering of the applied strains and localized damage near the crack tip ; however , they require substantial experimental support . by comparison , \n the present model only includes materials information from the cyclic stress - strain curve and the constant amplitude strain life curve . \n it should be noted that for some analysis involving extreme load cases , a more sophisticated model than the one presented here may be necessary . in particular , cases where residual plasticity will play a dominant role in crack growth rates through strain hardening and residual stresses will likely require a model that explicitly deals with plasticity near the crack tip . \n one of the greatest engineering challenges of the last @xmath54 years is that of predicting the strain - life relationships of mechanical components undergoing variable amplitude loading . in spite of extensive studies , \n no conclusive model has been determined . \n although many useful models have been developed , many require cumbersome amounts of experimental data . here \n we report a new method , free of fitting parameters , for making an accurate variable amplitude strain - life prediction using basic constant amplitude fatigue data . \n the method is validated using data from experiments performed on p355nl1 steel , 304l stainless steel , and 7075 t6 aluminum . \n @xcite the present model fits the experimental data well for a variety of load spectra and materials and the algorithm is simple to implement . \n the authors gratefully acknowledge funding from john deere & company . \n 22 natexlab#1#1[2]#2 , , , , . , , , . \n , , . , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . , , , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . , , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , , ( ) . , , , , , , ( ) . , , , , ( ) . \n , , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) . \n , , , ( ) . \n , , , , , . \n , , , , , ( ) . , , , ( ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1680132975690, "RequestID": "0870b6943f4f14471c6509e25e336d233473b5ab", "TotalTokens": 3743}

test are as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for each of the following , give a brief outline of the easiest method that you would use to solve the problem . \n methods used in this class include but are not limited to : direct integration , ampere s law , superposition , gauss law , method of images , separation of variables , and multipole expansion . \n _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _        , blue dotted pattern ) and for cu ( @xmath0 , purple hatched pattern).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we have been using the cue to assess students understanding of junior - level e&m over a period of 5 years ( from 2009 to 2013 ) . at the beginning of the fall term of each year , junior - level students enrolled in symmetries and idealizations paradigm ( ph320 ) took the full cue pre - test ( see table  [ tab : course_desc ] for the osu course schedule and figure  [ fig : emscheme ] for a timeline of the cue at osu and cu ) . \n the same group of students was given the mid - test ( a subset of 12 post - test questions we chose to conform to our course goals ) at the end of the static vector fields paradigm ( ph422/522 ) . \n in the following year , those students who successfully finished their junior year were again given two tests within the electromagnetism capstone course ( ph 431 ) . \n there was a second mid - test at the beginning of the term ( with the same set of 12 questions as in the first mid - test ) and the full cue post - test at the end of the term . \n the necessity of introducing the mid - test arose due to the different course structure at osu . since not everything that the cue tests is covered by the end of the fall quarter \n , the results from a full cue post - test would not have been appropriate . \n we also note that , although osu students have had more contact hours in e&m ( 72 hours ) at the time they take the post - test than cu students ( 45 hours ) , most of the additional hours are on the more advanced content from e&m(ii ) at cu . \n the cue post - test was administered three times between the fall term of 2010 and the fall term of 2013 ( with the exclusion of the fall term of 2012 ) . \n the timing of the test was consistent throughout that period  each time it was given in the last week of the term . \n a total number of @xmath1 students took the cue post - test , out of whom two students were excluded from the research ( one student was a member of the per group at osu and participated in meetings where the cue was discussed , the other student took only some of osu s e&m courses and therefore did not take a sequence of at least two tests ) . \n students at osu scored on average @xmath2 ( compared to @xmath3 at cu reported in ref . \n @xcite ) , with the spread of their performance ranging from about @xmath4 to @xmath5 . to provide a measure of student improvement over time we used the ( non-)normalized gain proposed in ref . \n the normalized gain is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain to the maximum possible average gain , @xmath6 where by @xmath7 we denote the average score of a given student from the subset of post - test questions which match the pre - test problems . for the @xmath8 students who took both the pre- and post - tests \n , we found an average normalized gain of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 non - normalized . ] ) , which is similar to gains of @xmath11 ( normalized ) and @xmath12 ( non - normalized ) reported in ref . \n thus , although students at osu on the average scored about @xmath13 lower than students at cu on both the pre- and post - tests at osu ( for @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 at cu ( for @xmath16 ) , see ref . \n , they showed similar learning _ \n gains _ to students from other institutions taught in per - based courses and higher gain than were observed in standard lecture - based courses ( see figure 7 in ref . \n @xcite ) . \n figure  [ fig : post_total ] shows comparison of the average performance on each question between students from osu ( blue dotted plot ) and cu ( purple hatched plot ) . \n one of the most striking features of this plot is the similarity of the overall pattern of students scores  both on the high- and low - scored questions . with the exception of two questions ( q1 and q15 ) \n , the averages agree to within @xmath17 on the first 12 questions and to within @xmath18 thereafter . \n it is also worth noting that , despite the low number of students taking the cue post - test in individual years , this pattern is still preserved when we plot the average scores of each question by year . \n this affirms the reliability of the cue across the two very different curricula . \n moreover , the surprisingly low average scores on some questions from both institutions suggest that the cue is a very challenging test in general , regardless of the curriculum . \n although the overall pattern in figure  [ fig : post_total ] from both institutions is very similar , there are some significant differences that need to be addressed . in particular , osu students scores differ by over @xmath19 on question q1 regarding finding the potential @xmath20 ( or field @xmath21 ) inside an insulating sphere and by almost @xmath22 on question q15 regarding selecting boundary conditions to solve for the potential @xmath23 on a charged spherical surface . for reference \n , the full problems are reproduced in figure  [ fig : q1+q15 ] . \n both of these questions are intended to test whether students can set up the solution to a problem involving partial differential equations ( i.e , recognizing separation of variables as an appropriate problem - solving technique and/or defining appropriate boundary conditions ) @xcite . to address these discrepancies \n we now look more closely at the learning goals for courses at osu .        in a traditional curriculum , \n as defined by the standard e&m text by david griffiths @xcite , students are first exposed to the application of separation of variables in physics in their e&m course , before they take quantum mechanics . at osu , however , students are exposed to the separation of variables mainly in the context of the schrdinger equation  first in the waves in one dimension paradigm and in the central forces paradigm in the winter term of the junior year and then in the mathematical methods capstone in the fall term of the senior year . \n separation of variables is being discussed in multiple courses before students take the capstone in e&m and thus not much time is devoted to this topic in the e&m capstone . to be precise , \n there is only one day ( typically the second day of the first week ) spent on laplace s equation , followed by 2 or 3 homework problems . as a consequence , students have much more experience with separation of variables in the context of quantum mechanics , long before they see it as part of e&m , and even then the structure of the capstone does not provide them with many opportunities to practice it in the e&m context . \n low scores on the two other questions involving separation of variables and boundary conditions ( bcs ) : q11 ( finding bcs in a specific scenario ) and q13 ( recognizing the form of solutions that match given bcs ) supports our suspicion that students are not getting enough exposure to these topics in the context of e&m . \n due to the significantly restructured curriculum at osu , our findings provide valuable data for comparison with reported results from cu s more moderately reformed curriculum and from institutions with a more traditional ( lecture ) format . \n it is intriguing that the across curricula difficulty pattern for most questions is preserved , even though the sample of students is quite different . \n this result confirms the overall robustness of the cue . \n in addition , strong differences in scores on a few specific questions shows that this assessment test is capable of helping to distinguish between different programs of study and uncovering important gaps in a curriculum . \n it is crucial to understand the causes for the big discrepancies between osu and cu scores on q1 and q15 . as we indicated above , one of the reasons \n might be the current organization of courses at osu . \n while restructuring the junior- and senior - level courses at osu , it was assumed that  once exposed to certain techniques of solving problems in one context \n students will be able to transfer their knowledge of its applicability from one subfield of physics to another . \n as the cue has revealed , however , this is not happening and the separation of variables procedure does not become a natural e&m problem - solving technique for students once they depart from the quantum world . \n osu has made a recent change in the schedule of the paradigms and capstones  moving the mathematical methods capstone , as well as , the central forces paradigm to the spring term of the junior year . \n this rearrangement gives us an opportunity to test whether the inclusion of more examples where separation of variables and boundary conditions are explicitly used to solve e&m problems can impart the generality of the techniques to the students and subsequently be reflected in higher cue scores on the relevant questions . \n we will discuss this change in a later publication . \n supported in part by nsf due 1023120 and 1323800 . \n we would like to thank steve pollock and bethany wilcox for conversations about the design and grading of the cue and stephanie chasteen for helping us with the cu test data .", "StartTimeOffset": 1687932420918, "RequestID": "9e7fa189c7541c4cf5364f8e57aa5f5c89704c93", "TotalTokens": 3706}
{"ContextTokens": 2558, "GeneratedTokens": 341, "SynthesizedBody": "the idea of using a corrugated structure as a  dechirper \" in a linac - based x - ray fel was first proposed in ref . \n the idea was to use a passive device to remove residual energy chirp in the beam before it enters the undulator for lasing . \n the original report considered a round structure . \n however , to allow for adjustability , it was next proposed to use a corrugated structure in flat geometry . \n but because of an unavoidable quadrupole wake excited in flat geometry , the structure is best built in two halves , with one half rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other , in order to , in principle , have the quad wake forces cancel . \n such structures have been built by radiabeam and tested , first at pohang  @xcite and more recently at the linac coherent light souce ( lcls )  @xcite,@xcite . \n the radiabeam / lcls dechirper is the first one that has been tested at high energies ( multi gev ) and short bunch lengths ( 10 s of microns ) .    for a nominal set of parameters for the lcls , the dominant wavelength of the wakefields @xmath0  mm  ( see _ \n @xcite ) . the full bunch length , however , is normally small , @xmath1  @xmath2 m . \n thus , we can expect that a model of the longitudinal ( steady - state ) wake that assumes that it is constant and equal to its value at the origin can be used to approximate the wake effects of the beam in such machines . \n the real wake will drop from the origin  ( see @xcite ) , and such a model will give a maximum bound of the wake , one that becomes more accurate as the bunch becomes shorter ( assuming it is not so short that the transient component of the wake becomes significant ) . \n for the transverse wake , equal to zero at the origin , we use an approximation of a linear function with the constant slope equal to that at the origin . \n we will see that , compared to numerically calculating the wakes , we gain by obtaining simple analytical functions that show us the structure of the wakes . \n the calculation of wakes of corrugated structures has been performed for round structures , assuming small corrugations and using perturbation methods  @xcite , @xcite . the same has been done for flat geometry  @xcite.time domain simulations have been performed for more accurate results , particularly when the corrugation parameters are not small compared to the dechirper gap  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n more recently , a detailed analysis of the radiabeam / lcls dechirper has been performed using field matching methods  @xcite . finally , in ref . \n @xcite , for the case of flat geometry and assuming the impedance can be characterized by a surface impedance , equations for the _ generalized _ wakefields , valid for arbitrary bunch length , are derived . by \n generalized \" we mean ( point charge ) wake functions for which the transverse positions of driving and test particles are arbitrary , and are not limited to being near the symmetry plane . \n we begin the present report with the results of  @xcite and obtain the values at the origin of the ( generalized ) longitudinal wake and the slope of the transverse wakes . \n that is enough to obtain an approximation to the energy loss and kick experienced by a pencil beam ( one with no transverse extent ) . \n there is some interest in using a dechirper as a fast kicker , by passing a beam close to one jaw ( see _ e.g. _ \n @xcite , @xcite ) , and the case of the beam near the wall is automatically included . \n then , assuming that the transverse beam sizes are small compared to the gap , we derive perturbation solutions of the wakes , valid over a small neighborhood around the beam centroid . \n this allows us to find wake effects like slice energy spread increase and projected emittance growth . \n next , we briefly investigate the accuracy of our model . \n we finally end with conclusions . in the appendix \n , we give a more accurate derivation , than found in @xcite , of the flat geometry wakes for arbitrary bunch lengths . \n representative beam and machine parameters for the lcls , which will be used in example calculations in this report , are given in table  i. note that the entire radiabeam / lcls dechirper assembly comprises two 2-m - long sections , one oriented horizontally , the other vertically . \n the wakes are given here in cgs units ; to convert to mks one merely needs to multiply by @xmath3 , with @xmath4  @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the speed of light . \n wakefield induced energy loss , however , has been converted to mks units , for convenience . \n .selected beam and machine properties ( at the dechirper ) used in example calculations . \n this is a typical combination of parameters found in ref . \n the longitudinal bunch distribution is taken to be uniform . \n in the current lattice , the first ( second ) dechirper is vertically ( horizontally ) orientated , with positive ( negative ) @xmath7 . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2_tab ] \n we began with general expressions for the wakefields in a corrugated structure dechiper with flat geometry , derived in  @xcite . \n we took the limits of short bunch length and obtained simplified , approximate expressions for the longitudinal and transverse wakefields , functions that are reasonably accurate for the type of bunch lengths used in _ \n e.g. _ the lcls . \n we then used these functions to obtain , for a short bunch passing through a dechirper : the energy loss as function of gap , the transverse kick as function of beam offset , the slice energy spread , and the emittance growth of the beam . \n we performed a thick lens calculation of emittance growth for the two - dechirper system applied to representative lcls bunch and machine parameters and found that the cancellation does indeed work ; the final projected emittance growth is modest : @xmath8 ( 1.12 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . \n we briefly investigated the accuracy of our model , and find that it overestimates the wakes by @xmath1130% for the type of parameters considered in this study ( in particular , full bunch length @xmath12  @xmath2 m and dechirper half - gap @xmath13  mm and the bunch on axis ) . for shorter bunches the model becomes more accurate .    in the appendix \n we perform a more accurate derivation of the general wake solution for the dechirper ( the starting point of the main work of this report ) than found in ref . \n we find that the results of @xcite are valid provided that the bunch length over half gap , @xmath14 , is small , which is indeed the parameter regime of interest . \n although in our example calculation the emittance increase was modest , and the cancellation of emittance growth using the two dechirper sections was effective , we would like to point out that large emittance growth is not far away in parameter space , especially if the gap is decreased ( note the @xmath15 dependence in eq . \n [ epsf_eq ] ) . \n for example , if in the example calculation above we reduce the energy from @xmath16  gev to @xmath17  gev , and the half gap @xmath13  mm to 0.5  mm , we find that @xmath18 . for this example we obtain a large emttance growth for the full , two dechirper , thick lens calculation : @xmath19 ( 2.5 ) in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . \n finally , we would like to emphasize that although we started with a surface impedance , the surface impedance itself never is part of the solution . \n this means that the results given here are valid not only for the corrugated pipe dechirper , but rather for _ any _ structure with flat geometry where the impedance can be described by a surface impedance . \n such problems include the resistive wall , the shallow corrugated structure ( often used as a model for surface roughness ) , and a metallic pipe lined with a thin dielectric layer . \n the only condition for their applicability is that the bunch lengths of interest are small compared to the characteristic distance of the problem . \n we thank : the team commissioning the radiabeam / lcls dechirper , led by r. iverson , for showing us how the dechirper affects the beam in practice ;

{"ContextTokens": 2195, "GeneratedTokens": 120, "SynthesizedBody": "quantum zeno effect , proposed by misra and sudarshan @xcite in 1977 , is believed to exist uniquely in the quantum world due to informatical description of quantum states and the projective measurement in quantum mechanics ( for a review , see ref . \n while its classical correspondences , such as the fletcher s paradox , becomes an antinomy in newtonian mechanics . \n the basic reason , from our judgement , is the absence of the projective measurement in classical physics . \n however , though newtonian mechanics excludes the projective measurement , the later does exist in the classical world . in a recent work on this issue sjgumario , one of us ( gu ) touched the possibility of the classical zeno and anti - zeno effects . \n gu used a scenario of super mario s prison break to show that a classical state \" might not decay if it is observed continuously . \n nevertheless , the scenario involves too much subjective freedoms coming from super mario s intelligent feedback , such that it is , though reasonable in everyday life , far beyond the objective laws of the classical world . \n this consideration leads to the main motivation of the present work to seek a possibility of the classical zeno effect without involving any subjective judgement . \n we consider here such a scenario of transferring a classical state , for instance a digitized image , through a classical channel with a noise surrounding ( see fig . \n [ sketch.eps ] ) . \n the state , if there is no assisted equipment , decays inevitably with the distance due to the surroundings interferences , and finally loses all information . in order to suppress the decay rate or \n even ensure zero decay , we need to check the information of state within a certain distance . instead of the intelligent judgement made by super mario @xcite \n , here we use a machine ( repeater ) , which has nothing to do with living beings , to examine and try to recover the state . \n we show that if there are enough number of repeaters , the transferred state then might decay much more slowly , or even never decay , then a classical zeno effect occurs . \n this work is organized as follows . in section \n [ sec : class ] , we introduce the basic formulas for describing the classical transportation . in section [ sec : example ] , we take the emblem of the chinese university of hong kong ( cuhk ) as an explicit example to show how the classical zeno effect occurs during a classical transportation . a further discussion and a brief summary are given in section [ sec : dis ] and [ sec : sum ] respectively . \n through a classical channel . \n up : @xmath0 is transferred through the channel without any repeater and decays with the distance . \n low : a repeater t is installed to check the completeness of the state , then @xmath0 might decay more slowly . , width=302 ] \n to begin with , we consider a classical @xmath1-bit state describe by @xmath2 with @xmath3 , which in computer science can be saved physically by for instance in a flash disk or a perforated paper tape . \n now we want to transfer the state through a classical channel , which is subject to a noise background of temperature @xmath4 . during the transferring process \n , the state carried by each bit is protected via an energy gap @xmath5 . \n so if the temperature is zero , there is no background inference , and the state can be transferred over an infinite distance without loss of information . \n however , the thermal fluctuation of the surrounding might flip the state of bit . once the bit is flipped one or more times , \n we assume it loses the correlation to the original global state . \n the transition probability of each bit through a unit distance @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7where @xmath8 denotes uncorrelated state . \n then if the bit is transferred over a distance of @xmath9 ( in unit of @xmath6 ) , the surviving probability becomes @xmath10where @xmath11 . \n therefore , the classical state will decay exponentially to a complete random state with the transferred distance . \n explicitly , in the basis of @xmath12 , the initial state of the bit is @xmath13while the final state becomes@xmath14the distance between these two states can be measured by the fidelity @xmath15then at the very beginning , i.e. small @xmath9 @xmath16which decays algebraically . \n we notice that the leading term of the fidelity here is linear instead of quadratic in quantum fidelity . \n nevertheless , the algebraic decay of the fidelity ensure that we have chance to correct the lost information via a repeater . \n in this section , we give a simple example to illustrate how such a process can be realized in practice . \n we assume that alice wants to transfer a picture , i.e , the cuhk emblem , to bob who is at a long distance via a classical channel . \n the emblem is prepared in a bmp file with @xmath17 resolution and 256 colors . for simplicity , we assume alice and bob have already known all other structural information , such as 256 elemental colors and the size of the picture , except the image data , which can be expressed as a @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 @xmath19with each element @xmath20 ( @xmath21,j\\in \\lbrack 1,200]$ ] ) being an 8-bit integer . during the transportation , \n each element of the matrix @xmath18 is subject to environmental interference . \n one of elements might be changed to a random 8-bit integer with the probability @xmath22 with @xmath23 over the unit distance @xmath6 . \n clearly , the lower the temperature , the more stable the data . meanwhile , as the transferred distance increase , the emblem s information will inevitably lose . \n we use the classical monte carlo method to simulate such a process . \n the leftmost column of fig . \n [ cuhk.eps ] shows the emblem at the various distance . \n we can see that the figure will finally be blurred .    in order \n to suppress the decay rate , alice and bob need to install repeaters on the channel they use . \n the repeater s first function is to check the integrability of data . \n secondly , if possible , it can partially recover the integrability or require the previous repeater to resend the data . \n for this purpose , they add row - column check code to the end of the matrix elements . \n @xmath24the row and column check codes are defined as@xmath25respectively . \n so if one of elements @xmath20 or @xmath26 is changed , the corresponding row and column check code do not match . since the eq . \n ( [ eq : checkcode ] ) are simple summation , in this case , the repeater is able to recover the lost information , that is@xmath27or@xmath28 if one of elements in @xmath26 is lost , the repeater recalculate @xmath29 from the matrix @xmath18 . _ for simplicity _ , \n if there are two or more elements are lost , we assume that the repeater is neither able to recover the integrability , nor requires the previous repeater to resend the picture again , but recalculate eq . \n ( [ eq : checkcode ] ) to ensure the integrability of data for next repeater . \n we show our results in fig . \n cuhk.eps . in the second column , \n the distance between two repeaters is @xmath30 . \n the emblem keep much more information than the first column . \n moreover , if we add more repeaters to the channel , the decay rate will be suppressed further . \n especially if @xmath31 , the emblem at @xmath32 is almost the same as the original one . \n we then call such a phenomenon as a repeater - assisted classical zeno effect in random processes . \n precisely , we can introduce the fidelity to describe the honesty of the state to the original one . in this case \n , the fidelity can be defined as @xmath33 the results are shown in fig . \n [ fidelity.eps ] , from which we can see that the decay rate can be significantly suppressed if enough number of repeaters are installed . on the other hand , if there are two or more elements that have been found to be lost and the repeater can ask the previous repeater to resend the data again , then the classical state will never decay . \n ( in unit of 20000 steps ) for various @xmath34 . , width=302 ] \n now the game is over . \n however , we find ourselves in an embarrassed situation \n . does such an issue still belong to physics ? \n the answer seems to be yes since there is no any interferences from living beings and the  repeater \"- like device needs energy only . \n nevertheless , a digitized state and its decay clearly neither belong to quantum mechanics nor newtonian mechanics . \n such a puzzle keeps a challenge for us and is not able to be answered easily in physical science .    on the other hand , \n the classical zeno effect is very popular phenomenon in the world . besides the case of super mario s prison break @xcite , the classical zeno effect exists in many fields , such as the medical field and the economical field . \n take the former as an example : a human being usually is in a metastable state . \n some small deceases can introduce some fluctuations around the equilibrium point . in these cases , the body s immune response and a suitable cure \n will recover the metastable . \n however , there exists a class of vital deceases , such as cancer , that will finally drag the state of human beings from the metastable point and never back if the state is far from the equilibrium point . \n necessary cures clearly can slow down or ever stop such a process . \n however , to stop such a process , the most important is to find and cure the decease as early as possible , then the probability to recover the metastable state is very high . \n in summary , we touched such a possibility of classical zeno effect in classical stochastic processes , as illustrated by a scenario of transferring a classical state through a noise channel . \n we show explicitly that the zeno effect is no longer a patent of quantum mechanics , but exists in classical stochastic processes . \n we gave an example of transferring a bmp file through a noise channel , as simulated by classical monte carlo

{"ContextTokens": 3520, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "a first generation quantum computer will be expensive and high - maintenance , and therefore will be implemented in a  cloud \" style like today s supercomputers . in such a cloud quantum computing , \n the most important problem is to guarantee the client s privacy . \n blind quantum computation  @xcite is a new secure quantum computing protocol which can protect the security of client s privacy in such a cloud quantum computing . \n protocols of blind quantum computation enable a client ( alice ) , who does not have enough quantum technologies at her disposal , to delegate her quantum computation to a server ( bob ) , who has a full - fledged quantum computer , in such a way that alice s input , output , and program are hidden to bob  @xcite . \n an unconditionally secure protocol of blind quantum computation with almost classical alice was first proposed by broadbent , fitzsimons , and kashefi ( bfk )  @xcite . \n their protocol uses measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) on the cluster state ( graph state ) by raussendorf and briegel  @xcite . a proof - of - principle experiment of the bfk protocol \n has also been achieved recently with a quantum optical system  @xcite . \n the bfk protocol has been generalized to other blind quantum computing protocols which use mbqc on the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state  @xcite , continuous - variable mbqc  @xcite , topological mbqc  @xcite , and the ancilla - driven model  @xcite .    in these bfk - based protocols , \n alice has to possess a device which emits randomly - rotated single - particle states , such as single - photon states . \n if alice s device is not perfect , and sometimes wrongly emits more than two photons , extra photons can be exploited by malicious bob to learn alice s information , by using , for example , the photon number splitting attack  @xcite . \n therefore , it is necessary for alice to precisely control the number of emitted photons , which is not easy with today s technology .    in ref . \n @xcite , a complementary protocol of the bfk - type protocol , so called measuring - alice ( ma ) protocol , was proposed by morimae and fujii . in this protocol \n , alice has only to perform measurements in stead of state preparations . \n these measurements are not necessary to be single - photon measurements : they can be polarization measurements with a threshold detector . \n since a polarization measurement with a threshold detector is much easier than a creation of a single - photon state , ma protocol eases alice s burden . \n furthermore , as is shown in ref . \n @xcite , this protocol offers the device - independent security for alice , which means that alice does not need to trust her device : even if alice s device does not work correctly , bob can not learn alice s information . \n finally , it was shown  @xcite that the security of ma protocol is based on the no - signaling principle , which is more fundamental than quantum physics  @xcite . \n because of the no - signaling principle , the proof of the security of ma protocol becomes very simple . \n if bob can not learn anything about alice s computation whatever he does , we say that the protocol offers  blindness \"  @xcite . \n ( here , we ignore unavoidable leakage of trivial information , such as the upper bound of the computational size , or whether alice s output is classical or quantum , etc . \n @xcite . ) in fact , all bfk - type blind protocols and ma protocol satisfy the blindness . \n the  verifiability \" is another important concept in could quantum computing . \n the verifiability means that alice can check whether bob is following the correct protocol . \n if malicious bob deviates from the correct protocol , the verifiability enables alice to detect it with high probability , and therefore the probability for alice of accepting a wrong result can be exponentially small . \n fitzsimons and kashefi ( fk ) recently introduced a modified version of the bfk protocol which satisfies the verifiability  @xcite . \n the verifiability of ma protocol was shown in ref . \n @xcite .    however , all previous results ( except for ref . \n @xcite ) consider only stand - alone security . \n the stand - alone security means that the protocol is secure during a single execution of it in an isolated environment . \n the stand - alone security is often proven by showing that the mutual information between honest party and malicious party is exponentially small . \n the stand - alone security establishes the security of a protocol as a primitive , and often gives important insights for deep understanding of protocols . \n therefore , it is a first goal to show the stand - alone security of a cryptographic protocol . \n however , the stand - alone security is not sufficient if we consider a protocol in a broader and hence more realistic scenario . \n for example , the ( stand - alone ) unconditional security of the quantum key distribution protocol ( qkd )  @xcite has been proven by many researchers by showing that the accessible information is exponentially small . here , the accessible information is the mutual information between the distributed key and the outcome of an optimal measurement on the adversary s system . \n however , it was pointed out in ref .  @xcite that even if the accessible information is small , the key might not be enough secure if it is used in another protocol , such as the one - time pad encryption , due to the locking  @xcite , which is a purely non - classical property . \n if we want to guarantee the security of a protocol in such a broader context , we have to show the composable security  @xcite . \n the composable security means the security of a primitive protocol in a general environment . \n for example , a protocol is secure even if it is used many times as subroutines of a larger protocol . \n the composable security of qkd was shown in ref . \n the composable security of the key recycling in authentication was studied in ref . \n @xcite . \n the composable security of the bfk - type protocols were studied in ref . \n they showed the composable blindness of the bfk protocol and the composable blind - verifiability of the fk protocol by using the constructive cryptography  @xcite . \n although the composable security of ma protocol was also studied in ref . \n @xcite , it is not sufficient , since they showed only the composable blindness : the composable device - independent blindness , which is a new feature of ma protocol , was not shown . \n furthermore , the composable blind - verifiability of ma protocol was neither considered .    in this paper \n , we study the composable security of ma protocol . for that purpose \n , we utilize the framework of the constructive cryptography  @xcite . \n we will introduce two types of ma protocols , one is without verification and the other is with verification , and will show the composable security of them . \n hence , the device - independent blindness and the verifiability of ma protocol are shown to be composable . \n we will see that our proofs of the composable security are much simpler than those of bfk type protocols due to the simplicity of the stand - alone security of ma protocol based on the no - signaling principle . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n we will first review some necessary backgrounds , including the no - signaling principle ( sec . \n [ sec : ns ] ) , mbqc ( sec . \n [ sec : mbqc ] ) , ma protocol ( sec . \n [ sec : ma ] ) , and the constructive cryptography and the composable security ( sec .  [ sec : comp ] ) . \n we will then show our results in sec . \n [ sec : result1 ] and sec . \n [ sec : result2 ] . the discussion is given in sec . \n [ sec : discussion ] . \n no - signaling principle is one of the most fundamental principles in physics , and quantum theory also respects it . \n formally , it is explained as follows . \n let us assume that alice and bob share a physical system , which might be classical , quantum , or even super - quantum ( fig . \n [ ns ] ) . for example \n , alice and bob share the bell pair , @xmath0 , alice chooses her measurement parameter @xmath1 ( such as the measurement angles of a spin ) , and performs measurement . \n she obtains the result @xmath2 . \n bob also chooses his measurement parameter @xmath3 , and performs measurement . \n he obtains the result @xmath4 . the no - signaling principle ( from alice to bob ) \n is defined by @xmath5 for all @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the conditional probability distribution of @xmath8 given @xmath9 . \n equation  ( [ no - signaling ] ) means that the change of alice s measurement parameter does not affect the probability distribution of bob s measurement result . in other words , \n the shared system can not transmit any message from alice to bob . \n interestingly , the no - signaling principle is more fundamental than quantum theory in the sense that there is a theory which is more non - local than quantum theory , but respects the no - signaling principle  @xcite . \n in this section , we will review the basics of measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc )  @xcite . \n readers who are familiar with it can skip this section . \n mbqc is a new model of quantum computation whose computational power is equivalent to the traditional circuit model . in mbqc , we first prepare a highly - entangled @xmath10 qubit ( or more generally , qudit ) state , which we call the resource state . \n we next perform measurement of each qubit . \n the measurement angle of a qubit depends on the results of the previous measurements . \n if the resource state is a universal resource state , we can simulate any quantum circuit with the adaptive local measurements . \n a canonical example of universal resource states is the cluster state  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath10 qubits are allocated on sites of the two - dimensional square lattice , @xmath13 is the controlled-@xmath14 gate between @xmath15th qubit and @xmath16th qubit , and @xmath17 is a pair of nearest - neighbour sites . here \n , @xmath18 is the identity operator acting on @xmath16th qubit , and @xmath19 is the pauli @xmath14 operator acting on @xmath16th qubit .    let us see fig . \n [ figmbqc ] . \n we first prepare the cluster state ( fig .  [ figmbqc ] ( a ) ) . \n we then perform local adaptive measurements ( figs . \n [ figmbqc ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) . by changing measurement angles \n , we can generate any state @xmath20 on the last layer of the cluster state ( fig . \n [ figmbqc ] ( d ) ) , where @xmath21 is any @xmath10-qubit unitary operator . \n ( actually , what we create on the last layer is @xmath22 where @xmath23 are random binaries . \n we call @xmath24 the byproduct , and we say that we can implement @xmath20 up to a byproduct . since @xmath25 are determined by measurement results , we can correct byproduct . ) \n in this section , we will review ma protocol  @xcite . let @xmath26 and @xmath21 be the input and the program ( unitary operation ) of alice s computation , respectively . in other words \n , alice wants to implement @xmath21 on @xmath26 , and obtain @xmath27 . \n if alice s input is classical , i.e. , she knows the classical description of the input quantum state @xmath26 , or her input is a classical data , she does not need to start with @xmath26 : she can start with the standard state , such as @xmath28 , which is prepared by bob , and the preparation of the initial state can be included in @xmath21 . \n bellow , we will introduce two ma protocols . \n we will first explain a simpler one : a protocol without the verification . \n we will next explain a protocol with verification . \n these two protocols satisfy the device - independent blindness . \n note that the device - independent verifiability is not guaranteed in the second protocol , because , as we will see later , the device - independent verifiability is impossible : a malicious device can always cheat alice by pretending that all tests are passed . \n let us consider mbqc between two parties , alice and bob ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ) : bob first prepares a resource state @xmath29 , such as the cluster state , in his laboratory ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( a ) ) . \n he next sends each particle to alice one by one , and alice measures each particle in a certain angle which is determined by her program @xmath21 ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( b ) ) . \n the program is kept secret to bob . \n if bob behaves honestly , i.e. , generates the correct resource state and sends each particle correctly , the last layer of his resource state becomes @xmath27 ( up to byproducts ) ( fig . \n [ ma1 ] ( c ) ) . \n if bob sends it to alice , alice can obtain the correct quantum outcome ( or if she needs the classical outcome , she can obtain the correct result by measuring it ) .    since there is no message transmission from alice to bob , the no - signaling principle guarantees that bob can not learn anything about alice s input , measurement angles ( i.e. , program ) , and outputs , whatever he does on his system  @xcite . \n ( as we said , we ignore trivial leakage of alice s information . in this case \n , bob can know the upper bound of the size of alice s mbqc , since he creates the resource state . ) \n this protocol also satisfies the device - independent blindness , which means that whatever alice s device does , bob can not learn alice s secret . \n this is again shown by using the no - signaling principle : due to the no - signaling principle , alice can not send any message to bob whatever she does . \n therefore , even if her measuring device does not work correctly , bob can not gain any information about alice s secret  @xcite .    . \n if he is malicious , he might create completely different state . \n ( b ) he sends each particle to alice one by one . \n alice measures each particle according to her program . \n ( c ) the last layer of bob s resource state is @xmath27 ( up to byproduct ) if he is honest . \n , scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the above protocol does not satisfy the verifiability . in other words , if bob behaves maliciously , alice accepts a wrong result although bob can not learn alice s secret . in order to achieve the verifiability , \n we modify the above protocol in the following manner . \n let us define the @xmath10-qubit state latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are certain states , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 are certain cptp maps . if we consider @xmath129 as the simulator for @xmath74 , this shows eq . \n ( [ comp1 ] ) . \n t. sueki , t. koshiba , and t. morimae , ancilla -

{"ContextTokens": 3192, "GeneratedTokens": 66, "SynthesizedBody": "observations of pulsars have been accumulated since the first discovery by hewish et al . \n ( @xcite ) , and several new types of pulsars appeared with great surprise . \n these observations have partially revealed the structure and evolution of rotating neutron stars . \n their rotation periods range from @xmath0ms to several seconds . \n the surface magnetic fields range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . \n the upper limit was recently raised by a factor @xmath3 by the discovery of the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( see e.g. kouveliotou et al . \n @xcite ; mereghetti & stella  @xcite ) \n . the new class of pulsars with the very strong magnetic field ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) are most likely candidates of _ magnetars _ \n ( e.g. thompson & duncan  @xcite ) and may be worth studying further . in the future , we may find a more extreme case , that is , a rapidly rotating relativistic star with a strong magnetic field . \n most stars have spherically symmetric structure . \n they are however deformed due to the rapid rotation and the strong magnetic field . \n it is well known that both effects produce a flattening equilibrium star . \n we will examine them within general relativity . \n these effects are assumed to be small and treated as perturbations to spherically symmetric stars . \n the rotational axis of pulsars does not in general coincide with the axis of the dipole magnetic field . \n the relativistic treatments for the case is a complicated task , because the situation is not stationary . in this paper , however , we assume that the rotational effect decouples from the magnetic effect . \n thus we consider the deformation arising from each perturbation separately and estimate the ellipticity . \n the estimate is important to judge which effect dominates in the rotating magnetized stars , whose rotation rate and the magnetic field are in a wide range . \n our treatment is beyond the classical estimate in the newtonian gravity , and give better comparison of the rotational effect and the magnetic effect on star deformation for various pulsars . when either of them is huge , our estimate breaks down , and sophisticated numerical codes are required ( see e.g. bocquet et al . \n @xcite ; bonazzola & gourgoulhon @xcite ) . \n the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we briefly review deformation of stars due to the rotation ( chandrasekhar @xcite ; chandrasekhar & roberts @xcite ) and the magnetic field ( chandrasekhar & fermi @xcite ; ferraro @xcite ; galtsov et al . \n @xcite ; galtsov & tsvetkov @xcite ) within newtonian gravity . \n the quadrupole deformation can be evaluated by the ellipticity of the equilibrium shape . in sect .  3 \n , we also calculate the ellipticity based on the general relativistic perturbation theory ( see also hartle ( @xcite ) and chandrasekhar & miller ( @xcite ) for the rotational cases and konno et al . \n ( @xcite ) for the magnetic cases ) . \n the ellipticity can be summarized in the same form as the newtonian cases , but with different numerical factors . in sect . \n 4 , using the ellipticity , we compare the rotational effect with the magnetic effect on star deformation numerically . in this comparison \n , we keep the parameter range of known pulsars in mind . finally , we give concluding remarks in sect . \n 5 . throughout the paper \n , we use the units in which @xmath6 . \n quadrupole deformation of an equilibrium body is characterized by the ellipticity @xmath7 , which is defined by @xmath8 for the gravitational equilibrium with uniform rotation , the value is essentially related to the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy . in the slow rotation of a homogeneous star , we have a well - known result ( see e.g. chandrasekhar @xcite ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the radius , mass and angular velocity , respectively . for other stellar model , the numerical factor @xmath13 \n should be replaced by an appropriate one . \n for example , the factor is @xmath14 for the model with the polytropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath15 with index @xmath16 ( see table 1 in chandrasekhar & roberts @xcite ) . \n we therefore generalize the expression with a dimensionless factor @xmath17 as @xmath18 and will discuss how the factor @xmath17 depends on the stellar models .    in a similar way , \n the effect of the magnetic stress is also expressed by the energy ratio of the magnetic field to the gravitational field . introducing a dimensionless factor @xmath19 \n , we have the ellipticity @xmath20 arising from magnetic field as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic dipole moment . the dimensionless factor @xmath19 , in general , \n depends on both the magnetic field configurations and the eos . \n for example , in the case of an incompressible fluid body with a dipole magnetic field treated by ferraro ( @xcite ) , we derive @xmath23 . \n in this section , we will review quadrupole deformation due to the slow rotation and weak dipole magnetic field . \n the deformation can be expressed by the second - order quantities with respect to the rotation rate or the magnetic field strength . in order to calculate the shape \n , we also have to calculate the space - time metric , which is axisymmetric stationary or static one . \n the line element can be written in the form @xmath24 \n dt^2   \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\ : e^{\\lambda ( r ) } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{2 e^{\\lambda ( r)}}{r }             \\left\\ { m_{0}(r ) + m_{2}(r )             p_{2}\\left ( \\cos \\theta \\right)\\right\\ }             \\right ] dr^2             \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\ : r^2 \\left ( 1 + 2 k_{2}(r )             p_{2}\\left ( \\cos \\theta \\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\qquad \\times \\ ;              \\left [ d \\theta^2              + r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta ( d \\phi - \\omega ( r ) dt)^2 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the legendre s polynomial of degree @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the second - order quantities for the rotation rate or the magnetic field strength . \n the quantity @xmath28 is the angular velocity acquired by an observer falling freely from infinity to a point @xmath29 , and is equal to zero for the static magnetic field deformation . \n the stress - energy tensor of the perfect fluid body is described by @xmath30 when we consider the magnetic field deformation , we further take into account the stress - energy tensor arising from the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath31 solving the einstein - maxwell equations , we can obtain the second - order metric functions mentioned above .    the ellipticity of the relativistic star can be calculated from the definition ( [ def - e ] ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the displacement of quadrupole deformation . \n since the displacement of the surface can be determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , the ellipticity of the slowly rotating star is expressed as ( chandrasekhar & miller @xcite ) @xmath34    in order to compare it with the newtonian results , we normalize the ellipticity in the same form as eq . \n ( [ e - newton ] ) . \n there are several possibilities of the normalization factors for @xmath11 and @xmath10 in the relativistic calculation . \n we use natural choices , i.e. , gravitational mass for @xmath11 and circumferential radius for @xmath10 in this paper . \n this normalization is useful to extrapolate from the newtonian results . \n chandrasekhar & miller ( @xcite ) used a different normalization , which causes a prominent peak ( see fig .  5 in their paper ) . \n we note that the peak is due merely to a less convenient choice of the normalization . \n the resultant dimensionless factor @xmath17 is calculated for the polytropic eos with @xmath35 . \n [ fig1 ] displays the variation of the dimensionless quantity @xmath17 with respect to the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n this figure shows that the correct relativistic calculations give smaller values of the ellipticity than those of the newtonian calculations with fixed @xmath37 . \n the factor in the typical relativistic case decreases down to 0.7 of the newtonian case .    as for the weakly magnetized star , \n the lorentz force plays a role on the equilibrium . \n the rotational term @xmath38 is replaced by the magnetic term in the ellipticity . from the hydrostatic condition , we have ( konno et al . \n @xcite ) @xmath39 where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the background quantities , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath42-components of the 4-current and 4-potential respectively . the ellipticity can also be written in the form of eq . \n ( [ e - mag ] ) . \n we also use the gravitational mass @xmath11 and circumferential radius @xmath10 . \n [ fig2 ] displays the variation of the ellipticity with respect to the relativistic factor @xmath36 . in these calculations \n , we have used the current distribution @xmath43 which is a simplest case derived by the integrability condition ( see e.g. ferraro @xcite ) and gives the direct general - relativistic extension of ferraro ( @xcite ) \n . using the normalization , the residual factor @xmath19 is almost independent of the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n in order to compare the rotational effect with the magnetic effect on star deformation , we now consider the ratio of @xmath44 to @xmath45 , @xmath46    first , we investigate the dependence of the ratio of the two dimensionless factors , @xmath47 , on the relativistic factor @xmath36 . \n [ fig3 ] displays this ratio . from this figure \n , we can see that the true relativistic calculations with @xmath48 give smaller values of the ratio than those obtained by the newtonian calculations . \n this fact means that the approach using the newtonian gravity overestimates the rotational effect . \n the curves @xmath47 are approximately reproduced within 10% if we use @xmath49    next , we consider the comparison including other parameters @xmath12 and @xmath50 of stars . \n we use the stellar model with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n [ fig4 ] displays a critical line on which @xmath53 and the two regions divided by this line in @xmath54-@xmath12 space , where @xmath54 denotes the typical magnetic field strength on the surface , which is defined by @xmath55 . \n we have plotted only one representative line of @xmath16 . \n we can also derive very close results for other indices . the critical line , in general , \n can be written from eq . \n ( [ ratio ] ) as @xmath56   \\approx 5.3 \\times 10^{13 }    \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{g } } \\left ( \\frac{m / 1.4 m_{\\odot } }   { r / 10 { \\rm km } } \\right)^{1/2 } \\omega \\ : [ \\mbox{sec}^{-1 } ] , \\ ] ] where it is useful to use the fitting formula eq . \n ( [ fitting ] ) for @xmath47 . in the region \n , the magnetic effect dominates the rotational effect , i.e. , @xmath57 , whereas in the region vice versa , i.e. , @xmath58 . from this figure \n , we find that objects having magnetic field strength @xmath4@xmath59 g and period @xmath60sec such as sgrs and axps belong to the region . \n thus , the magnetic effect overwhelms the rotational effect for such observed candidates of magnetars .    on the other hand , \n well - known typical pulsars with magnetic field strength @xmath61@xmath62 and the period @xmath63@xmath64 ( see e.g. taylor et al . \n @xcite ) obviously belong to the region . \n millisecond pulsars also belong to the region . \n the magnetic deformation is neglected . \n the new classes of objects , which are candidates of magnetars , have inspired us to investigate the relation between the rotational effect and the magnetic effect on deformation of stars . \n we have briefly reviewed the quadrupole deformation due to the rotation and that due to the magnetic field based on previous studies , and compared the rotational effect with the magnetic effect for various pulsars reported observationally . from our investigation , we have found that the new classes of objects such as sgrs and axps belong to the region in which the magnetic effect dominates the rotational effect , while well - known typical pulsars with magnetic field strength @xmath65@xmath66 g and millisecond pulsars vice versa . \n thus , the critical line on which the ellipticity arising from the rotation equals to that arising from the magnetic field divides the new classes and the well - known pulsars . \n once we obtain the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath54 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of a pulsar , we can see whether the magnetic effect is dominant or the rotational effect is dominant using eqs . \n ( [ fitting ] ) and ( [ c - line ] ) and fig . \n the deformation due to the magnetic field may come into play in the spin - down of the magnetars . \n the spin - down history of the axps is rather irregular . \n recently , melatos ( @xcite ) ascribed the irregularity to the radiative precession produced by the deformation . at present , the fit to the observational data is not so good , but will be improved by detailed models . \n theoretical models for the deformed stars will be required there . \n as discussed by bonazzola & gourgoulhon ( @xcite ) , the non - axisymmetric distortion is also important for the gravitational emission . \n the deformation can be calculated from the magnetic field , which is estimated from the observed pulsar period and the period derivative . \n the inferred amplitudes of the gravitational waves are too small for the present known pulsars . in the future \n , we might find more extreme case such as the early stage of rapidly rotating magnetars .", "StartTimeOffset": 1728123343440, "RequestID": "ef31713d05a7f0e852679bd218bdbdea1d07c573", "TotalTokens": 3258}

ii measurements . \n the question naturally arises as to why the rcg - based optical depths appear to be lower than those from all stars . \n one possibility is a dependence on the flux limits of the two methods . \n rcgs are bright ; the latter method will include much fainter stars , and so probe sources at greater distances , which will have a higher optical depth ( @xcite ) . \n this potential explanation of the discrepancy is investigated using monte carlo simulations of galactic microlensing , and the optical depth as a function of source apparent magnitude is then predicted . \n the model galaxy is barred , and in light of observations by the _ \n spitzer space telescope _ \n ( _ sst _ ) , that support a bar inclination angle much larger than suggested by previous studies ( see  [ sec : models ] ) , the effect on the expected @xmath0 of changing the bar angle is determined . \n combining these results with the observed optical depths , upper limits are placed on the bar angle . \n [ sec : model ] describes the model . \n the results and discussion are presented in \n [ sec : results ] : the model results are given in  [ sec : results_model ] , and comparisons are made with the latest eros-2 data in  [ sec : results_eros ] . a summary and conclusions follow in  [ sec : conclusions ] . \n the mass models and parameters of the galactic bulge ( bar ) and disc are as described in @xcite . \n they are based on those of @xcite , who empirically normalised the g2 bulge model of ( * ? ? ? \n * table 1 ) with _ hubble space telescope _ star counts , and extended the local disc model of @xcite to the whole disc . \n @xcite tested a series of models against images of the galactic bulge from the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) satellite , and found their g2 model to provide one of the best fits . \n this model bar extends from 313 kpc and is inclined to the galactic centre line of sight ( los ) at an angle of @xmath17 . \n @xcite states that physical models can be found for the _ cobe _ bar with angles in the range @xmath18 , and many studies assume @xmath19 . \n however , more recent data from glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) , using the _ sst _ , support a much larger value of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) , while from eros-2 , @xcite report @xmath21 , which is consistent with original ogle - i results ( @xcite ) . \n hence , predictions are also made here for @xcite s e2 model , which has the largest bar angle of their models : @xmath22 . \n the expected @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be calculated . \n therefore for each los , the apparent magnitude distribution of the model sources must match the observed distribution . \n @xcite fitted the @xmath26-band stellar distributions in 48 ogle - ii galactic bulge fields with the power - law plus gaussian luminosity function @xmath27 , \\label{eq : powgauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters , and @xmath32 is measured as described in his paper . \n the power - law part contains red giants and bright main - sequence stars , which lie throughout the bar . \n the gaussian component consists of rcgs , which in the model here are more concentrated in the central part of the bulge , occupying the region 610 kpc . \n ( this concentration is found to improve the match to the observed magnitude distributions , and is not unreasonable , as rcgs are older , evolved stars , and hence more likely to exist only in more densely populated regions ) . \n @xcite thus provides , for each of these fields , an observed distribution of apparent magnitude . \n the positions of these fields are listed in table 1 of @xcite . \n the fields closest to the ogle , macho ( rcg ) and moa lines of sight are selected , as shown in table [ tab : coords ] . \n the macho ( dia ) los is not considered , as explained below . \n lccc    & @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) & @xmath35 ( @xmath34 ) & angular separation ( @xmath34 ) +    ogle & 1.16 & @xmath36 & + field 34 & 1.35 & @xmath37 & 0.40 +   + macho & 1.50 & @xmath38 & + field 20 & 1.68 & @xmath39 & 0.28 +   + moa & 3.0 & @xmath40 & + field 36 & 3.16 & @xmath41 & 0.6 +    as described in \n [ sec : opdepth ] , the apparent magnitude of each source is calculated by first assigning it an absolute magnitude , and then correcting for its distance . \n hence for each los a separate model distribution of absolute magnitude is required that will , with distance corrections , reproduce the observed distribution of apparent magnitude . \n of course in reality the absolute magnitude distribution should be virtually the same for each direction in table [ tab : coords ] , since over these small angular separations the mass function is expected to vary little . here \n , the artificial absolute magnitude distributions are only used as a means to ensure the model distributions of apparent magnitude match those observed for each direction . \n it is assumed that the forms of the two distributions are the same , i.e. a power - law plus gaussian . \n for each of the three ogle - ii fields listed in table [ tab : coords ] , an appropriate absolute magnitude distribution can easily be generated , by suitably adjusting the ( extinction - corrected ) fitted parameters of the apparent magnitude distribution found by @xcite . \n ( these parameters are not given in @xcite , and are provided by t. sumi , private communication ) . \n * table 5 ) and ( * ? ? ? \n * table 4 ) list the extinction - corrected @xmath26-band apparent magnitudes of all the moa and ogle sources used in their respective measurements of @xmath0 . \n the minimum and maximum magnitudes given in each case are taken to define ranges of detectable apparent magnitudes . \n @xcite , in their table 2 , provide uncorrected @xmath42-band apparent magnitudes . \n since these macho sources are all rcgs , their apparent magnitudes are converted to @xmath26-band using the following relation for rcgs from @xcite : @xmath43 macho source extinction is then accounted for by simply shifting the minimum and maximum macho magnitudes by the mean @xmath44 for the corresponding ogle - ii field , as given in table 3 of @xcite : for field 20 , @xmath44 = 0.951 . \n ( strictly speaking the extinction should instead be calculated for each source individually , but this is neglected as in the region occupied by the model rcgs , @xmath44 varies from the mean value by @xmath45 0.05 mag  a negligible amount ) . \n although @xcite also list the apparent magnitudes of the macho sources used in their dia measurement , these are in @xmath42-band and do not consist of only rcgs \n . therefore an @xmath26-band magnitude range can not be reliably defined for the model . \n the defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes @xmath46 for ogle , macho and moa are given in table [ tab : mag_ranges ] . \n .defined ranges of detectable , extinction - corrected apparent magnitudes for ogle , macho and moa . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , there is another , simpler way to look for signs of the predicted @xmath0 oscillation in the survey data . \n if @xmath0 is indeed higher on the faint side of the clump centres , then more of the observed events should also be on the faint side : a plot of event counts , as a function of @xmath47 , should be noticeably skewed towards the faint side . \n [ fig : eros_skew ] shows that this is so . \n the ratio of events with @xmath47 fainter than zero to those brighter than zero ( hereafter the _ skewness ratio _ ) is 1.14 . \n the significance of this skew is tested as follows . \n the plot of event counts is fitted with a gaussian , as shown . \n this is of course an imperfect fit , but gives an approximate measure of the dispersion . \n then 120 points ( for the 120 eros events ) are randomly distributed on the magnitude axis , according to a gaussian with the fitted dispersion , and the skewness ratio is calculated . for one million such monte carlo cases , \n only 21 per cent have a skewness ratio greater than the observed value . \n thus the observed skew is suggestive , but not highly significant . \n it does not appear that the discrepancy in optical depth measurements between the rcg and all - star analyses can be explained by a dependence of the lensing surveys on their flux limits . \n the model reproduces the ogle and macho values based on rcgs , but underpredicts moa s all - star value by @xmath48@xmath49 . \n another potential explanation for the discrepancy is blending . @xcite found @xmath4838 per cent of ogle - ii events with apparent rcg sources were really due to faint stars blended with a bright companion . \n however , they also showed that blending has little effect on estimates of @xmath0 due to partial cancellation of its different effects , a point also made by @xcite and @xcite . \n @xcite also state that the dia method is less sensitive to the systematics of blending in crowded fields . though it is of course possible that moa s value may yet be lowered with more data , it is supported by macho s earlier dia value . \n @xmath0 is expected to be generally constant as a function of source apparent magnitude for @xmath50 , except in the range @xmath2 , where many rcgs are detected . \n these stars dominate the source counts at such magnitudes , and show a strong correlation between distance and apparent magnitude , causing a significant oscillation in @xmath0 . \n the amplitude of this oscillation is found to decrease with increasing bar angle , providing a potential constraint on @xmath3 . \n a further constraint comes from a similar dependance of @xmath0 with @xmath3 : combining the predicted trends with the measured values provides @xmath4 upper limits , which exclude the large bar angles reported by glimpse and eros .    from the eros-2 survey \n , @xmath51 has been found as a function of source apparent magnitude . \n the predicted oscillation is not only consistent with the observed trend , but provides a better @xmath52 fit than a constant optical depth , though the significance of this preference is low due to insufficient data . \n however , a further sign comes from eros event counts , which show a clear skew towards fainter magnitudes . with ongoing surveys detecting increasing numbers of rcg events ( and @xmath48@xmath53 of all kinds ) \n , it should soon be possible to make a more useful and definite comparison . \n i am grateful to jim rich of the eros collaboration for providing their data , and for his helpful comments . \n i also thank szymon kozowski , shude mao and ukasz wyrzykowski for useful discussions , and the anonymous referee for their comments . \n i acknowledge support from a pparc studentship , and travel support from the european community s sixth framework marie curie research training network programme , contract no . \n mrtn -

dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) realized in semiconductor heterostructures , the conduction electrons behave as ordinary electrons with a parabolic dispersion relation . \n in contrast , the dispersion relation obeyed by conduction electrons in graphene monolayer is linear in momentum . \n this occurs due to the unique crystal structure of graphene which is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms . \n quantum - mechanical hopping between the sublattices of graphene leads to the formation of  two energy bands , and their intersection near the edges of the brillioun zone yields the conical energy spectrum . as a consequence , \n the dispersion relation of electrons and holes bands is linear near @xmath0 points of the brillioun zone which is given by @xmath1 hence , the conduction electrons , known as dirac electrons , behave as massless particles with the effective speed of light @xmath2@xcite . in a graphene monolayer , electron transport is essentially governed by dirac s ( relativistic ) equation , rather than the usual schrodinger equation for nonrelativistic quantum particles . \n the relativistic behavior of graphene was first predicted by p. r. wallace@xcite . \n it thus provides a unique opportunity to study relativistic quantum dynamics in condensed -

{"ContextTokens": 3354, "GeneratedTokens": 247, "SynthesizedBody": "melting of crystals has always been a fascinating subject for more than a century since the discovery of the empirical lindemann s criterion @xcite . \n the lindemann s criterion says that if the average of vibration amplitude u , namely @xmath0 , exceeds a certain value , usually 10@xmath1 of the distance between nearest - neighbors , then the melting occurs . times and over again , many authors have tried to find out microscopic precursor mechanisms that lead a crystal to melt . until 30 years ago , one of the favorite pictures of melting is the softening of a phonon mode due to the temperature ( t ) . \n the atoms have no longer restoring forces which keep them staying close to their equilibrium positions : they move around and the system goes to a liquid state . \n the soft - mode picture has encountered some scepticism because in real crystals as well as in simulations one observes that well below the melting temperature ( @xmath2 ) , many defects , dislocations , interstitial atoms ... are excited . \n therefore , it is hard to believe that the system stays in a periodic structure with propagating phonon modes up to @xmath2 . \n evidence of defects is found in many works @xcite . \n another question that is unsolved in a clear manner is the form of the potential that binds the atoms together in a given lattice structure . in a microscopic point of view \n , the potential should come mainly from the symmetry of atomic orbitals . \n but ab - initio calculations are still far away from being able to use realistic hypotheses @xcite . \n empirical potentials have been used instead to study melting . \n one can mention the popular 6 - 12 power lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite , various similar power potentials , the many - body gupta s potential @xcite , the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential @xcite , and the tersoff potential @xcite . \n two - body potentials such as the lj one crystallize atoms in the fcc at low temperatures and nothing else ; this comes from the fact that lj potential is isotropic so the atoms are crystallized in the most dense isotropic structure , namely the fcc lattice . in order to stabilize other structures , several phenomenological potentials have been introduced , often without a microscopic justification . \n for example , the sw potential or the tersoff potential stabilize the diamond structure at low temperatures . \n these potentials have been used with success to calculate properties of si clusters @xcite and amorphous si crystals @xcite .    in this paper \n , we use the lj potential to study the melting of rare - gas crystals which have the fcc lattice structure at low temperatures . \n it is amazing that such a simple question was not studied with precision so far in spite of an abundance of experimental data on rare gas such as ar , xe , ne and kr . \n most of the melting studies concerning rare gas were done in particular cases : small clusters @xcite , adlayers on a substrate , etc . the main reason to avoid to study \n the bulk melting may be due to some technical difficulties such as periodic boundary conditions , volume expansion with temperature , etc . \n previous monte carlo ( mc ) studies of bulk melting have been carried out with lj potential but emphasize was put on the melting mechanism rather than on the precise melting temperature in real materials @xcite . \n the purpose of this paper is therefore to test whether or not the experimental @xmath2 can be reproduced by mc simulation using the values of the lj parameters deduced for rare gas in the gaseous state long time ago@xcite . \n we will show here that by appropriate choices of technical procedures , we are able to obtain melting temperature for various rare gas _ directly _ from our simulations , unlike previous simulations @xcite which have had recourse to various means and some thermodynamic functions to deduce it . \n we find in this work the melting temperatures for several rare gas higher than experimental values . \n a revision of the values of lj parameters widely used in the literature for more than 50 years should be made in order to better describe the solid state of rare gas . \n note that in a recent work @xcite , a hypothetical thermodynamic integration path is used to find the relative free energies of the solid and liquid phases , for various system sizes , at constant cutoff radius , in an attempt to explain the overestimate of the melting temperature with the lj potential . \n however , due to various approximations , several results were not physically clear , in particular why the melting temperature oscillates with increasing cutoff distance . \n section [ sec : level2 ] is devoted to a description of the model and our mc technique . \n the results are shown and discussed in sect . \n [ sec : level3 ] . \n concluding remarks are given in sect . \n [ sec : level4 ] . \n the lj potential is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants , @xmath9 denotes the distance between two atoms at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here \n @xmath12 and @xmath13 . \n we list for convenience the values of the above constants for various rare gas and their melting temperatures , using the data from ref . \n note that the constants @xmath5 and @xmath8 are those deduced with some approximations using experimental data of the gaseous phase of rare gas which have been described in the pioneer paper of bernardes@xcite . \n the listed values of the constants should be therefore viewed as approximate values . to our knowledge \n , there were not papers using these constants to verify if the melting temperature is correctly obtained , either by theoretical calculations or by simulations . \n the absence of works dealing with this point has motivated our present work .    in one of our previous works @xcite , we have used the lj potential to investigate the mechanism which initiates the melting . \n we have counted the number of defects created with increasing temperature ( @xmath14 ) and found that the melting occurs when these defects interact with each other forming a kind of chains of defects which break the solid periodic state at a temperature well below the melting point . in that work \n , we did not use the constants of the lj potential for any specific material . \n we used instead the reduced temperature and dimensionless parameters . \n it was not our purpose to clarify the value of melting temperature for a given kind of crystal . \n it is now the time to verify those constants to see whether or not they yield the correct value of @xmath2 for the melting of the solid phase of rare gas . \n ( color online ) the lennard -

{"ContextTokens": 3137, "GeneratedTokens": 103, "SynthesizedBody": "experimental measurement of the doppler peaks positions and heights would fix at least some combinations of cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . ) which are left free in inflationary models @xcite . \n furthermore , as shown by @xcite , the _ absence _ of secondary doppler peaks is a robust prediction for cosmic strings , although this may or may not be the case for textures @xcite . \n therefore it appears that even determining whether or not there are secondary doppler peaks offers an important alternative motivation for measuring the cmbr power spectrum . \n we address this issue by proposing a statistic for detecting secondary oscillations , and studying how it performs for various models , using different experimental strategies . \n the results are encoded in a detection function @xmath3 which indicates to within how many sigmas we can claim a detection of secondary oscillations , given a particular model and experiment . \n we apply the statistic to both the standard cdm scenario and an open cdm model which is tuned to confuse inflation and cosmic strings in all but the existence or otherwise of secondary oscillations . for a wide range of experiments \n we allow the beam size , sky coverage , and detector noise to vary , and use this framework to compute the detection function for secondary peaks . \n there are several factors affecting how well one can measure the cmbr power spectrum from real observations , which we now discuss . \n \\(i ) distortion of the underlying spectrum due to the finite size of the observed field . for ( square ) fields of size @xmath4 degrees ( suitably windowed with a cosine bell or hann window ) \n this is not a severe problem for detecting secondary peak structure . \n \\(ii ) cosmic / sample variance , which places constraints on the minimum sky -

free emission . \n algorithms for separating these components from the cmbr signal are discussed by @xcite and @xcite . \n typically the errors associated with the separation process are of a similar magnitude to the average errors on an individual frequency channel due to instrumental noise alone , but details depend on the separation algorithm used . \n \\(v ) point sources , which can not be removed from spectral information alone . \n this requires the identification of the sources by higher - resolution observations at a frequency close to that of the cmbr observations , with sufficient flux sensitivity to indentify all point sources down to some flux limit roughly equal to the instrumental noise of the cmbr observations . \n we note here that although it is generally believed that point source contamination becomes less important as the observing frequency increases above about 100 ghz , there is no direct evidence for this . \n moreover , even the population of radio point sources at frequencies above about 10 ghz is rather uncertain , and it may be inadvisable to rely on low frequency surveys such as the 1.5 ghz vla first survey @xcite to subtract point sources from cmbr maps made at much higher frequencies . \n the idea is to apply to a particular model a statistic sensitive only to the existence or absence of secondary oscillations in the power spectrum . in this section \n we consider the power spectrum predicted by the standard inflation / cdm scenario with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( which we shall call scdm ) .    to this end \n we first compute the average broad band power @xmath14 in each of several equally spaced -

coverage and instrumental noise , are discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .    from fig . \n [ mph_fig1 ] we see that the first dip in the scdm power spectrum is more easily detected than than the second one , a situation only exacerbated by finite resolution and the presence of instrumental noise \n . therefore we shall confine ourselves to considering the detection function @xmath21 , which from now on we refer to simply as @xmath3 . \n the detection function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the linear size of the observed ( square ) field [ the all - sky limit can be recovered by setting @xmath24 sr @xmath25 ( 202 deg)@xmath26 , @xmath27 is fwhm of the observing beam , and @xmath28 is the noise level discussed above . \n this function is plotted in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] for the low noise case @xmath29 and the high - noise case @xmath30 .    for any beamsize \n there is a maximum sky coverage beyond which the detection is not improved . if anything the level of the detection decreases , but typically not by much . \n the ideal scanning strategy is then defined by a line @xmath31 which intersects the contours of @xmath3 at the lowest @xmath23-value at which a plateau has been achieved in the detection function . \n the significance of the detection obtained for an ideally scanned experiment depends on the beam size . \n for example , in the low - noise case , if @xmath32 , the ideal coverage is a patch of @xmath33 degrees , which results in a 3-sigma detection . \n if @xmath34 , on the other hand , an 8-sigma detection can be obtained with @xmath35 degrees . \n the detection provided by an optimally scanned experiment increases at first very quickly as the beam is reduced below @xmath32 ( from 3-sigma at @xmath36 to 33-sigma at @xmath37 ) . by reducing @xmath27 from @xmath38 to zero , however , the detection is only increased by 2-sigma ( from 33 to 35 ) . for this level of noise \n the maximal detection is 35 sigma and is achieved with @xmath39 and all - sky coverage . for low noise levels all - sky coverage is never harmful , but it is the beamsize that determines how good a detection can be achieved , and how much sky coverage is actually required for an optimum level of detection .    for noise levels of the order @xmath40 the overall picture is always as in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] . \n in particular , there is always a top contour indicating the maximal detection allowed by the given noise level . \n the maximum @xmath3 is always achieved with infinite resolution , but one falls short of this maximum by only a couple of sigmas if @xmath41 . \n if the noise is much smaller than this , however , the summit of @xmath3 is beyond @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , for instance , all - sky coverage becomes ideal for any @xmath44 . \n if , on the other hand , the noise is much larger than @xmath45 then the @xmath3 contours are qualitatively different , as shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig2 ] for @xmath46 . \n the beamsize is now a crucial factor . \n a beamsize of @xmath34 would provide a 3-sigma detection ( with @xmath47 ) , but reducing the beamsize to about @xmath48 improves the detection to 6-sigma ( with @xmath49 ) . \n it is also clear from the figure that , for high noise levels , forcing all - sky coverage dramatically decreases the detection . \n we may repeat the above analysis for different cosmological models . \n we therefore consider the case of maximal confusion between inflation / cdm and cosmic string scenarios by comparing a cosmic strings model with a cdm model for which the main peak in the power spectrum has the same position and shape ( but the latter exhibits secondary peaks ) . for definiteness \n we have chosen a cdm theory with a flat primordial spectrum , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . \n we shall call this theory stcdm , the cdm competitor of cosmic strings . \n as before we simply study the first dip detection function of stcdm , and then take this detection function as a cosmic string rejection function .    in fig . \n [ mph_fig3 ] we show the angular power spectrum of stcdm ( solid line ) and a possible power spectrum for cosmic strings ( dotted line ) . \n we then simply repeat the same exercise as in the previous section to obtain the detection function of the first dip of stcdm . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] for the same noise levels as before . \n overall we see that in signal dominated regions the detection is much better for stcdm than for scdm . \n this is because features at higher @xmath53 have a smaller cosmic / sample variance ( which is proportional to @xmath54 ) . \n it can be checked that the cosmic / sample variance limit , obtained with a single - dish experiment with no noise , is now @xmath55 ( as opposed to @xmath56 for scdm ) . even in the presence of noise , \n wherever the signal dominates , the detection is better for stcdm . \n however , in noise - dominated regions the behaviour of the detection function for stcdm and cdm is very different . \n the signal - dominated region is greatly reduced in stcdm . \n much smaller beamsizes @xmath27 are now required for any meaningful detection . as shown in fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] , one would now need @xmath44 and @xmath57 , for noises @xmath40 and @xmath46 respectively , in order to obtain a reasonable detection . \n again one can plot an ideal scanning line in the beam / coverage sections defined by a fixed noise @xmath28 . \n the ideal sky coverage is much smaller for stcdm than for scdm . in general the contours of @xmath3 for stcdm \n compared to scdm are squashed to lower @xmath27 , lower @xmath23 , and achieve higher significance levels , with steeper slopes . following an ideal scanning line for any fixed @xmath28 one \n reaches a maximal detection allowed by the given level of noise , which is always better for stcdm than for scdm . \n this maximal detection is normally obtained with a small sky coverage , and infinite resolution . \n nevertheless , one falls short of this maximum by only a few sigma if the resolution is about @xmath58 . from fig . \n [ mph_fig4 ] , for @xmath40 , one may now obtain a maximal 43-sigma detection for an ideal scanning area of @xmath59 degrees . if @xmath60 a 36-sigma detection is still obtained . \n we also see that a beamsize of @xmath61 is required to obtain a 3-sigma detection ( with @xmath62 degrees ) , and a 10-sigma detection can be achieved only with @xmath63 ( and @xmath64 degrees ) . \n all - sky coverage for an experiment targeting stcdm is generally inadvisable , and it would only be optimal for the extremely low level of noise @xmath65 . \n the results obtained here are useful for future cmbr projects in two different ways . \n firstly they allow the choice of an ideal scanning strategy ( choice of resolution and sky coverage ) for detecting secondary doppler peaks , given observational constraints such as the instrumental noise level and the total observing time . \n secondly , one may compute the expected value of the detection , assuming ideal scanning , as a function of these parameters . \n this provides lower bounds on experimental conditions for a meaningful detection as well as an estimate of how fast detections will improve thereafter . \n these results also indicate that in order to study doppler peak features for scdm , depending on the noise levels , a large sky coverage might be desirable , even for a resolution of about @xmath66 . if , however , one is instead to test the high-@xmath67 opposition between low @xmath68 cdm and cosmic strings , then a rather higher resolution is required . \n furthermore , in this context , all - sky scanning is not only unnecessary , but in fact undesirable .    99 jungman g. , kamionkowski m. , kosowsky a. , spergel d. , 1996 , phys . \n lett . , submitted . \n albrecht a. , coulson d. , ferreira p. , magueijo j. , 1996 , phys.rev.lett . , 76 , 1413 magueijo j. , albrecht a. , coulson d. , ferreira p. , 1996 \n , phys.rev.lett . \n , in press crittenden r. , turok n. , 1995 , phys . \n lett . , 75 , 2642 durrer r. , gangui a. , sakellariadou m. , 1996 , phys . \n lett . , 76 , 579 tegmark m. , efstathiou g. , 1996 , _ mnras _ , in press maisinger k. , hobson m. p. , lasenby a. , 1996 , _ mnras _ , submitted becker r. h. , white r. l. , helfand d. j. , 1995 , hobson m. p. , mageuijo j.,1996 , _ mnras _ , submitted magueijo j. , hobson m. p. , 1996 \n , phys.rev.lett . , submitted", "StartTimeOffset": 1766699255352, "RequestID": "00ff497a13689eca7689e7f0305f333b068db967", "TotalTokens": 3240}

'' below that , it is written the maximum for quantum theory ( qt ) : `` @xmath0 . '' already in 1969 , chsh noticed that this was the maximum for two - qubit systems @xcite . in 1980 , tsirelson proved that it is also the maximum in qt , no matter the dimensionality of the state space @xcite . \n it took a lot of time until somebody asked the obvious question : why ? \n it took a surprising amount of time until somebody came with a compelling answer @xcite . \n however , it was soon proved that this answer can not explain the maximum quantum values for some tripartite bell inequalities @xcite . \n this leads us back to square one : why the quantum maxima of all bell inequalities ? \n what is the fundamental reason that limits quantum probabilities ?    in the summer of 1964 , before submitting the bell inequality paper , bell submitted other paper which , for several reasons @xcite , was not published until 1966 @xcite . there , bell discusses the implications for the hidden variables problem of gleason s theorem @xcite , which was directed to reducing the axiomatic basis of qt . the relevant corollary of gleason s theorem is that , if the dimensionality @xmath1 of the state space is grater than two , then there exists a set of elementary tests such that values @xmath2(rue ) or @xmath3(alse ) can not be assigned to them respecting that : ( i ) @xmath2 can not be assigned to two mutually exclusive tests , and ( ii ) @xmath2 must be assigned to exactly one of @xmath1 mutually exclusive tests . \n bell proved this corollary by constructing an explicit infinite set of elementary tests in @xmath4 for which such an assignment is impossible . \n a finite set was found by kochen and specker in 1962 @xcite , but not published until 1967 @xcite , making explicit a result anticipated by specker in 1960 @xcite . \n these sets prove the impossibility of reproducing qt with theories satisfying the assumption of non - contextuality of results , namely , the assumption that the `` measurement of an observable must yield the same value independently of what other measurements may be made simultaneously '' @xcite . \n bell considered that this assumption was not reasonable and finished his paper suggesting that it would be interesting to pursue some proof of impossibility of hidden variables replacing non - contextuality by some assumption of locality . \n one month later , bell submitted the bell inequality paper . \n however , the problem of hidden variables in qt can be mathematically formulated in a way which goes beyond whether or not non - contextuality is reasonable . \n the problem of hidden variables in qt is simply whether or not it is possible to recover the quantum probabilities from a joint probability distribution over a single probability space . \n what is proven by kochen - specker and bell s examples is that this is not possible in any scenario in which the dimensionality of the state space is three or higher , irrespective of whether or not locality can be invoked . \n what if bell would have derived a bell - like inequality violated by quantum systems of dimension three ? \n such an inequality was introduced in 2008 and is called the klyachko - can - biniciolu - shumovsky ( kcbs ) non - contextuality ( nc ) inequality @xcite . \n the kcbs inequality is the analog for quantum systems of dimension three of the chsh inequality . \n the kcbs inequality is the simplest nc inequality violated by quantum systems of dimension three ; the chsh inequality is the simplest nc inequality violated by quantum systems of dimension four . \n simplicity is here measured by the number of dichotomic observables used . \n the quantum violation of nc inequalities shows the impossibility to recover the quantum probabilities from a joint probability distribution over a single probability space . \n the kcbs inequality says that , for any non - contextual hidden variable ( nchv ) theory , @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 are observables with two possible results @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 where , e.g. , @xmath11 denotes the joint probability of obtaining @xmath9 when measuring @xmath12 and @xmath8 when measuring @xmath13 . \n probabilities in eq . \n ( [ mean ] ) are assumed to be well defined no matter in which order @xmath12 and @xmath13 are measured . however , for @xmath12 and @xmath14 this may not be the case .    similarly , the chsh inequality says that , for any local hidden variables ( lhv ) theory , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the difference between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is that , in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be measured on a subsystem while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are measured on a distant subsystem . \n therefore , in @xmath18 the choice of measurement on one subsystem and the result on the other subsystem can be space - like separated . \n this allows us to invoke locality to justify the assumption of non - contextuality . \n in contrast with ( [ kcbs ] ) and ( [ chsh ] ) , in qt , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the big question is not just why qt violates the inequalities for hidden variable theories , but rather why qt violates them _ exactly up to these limits_. \n consider non - demolition measurements that are repeatable ( i.e. , that give the same result when repeated ) and cause no disturbance on other measurements ( i.e. , when combined with these other measurements , all are repeatable ) . \n these measurements are called `` sharp '' @xcite and , in qt , are represented by projection operators . \n these are the measurements that von neumann called `` quantum observables '' @xcite . \n let us define an _ \n event _ as the state of the system after some sharp measurements ( with certain results ) on some initial state . \n two events are equivalent when they correspond to indistinguishable states . \n two events are exclusive when there is a measurement that distinguishes between them . \n a theory satisfies the _ exclusivity ( e ) principle _ \n @xcite when any set of @xmath25 pairwise exclusive events is @xmath25-wise exclusive . therefore , \n if we assume the e principle , kolmogorov s axioms of probability lead us to the conclusion that the sum of the probabilities of any set of pairwise exclusive events can not be higher than  @xmath26 . \n however , the e principle can not be derived from kolmogorov s axioms . to see it , \n consider the maximum value of the following sum of probabilities of events : @xmath27 where the notation is the same used above . \n the three events @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are pairwise exclusive . \n therefore , the only restrictions from kolmogorov s axioms are that the probabilities are non - negative and that    @xmath31    therefore , for theories satisfying kolmogorov s axioms the maximum is @xmath32 , since each of the three probabilities in ( [ spe ] ) can be @xmath33 . \n however , for theories satisfying the e principle , the maximum is @xmath34 , since the e principles forces that @xmath35    the e principle can be derived from a variety of axioms . \n for example , from the axiom that pairwise co - measurability implies joint co - measurability @xcite , from the principle of fundamental sharpness of measurements @xcite , from axioms 1 and 2 in ref . \n @xcite , and from the principle of lack of irreducible third order interference @xcite . \n the e principle imposes limits to the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events . \n therefore , in order to study the implications of the e principle for the limits of the kcbs and chsh inequalities , it is convenient to rewrite both inequalities in terms of sums of probabilities of events . for that , it is useful to notice that the condition of normalization of probabilities allows us to write    @xmath36    therefore , we can write    @xmath37    where    @xmath38    and @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath40 by changing the signs of all the results . then , we can write the kcbs and chsh inequalities and their quantum limits as follows :    @xmath41 \n our first target is to explain why @xmath40 can not go beyond @xmath42 or , equivalently , why @xmath17 can not go beyond @xmath43 . for this purpose , consider two independent experiments both aiming the maximum of @xmath40 . \n suppose that one of the experiments is performed in vienna on a certain physical system , while the other experiment is performed in stockholm on a different physical system . \n let us denote by @xmath44 an event of the experiment in vienna , by @xmath45 the sum of the corresponding five probabilities , by @xmath46 an event of the experiment in stockholm and by @xmath47 the sum of the corresponding five probabilities .    since the experiments are independent , the probability of an event involving both experiments is the product of the probabilities of the corresponding ( single - city ) events . \n for example , @xmath48    exclusivity graphs of the five sets of five pairwise exclusive events used in the proof of the limit of the kcbs inequality . \n events are represented by nodes and exclusivity relations by edges . \n the black pentagons correspond to the exclusivity relations between the events @xmath49 . \n the coloured pentagrams correspond to the exclusivity relations between the events @xmath50 . \n any two graphs differ in a rotation of the pentagram . ]    having two copies , we can identify larger sets of pairwise exclusive events . \n for example , the set with the following events : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . \n the e principle and assumption ( [ indep ] ) applied to this set imply that    @xmath56    similarly , by identifying sets of pairwise exclusive events , we can derive the following inequalities : @xmath57    the geometry behind these sets is explained in fig . \n if we sum all five inequalities ( [ uno])([cinco ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 assuming that the maximum is the same in both experiments , i.e. , that @xmath59 , we can conclude that , for any theory satisfying the e principle , @xmath60 exactly as in qt . \n this is an arguably clearer presentation of a result introduced in ref . \n our second target is to explain why @xmath61 can not go beyond @xmath62 or , equivalently , why @xmath18 can not go beyond @xmath0 . for this purpose , \n first notice that the state space on which @xmath19 and @xmath20 act is , at least , two - dimensional . \n second , notice that the conditions of normalization of probabilities allows us to write , @xmath63    now consider two independent experiments both testing @xmath61 . \n suppose that one of the experiments is performed in vienna and the other experiment in stockholm . \n as before , let us denote by @xmath44 one event in vienna and by @xmath46 one event in stockholm .    now notice that @xmath19 and @xmath64 are co - measurable and that the state space on which @xmath19 and @xmath64 act is , at least , four - dimensional . \n therefore , there must exist an observable @xmath65 co - measurable with @xmath19 and @xmath64 and such that the result for @xmath65 is @xmath9 if the results of @xmath19 and @xmath64 are equal , and @xmath8 if they are different . \n @xmath65 acts on a four - dimensional state space , but only distinguishes between two subspaces . \n therefore , there must be an observable @xmath66 co - measurable with @xmath65 that distinguishes between other two subspaces and such that @xmath67 since we have made no assumption about @xmath20 and @xmath68 ( other than each of them acts on a different at least two - dimensional subspace ) , we can relate @xmath66 to @xmath20 and @xmath68 , the same way we related @xmath65 to @xmath19 and @xmath64 . \n similarly , we can start with @xmath19 and @xmath68 and define @xmath69 and then define a co - measurable @xmath70 related to @xmath20 and @xmath64 . \n these observables allow us to identify larger sets of pairwise exclusive events . \n for example , the set with the following events : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . since , by definition of @xmath65 , @xmath80 , the e principle and assumption ( [ indep ] ) applied to this set \n imply that @xmath81    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as explained in table  [ table1 ] , there are 16 sets like this one . for each of them \n , there is a inequality like ( [ one ] ) . \n if we sum all of them we obtain , @xmath82 assuming that the maximum is the same in both experiments , we can conclude that , for any theory satisfying the e principle , @xmath83 exactly as in qt . \n this result is an improved version of an argument introduced in ref . \n a similar argument allows us to derive the quantum limits for @xmath25-partite bell - like inequalities for non - local ( but not genuinely @xmath25-partite non - local ) hidden variable theories @xcite . \n we have shown that some characteristic limits of qt have a simple explanation . \n indeed , we suspect that all the limits of quantum probabilities have the same explanation . if this would be the case , what should we learn about qt ?    for some people , \n a fundamental message of qt is that the world is non - local , i.e. , that the results of quantum observables correspond to some reality and change non - locally @xcite . \n however , from this perspective , it is puzzling that the no - signaling principle allows for higher than quantum violations of the chsh inequality @xcite . \n why then qt is not more non - local ? \n the reason why qt is exactly as non - local as it is , apparently , the same reason why qt is exactly as contextual as it is . \n however , in the contextuality case , there is no alice and bob and no communication . \n why nobody paid attention to the e principle before ? \n arguably , because the e principle is trivial in classical deterministic theories and not well defined in non - local realistic theories . \n however , if one takes non - realism ( of the results of observables represented in qt by self - adjoint operators ) as a fundamental key of the world , then everything makes much more sense . \n the fundamental non - existence of results makes that not all conceivable combinations of observables allow for joint probability distributions ( i.e. , makes not all observables to be co - measurable ) . \n indeed , it makes all conceivable relations of co - measurability / non - co - measurability ( among sharp measurements ) realizable and , as a consequence , makes all conceivable relationships of exclusivity / non - exclusivity ( among events ) realizable . \n there is where the e principle makes a profound contribution : the possible sets of probabilities of a given scenario ( i.e. , a certain structure of co - measurability / non - co - measurability ) are restricted by the e principle applied to all conceivable embeddings of the scenario into a larger scenario . in this sense , the e principle acts in an holistic way . in particular , the limits of the probabilities of a given scenario follow from identifying the most ( or one of the most ) restrictive embedding(s ) ( details will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) . \n the resulting picture points out that non - realism is not `` a soft option '' @xcite , but rather a fundamental key of the world . \n qt is a probability theory about things that do not exist and are unpredictable at a fundamental level . \n one may argue that the view i have drawn before is just one of the possible options and that the predictions of qt are also compatible with contextual and non - local realistic views of the world . \n i disagree . \n common to all these other views is a certain degree of realism that ranges from hidden variables determining the results of all possible experiments to just taking the quantum state as real . \n it seems evident that any of these other views , when examined in detail , will lead to predictions that qt does not make . \n hopefully , we will soon identify these predictions and test them . time and experiments \n will tell . \n this work was supported by the project fis2011 -

shot pd is usually viewed simple . in the original version of one - shot pd , \n two prisoners are arrested by a policeman . \n each prisoner must independently choose a strategy between `` confessing '' ( denoted as strategy `` _ _ defect _ _ '' ) and `` not confessing '' ( denoted as strategy `` _ _ cooperate _ _ '' ) . \n the payoff matrix of prisoners is shown in table 1 . as long as two agents are rational \n , the unique nash equilibrium shall be ( _ defect _ , _ defect _ ) , which results in a pareto - inefficient payoff @xmath0 . \n that is the dilemma . \n _ table 1 : the payoff matrix of pd , where _ @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . \n _ the first entry in the parenthesis denotes the payoff of agent 1 and the second entry stands for the payoff of agent 2_. +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\1 ) @xmath3 : this strategy profile means two agents both participate the algorithmic model and submit parameters to the computer . according to ref . \n @xcite , for each agent @xmath4 , his dominant parameters are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which result in a pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 . \n + 2 ) @xmath8 : this strategy profile means agent 1 participates the algorithmic model , but agent 2 takes back his channel and submits a message to the arbitrator directly . since agent 1 can observe agent 2 s action , in the end , both agents will take back their channels and submit messages to the arbitrator directly . obviously , the dominant message of each agent @xmath9 is @xmath10 , and the arbitrator will assign the pareto - inefficient payoff @xmath0 to agents . \n + 3 ) @xmath11 : this strategy profile is similar to the above case . \n the arbitrator will assign @xmath12 to two agents . \n + 4 ) @xmath13 : this strategy profile means two agents both take back their channels and send messages to the arbitrator directly . \n this case is similar to the case 2 . \n the arbitrator will assign @xmath12 to two agents .    from table 3 \n , it can be seen that @xmath3 and @xmath13 are two nash equilibria , and the former is pareto - efficient . \n as specified by telser ( page 28 , line 2 , @xcite ) , `` _ _ a party to a self - enforcing agreement calculates whether his gain from violating the agreement is greater or less than the loss of future net benefits that he would incur as a result of detection of his violation and the consequent termination of the agreement by the other party . _ _ '' since two channels have been controlled by the computer in stage 1 , in the end @xmath3 is a self - enforcing nash equilibrium and the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 is the unique nash equilibrium outcome . in this sense , \n the two agents escape the dilemma .    * type-5 pd * : + conditions 1 - 3 are the same as those in type-4 pd . \n + 4 ) the last condition of type-4 pd does not hold . \n + for this case , although the two agents can communicate before moving and agree that collaboration is good for each agent , they will definitely choose ( _ defect _ , _ defect _ ) as if they are separated . \n thus , the agents can not escape the dilemma . \n the algorithmic model revises common understanding on the one - shot pd . here \n we will discuss some possible doubts about it .    _ \n q1 _ : the type-4 pd seems to be a cooperative game because in condition 4 , the algorithmic model constructed by two agents acts as a correlation between agents .    _ \n a1 _ : from the viewpoints of agents , the game is different from the original one - shot pd , since the payoff matrix confronted by the two agents has been changed from table 1 to table 3 . but from the viewpoints of the arbitrator , nothing is changed . \n thus , the so - called correlation between two agents is indeed _ \n unobservable _ to the arbitrator . \n put differently , the arbitrator can not prevent agents from constructing the algorithmic model . \n + on the other hand , since each agent can freely choose not to participate the algorithmic model and send a message to the arbitrator directly in stage 1 , the algorithmic model is self - enforcing and thus still a non - cooperative game .    _ q2 _ : after the algorithmic model is triggered , can it simply send @xmath14 , @xmath15 to the arbitrator instead of running steps 1 - 5 ?    _ a2 _ : the algorithmic model enlarges each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a two - dimensional strategy space @xmath16\\times[0,\\pi/2]$ ] , and generates the pareto - efficient payoff @xmath7 in nash equilibrium . \n the enlarged strategy space includes the original strategy space of one - shot pd : the strategy ( _ cooperate , cooperate _ ) , ( _ cooperate , defect _ ) , ( _ defect , cooperate _ ) , ( _ defect , defect _ ) in the original pd correspond to the strategy @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the algorithmic model respectively , since @xmath21 , @xmath22 . \n + however , the idea in this question restricts each agent s strategy space from the original strategy space _ \\{cooperate , defect } _ to a single strategy _ \n cooperate_. in this sense , two agents are required to sign a binding contract to do so . \n this is beyond the range of non - cooperative game . \n _ remark 2 _ : the algorithmic model is not suitable for type-1 and type-2 pd , because the computer can not perform actions on behalf of agents . \n the algorithmic model is not applicable for type-3 pd either because two agents are separated , thereby the algorithmic model can not be constructed . for the case of type-5 pd , the algorithmic model is not applicable because condition 4 in type-4 pd is vital and indispensable . \n in this paper , we categorize the well - known one - shot pd into five types and propose an algorithmic model to help two non - cooperative agents self - enforcingly escape a special type of pd , i.e. , the type-4 pd . \n the type-4 pd is justified when the arbitrator communicate with the agents indirectly through some channels , and each agent s strategy is not an action , but a message that can be sent to the arbitrator . with the rapid development of internet , more and more type-4 pd games will be seen . \n one point is important for the novel result : usually people may think the two payoff matrices confronted by agents and the arbitrator are the same ( i.e. , table 1 ) . \n however we argue that for the case of type-4 pd , the two payoff matrices can be different : the arbitrator still faces table 1 , but the agents can self - enforcingly change their payoff matrix to table 3 by virtue of the algorithmic model , which leads to a pareto - efficient payoff . \n the author is very grateful to ms . \n fang chen , hanyue wu ( _ apple _ ) , hanxing wu ( _ lily _ ) and hanchen wu ( _ cindy _ ) for their great support .", "StartTimeOffset": 1797737444208, "RequestID": "ea86d19f6806dc63c137ca3999abfd95089eef8f", "TotalTokens": 1908}
{"ContextTokens": 3810, "GeneratedTokens": 183, "SynthesizedBody": "pulsars are particularly interesting astrophysical objects because we know so much about them , and much of that information is derived from their timing properties . \n measurement of the period p and period derivative @xmath0 first identified pulsars as compact objects . under fairly general assumptions that pulsars are rapidly- rotating neutron stars with a strong dipole magnetic field , \n a whole range of physical parameters can be estimated from these timing parameters . \n examples include the timing age , the spin - down energy loss , the surface magnetic field , and the open field line voltage [ 1 ] . \n the telescopes on the compton gamma ray observatory identified a number of gamma - ray pulsars , some with very high confidence and others with less certainty . \n there are at least three answers to the question , `` how many gamma - ray pulsars are there ? '' \n the first answer is that there are seven or more gamma - ray pulsars . \n figure 1 shows their light curves in four energy bands : roughly 0.5 - 2 kev , 2 - 100 kev , 100 kev - 10 mev , and above 100 mev . \n all seven of these are positive detections in the gamma - ray band above 100 kev . \n the weakest ( psr b1951 + 32 ) has a statistical probability of occurring by chance of @xmath110@xmath2 . \n some important features of these pulsar light curves are :    * they are not the same at all wavelengths . \n some combination of the geometry and the emission mechanism is energy - dependent . in soft x - rays , for example \n , the emission in same cases seems to be thermal , probably from the surface of the neutron star ; clearly this is not the case for gamma radiation . * \n not all seven are seen at the highest energies . \n psr b1509@xmath358 is seen only up to 10 mev , by comptel [ 7 ] , and not above 100 mev by egret . \n for this reason , the answer to the question , `` how many _ high - energy _ \n gamma ray pulsars are seen ? '' is , `` at least six . '' \n * the six seen by egret all have a common feature - they show a double peak in their light curves . \n because these high - energy gamma rays are associated with energetic particles , it seems likely that the particle acceleration and interactions are taking place along a large hollow cone or surface . \n in addition to the six high - confidence pulsar detections above 100 mev , three additional radio pulsars may have been seen by egret . \n figure 2 shows their light curves ( without the zero suppression used in some of the original references ) . \n these three all have statistical probabilities in the 10@xmath4 range , or about 5 orders of magnitude less convincing than the weakest of the seven on the previous figure . \n these are good candidates , but they are not strong enough to be used as discriminators between models . \n these three do imply a third answer to the `` how many '' question - there could be as many as ten known gamma - ray pulsars . \n this sample of pulsars can be compared to other pulsars in terms some of the derived physical parameters . \n figure 3 is a distribution of pulsars as a function of their period and period derivative , with the gamma - ray pulsars shown as large dots . \n also shown are some of the derived physical parameters . \n the gamma - ray pulsars tend to be concentrated ( with the exception of the one millisecond candidate ) in a region with high magnetic field ( but not magnetar - strength ) - shown by the dashed lines , and relatively young ages - shown by the solid lines . \n all ten gamma - ray pulsars share a third characteristic , shown by the dotted line , of having the open field line voltage high compared to most pulsars . \n this is not surprising , since the particles are being accelerated electromagnetically . \n the open field line voltage , which is also proportional to the polar cap ( goldreich - julian ) current , has long been recognized as a significant parameter for gamma - ray pulsars [ 22 ] . \n figure 5 illustrates that the pulsar high - energy luminosities , integrated above 1 ev , are approximately proportional to this parameter , shown by the solid line in the figure . \n an interesting question is what happens for lower voltages , where the high - energy luminosity converges with the total spin - down energy available , shown by the dashed line \n . this will be a question for future missions . \n what happens to pulsar observations at the highest energies ? \n no pulsars have been seen at tev energies . \n the upper end of the egret range represents the highest energies for detections of pulsed emission . \n there is evidence of pulsed emission above 5 gev for all six of the pulsars definitely seen by egret . \n figure 5 shows the light curves for the four with the best statistics ( the other two are consistent with these ) , shown in the upper panels in the 100 mev range , and at the bottom for photons above 5 gev . \n it is clear that something has changed in the multi - gev light curves - each of the pulsars above 5 gev is dominated by one of the two pulses seen at lower energies . \n in fact , for all except psr b1706@xmath344 , it is the trailing pulse that dominates . because of egret s very low background , the second pulse is still barely visible . \n a detector with higher background would see only the single pulse . \n these observations suggest that this energy range is a critical one for gamma - ray production . \n the importance of the 1 - 20 gev band is also visible in the energy spectra [ 17 ] . in all gamma - ray pulsars , \n the dominant power is seen in the hard x - ray to hard gamma - ray band - between 100 kev for the crab and greater than 10 gev for psr b1951 + 32 . \n also in all cases , there is a fall - off at higher energies . \n the upper limits from the ground - based detectors are typically an order of magnitude or more below the peak luminosity . \n the gap between about 10 gev ( where egret runs out of photons ) and the current generation of ground - based telescopes is very important . \n it is hard to predict from the limited egret data what is expected even at 100 gev . \n figure 6 shows the spectrum of vela , the brightest of the egret pulsars . \n this spectrum is shown in @xmath5f@xmath5 or power per logarithmic energy interval format . \n the 10 - 30 gev point is based on only 4 photons , and the absolute calibration of egret at these energies is fairly uncertain . \n also shown are the spectra expected in two popular gamma - ray pulsar models , the polar cap [ 23,24 ] and the outer gap [ 25,26 ] . \n the large error bars on the egret data make them consistent with both models . \n the extrapolation to higher energies is , however , dramatically different . \n there is also the possibility of a second , inverse - compton component of the pulsed radiation at higher energies , expected in some outer gap models [ 25 ] , although there is yet no observational evidence for that component . \n searching for that second component will be an important goal of the next generation of very - high - energy gamma - ray telescopes . \n the high luminosity in the gev energy range and the drop - off above that part of the spectrum suggest that glast will be the next big step in gamma - ray pulsar observations . \n agile will certainly make a contribution , especially in confirming those candidate pulsars for which the egret data are marginal , but glast will be needed for a major increase in sensitivity and energy reach . \n figure 6 shows one of the ways that glast will help - the smaller error bars on the theoretical curves show two models predictions folded through the glast sensitivity for a one - year sky survey . \n glast will easily distinguish spectra such as these and might detect a second component at higher energies . \n a second strength of glast will be in its much higher sensitivity than previous instruments . \n figure 7 shows one of the classic measures of pulsar observability : the pulsar spin - down luminosity divided by 4@xmath6 times the square of the distance , the total available pulsar energy output at earth . \n the 10 gamma - ray pulsars and candidates are shown as the large diamonds . \n six of the seven pulsars with the highest value of this parameter are gamma - ray pulsars . \n below these , only a handful of pulsars are visible in gamma rays . \n the glast sensitivity will push the lower limit down substantially farther . \n two sensitivity limits are shown for glast - one for low - galactic - latitude sources and one for those at high latitudes , because the high diffuse emission along the galactic plane reduces the sensitivity for point source detection . \n the phase space that glast opens up is substantial . \n how many pulsars will glast see ? to some extent that number depends on which model best describes the emission and how the pulsars are distributed on the sky . \n one empirical estimate can be made by constructing a logn - logs curve from the known pulsars . \n figure 8 uses all nine of the high - energy gamma - ray pulsars to construct this function . \n the simple linear fit suggests that glast might expect to detect between 30 and 100 gamma - ray pulsars . \n the range of sensitivity is dependent on where the pulsars lie with respect to the galactic plane . in some respects this figure is pessimistic , possibly due to the small sample . \n a disk population should increase linearly with decreasing sensitivity , but the fitted line goes as the @xmath30.5 power of the sensitivity \n . a linear function would raise the number of pulsars to more than 100 . \n .predicted gamma - ray fluxes ( units of 10@xmath7 ph [ e@xmath8 100 mev ] @xmath9s@xmath10 ) [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     just as interesting as the number of pulsars to be seen by glast is which particular pulsars will be seen \n . such observations are probably the best discriminator among models . \n table 1 is a compilation with help from the theorists involved , showing the expected flux for various radio pulsars that have not yet been seen in gamma rays . for many of these , \n different models make predictions that differ by more than an order of magnitude . in these units , \n the glast sensitivity is 2 for pulsars near the plane and 0.2 for high - latitude pulsars ; therefore glast will certainly provide solid observational tests of these and other gamma - ray pulsar models . \n the third , and perhaps most important , capability of glast for pulsars will be its ability to find unknown pulse periods , in order to look for more geminga - like pulsars . \n various analyses have shown that only the brightest pulsars could be found in the egret data without independent information [ 32 - 34 ] . \n for all of the other unidentified egret sources , the photons are just too far apart in time to derive unambiguous pulse periods . \n with glast , periodicity searches will be feasible for most , if not all , the unidentified egret sources [ 35 ] . the potential is to find a whole new population of rotation - powered pulsars , much as x - ray astronomy has started to do in the past few years . \n this could be an important new window onto the physics of the extreme conditions around these spinning neutron stars . \n * gamma - ray pulsars remain a valuable probe of particle acceleration and interaction in the extreme conditions found near rotating neutron stars . * \n at least 7 pulsars are seen in gamma rays ( six of those at energies above 100 mev ) , with 3 additional good candidates . * \n the changing shape of the light curves and energy spectra in the 1 - 20 gev range make this band particularly interesting for future observations . \n * glast , along with other satellite and ground - based gamma - ray telescopes , will make a major advance in gamma - ray pulsar studies . \n thompson , d.j . \n space res . _ \n * 25 * , 659 - 668 ( 2000 ) . \n becker , w. , and aschenbach , h. in _ proc . \n nato asi , vol . \n 450 , lives of the neutron stars _ , ed \n . m. a. alpar , . kizilolglu , and j. van paradijs , dordrecht , kluwer , 1995 , pp . \n ulmer , m.p . \n et al . , _ apj _ * 432 * , 228 -

{"ContextTokens": 1534, "GeneratedTokens": 124, "SynthesizedBody": "in many current and upcoming extragalactic photometric surveys it will be necessary to use spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting techniques to characterize most objects ( e.g. , redshifts , k - corrections , stellar masses and bolometric luminosities ) , because spectroscopic observations are too expensive . \n seds of galaxies are typically either empirically obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or theoretically created ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n the former have the advantage of giving an accurate representation of the seds but generally lack the large wavelength ranges of theoretical ones . \n empirical seds also have the advantage of easily including non - stellar emission , like active nuclei and dust / pah emission , which are hard to model from first principles . \n in particular , most available agn seds are empirically obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) by averaging photometric observations of a small number of quasars .    in this proceeding \n we discuss a non - negative basis of empirically obtained sed templates for galaxies and agns that accurately represents the colors of such objects . \n these templates are derived from a combination of 14448 galaxies and 5347 likely agns in the ndwfs botes field with spectroscopic redshifts and photometry spanning the far - uv to the mid - ir . \n all results shown in here have been presented and are discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . \n our data set consists on 14448 galaxies and 5347 likely agns in the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ? \n * ) botes field . \n each object has a spectroscopic redshift from the agn and galaxy evolution survey and has at least an upper limit in 8 of the 14 following bands : bw , r , i and k from ndwfs , j and ks from flamex , z from zbotes , irac [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] from sdwfs , galex fuv and nuv , and mips 24@xmath0 m from @xcite . \n the agn classification scheme is conservative , and objects classified as agns are either spectroscopically or photometrically classified according to their mid - ir , x - ray and radio properties . \n we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the sample selection . \n the methods we use to derive the sed templates are described in detail by @xcite and @xcite . in this section \n we give a brief summary of how our methods work and refer the reader to the aforementioned papers for detailed discussions . \n we assume that the spectrum of any object in our sample can be modeled as a linear combination of a small set of unknown spectral templates . \n we construct these unknown templates using the data sets described in the previous section . for `` pure '' galaxies , \n we assume the majority of them have seds that can be described as a linear combination of three templates : one similar to an elliptical galaxy ( an old stellar population ) , one similar to a spiral galaxy ( a continuously star forming population ) , and a third similar to an irregular galaxy ( a starburst population ) . for objects with active nuclei , \n we assume that every agn sed can be described by the same spectral template with varying amounts of reddening and absorption by the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , combined with the galaxy templates to describe the host . \n we use an iterative algorithm to derive the sed templates . \n this algorithm is based on the method proposed by @xcite for deriving principal component seds . \n we start with an initial guess for each of our sed templates and sequentially improve it to best fit the photometric data . \n our initial guess for the `` pure '' galaxy seds corresponds to the e , sbc and i m templates of , extended into the uv and mid - ir with the models of @xcite and with the addition of pah and dust emission of the vcc1003 and m82 seds obtained by @xcite to the star forming templates . for the agn component we use a combination of power - laws that broadly resembles the agn sed template of @xcite . \n we divide every sed template in 300 logarithmically spaced wavelength bins and fit each bin independently to our data set , with a restriction to force their smoothness . \n the top left panel of figure [ fg : temps ] shows the resulting sed templates alongside with the initial guesses . \n we have pursued several applications of our sed templates , including the estimation of photometric redshifts and k - corrections for galaxies and agns , the study of biases in mid - ir selection of agns , predictions of colors of agns and galaxies in the pass - bands of the recently launched wise mission , and the determination of luminosity function of mid - ir and x - ray selected agns from redshift 0 to 6 . \n the former three applications are discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite , while our results on the agn luminosity function were presented by @xcite . in this section \n we discuss two of these applications , namely the biases in the mid - ir color selection of agns and the colors of agns and galaxies in wise . \n figure [ fg : temps ] shows the mid - ir colors of all sources in sdwfs with @xmath1 , the agn selection diagrams of @xcite ( top right panel ) and of @xcite ( bottom left panel ) and the color tracks of our templates . \n the boundaries of the selection region of @xcite do a remarkable job of excluding inactive galaxies at @xmath2 , but also exclude unreddened agns at @xmath3 . in a more subtle manner \n , the selection region of @xcite also excludes agns that are faint in comparison to their host galaxies , as the latter will dominate the mid - ir colors . \n the selection region proposed by @xcite is not strongly affected by the biases of the @xcite criteria , but their agn selection region is heavily contaminated by intermediate redshift star forming galaxies and galaxies at @xmath4 . \n these problems are partially solved by the revised version of this criteria by @xcite . \n it can be seen , however , that if the left - most boundary in this criterion is pushed further to the right to limit contamination by inactive galaxies , similar biases to those of the @xcite selection criteria arise . \n using our sed templates , we have also studied the color distribution of sources in the wise mission . \n the selection boundaries shown in the bottom right panel of figure [ fg : temps ] correspond to those proposed by @xcite , and would be able to classify in between @xmath5 and @xmath6 agns , depending on whether a detection in the two longest wavelength bands is required or not . \n this criterion would keep the contamination by inactive galaxies and ulirgs to a minimum , as shown by the color tracks of our seds and of the sed of arp 220 produced by grasil @xcite . \n we note , however , that the wise colors of @xmath7 agns are similar to those of intermediate redshift galaxies and ulirgs , leading to a color degeneracy that must be broken by the inclusion of other data ( e.g. , optical broad - band photometry ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1830826260348, "RequestID": "7095b3adefa1606db0a33f0ba0f6e75708d64f7b", "TotalTokens": 1658}

channel reaction would allow the measurement of the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factor which due to the mass difference between the strange and down quarks does non vanish . \n in view of this proposed experiment predictions for the @xmath0 form factor have been recently published and it commonly turned out that due to the accessible values of momentum transfer up to few @xmath3 a covariant description of the underlying dynamics is mandatory . \n cardarelli et al . \n investigated a relativistic constituent quark model based on the light front formalism @xcite . \n therein they made use of an interaction kernel motivated by an effective @xmath1 -

salpeter equation , we use a @xmath1 - interaction assumed instantaneous in the rest frame of the bound state and free effective quark propagators to arrive at the salpeter equation , which is expressed as an eigenvalue problem for the bound state mass and solved numerically @xcite . \n in addition to the calculation of mass spectra we have presented there a method to reconstruct the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter amplitude from the equal - time salpeter amplitudes .    in our model the interaction \n consists of a confining potential which is linearly rising in coordinate space , and an instanton - induced interaction derived by ( see @xcite and references therein ) as a possible solution of the u@xmath6(1)-problem . \n we would like to emphasize that the potential and mass parameters used in our model have been fixed in @xcite to obtain a reasonable agreement with the experimental mass spectrum of the low lying pseudoscalar and vector mesons as well as the leptonic @xmath4 and @xmath7 decay widths . \n the electromagnetic form factors as well as the other decay widths ( e.g. @xmath8 ) are consistently obtained by employing the mandelstam formalism to the formerly calculated bethe -

salpeter amplitude , which in our model contains in general eight amplitudes for fixed spin and parity @xcite and thus reflects the full dirac structure of the @xmath1 - system . \n our results for the @xmath0 form factor @xmath10 are shown in fig . \n [ abb1 ] and [ abb2 ] for small and large momentum transfer ( in fig . \n [ abb2 ] we plotted @xmath11 ) . \n our calculation agrees remarkably well with the prediction of buck et al . \n @xcite , where the parameter have been fixed to reproduce the @xmath12 and @xmath13 charge radii and decay constants . however , our maximum of @xmath11 appears at a smaller momentum transfer of approximately 2 gev@xmath14 .    as our calculation has been performed in the framework of a covariant quark model which includes confinement , and therefore is able to describe not only the masses and decay properties of the pseudoscalars but also of the vector mesons , the @xmath0 form factor calculation is put on a more general basis than in the work of buck et al . \n @xcite , although our results do not differ significantly .    the @xmath0 charge radius , as has been discussed e.g.  in @xcite , is most sensitive to the mass difference between the strange and down quark mass . \n we have estimated the charge radius by a least - square fit of a quadratic function to our form factor below 0.1 gev@xmath14 and studied its dependence on the differences of the constituent quark masses @xmath15 keeping the sum of them fixed to our original value @xmath16  @xcite . \n the results plotted in fig . \n [ abb3 ] indeed shows a strong dependence on the quark mass difference , as long as it is smaller than 250 mev . \n an experimental measurement of the @xmath0 charge radius therefore would be an interesting opportunity to determine the difference between strange and nonstrange constituent quark mass , alternatively to estimates from purely spectroscopic quark model calculations . \n r.a.magahiz et al . , letter of intent submitted to cebaf pac 9 , available on www at http://www.phys.cmu.edu/hyperons/homepage.html . \n f.cardarelli et al . \n , preprint nucl -

{"ContextTokens": 1405, "GeneratedTokens": 142, "SynthesizedBody": "gradual infall of halo gas onto the disk due to radiative cooling is a generic feature of disk galaxy formation models . \n such continuing gas infall seems essential to explain the extended star formation histories of isolated spiral galaxies like the milky - way and is the most likely explanation of the `` g - dwarf problem ''  see , e.g. , rocha - pinto & maciel ( 1996 ) and pagel ( 1997 ) .    at the virial temperatures of disk galaxy \n haloes the dominant cooling mechanism is thermal bremsstrahlung plus atomic line emission . \n the emissivity , increasing strongly with halo gas density , is expected to peak fairly close to the disk and decrease outwards , and if the cooling rate is significant the x - ray flux may be visible well beyond the optical radius of a galaxy .    recently , benson et  al . \n ( 2000 ) compared rosat observations of three massive , nearby and highly inclined disk galaxies with predictions of simple cooling flow models of galaxy formation and evolution . \n they showed that these models predict about _ an order of magnitude _ more x - ray emission from the galaxy haloes than observational detections and upper limits . \n we have determined global x - ray properties of the haloes of a novel sample of 44 model disk galaxies at redshift @xmath0=0 . \n the galaxies result from physically realistic , fully cosmological gravity / hydro simulations of galaxy formation and evolution . \n the galaxies span a range in characteristic circular speeds of @xmath3 = 130325 km s@xmath4 and have been obtained with a considerable range of physical parameters , varying the baryonic fraction , the gas metallicity , the meta - galactic uv field , the cosmology , the dark matter type , and also the numerical resolution . \n details of the simulations and halo x - ray emission calculations are given in toft et  al . \n ( 2002 ) , sommer - larsen & dolgov ( 2001 ) and sommer - larsen et  al . \n the total bolometric x - ray luminosities @xmath5 of the 44 simulated disk galaxies in our sample are plotted versus their characteristic circular speed @xmath3 . \n also shown are predictions by simple cooling flow models . \n the x - ray luminosities derived from the simulations are up to two orders of magnitude below values derived from simple models . \n toft et  al . \n ( 2002 ) show that our model predictions of x - ray properties of disk galaxy haloes are consistent with observational detections and upper limits . as can be seen from the figure @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 erg s@xmath4 for a milky way sized galaxy . \n this in turn implies that hot halo gas is cooling out and being deposited onto the galactic disk at a rate of , consistent with observational upper limits , as discussed by sommer - larsen et  al . \n they also show that the present amount and distribution of hot gas in the haloes of milky way like disk galaxies is consistent with observed dispersion measures towards pulsars in the globular cluster m53 and the lmc . \n in contrast to what is predicted by simple cooling flow models , it is found that _ increasing _ cooling efficiency of the halo gas results in _ decreasing _ present day @xmath7 . \n the reason for this is that increasing the cooling efficiency over the course of a simulation results in less hot gas in the halo at @xmath0=0 to cool ( because the total amount of gas available at any given time is always limited to the gas inside of the virial radius ) . \n this in turn leads to lower present day accretion rates and lower @xmath5 . \n finally , it is found for realistic choices of the physical parameters that disk galaxy haloes were up to _ one order of magnitude _ brighter in soft x - ray emission at @xmath0@xmath11 , than at present . \n in the simulations , the local ionization balance of hydrogen is assumed to be set by collisional ionization , photo - ionization by the redshift dependent , meta - galactic uv field and recombination . \n radiative transfer of the ionizing uv photons is included in a simplified way . given this \n , the local rate of ly@xmath2 and h@xmath2 emission can be calculated . \n 2 shows the appearance of an edge - on , milky way like disk galaxy in h@xmath2 ( ly@xmath2 is very similar ) . \n no extinction correction has been applied ;

@xmath12 ) as the plume of objects above the trgb redder of a given line that discriminates between the younger and older populations ( cioni et al . \n these agb stars distribute smoothly over the surface of the clouds in contrast with the bar  like and patchy distribution of the younger stars . in the cmd ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) c  rich agb stars occupy a red branch compared to the location of o  rich stars . \n the distribution of the ratio between c  rich and o  rich ( c / m ratio ) agb stars outlines in the lmc a ring  like structure of increasing values ( cioni & habing 2003 ) . because the c / m ratio is a strong indicator of metallicity the first global evidence that there is a radial metallicity gradient in the lmc \n was found . \n the ratio is patchy and irregularly distributed in the smc . by fitting the distribution of points ( log(@xmath13 ) versus [ fe / h ] ) in other galaxies of the lg a metallicity spread of about @xmath14 dex within each cloud \n was derived . \n the larger uncertainty remains in the calibration and scatter of this relation . \n based on the results obtained in the magellanic clouds i started in collaboration with habing a near  infrared campaign from the la palma observatory to mosaic other galaxies of the lg in @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath1 . \n the goal is to find , study and compare the agb stellar population . \n fig.1 shows : the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) diagram for all the sources detected within an area of @xmath16 centered on ngc6822 ( a ) , the histogram of the @xmath0 colour at about @xmath17 mag above the trgb where the dashed line discriminates between o  rich and c  rich agb stars ( b ) , and the histograms of @xmath15 ( c ) and @xmath1 ( d ) where the dashed line indicates the approximate location of the trgb . in ngc6822 we detect about @xmath18 c stars , approximately @xmath19 more than letarte et al . \n ( 2002 ) , and @xmath20 m stars . \n the distribution of the whole agb population is shown in fig.2 while fig.3 shows the distribution of the c / m ratio . using the same relation discussed in sect.2 \n we derive that the gray scale and the contours span a range of 1.65 dex in [ fe / h ] . \n contrary to nowotny et al . \n ( 2003 ) we do detect regions with a different c / m ratio . \n note that in the @xmath1 band the differential reddening is negligible and that foreground stars have been removed . \n the striking difference between the two figures indicates the potential of the c / m ratio to study the chemical history of galaxies . \n similar figures , though with less statistics have been obtained for ngc147 and ngc185 . \n observations of draco have just been reduced and unfortunately the observations of leoa , leoi and leoii took place during variable sky conditions which considerably affect the quality of the resulting cmds .    in the southern hemisphere the central region of a few galaxies has been observed using sofi at the ntt in the near  ir wave bands by tolstoy back in 1998 . \n the cmds of ddo210 , fornax , sagdig and pegasus show clear red giant branches reaching in fornax the red clump . \n these galaxies are not rich in agb stars especially of c type except pegasus that shows a plum of objects with quite red @xmath0 colours . \n these relatively deep data are probably suitable to derive the metallicity and the age of the observed region ( about @xmath21 ) from the slope and colour of the rgb as in davidge ( 2003 ) \n . new observations of these and other galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere took place at the end of july 2003 in collaboration also with reijkuba . \n the wealth of near  ir data on galaxies in the local group either than the magellanic clouds will definitely benefit from the latest theoretical results by marigo et al . \n the authors were able to successfully model the red tail of c stars producing a synthetic ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) diagram in very good agreement with the observational data . \n the key ingredient is to assume an opacity that in cool stars varies with the chemical composition in addition to the assumption of a given pulsation mode ( the first overtone for c stars ) . \n large scale informations on agb stars in the magellanic clouds , ngc6822 , ngc147 and ngc185 have been discussed : their location in the near  ir cmd , their spatial distribution and that of the c / m ratio . \n the latter is an important abundance indicator , especially for those systems too far away to measure abundances with other tracers . in the near future \n we will complete the reduction of complementary i  band measurements , try to complete the observations of some targets not yet fully mosaiced and to continue a monitoring program ( in the i  band ) that will provide us with an indication about the variability of the target stars . \n ultimately we count on publishing homogeneous catalogues of agb variables that will be useful to the whole community to perform stellar population studies in these relatively nearby galaxies . \n blanco v.m . \n , mccarthy m.f . , 1983 , aj 88 , 1442 cioni m .- r.l . , habing h.j . , 2003 , \n a&a 402 , 133 cioni m .- r.l . \n ,

{"ContextTokens": 4031, "GeneratedTokens": 166, "SynthesizedBody": "we report in this letter on our spectroscopic observations of hd  209458 , observations that led to the discovery of a transiting planet with an orbital period of 3.5 days . \n we have been observing hd  209458 since august 1997 as one of the targets in two large independent radial - velocity surveys , both searching for extrasolar planets around solar - type stars . \n one program uses hires ( vogt et al . \n 1994 ) on the keck i telescope , and the other uses elodie ( baranne et al . \n 1996 ) on the 1.93-m telescope at observatoire de haute provence ( france ) . \n in june 1999 , after observations from both efforts showed that the radial velocity of hd  209458 was variable , additional frequent observations were obtained with elodie , as well as with coralie ( queloz et al . \n 1999 ) on the new 1.2-m swiss telescope at la silla .    in august 1999 \n the identity of hd  209458 and its orbital elements were provided to d.  charbonneau and t.  brown so that they could look for transits with the stare photometric instrument ( brown & kolinski 1999 ) . \n two transits were successfully observed in september 1999 ( charbonneau et al . \n 2000 ; hereafter c00 ) . \n an independent discovery in november 1999 of the planetary orbit , as well as the detection of a transit ingress , are reported by henry et al . \n ( 2000 ) . \n transit observations together with an orbital solution allow us to determine directly the mass , radius , and density of the planet , provided we have good estimates for the mass , radius , and limb darkening of the star ( e.g. ,  c00 ) . \n we describe in this letter our efforts to derive better estimates for these parameters . \n one of the two radial - velocity projects , the results of which we report here , is the g dwarf planet search ( latham 2000 ) . the sample for this project \n is composed of more than 1000 targets whose effective temperatures , luminosities , chemical compositions , and galactic - population memberships have been determined using precise strmgren photometry ( olsen 1993 ; private communications ) . \n in addition , the radial velocities of these stars were known to be constant at a precision of 300600 ms@xmath8 , based on more than ten years of observations with the coravels ( mayor 1985 ) and the cfa digital speedometers ( latham 1985 , 1992 ) . \n the observations for this project were performed with hires and its iodine gas - absorption cell ( marcy & butler 1992 ) on the keck i telescope . \n the g dwarf planet search observing strategy is designed to carry out an initial reconnaissance of the sample stars , with the immediate goal of identifying the stars whose radial velocity is modulated with an amplitude of about 50 ms@xmath8  or larger . to increase the number of target visits we concede velocity precision , and \n therefore have exposed no longer than needed to achieve a precision of 10 ms@xmath8 . \n radial velocities are derived from the spectra with todcor ( zucker and mazeh 1994 )  a two dimensional correlation algorithm . although we are still in the development stage of our software ( zucker , drukier & mazeh , in preparation ) , preliminary results from the global analysis of the 675 stars with two or more iodine observations show that we are already close to achieving our goal of 10 ms@xmath8  or better .    the other program \n whose results are presented here is the elodie planet search survey ( mayor & queloz 1995a ) . \n after the discovery of the planetary companion around 51 peg ( mayor & queloz 1995b ) , the surveyed sample was extended to about 320 northern hemisphere solar - type stars brighter than @xmath9 and with small projected rotational velocities ( @xmath10 from coravel , benz & mayor 1984 ) . from coravel data , \n the stars in this sample were known to have constant radial velocities at a 300 ms@xmath8  precision level . \n radial - velocity measurements are obtained with the elodie echelle fiber - fed spectrograph ( baranne et al . \n 1996 ) mounted on the cassegrain focus of the 1.93-m telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence . \n the reduction technique used for this sample is known as the  simultaneous thorium - argon technique \" described by baranne et al ( 1996 ) . \n the precision achieved with this instrument is of the order of 10 ms@xmath8  over more than 3 years . \n after the two independent detections of the short - term variability of  by the hires and elodie teams , we decided to add this object to the coralie planet search sample ( udry et al . \n 1999a , b ) in order to gather more radial - velocity data and therefore increase the precision of the orbital elements . \n the precision achieved with coralie is of the order of 78 ms@xmath8  over 18 months . to check for other possible sources of line shifts besides orbital motion we computed the mean bisector profiles ( as described by queloz et al . \n 2000 , in preparation ) for all the elodie and coralie spectra . \n no correlation between the observed velocities and the line profiles was detected , convincing us that the planetary interpretation was correct even before transits were detected . \n as of november 16 , 1999 , we had a total of 150 radial - velocity measurements of hd  209458 available for analysis : 11 from hires , 31 from elodie , and 108 from coralie . \n initially we applied shifts of @xmath11 m  s@xmath8 to the elodie velocities and @xmath12 m  s@xmath8 to the hires measurements to bring them to the coralie system , the latter offset being much larger due to the arbitrary zero point of the hires velocities ( zucker , drukier & mazeh , in preparation ) . to account for possible errors in these shifts , \n the orbital solutions described below included two additional free parameters  @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the hires and elodie shifts  along with the orbital elements . \n in addition , the two transit timings recorded by c00 provide useful information on the orbital period and @xmath15 , the time of inferior conjunction . \n these timings were therefore included in the derivation of the spectroscopic orbital elements , and we treated them as independent measurements with their corresponding uncertainties .    in a preliminary solution weights were assigned to each observation based on the internal errors . from this fit we computed the rms residuals separately for each data set \n @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  and then scaled the internal errors for each instrument to match the corresponding rms residuals on average . \n we re - solved for the orbital parameters , and the procedure converged in one iteration with essentially no change in the elements . \n tests allowing for a non - circular keplerian orbit for hd  209458 resulted in an eccentricity indistinguishable from zero : @xmath19 . \n we therefore assume in the following that the orbit is circular . \n our final orbital solution is represented graphically in figure 1 . \n the elements are given in table 1 , where the value of the planetary mass , @xmath20 , depends on the inclination angle and on the adopted stellar mass , , to the power of 2/3 . \n the orbital elements reported by henry et al . \n ( 2000 ) are consistent with our results , although their quoted errors are substantially larger . \n robichon & arenou ( 2000 ) have identified three transits in the hipparcos photometry and have derived a more precise period , @xmath21 d , consistent with the value of table 1 within 1.5-@xmath22 . \n in this section we compare the results of two different approaches for estimating the mass and radius of hd  209458 . in the first approach we rely on the effective temperature , @xmath23 , and the surface gravity , @xmath24 , derived from a fine analysis of the iron lines in the hires template spectrum of . in the second approach \n we take advantage of the accurate distance available from the hipparcos astrometric mission ( esa 1997 ) and rely on the stellar absolute magnitude and observed color . for both approaches we matched theoretical isochrones from four different sets of stellar evolution models with the location of  in the corresponding parameter plane , estimating the stellar mass , radius and age . \n the stellar models depend sensitively on the metallicity , and therefore a critical first step for both approaches is to determine the metallicity . \n an analysis of eight spectra obtained with the cfa digital speedometers ( latham 1992 ) with the techniques reported by carney et al . \n ( 1987 ) gave @xmath25 k , @xmath26 , and @xmath27}=+0.11 \\pm 0.1 $ ] . \n another independent analysis of the cross - correlation dips from coravel observations ( mayor 1980 as revised by pont 1997 using primary calibrators by edvardsson et al . \n 1993 ) gave [ fe / h]@xmath28 . \n this large range in metallicity values , @xmath29 to @xmath30 , implied a large uncertainty in the mass and radius of hd  209458 , so we undertook a detailed analysis of selected fe i and fe ii lines measured on our hires template spectrum , which has a resolving power of about 70,000 and signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element of about 300 . \n we adopted a line list developed by l.  de almeida ( private communication ) and solar _ gf _ values based on the national solar observatory solar flux atlas ( kurucz et al . \n 1984 ) .    for this analysis of hd  209458 we used model atmospheres and computer codes based on the work of r.  kurucz . \n selected weak fe i lines were used to set  by adjusting the  until the plot of abundance versus excitation potential was flat . \n stronger fe i lines were then included and the microturbulent velocity was adjusted to get a flat dependence of abundance on line strength . \n finally , the surface gravity was adjusted until the abundances from the fe ii and fe i lines agreed . \n this analysis gave @xmath31 k , microturbulent velocity @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and [ fe / h]@xmath34 . \n the errors in these values are undoubtedly dominated by systematic effects , and we estimate that they are @xmath35 k in @xmath23 , @xmath36 in @xmath24 , and @xmath37 in [ fe / h ] . \n this approach yielded  and , as well as the metallicity . in the other approach we used the absolute magnitude and color of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( assuming no extinction or reddening ) , together with the metallicity derived from the iron lines .    in table 2 \n we compare the values of the stellar mass and radius , and , and age that we derive for  using the two approaches and isochrones from four different stellar evolution codes : geneva ( schaller et al . \n 1992 ) , bertelli ( bertelli et al . \n 1994 ) , claret ( claret 1995 ) , and yale ( demarque et al .  1996 ) . \n the results of this comparison are given in the first four lines of table 2 . \n the last two lines of table 2 demonstrate the effects of changing the stellar helium abundance and metallicity . \n the next - to - the - last line indicates that helium - rich models give slightly lower values of the mass and radius . \n the effect of changing the metallicity , with the helium scaled by the enrichment law , is illustrated by the last line . \n we therefore conclude that if z = 0.019 is adopted for the solar metallicity ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , all the results for the z = 0.02 models should be reduced by about 0.01 in both mass and radius . \n note that all four sets of evolutionary models and the two approaches yielded similar results , with only small differences . \n the mass estimates are systematically smaller for the results based on the observational  vs @xmath40 plane , by about @xmath41 . \n the radius estimates are also smaller , by about @xmath42 . \n note , however , that the good agreement between the different models may be misleading , and that systematic errors are likely to be larger . based on all these considerations , \n we adopt for our best estimate of the mass and radius of hd  209458 @xmath43 and @xmath44 . \n the uncertainty estimates are somewhat arbitrary , and are based mainly on the assumed uncertainty in , ,  and @xmath40 .    using elodie and coravel cross - correlation dip widths \n , we infer the projected rotational velocity ( calibration by queloz et al . \n ( 1998 ) for elodie and by benz & mayor ( 1984 ) for coravel ) . \n the results are @xmath45 kms@xmath8  for coravel and @xmath46 kms@xmath8for elodie . \n c00 present preliminary estimates of the planetary radius , @xmath47 , and orbital inclination , @xmath48 , based on initial estimates of , , and the @xmath49-band limb - darkening parameter @xmath50 . \n we now present values for these quantities based on the more accurate analysis of the stellar parameters presented in this letter . \n in addition , we present estimates of the uncertainties that combine the effects both due to the uncertainties in the stellar parameters , and due to the level of precision in the photometric measurements of the transit . \n all uncertainties presented below correspond to 1-@xmath22 confidence levels .    using the calculated limb darkening coefficients \n presented in claret , daz - cordovs , & gimnez ( 1995 ) , we adopted a value of @xmath51 , based on the values for  and  derived in the previous section . \n as described in c00 , we then calculated the @xmath52 of the photometric points for the model light curve as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , using the revised values of \\{,,@xmath50 } presented here . to evaluate the uncertainty in the derived values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we calculated the @xmath53 for all combinations of the stellar parameters at 1-@xmath22 above and below their respective best fit values . \n we then assign 1-@xmath22 error bars based on the intervals which are excluded with this confidence for all these combinations . \n we find @xmath54 and @xmath55 . \n the primary mass and the inclination imply ( see table 1 ) the planetary mass to be    @xmath56    > from the planetary radius and mass we calculate the density , surface gravity , and escape velocity to be @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .    in the interpretation of the transit curve of hd  209458 , \n the dominant uncertainty in the planetary parameters is due to the uncertainty in the stellar radius , rather than the observational uncertainty in the photometric points . \n the planetary radius found here is larger and the orbital inclination is smaller than the values presented in c00 . \n this is due primarily to the fact that the value of the stellar radius found here ( @xmath60 ) is larger than the one assumed in the initial analysis ( @xmath61 ) . \n a larger star requires a larger planet crossing at a lower inclination to fit the same photometric data . \n the results presented here and in c00 are based on the analysis of the detailed observed transit lightcurve . \n henry et al . \n ( 2000 ) , who did not observe the full transit , assumed an inclination of 90  for the orbital inclination , and a stellar radius and mass of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . with these assumptions they derived a planetary mass and radius of @xmath64 and @xmath65 \n the spectroscopic orbit , when combined with the inclination derived from transits , enables us to derive the planetary mass directly . \n this demonstrates the power of combining spectroscopy and photometry for transiting planets ( c00 ; henry et al . \n 2000 ) . to derive masses for non - transiting planets that have spectroscopic orbits , \n we are forced to turn to other approaches for determining the orbital inclination , such as astrometry ( e.g. , mazeh et al . \n 1999 ; zucker & mazeh 2000 ) . \n is the first extrasolar planet whose orbital inclination is known with high precision . in principle we might be able to derive the inclination of the stellar rotational axis , if we could obtain the stellar rotational period from photometric observations . \n together with the projected rotational velocity and the stellar radius derived here , this will enable us for the first time to check the assumption that the stellar rotation is aligned with the orbital motion for such short - period systems . with @xmath66 kms@xmath8 \n , alignment implies a rotational period of @xmath67 days . \n one unique feature of the transit technique is its ability to derive the planetary radius . \n as described in the review by guillot ( 1999 ) and the references listed therein , the radius of an extrasolar giant planet is determined by its mass , age , degree of insolation , and composition . \n now that an accurate measurement of the planetary radius has been made , it should be possible to infer specifics of the planetary composition , since the mass and insolation are known , and the age can be reasonably constrained based on the value of the age of the star determined above . more specifically , as described in guillot ( 1999 ) , it may be possible to calculate the amount of heavy elements for a given hydrogen / helium ratio , and to infer the presence or absence of certain atmospheric grains . \n these very fascinating possibilities , together with the analysis of other known short - period extrasolar planets , like 51 peg , @xmath68 boo , and @xmath69 and ( e.g. , ford , rasio & sills 1999 ) , promise us new insights to the formation and evolution of these systems . \n we give special thanks to robert l. kurucz for generously sharing his expertise and procedures for analyzing stellar spectra . \n we are grateful to karin sandstrom for her help with the abundance analysis and to the referee for his useful comments . \n this work was supported by the us -

mass bds in the pleiades and to provide accurate first - epoch data for future proper motion determination . \n this paper is an extension of the @xmath8 survey described in festin @xcite . \n for a teide1-type object , the flux rises from 10 to almost 100% of its peak value between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . \n therefore , although providing a rather short wavelength baseline , @xmath11 was chosen as the primary temperature indicator . \n its efficiency is proved by the large gap between the pleiades sequence and the background stars in the @xmath9 vs @xmath11 diagram . \n most observational effort was spent on obtaining high - quality images in @xmath9 ( fig . \n [ figseeing ] ) to get good first - epoch coordinates and to clean out galaxies . to minimize the effects of nonuniform pixels and rotation angle , each @xmath9 field \n was observed at four different field angles ( 0 , 90 , 180 and 270 degrees ) . \n complementary photometry was taken in @xmath12 . \n +    all observations were carried out at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , la palma . \n the survey covers 648 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath13 ( of which 240 arcmin@xmath0 were also covered in @xmath14 ) + 200 arcmin@xmath0 in @xmath15 only . \n the total area is 848 arcmin@xmath0 near the centre of the pleiades ( fig . \n [ figfield ] ) . \n a summary of the observations is given in table  [ tabobsoverview ] . \n .observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     figure  [ figimf ] suggests a rising mf towards lower masses with a power - law index between 0 and 1 , but there are several uncertainties one should be aware of . \n the observed number of objects is small , but it remains clear that the lf drops from @xmath16 to the survey limit . \n we can not say how many pleiades bds that are lost in unresolved binaries . \n however , we estimate a likely upper limit by assuming that the 30% multiple fraction for m dwarfs @xcite applies to all our single pleiades candidates which are brighter than the bd limit at @xmath17 . if those companions all are below the bd limit , 8 bds would have been lost . of course \n , we do not know their possible distribution , but adding 8 bds to the lf still leaves it close to the @xmath18 curve . from this crude discussion it follows that lost companions are unlikely to raise the mf index significantly above 1 . \n there is also a normalization error , which does not affect the falling trend , however . \n the model in baraffe et al . \n @xcite is state - of - the - art and based on the latest generation of non - grey atmospheres and should provide the best possible mass - luminosity relations for the pleiades bd sequence . \n since it has not yet been possible to derive an empirical mass - luminosity relation for substellar objects , we do not try to estimate the uncertainties in mass that may arise from the model . \n we have performed a deep 850 arcmin@xmath0 @xmath1 survey in the central area of the pleiades cluster . \n photometry in @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath14 is presented for 32 previously known and 7 new likely members . \n four of those are below the bd limit , and the faintest one would be the lowest mass bd found in the pleiades so far , if its membership could be confirmed . \n the overall agreement in the photometry with other surveys is satisfactory . \n teide1 is an exception . \n we find @xmath19 , @xmath200.5 mag fainter than zrm . based on rgo archive data and a roughly constant @xmath10 magnitude \n we conclude that the reason for this discrepancy most likely sits in the photometry of zrm and not in intrinsic variability .      after splitting ppl15 and two other probable binaries into components , \n the pleiades lf was compared to model lfs derived from the most recent theoretical mass - luminosity relations . \n the observed lf supports an mf - index between 0 and 1 . \n thus , even if the mf seems to rise for low - mass bds in the pleiades , it is not steep enough to leave more than a few percent of the cluster s mass in bds , which is consistent with dynamical findings @xcite . \n i would like to thank the not opc for allocating time for this project which is an essential part in my coming thesis . \n thanks also to n.c . \n hambly who provided proper motions for some of my candidates and to i. baraffe who provided the model on ascii format . \n this work was supported by the nordic optical telescpe scientific association and the swedish natural science research council ( nfr ) . \n this research has made use of the rgo la palma archive . \n f. , hauschildt p. , 1997 \n , model atmospheres : brown dwarfs from the stellar perspective . in : r. rebolo , e. martin , m.  r. zapatero osorio ( eds . ) , brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets : asp conf . \n , in press                                                    g. , 1997 , searching for new brown dwarf candidates in a pleiades ijk imaging survey in : r. rebolo , e. martin , m.  r. zapatero osorio ( eds . ) , brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets : asp conf .", "StartTimeOffset": 1892141453802, "RequestID": "8601d24e0c5c45a5aebb6d031d9819af49c40d77", "TotalTokens": 1645}
{"ContextTokens": 3004, "GeneratedTokens": 106, "SynthesizedBody": "the behavior of quantum - mechanical systems within relativistic settings is a subject of ongoing research , with the unruh effect being a prime aspect of these explorations @xcite . \n questions raised by relativistic quantum information go beyond the problem of relative particle content and hold a promise of unveiling general properties of quantum mechanics when exposed to non - inertial motions and strong gravitational fields . \n this includes analysis of detection of entanglement by non - inertial observers @xcite , extraction of entanglement from the vacuum @xcite , generation of entanglement due to motion @xcite and improvement of relativistic metrological protocols @xcite . \n it also involves discussion of universal decoherence due to the gravitation dilation @xcite , fundamental limits to building ideal clocks @xcite , experimental simulation closed time - like curves @xcite and entangling power of the expanding universe @xcite , proposals for verification of the space - time topology @xcite and relativistic protocols within circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture @xcite . \n here we would like to discuss one of the quantum features , namely the nonclassicality of quantum states , and ask how its operationally defined measure is influenced by general motions . \n nonclassicality of quantum states can be linked to a variety of phenomena observed experimentally @xcite , such as photon antibunching @xcite , sub - poissonian photon statistics @xcite , squeezing @xcite , and can be considered a resource @xcite . \n there is a number of different approaches to this concept @xcite . \n however , no unique definition exists . \n we are motivated by the approach taken in the field of quantum optics where the criterion for nonclassicality is frequently based on the properties of the @xmath0-representation . \n what we are interested in , is verifying whether such a criterion , defined operationally , is sensitive to the motion of the probe detecting nonclassicality . \n we show that indeed such sensitivity occurs and the universality of the operational criterion is further limited by a presence of relative motions . \n even the minkowski vacuum state , which is considered classical from the perspective of an inertial frame , can yield non - classical properties when viewed by an accelerated observer , associated with a different basis @xcite . \n the purpose of this work is to show explicitly that operational measures of nonclassicality such as the one studied in this paper , are actually observer - dependent . in order to study such effects \n let us first review the necessary formalism behind the @xmath0-representation . \n any state of a harmonic oscillator can be represented in the basis of coherent states , the so - called diagonal basis : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the glauber - sudarshan diagonal @xmath0-representation , which is a probability quasi - distribution function @xcite . \n coherent state represents the closest approximation of a classical oscillator , with the minimum uncertainty and oscillating expectation value of the position and the momentum @xcite . \n therefore a quantum state @xmath3 , which can be represented as a statistical mixture of coherent states , can be considered classical @xcite . \n this occurs when the corresponding @xmath0-representation @xmath2 satisfies the properties of a probability distribution function and is a positive definite function . \n however , when @xmath2 takes on negative values or is highly singular , this statement does not hold anymore . \n it is possible to derive the @xmath0-representation from the full quantum state tomography @xcite . \n however , in general this procedure is highly sensitive to experimental errors and thus not practical . \n for that reason , the solution is to search for measures that can tune in to the properties of @xmath0-representation without the necessity of using state tomography . in this body of work \n we are interested in the quantum - optical approach that leads to an operationally defined witness of nonclassicality . \n we follow the proposal presented in @xcite where the authors introduced a witness based on a two - level probe interacting with a harmonic oscillator . similarly to that we probe a state of a quantum field with a two - level detector and infer the presence of the aforementioned nonclassicality of this state from the detector s readings . \n our analysis reveals how different motions of the detector affect the performance of the witness based on the @xmath0-representation . \n the paper is structured as follows : in sec . \n [ s2 ] we recall the formalism of the witness of nonclassicality , in sec .  [ s3 ] we discuss the impact of relative motion of the detector and the measured system on the performance of the witness and in sec .  [ s4 ] we give a summary and an outlook . throughout the paper \n we use natural units with @xmath4 . \n let us start by briefly reviewing the operational witness of nonclassicality based on the approach presented in @xcite . \n we are interested in the operational evaluation of nonclassicality of an unknown initial state of a quantum system . \n we consider a qubit detector which interacts with a harmonic oscillator . \n after the interaction , by analyzing the state of the detector we are able to verify the presence of nonclassicality in the initial state of the harmonic oscillator . + the system is assumed to start in a product state @xmath5 , corresponding to the qubit and the harmonic oscillator , and evolve according to a unitary transformation @xmath6 generated by a hamiltonian : @xmath7 in the above equation @xmath8 denote the usual bosonic annihilation and creation operators , @xmath9 are the pauli operators , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the frequencies of the respective subsystems , and @xmath12 is the coupling constant between them . \n we choose to parametrize the initial state in the following manner : @xmath13 where we have used the diagonal representation for the harmonic oscillator s density operator @xmath14 and the eigenbasis of @xmath15 for the qubit s operator @xmath16 . \n the full density operator evolves according to the equation @xmath17 and the state of the detector at any time @xmath18 is given by the reduced density operator @xmath19 . since @xmath20=0 $ ] , the only non - trivially evolving elements of the qubit density matrix , @xmath21 , are the off - diagonal ones : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denote @xmath24 eigenstates with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath25 . \n an explicit calculation of the evolution of @xmath26 yields the following result : @xmath27 is the _ _ witness function _ _ as the witness function . ] . \n if the underlying @xmath0-representation is positive , then one can write the _ witness inequality _ ( or the _ classicality bound _ ) : latexmath:[\\ ] ] and confirm that @xmath156 satisfies the relation . \n based on this observation we can calculate the time evolution operator to obtain : @xmath157 in the above @xmath158 denotes the displacement operator and we have introduced : @xmath159 the above formulae can be used for evaluating the time evolution operator @xmath160 discussed in the core body of the manuscript . \n recall that the @xmath0-representation for coherent and thermal states take the following form ( here we consider one mode only and omit the label @xmath108 ) : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the average number of excitations . \n one can insert these formulae into the first line of equation ( [ witness - moving ] ) and evaluate the absolute value of the witness function . for the coherent state \n the corresponding absolute value of the witness function is equal to one , whereas for the thermal state we obtain : @xmath163 in both cases we obtain a function which does not exceed unity . \n here we evaluate the expression for @xmath104 that appears in eq .  . \n let us repeat the underlying integral : @xmath164 and the notation @xmath114 . for further convenience \n we introduce @xmath165 and continue the calculation to obtain :      this expression reveals a resonant behavior with a peak at @xmath167 , namely if we take the limit @xmath168 , we obtain a finite @xmath169 whose envelope increases linearly with @xmath48 . \n it allows us to identify the critical velocity given in eq .  . \n w. g. unruh , , 870 ( 1976 ) . \n w. g. unruh , _ proceedings of the 1st marcel grossmann meeting on general relativity _ , edited by r. ruffini ( north - holland , amsterdam ) , 527 - 536 ( 1977 ) . \n s. a. fulling , , 2850 ( 1973 ) . \n l. c. b. crispino , a. higuchi , and g. e. a. matsas , rev . \n phys . * 80 * , 787 ( 2008 ) . \n i. fuentes - schuller and r. b. mann , , 120404 ( 2005 ) ;

{"ContextTokens": 3849, "GeneratedTokens": 295, "SynthesizedBody": "our knowledge of the distribution of luminous matter in the universe has increased dramatically over the last two decades . both angular catalogues and redshift surveys now contain many thousands of galaxies and have allowed us to study their clustering properties in great detail . however , one feature of redshift surveys has been somewhat overlooked . \n a cursory glance at the distribution of galaxies in redshift surveys or angular catalogues reveals that there are vast parts of any survey that seem to be avoided by galaxies . these are termed voids . \n they are a major feature in the large scale distribution of galaxies in all wide angle , densely sampled redshift surveys .    until recently , \n voids have not been studied in great detail . \n this was mostly due to limitations on the sizes of the surveys . \n the @xmath3 30 @xmath4mpckm s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ] diameter of voids is a significant fraction of the depth of many redshift surveys of the local universe @xcite @xcite @xcite . \n a search for voids has so far been made on the southern sky redshift survey @xcite , the iras 1.2 jy survey @xcite and the las campanas survey @xcite . \n approximately twelve voids have been detected in these nearby surveys .    observed voids contain few galaxies regardless of the detection criteria . \n however , cold dark matter models predict that there should be matter , and hence maybe galaxies , within voids ( see benson et al . and somerville et al . in this volume for a discussion of the substructure problem ) . \n yet , studies of different types of galaxies show that they all seem to trace the same structures . \n either we are missing a population of galaxies that reside in the voids or there is a problem with the models producing too much mass on small scales @xcite . \n a first step in quantifying the properties of voids and void galaxies is to compile a catalogue of detected voids from as many redshift surveys as possible . \n here we adapt the method of ep97 in order to search for voids in the pscz survey @xcite and the updated zwicky catalog @xcite . \n we describe the surveys in sections [ sec : surv ] , the algorithm in section [ sec : algo ] and present our results in section [ sec : res ] . \n the pscz survey @xcite is a redshift survey of galaxies that is based on the catalogue of detections with the infra - red astronomical satellite . \n it covers the whole sky apart from areas with incomplete iras data and high optical extinction , such as the plane of the galaxy . \n the pscz survey covers 84% of the sky and contains a total of 15,411 galaxies , with a median redshift of 0.028 ( @xmath7mpc ) .    the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc ) @xcite includes results of the center for astrophysics redshift survey @xcite @xcite and contains a total of 18,633 galaxies with redshifts . \n the survey covers two main survey regions ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 both with @xmath10 . \n the volume limited sample which contains the most galaxies extends to @xmath11=0.025 ( @xmath12mpc ) and contains 3518 galaxies . \n we consider different samples from the two surveys to check the robustness of results , in particular , we check what effect the wall / field criteria has on the detection of voids and how much the volume of voids is underestimated by insisting that voids lie completely within the survey geometry . \n we also compare the two surveys to see if the same voids are detected and if the properties of voids in overlap regions are similar even though one survey is ir selected , the other optical . \n here we give a brief overview of the steps involved in our void finding algorithm . \n each of the steps are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections . \n the void finding algorithm we adopt is very similar to the method used by el - ad & piran ( void finder ) @xcite . \n the main features of the algorithm are :    * it is based on the point distribution of galaxies ; * allows for so called ` field galaxies ' - voids may not be completely empty ; * voids have to be larger than a minimum threshold      the first stage in identifying voids is to determine which galaxies are classified as field galaxies and which are wall galaxies . here we follow the method of ep97 . \n first we calculate the mean distance , _ d _ , to the @xmath13 galaxy and the standard deviation on this value , @xmath14 . \n we then specify a length _ l@xmath15 _ such that any galaxy that does not have @xmath16 neighbours within a sphere of radius _ \n l@xmath15 _ is classified as a field galaxy . \n the value of _ \n l@xmath15 _ we adopt is given by _ \n l@xmath15 _ = _ \n d _ + 1.5@xmath14 and we set @xmath16=3 . for our main samples , the values of _ \n d _ and _ l@xmath17 _ that we obtain for the pscz survey are 3.42@xmath4mpc and 7.19@xmath4mpc respectively while for the uzc we obtain 3.46@xmath4 and 6.52@xmath4mpc . \n a choice of _ n_=3 means that @xmath3 10% of galaxies are classified as field galaxies for both surveys . \n we compare with the results for a sample where we do not make the wall / field split to see what effect the choice of @xmath16 makes since the fraction of field galaxies depends critically on this choice . \n we count the number of field galaxies that lie in the voids to calculate the density of voids . \n the way we detect the voids is similar to the void finder algorithm of ep97 . \n first we place the wall galaxies onto a three dimensional grid . \n the fineness of the grid defines the minimum size void that can be detected . \n if each grid cell has length l@xmath18 , then all voids with radius r = @xmath19l@xmath18 will be found .    each empty cell \n ( we will refer to these as holes ) is considered a possible void . \n our method finds the maximal sphere than can be drawn in the hole , starting from the first empty cell . \n we place a sphere at the centre of the cell and grow its radius until we find a galaxy that is just on the edge of it . \n we then find the vector that connects this galaxy with the centre of the hole and move the centre of the spherical hole along this direction , away from the first galaxy , growing the radius to keep the first galaxy on its surface , until a second galaxy is also on the surface . \n we next find the vector that bisects the line joining the two galaxies and move the hole in this direction until a third galaxy is found , as before . \n the final step is to grow the hole out of the plane formed by the first three galaxies . at this stage \n we keep track of all the holes with radii larger than the value of the search radius used to classify field and wall galaxies , @xmath20 .      finding the holes \n is a robust process . \n deciding which holes form unique voids requires more care . \n our definition of a void is slightly different from that of ep97 . \n first we sort the holes by radius , the largest first . \n the largest hole found is automatically a void . \n we test the second hole . \n if it overlaps the first by more than f% in volume , then we say it is a member of the first void rather than a new void . if not then it forms a separate void . \n we then check the third hole . \n if it does not overlap a previous void by f% , it is a distinct void . \n if it overlaps only one previously detected void by f% , it becomes a member of that void . \n if it overlaps more than one previous void by f% , it is rejected as it is linking together two larger voids . \n we continue like this for all holes with radii larger than 10@xmath4mpc . \n we have investigated how much holes should overlap and yet be considered separate voids . in figure 1a \n we show the number of voids we find for the pscz ( dashed line ) and the uzc ( solid line ) as a function of the overlap fraction for which the hole is still considered a separate void . \n the number of voids converges to within a factor of two if the overlap fraction is @xmath2130% . \n we fix the fraction to be 10% . therefore , \n if a sphere with radii larger than 10@xmath4mpc overlaps a larger void by more than 10% of its volume , we merge the sphere into the void . \n if the overlap fraction is less than 10% of the smaller voids volume , we deem the sphere to be a distinct void . \n visually , using our criteria of 10% overlap , voids appear to be distinct regions of the survey . \n we set a threshold of 10@xmath4mpc for the minimum size of voids , this value being chosen for two reasons . \n it is larger than the search radius for defining field galaxies , @xmath22 . \n this helps ensure that we do nt identify gaps in the walls as voids . \n it is also the value at which the significance of detecting voids in the both the pscz and uzc drops below 80% , as discussed later . \n we next enhance the volume of the void . \n we consider the holes that have radii less than the threshold of 10@xmath4mpc but greater than the radius for the wall / field galaxy criteria ( in the case where we do not make the wall / field galaxy cut we use the value we would have used to make the cut as the minimum sphere radius ) . \n any of these holes that overlap the maximal void sphere by 50% of the smaller holes volume are also considered members of the void . \n if the hole overlaps with more than one void by 50% then it is not added to either of the voids as this would link two voids together that we wish to keep seperate . if the hole is isolated it can not be classified as a seperate void as it is smaller than the threshold we use for void classification . \n we have varied the overlap fraction and we find that the volume of voids are robust to within @xmath350% if the minimum overlap fraction varies from 0.3 - 0.8 . \n we are likely to underestimate the volumes of voids as we only consider holes that have radius greater than the search radius , @xmath22 . if voids are highly elliptical then we will not detect the volume at the ` corners ' of the ellipse . \n we test this by generating data containing mock voids of known elliptical shape . \n we generate ellipsoids with volume 15,000@xmath23mpc@xmath24 that have axis ratios 1:1:x ( i.e. \n if x is 1 then the void is spherical with radius 15.3@xmath4mpc ) . \n we then run the simulated data through our void finding algorithm and compare the volume obtained with the known volume of the void . \n the results are shown in figure 1b . \n if voids are spherical in shape then we recover 100% of its volume . \n the more elongated it becomes , the less of the volume we detect . \n this becomes significant if one of the axes is elongated by more than a factor of 2.5 than the others . \n again we use the method of epc97 to asses the significance of voids . the confidence level with which we detect a void \n is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the number of voids found in the poisson realisations and the survey sample under consideration . \n the closer @xmath28 is to 1 , the less likely a void could occur in a random distribution . \n voids in the main pscz and uzc sample are shown in figure 2 . in both cases , \n the points represent the wall galaxies and the shadings represent areas that are covered by voids and the open squares show the void centres . \n we find 35 voids in the pscz survey and 20 in the uzc with r@xmath29mpc . \n we construct mock pscz and uzc samples and find that we detect an average of 7.2 voids with r@xmath29mpc in poisson realisations of the pscz sample and 3.9 voids with r@xmath29mpc in poisson realisations of the uzc . \n this implies that the voids in both the pscz and uzc are significant at the 80% confidence level . \n the range of sizes of the voids between the two surveys is comparable . \n the largest maximal sphere in the pscz survey has radius 17.8@xmath4mpc , whereas in the uzc survey the largest hole has radius 14.7@xmath4mpc . \n the average void in the pscz survey has a volume of 15200@xmath23mpc@xmath24 whereas the average void in the uzc survey has a slightly smaller volume of 12800@xmath23mpc@xmath24 . \n using our criteria for identifying voids , the total volume fraction occupied by voids in the pscz and uzc surveys is 30% and 40% respectively .    in the case where we differentiate between wall and field galaxies \n , we find that voids have a typical overdensity of @xmath30 = -0.94 in the case of the pscz survey and -0.98 in the case of the cfa survey . \n these values are very low , even with 10% of galaxies classified as field galaxies , probably because the field galaxies lie close to the structures traced by the wall galaxies and are therefore not detected within the void volume . if we do not apply the field / wall criteria , we find 90% of the same voids . \n we miss one or two of the voids if we do nt define some galaxies as field galaxies because the few field galaxies in the low density environments restrict the size of the maximal sphere . \n we compare the volumes of the voids found in our main sample with voids found in samples that extend 20@xmath4mpc in depth beyond the depth of our main samples . \n this test shows that we underestimate the volume of voids by a larger factor the further out the void is found but the volumes are found to agree within a factor of @xmath31 for most of the voids . \n full details of the method and detected voids are given in hoyle & vogeley . \n we have demonstrated that our technique gives robust results in the sense that different samples from the same survey yield the same voids and we detect the same voids in different redshift surveys . as an extension to the work of ep97 and epc97 we have quantified the effect of our void definition on the number of voids detected within a survey and we have provided estimates of how accurately we are able to recover the volume of voids . using criteria that detect voids with typical underdensity @xmath32 \n , we find that up to 40% of the volume in the surveys under consideration is found in void regions . \n this is consistent with the findings of epc97 and shows that voids are indeed a large part of the universe . \n the next generation of surveys , the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite and , in particular , the sloan digital sky survey @xcite will aid our understanding of voids . \n both of these surveys cover a larger area than the uzc , although not quite as large an area as the ir surveys . \n the sdss will cover a quarter of the sky in one contiguous area which will be especially useful for void detection . \n both the 2dfgrs and the sdss will reach fainter magnitude limits than previous surveys , approximately 4 magnitudes deeper than the uzc . this will allow us to construct volume limited samples with more galaxies , which extend to greater depths . also , the sdss bright red galaxy sample will be approximately volume limited out to @xmath33 which increases the depth by more than an order of magnitude , although due to the sparsity of galaxies in the brg sample the voids will not be detected with as high a confidence as they will in the main

{"ContextTokens": 3905, "GeneratedTokens": 143, "SynthesizedBody": "powerful anisotropic outflows appear in a wide range of astrophysical sources and magneto - rotationally driven models are often a favored explanation . \n maybe asymmetric outflows ( e.g. balick & frank 2003 ) in planetary nebulae ( ppne ) and pre - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) also involve dynamically important magnetic fields ( aller 1958 ) . \n magneto - rotational driving is particularly appealing for ppne winds which are more powerful than pne winds : the observationally inferred rates of mechanical momentum and energy deposition for pne are ( kwok 2000 ) @xmath0 erg / cm , and @xmath1 erg / s , where @xmath2 is the swept up mass in the pn , @xmath3 is the speed of this mass , and the acceleration time @xmath4 age of the pn . but \n observations of ppne ( bujarrabal et al . 2001 ) reveal values up to @xmath5 erg / cm , and @xmath6 where the acceleration time @xmath7 age of the ppn . \n the ppne wind momenta are often @xmath8 times that carried by radiation even when multiple scattering is considered .    a large scale magnetic field can act as a drive belt that extracts rotational energy to drive a wind from the engine where the field lines are anchored ( e.g. spruit 1996 ) . when the engine is a star , the extraction spins the star down . when the engine is an accretion disk , a fraction of the accretion luminosity gets redirected into the wind . in the blandford & payne ( 1982 ) type model , mass outflow is driven by the toroidal magnetic field pressure gradient along poloidal field lines , though in the rotator s co - rotating frame near the footpoints , the processes can be thought of as centrifugal launching along favorably inclined poloidal field lines . \n consideration of magnetically mediated outflows raises natural questions in the ppne / pne context : where do the required fields come from ? how do these mechanisms work for single star or binary / disk systems ? \n are the outflow powers and momenta consistent with the observations ? \n convection driven and magneto - rotationally driven mhd turbulence ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) are fully developed in in agb stars and in accretion disks ( the two relevant environments ) respectively . \n large scale magnetic fields can then experience turbulent diffusion so intense that the field is not flux - frozen on the relevant dynamical or advection time scales ( lubow et al . \n 1994 ; blackman & tan 2003 ( bt ) ) . \n this highlights the need for dynamo amplification . \n the fields also be large enough to avoid diffusing before escaping to the corona where they are needed . in coronae \n , the fields can further open up . \n coronal loops which carry magneto - centrifugal winds should be at least as large as the radial scale of the anchoring rotator so that material can be accelerated to super - alfvnic velocities before reaching the loop - tops and avoid sliding back down . \n dynamos amplify or sustain magnetic fields by draining energy from random and shear motion . \n nonhelical ( direct ) dynamos amplify fields at wave numbers @xmath9 whereas helical ( inverse ) dynamos can also amplify fields at @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the smallest wavenumber at which the flow is turbulent . here \n `` helical '' refers to whether the driving turbulence possesses a non - vanishing pseudoscalar helicity such as kinetic helicity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the turbulent velocity , and the brackets imply averaging within a hemisphere . \n the nonhelical dynamo increases magnetic energy as the turbulence stretches magnetic field lines in a nearly random walk , but it is the helical dynamo ( e.g. `` @xmath14 , '' see moffatt 1978 ) which produce the large scale fields needed for outflows . \n helical turbulence can be supplied by convection in a star , or by the magneto - rotational instability in a stratified disk ( brandenburg et al . \n 1995 ; brandenburg 1998 ; bt ) \n .    while 3-d mhd simulations are essential for understanding dynamos , they are not always practical for modeling . for the latter , mean field theory ( e.g. moffatt 1978 ) \n is used . here the field is broken into mean and fluctuating components . \n the helical dynamo growth coefficients become correlations of fluctuating quantities , and the mean field evolution is solved for . \n traditional treatments do not dynamically determine the saturation strength of the large scale field ; they either take the growth to be steady ( = kinematic theory ) , or presume a form of quenching by the growing magnetic field without conserving magnetic helicity , a fundamental invariant of ideal mhd . a recent theory which alleviates these limitations by including the dynamical evolution of the velocity and magnetic helicity ( blackman & field 2002 ) \n is illustrated below . \n fig . 1 below ( from blackman & brandenburg 2003 ) shows the helical @xmath14 dynamo in a rotating northern hemisphere . \n the kinematic theory is shown in ( a ) and ( b ) while ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) show the dynamic theory . \n ( a ) : to conserve angular momentum , rising ( falling ) blobs in a stratified medium twist in the opposite ( same ) sense to the underlying rotation . \n this implies a non - vanishing @xmath15 , averaged in a given hemisphere . \n this `` @xmath16 '' effect implies that a large scale toroidal loop in the northern hemisphere incurs a right - handed writhe , and a radial field component as it rises . \n ( b ) : differential rotation ( the `` @xmath17 '' effect ) at the base of the loop shears the radial component , amplifying the toroidal field . dissipation or ballooning / opening of the top part of the loop allows for a net flux gain through the rectangle . \n ( c ) : same as ( a ) but now with the field represented as a ribbon . \n the right - handed writhe of the large scale loop is accompanied by a left - handed twist along the tube , incorporating magnetic helicity conservation . \n ( d ) : same as ( b ) but with field represented as ribbon / tube . \n ( e ) : top view of the combined twist and writhe the backreaction force which resists bending is the small scale twist . diffusing the top part of the loops \n allows a net flux generation in the rectangles of ( a)-(d ) , and helps alleviate the backreaction . \n to    the dynamic role of magnetic helicity is seen in simulations ( brandenburg 2001 ) and modeled analytically ( field & blackman 2002 ; blackman & field 2002 ) . \n although the small scale magnetic helicity growth drives the helical dynamo to a steady state , the large scale field grows large enough for most astrophysical applications . \n application of these principles to disks and stars with boundaries is work in progress . \n in addition , buoyancy rather than kinetic helicity may be the initial driver of the helical @xmath16 effect in disks ( brandenburg 1998 ) . \n this affects the initial sign of @xmath16 in each hemisphere , but magnetic helicity evolution remains a key to understanding the saturation . \n this scenario ( blackman et al . 2001 ( bfmtv ) ) begins with a main sequence ( ms ) star @xmath18 of rotational speed @xmath19 km / s . at the end \n the ms lifetime , the core collapses and the envelope expands , and angular momentum is assumed to be conserved on spherical mass shells . the rotation profile satisfies @xmath20 which is then combined with a numerical agb stellar model ( sdk1401 , steve kawalar , personal communication ) . in sdk1401 , \n the convection zone extends from the outer stellar radius @xmath21 cm down to the core radius @xmath22 cm . at the `` interface '' between the core and the envelope , @xmath23 cm / s . \n the combination of a strong differential rotation layer and overlying convection zone may lead to an `` interface dynamo '' ( e.g. markiel & thomas 1999 ) . here \n the poloidal field is generated by a helical @xmath16-effect layer in the convection zone . \n diffusive transport ( or turbulent pumping ; tobias et al . \n 1998 ) bleeds the poloidal field to the shear layer beneath the convection zone where it is further amplified by linear stretching ( `` @xmath17 '' effect ) . \n bfmtv applied the code of markiel & thomas ( 1999 ) to the agb star , ( the @xmath16 formula used was consistent with magnetic helicity conservation . ) at @xmath24 the saturated field is @xmath25 g. the scenario requires this dynamo to be steady for @xmath26 yr until the envelope of the agb star is radiatively driven away in the late agb stages . \n eventually , the density falls such that the field can no longer be stored : turbulent pumping can be gauged by assuming it to be proportional to a fixed convective energy density transfer rate @xmath27 . \n as @xmath28 decreases , @xmath29 increases and the turbulent pressure , @xmath30 , decreases with decreasing @xmath28 , eventually dropping below @xmath31 at the core . at this point , \n a `` magnetic explosion '' associated with toroidal pressure could ensue and drive the ppne outflow . \n the magnetic explosion is driven by poynting flux , and surface integration reveals a maximum mechanical luminosity ( blackman , frank , welch 2001 ( bfw ) ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the core radius and angular speed respectively . \n this high @xmath35 lasts for a magnetic spin down time of the star ( @xmath36 yr , starting after the envelope is lost ) and then decays exponentially . \n the asymptotic outflow speed should approach @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the alfvn radius , which can be less than or comparable to the escape speed @xmath39 km / s , depending on @xmath38 . \n matt et al . ( 2003 ) ( these proceedings ) have simulated a magnetic explosion . \n the above results are consistent with the requirements of ppne ( see sec . 1 ) . \n ( imai et al . ( \n 2002 ) have observed a collimated agb jet . )    unfortunately , the present interface dynamo models , while including a saturation of the @xmath16 effect , do not include saturation of the @xmath17 effect . in reality , amplification of the magnetic field at the shear layer drains shear energy , and transfers angular momentum from the core to the envelope , slowing down the core within @xmath40 yr , unless the differential rotation is re - seeded throughout the @xmath41 yr lifetime of the agb phase . \n this is important because matching the ppne observations requires the field to be anchored in a rapidly rotating core .    the so called `` lambda effect '' ( c.f . \n rdiger 1989 ) might be able to re - seed the differential rotation . \n this mechanism involves the interplay between the overall rotation and asymmetric convection to produce a steady - state rotation profile . \n the helical interface dynamo has to be solved with a dynamically coupled lambda effect . \n this awaits attention , but note that there is enough energy in the fusion driven turbulent convection to sustain the differential rotation : the turbulent energy density can be calculated from from the aforementioned agb stellar model sdk1401 and the result is ( j. nordhaus personal comm . ) \n @xmath42 erg . \n this can be compared with the magnetic field energy in the shear layer from bfmtv , which is @xmath43 erg , which in turn is about 1/8 the shear energy in the interface layer . \n thus only @xmath44% of the energy from the convection needs to be steadily drained into the desired differential rotation . \n binary scenarios do not suffer from the sustained shear problem just discussed because they deliver the angular momentum near the end of the agb phase ( e.g. soker 1998 ) , just when needed to drive the outflows . \n such angular momentum transfer could occur in the late agb stage by common envelope ( ce ) evolution \n ( e.g. iben & livio 1993 ) , as the secondary star penetrates the distended agb envelope and transfers orbital angular momentum to it . \n the agb star can shed @xmath45 of its mass within years of the onset of ce , depending on the binary parameters . during the shedding \n , the companion spirals nearer to the core . while accretion of envelope material can occur onto the secondary ( e.g. morris 1987 ; soker & livio 1994 ; mastrodemos & morris 1998 ) , much larger ( needed ) accretion rates arise when an accretion disk forms around the primary via disruption of the secondary ( reyes - ruiz & lpez 1999 ) . \n favored systems for this mode of accretion involve an evolved agb star with mass @xmath46 , a secondary with mass ( @xmath47 ) , and the initial binary separation @xmath48 . \n reyes - ruiz & lpez ( 1999 ) find that the disk accretion rate onto the residual primary core evolves in time ( after an initial @xmath49yr viscous adjustment period ) as @xmath50 typical values of the initial accretion rate @xmath51/yr .    once the disk forms , a helical disk dynamo ( e.g. pudritz 1981 ; brandenburg et al . \n 1995 ; reyes - ruiz & stepinksi 1995 ; campbell 2000 ; bt ) provides the mean field strengths from which one can determine the magnetic luminosity @xmath52 , available to drive an outflow . \n this can be estimated as the integrated poynting flux flowing through the disk surface ( or , the poynting flux through the alfvn surface ( bfw ; frank & blackman 2003 ( fb ) ) . \n tan & blackman ( 2003 ) find @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the assumed disk viscosity parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1979 ) , @xmath55 is the inner radius , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the sound and rotation speeds there . \n the @xmath58 enters because @xmath59 , and the mean surface poloidal and toroidal fields satisfy @xmath60 and @xmath61 . a calculation of acceleration along a poloidal field line \n gives the asymptotic velocity @xmath62 km / s ( fb ) . for a rotationally supported disk , \n the asymptotic wind velocity is always near or greater than the escape speed . \n the mechanical luminosity and momentum delivered are consistent with the ppne requirements of sec . 1 .    rather than form a disk \n as just described , an alternative is that the companion could spin up both a slowly rotating core and envelope , leading to significant differential rotation between the two ( assuming a turbulent viscosity in the envelope ) . \n this could rejuvenate the interface dynamo of sec . \n 4 during ce in the late agb stage just when needed . \n the time scales of spin - orbit synchronization ( zahn 1977 ) , envelope ejection , and viscous dissipation ( iben & livio 1993 ) must be compared , but this alternative might mean that a wider range of binary systems could produce magneto - rotational outflows . \n asymmetric outflows in ppne and pne signature the transport of angular momentum , and magnetically mediated outflows may produce the required power and momenta . \n maser ( miranda et al . 2001 ; vlemmings et al . \n 2003 ) and core x - ray ( kastner et al . 2003 ) observations loosely support this general paradigm . \n however , key unresolved issues remain : ( 1 ) is there a need for collimated outflows from both the agb star and disk ? \n are both self - collimated or does the latter collimate the former ? what might misaligned nested winds produce ( bfw ) ? \n ( 2 ) do all ppn / pne produce collimated jets when the sources are young ? ( 3 ) \n large scale nonlinear dynamo theory is in its infancy for realistic boundary terms . \n how do helical dynamo fields open up and dynamically relax in the coronae ? \n ( 4 ) how far is momentum carried as poynting flux ? \n ( e.g. hydromagnetic `` fling '' models vs. magnetically dominated `` spring '' models , or nested hybrid models ? \n ustyugova et al . \n ( 5 ) mhd jet simulations have been separate from mhd dynamo simulations . \n simulations capturing both together have not been done , though using a dynamo produced field and then simulating the outflow provides encouraging results ( von rekowski et al . \n non - steady calculations are important in this context . \n ( 6 ) the single agb wind scenario will only work for ppne if convection + rotation can steadily re - seed the differential rotation to ensure a large enough poynting flux at the end of the agb phase . if not \n , binaries may be absolutely required for asymmetric pne and ppne ( e.g. soker & livio 1994 ; soker 2001 ) . \n stellar evolution models which include magnetic fields and rotation are needed . \n ( 7 ) to what extent are the strong outflows in ppne correlated with the presence of binaries ? binaries with brown dwarfs or planets are not easily detected , but are favored for accretion around the agb core . \n ( 8) how restrictive are the initial binary parameters for which common envelope evolution simulations ( demarco et al . 2003 ) would produce a suitably accreting disk to power ppne ? \n is this relaxed by the scenario at the end of sec . 5 ? ( 9 ) consequences of internal dynamo produced fields for surface x - ray emission in agb stars and disks need more study . \n ( 10 ) could winds from the primary vs. secondary disks be distinguished by abundance differences ( fb ) ?", "StartTimeOffset": 1923684435666, "RequestID": "131987878aad034dd0fb79297090d49c6073f6b6", "TotalTokens": 4048}
{"ContextTokens": 3872, "GeneratedTokens": 208, "SynthesizedBody": "the earliest accounts of mathematical modelling to capture the spread of diseases dates back to as early as the @xmath0 century . \n bernoulli used mathematical equations to defend his stand on vaccination against the outbreak of smallpox . \n works following bernoulli earliest formulation of epidemic modelling helped in understanding germ theory in detail . \n however , this was not until the works of mckendrick and kermack , which first proposed a deterministic model that predicted epidemic outbreaks very similar to the ones that were recorded during those times  @xcite . \n since then our understanding of the mathematical models in epidemology has evolved over the years , the accounts of which can be found in the extensive works of anderson and may  @xcite . \n all the above formulations focused on modelling epidemics over a set of population in which uniform ties between agents were assumed _ a priori_. also , the nature of the ties in the above models did not play any significant role . \n contrary to this , the enormous body of work during the last decade in the field of network science has asserted the fact that ties , their strength and types in a system or a population play a significant role  @xcite . \n thus , a system or a population is not considered to be a set of individuals , rather it is considered to be a complex network of interacting individuals , where each individual or an entity is considered to be a node , and the links between them define the type of relationship one shares with the other . \n interestingly , a network model is not exhaustive to the study of population , rather it is a universal framework which can be used to understand numerous complex systems in general . \n also , over the years the term _ epidemic modelling _ has evolved into a common metaphor for a wide array of dynamical processes on these networks . \n various complex phenomena such as percolation , the spreading of blackouts to the spreading of memes , ideas and opinions in a social network can be modelled under the common framework of epidemic modelling  @xcite . \n transportation networks play a vital role in the spread of epidemics due to their widespread outreach across cities , countries and continents  @xcite . \n hould people be worried about getting ebola on the subway@xmath1 was one of the numerous similar headlines that made the front pages of the newspapers around the world during the 2014 ebola scare  @xcite . in this particular incident however , nobody was infected because the subject did not show symptoms of ebola while using public transportation . \n therefore not only airline networks , that can transmit pathogens across continents , even modes of public transport operating within cities such as , buses and subways pose a serious threat as well as a source of panic during desperate times . although , epidemic spreading in airline networks have been studied extensively , similar studies on bus networks are relatively rare  @xcite . \n epidemological models have been simulated on bus network datasets ; however , the results were only used to validate the numerical models . \n also , a recent study on city - wide integrated travel networks ( itn ) , have found both the traveling speed and frequency to be important factors in epidemic spreading  @xcite . \n thus , the effect of network structure and constraints in epidemic spreading are yet to be studied in these networks . in this paper \n we exploit the structural aspect of these networks to understand their role in epidemic spreading and diffusion process in detail . \n in this paper , we simulate the epidemic model on the bus networks of six major indian cities , namely ahmedabad ( abn ) , chennai ( cbn ) , delhi ( dbn ) , hyderabad ( hbn ) , kolkata ( kbn ) and mumbai ( mbn )  @xcite . \n the route data for all these bus networks are obtained from their respective state government websites . \n a bus network in @xmath2-space can be considered a graph , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the set of nodes and @xmath2 , the set of links . \n the topological structure of the graph is generated by considering every stop as a node , and the routes connecting the stops form the set of links . \n thus , a bus network @xmath5 can be represented as a @xmath6 adjacency matrix , @xmath7 whose elements @xmath8 , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected , else @xmath11 . \n the structure of a network in general is dependent upon the way the nodes are connected in a network . \n however , bus networks fall into a special class of complex networks where the physical constraints offered by the roads and the cities result in the emergence of the network topology  @xcite . the statistical analysis of these networks reveal a wide spectrum of topological structure . \n we define the degree , @xmath12 of a node , @xmath13 as @xmath14 . \n the pattern of the inter - nodal connectivity is given by the degree - distribution function , @xmath15 , which can be defined as the probability of a node , @xmath16 having a degree of atleast @xmath16 . \n some of the other network metrics that are of particular interest are the clustering coefficient , @xmath17 which denotes the tendency of nodes to form clusters or cliques and the characteristic path length @xmath18 . \n the local clustering coefficient is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the link connecting node pair @xmath21 , and @xmath12 are the neighbours of the node @xmath22 . \n the neighbourhood for a node , @xmath22 is defined as the set of its immediately connected neighbours , as @xmath23 , and the average clustering coefficient for the entire network is given by @xmath24 . \n the characteristic path length , @xmath18 is defined as the average number of nodes crossed along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes . the average distance from a certain vertex to every other vertex is given by @xmath25 . then , @xmath18 is calculated by taking the median of all the calculated @xmath26 @xmath27 . finally , an important network metric is the degree - assortativity that tells us whether the hubs are directly connected in a network or if they are connected through intermediate nodes . \n we tabulate the statistical properties for the six networks in table 1 . \n we simulate the two epidemic models si and sir on these networks . \n si model helps us to understand diffusion and percolation in these networks whereas , sir is the classical model that describes epidemic spreading . \n both the models are simulated using agent based modelling technique ( igraph ) , where each node is considered to be an agent whose states ( s , i or r ) change with every increment in simulation . \n the si model is the most basic representation of an epidemic spreading model . in this model \n , there are two states that an agent or a node can exist in : s ( susceptible ) or i ( infected ) . \n the si model describes the status of individuals or agents switching from susceptible to infected at every instant of time . \n it is assumed that the population is homogeneous and closed , _ \n i.e. _ , no new entity is either created due to birth or removed due to death , and also no new entity enters the system , thus preserving homogeneous mixing in the system . \n the si model also implies that each individual has the same probability to transfer disease , innovation or information to its neighbors . \n thus , the si model helps to capture the diffusion or percolation process in the entire network . \n the si model is formulated using the following differential equation . since an agent in the entire population \n can either be in state s or i , @xmath28 the si model is governed by a single parameter , @xmath29 , the infection transmission rate or simply , the infection rate . \n the growth in the number of agents in either of the sates is given by : @xmath30 substituting the value of s from equation ( 1 ) to equation ( 2 ) , we get the following differential equation describing the growth rate of i : @xmath31 the solution of the above equation with the initial condition at @xmath32 , @xmath33 is given by the logistic form : @xmath34      contrary to the si model , the agents in sir model have access to three states s ( susceptible ) , i ( infected ) and r ( recovery ) . although the earlier assumptions of a closed population and homogeneous mixing also hold in this case , the complexity of the dynamical process increases due to the addition of one more state . \n the agents , instead of only switching between susceptible and infected ( as in si model ) , tend to recover in the sir epidemic model . \n the dynamics of the sir model is controlled by two parameters : the infection rate , @xmath29 , and the recovery rate , @xmath35 . \n the sir model can be mathematically represented by the set of the following differential equations : @xmath36 the population of susceptible nodes decrease in proportion to the number of encounters multiplied by the probability that each encounters results in an infection . \n the negative sign denotes that the population of s is decreasing . \n similarly , we can describe the evolution of the other two states , i and r. nodes become infected at a rate proportional to the number of encounters , and the probability of infection controlled by the parameter , @xmath29 . \n nodes recover at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals , and the probability of recovery controlled by the parameter , @xmath35 : @xmath37 it would be interesting to analyze the spread of infection with respect to the susceptible individuals when there is a constant recovery ( from equation ( 6 ) ) . \n we calculate the variation in i with respect to s : @xmath38 the solution to the above equation with the initial conditions at @xmath32 , @xmath39 ( negligible as compared to the population ) and @xmath40 , is given by : @xmath41 in order to understand the rate of spread of infection in the population , we look at the rate equation for i from equation ( 6 ) : @xmath42 the above equation implies that the infection spreads if and only if @xmath43 . the epidemic dies out ( the number of infected individuals decreases ) if the above quantity is less than zero . \n bifurcation occurs at the stationary state , when @xmath44 , which separates the above two regimes and corresponds to the epidemic threshold . \n .tabular representation of the statistical data for the bus routes of six major indian cities ( @xmath18 = characteristic path length , @xmath17 = average weighted clustering coefficient , @xmath35 = power - law exponent , and @xmath45 = average node degree ) . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure 3 we simulate the si and sir models on the us airline network for 500 of the busiest airports ( @xmath46 )  @xcite . \n statistical analysis of the network reveals scale - free degree - distribution pattern between the nodes , with the characteristic path length @xmath47 and average degree @xmath48 . \n the si plot of the us airline network and abn show similar pattern of growth as both of them exhibit scale - free behaviour . \n however , the sir plot is similar to that of hbn due to extremely low characteristic path length and high average node degree . in table 2 \n , we present our findings for the networks studied in the paper . \n the first column represents the simulation time ( in seconds ) for @xmath49 percolation threshold from the si model . in the second and third column \n , we present the epidemic thresholds for the various networks studied by computing the values of the plots from the sir model ( figure 2 ) ( as a fraction of network size ) and the corresponding simulation times ( in seconds ) respectively . in the final column \n , we present the characteristic path lengths for the various networks . \n finally , in figure 4 , we plot the variation in the rate of percolation by removing nodes from the network based upon their centralities and degrees . in transportation networks , \n other than the degree of a node , closeness and betweenness centralities play a crucial role . while closeness centrality is a measure of a node s relative importance in the network due to the existence of shortest paths from that particular node to every other node in the entire network , betweenness centrality , on the other hand , acts as a bridging node connecting different parts of the network together . in order to capture their effects on information diffusion \n we simulate the si model on modified networks generated after directed removal of nodes . \n since cbn and mbn are strongly assortative , we remove only two percent of the nodes ( higher number of node removal will cause cbn and mbn to disintegrate into disconnected components ) . \n we find that the removal of nodes does not significantly affect the diffusion in abn . \n however for cbn , dbn and hbn , we observe that when nodes are removed based upon their closeness centrality , the diffusion curve shifts towards right , thus signifying a delay in the diffusion process . \n this can be explained due to the fact that the removal of nodes based upon closeness centrality has a direct effect on the characteristic path length . \n a node with high closeness allows every other node in the network to be reached along the shortest paths . \n the removal of such a node affects / delays diffusion until the next central node is encountered . for mbn , we observe that degree - biased removal causes the diffusion rate to increase steeply , signifying the presence of redundant nodes that simply increase the characteristic path length of the network . \n a removal of @xmath50 of such nodes causes the diffusion to improve significantly , as can be compared from the simulation times recorded in figure 1 and 4 . \n in this paper , we simulated diffusion and epidemic spreading on the bus transportation networks for six different indian cities , and also compared the results with the us airline network . from table 2 \n , we can clearly identify the characteristic path length to be a vital component in both , network diffusion and epidemic spreading . \n interestingly , the metric @xmath18 can be used as a single parameter to compare diffusion rates across different network topologies . \n this is because abn , dbn , hbn and kbn exhibit small - world phenomenon due to which the characteristic path length scales as the logarithm of the network size , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath51 . however , complexity arises when we have networks with comparable characteristic path lengths , like in the case of abn , dbn and kbn . in such cases \n , average node degree plays an important role . actually , a node having a degree @xmath16 has @xmath16 opportunities for infection . for a network with average node degree @xmath45 , \n the rate of change of the susceptible population is given by : @xmath52 the rate of change of the infected and simultaneously recovered individuals is similarly given by : @xmath53 note that the rate of change of the recovered individuals remains the same as before . \n substituting the value of i from equation ( 11 ) into equation ( 10 ) , and solving for s gives us the following expression for s in terms of r , @xmath54 at time @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . population of recovered individuals , @xmath58 is given as , @xmath59 . \n recovery of the individuals occur in the network if and only if the slope of @xmath60 or @xmath61 . \n similarly , we can observe from table 2 that the values of epidemic thresholds ( dbn , hbn and us air ) are also strongly correlated with the characteristic path length . \n the epidemic threshold for dbn is particularly high compared to its comparable counterparts , abn and kbn . \n the reason for this behaviour lies in the fact that dbn has a high average node - degree when compared to abn , and is assortative when compared to kbn . \n this allows dbn a high degree of freedom for infection transmission . \n finally , the low epidemic threshold values for cbn and mbn can be directly attributed to their considerably higher magnitudes of characteristic path length . even though cbn and mbn are strongly assortative , the structural advantage of assortativity in diffusion is ruled out due to the presence of long routes mostly comprised of intermediate nodes . \n the effect of node centralities in information diffusion is also studied in this paper . \n it is found that networks are sensitive in percolation and diffusion to that particular metric which has a direct effect on the characteristic path length . \n for some networks , closeness plays a crucial role ( cbn , dbn and hbn ) . \n however for networks like mbn , degree - biased removal also reduces the magnitude of @xmath18 . \n although , the specific node centrality directly affecting the magnitude of @xmath18 largely depends upon the network structure , it can be argued that closeness of a node can be used as a marker for network immunization procedure . \n we studied the functionality of the bus networks of six major indian cities in this paper . since experiments with epidemic outbreaks in a population ( or a network ) is not a viable option , we resort to mathematical modelling . \n we , therefore , study the effect of percolation and epidemic spreading on these networks using si and sir epidemic models through numerical simulations . while it is observed that the characteristic path length plays a crucial role in information diffusion and epidemic spreading , several other network metrics also play important roles . \n their importance is however restricted to their relative contribution to the topological structures of the networks . \n small - world property , while an extremely desirable property in transportation networks , is highly subjective in its role of information diffusion , solely due to the diffusing entity . \n while diffusion of pathogens is an undesirable phenomenon , diffusion of useful information is a desirable one . in conclusion , \n the work presented in this paper will help us in understanding and controlling the process of diffusion and epidemic outbreaks in spatially -

{"ContextTokens": 2017, "GeneratedTokens": 196, "SynthesizedBody": "statistical model and hydro - inspired model calculations indicate the picture of early chemical freeze - out(cfo ) for strange hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions@xcite . \n the cfo temperature can be extracted by fitting the model calculation of particle ratios for hadrons to the experimental data . on the other hand , \n one obtains the thermal freeze - out temperature from the slope of transverse momentum distributions by assuming some radial flow profile . \n naturally , it is therefore motivating to see how this scenario can be adopted by more realistic models , where a full three - dimensional hydrodynamical evolution is taken into account . in this work , \n we present results of hydrodynamical model calculations , inspired by this picture . \n the hydrodynamical model we employed is based on smoothed particle hydrodynamic(sph ) algorithm@xcite , in this model , the matter flow is parametrized in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates , of the so - called sph particles . as a result \n , the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations . \n the code which implements the entropy representation of the sph model for relativistic high energy collisions , and which has been developed within the so paulo - rio de janeiro collaboration , is called spherio . \n as it has been shown , the model is an efficient and robust method to tackle the problems concerning relativistic high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , which are characterized by highly asymmetrical configurations . \n it has been successfully used to investigate the effects of the initial - condition fluctuations and adopting the continuous emission scenario for the description of decoupling process @xcite .    in the present calculation , \n the model has been further improved in order to consider strangeness conservation and to adopt the scenario of cfo . the strangeness conservation is implemented by explicitly incorporating strangeness chemical potential into the code , and correspondingly a different set of equation of state(eos ) has been built and utilized . as a good approximation , we assume local strangeness neutrality throughout the hydro evolution .    to adopt the picture of cfo , as a first step , we take a simple postulate that for strange hadrons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the cfo takes place immediately after they are completely hadronized . \n these particles cease to have inelastic collisions and therefore their abundances are fixed and determined only by partonic eos . instead of introducing a specific temperature , \n cfo is incorporated in a simple and parameter - free approach . \n this is inspired by the earlier estimation from statistical model@xcite that cfo takes place close to the phase transition region . \n it is also because at this point , we would like first to check whether the picture of cfo would qualitatively improve the result of hydrodynamic model without going into the details of parameters . \n with the system being cooled and rarefied further , the thermal freeze - out occurs at a lower temperature @xmath4 which serves as an adjustable parameter in our calculation . \n as in the previous calculations , we use nexus event generator to produce event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions . we make use of a rescaling factor@xcite to fix the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in the present calculation , we introduce another parameter @xmath5 which provides initial transverse velocity in addition to the one provided by nexus . \n the reason for the introduction of @xmath5 is because nexus almost does not provide any initial transverse velocity . \n thus the initial transverse expansion reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial distance from orgin .      as a preliminary application \n , we have calculated the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in fig.1 , we present the pseudo - rapidity distribution for the most central au+au collisions at 200a gev . \n the experimental data are from phobos collab , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev . \n we show in fig.2 , the experimental transverse momentum distribution data for all charged particles , which can be well reproduced with a choice of @xmath8@xmath9 and freeze - out temperature @xmath10 mev . \n the experimental data are from star collab@xcite , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev , with @xmath11 .        with the parameters chosen , in the following , we calculate the spectra for various hadrons . in fig.3 \n we show the transverse mass spectra of pions , protons and kaons for most central collisions at mid rapidity , as well as experimental data from brahms collab@xcite . \n the same spectra for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are depicted in fig.4 , together with data from star collab@xcite . \n we use dotted lines to represent the results obtained without incorporating cfo , and solid lines for those with cfo switched on . \n it is observed that the present hydrodynamic model gives good description of the experimental transverse momentum spectra for pions , kaons and protons even without turning on cfo for these particles . \n although it gives the correct slopes for the spectra of strange hyperons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the disagreement comes from the multiplicities of the spectra . by introducing cfo , \n those results are improved significantly . while the spectra for pions , kaons and protons almost remain the same , ( this is not shown in the figures . ) \n it provides a good fit of strange hyperons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the cfo amplifies the multiplicities of strange hadrons with respect to the ones in the original model owing to higher cfo temperature , as compared with the thermal freeze out one . \n meanwhile the slopes of the spectra remain unchanged . \n it was indicated experimentally in ref.@xcite , as one goes to large rapidity region where the baryon density differs sizably from zero , the outcome of cfo would be much more significant . \n further work on this topic is under progress . \n it is worth noting that the effect of cfo has been discussed by several authors . in ref@xcite , the early cfo \n is studied in term of hybrid model where the hydodynamic evolution is complemented with a hadronic cascade model . \n the pure hydrodynamic evolution calculation has been carried out either only in the transverse plane assuming bjorken s scaling@xcite or with the baryon chemical potential taken to be zero@xcite . \n j. cleymans and h. satz , z. phys . \n * c57 * ( 1993 ) 135 p. braun -

{"ContextTokens": 3699, "GeneratedTokens": 115, "SynthesizedBody": "in earlier work ( robertson & leiter 2002 ) we extended analyses of magnetic propeller effects ( campana et al . \n 1998 , zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) of neutron stars ( ns ) in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) to the domain of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) . from the luminosities at the low / high spectral state transitions , \n accurate rates of spin were found for ns and accurate quiescent luminosities were calculated for both ns and gbhc . \n ns magnetic moments were in agreement with those found for similarly spinning 200 - 600 hz pulsars . \n gbhc spins were found to be typically 10 - 50 hz . \n their magnetic moments of @xmath0 gauss @xmath1 are @xmath2 times larger than those of ` atoll ' class ns . in the magnetic propeller model \n , the inner disk radius , @xmath3 , determines the spectral state . very low to quiescent states \n correspond to an inner accretion disk radius outside the light cylinder . \n the inner disk radius lies between light cylinder and co - rotation radius in the low / hard / radio - loud / jet - producing state of the active propeller regime . \n the high / soft state corresponds to an inner disk inside the co - rotation radius and accreting matter impinging on the central object . \n we show here that this permits a quantitative accounting for the ` ultrasoft ' high state spectral peak and a high state hard x - ray spectral tail . \n a field in excess of @xmath4 g has been found at the base of the jets of grs 1915 + 105 ( gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 , vadawale , rao & chakrabarti 2001 ) . \n a recent study of optical polarization of cygnus x-1 in its low state ( gnedin et al . \n 2003 ) has found a slow gbhc spin and a magnetic field of @xmath5 gauss at the location of its optical emission . given the @xmath6 dependence of field strength on magnetic moment , the implied magnetic moments are in good agreement with those we have found . \n although gnedin et al . attempted to explain the cygnus x-1 magnetic field as a result of a spinning charged black hole , the necessary charge of @xmath7 esu would not be stable . given the charge / mass ratios of electrons and protons , the opposing electric forces on them would then be at least @xmath8 times the gravitational attraction of @xmath9 . \n due to highly variable accretion rates , it is also unlikely that disk dynamos could produce the stability of fields needed to account for either spectral state switches or quiescent spin - down luminosities . \n both also require magnetic fields co - rotating with the central object . \n considering the magnetic moments to be intrinsic to the central object permits a physically obvious and unified explanation of lmxb radio and spectral states , but this is incompatible with the event horizons of black hole models of the gbhc . \n the success of the magnetic propeller model for gbhc and the lack of evidence for event horizons in gbhc ( abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ) strongly suggests that it must be possible , within the confines of einstein s general relativity to accommodate intrinsic magnetic moments in gravitationally collapsed objects . \n this can be achieved if the energy momentum tensor on the right hand side of the einstein equation @xmath10 is chosen in a manner that dynamically enforces the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requirement of ` timelike worldline completeness ' ; i.e. , the requirement that the worldlines of physical matter , under the influence of both gravitational and non - gravitational forces , must remain timelike in all of spacetime ( wheeler & ciuofolini 1995 ) . \n when this spoe condition is met , trapped surfaces leading to event horizons can not be dynamically formed and intrinsic magnetic moments can exist in gravitationally collapsing objects ( leiter & robertson 2003 , mitra 2000 , 2002 , see below ) . \n a relatively simple example of a collapsing , compact object that can dynamically obey the spoe requirement of ` timelike worldline completeness ' is that of a radiating plasma containing an equipartition magnetic dipole field that drives it to radiate at its eddington limit . \n such an object can be described to first order by the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 describes outgoing radiation in a geometric optics approximation , @xmath14 is energy density of matter , @xmath15 is the pressure and @xmath16 the flux of photon radiation . for the collapsing mass , \n we use a comoving interior metric given by @xmath17 and a non - singular exterior vaidya metric with outgoing radiation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the areal radius and @xmath20 is the retarded observer time . in order to maintain timelike worldline completeness as required by the spoe , the surface redshift must remain finite ( leiter & robertson 2003 , mitra 2000 , 2002 ) . \n then the proper time @xmath21 , at the collapsing , radiating surface , s , will be positive definite if @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proper time rate of change of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with m(r , t ) the mass enclosed by the collapsing surface .    from equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we see that in order to satisfy the requirement of timelike world line completeness for a collapsing object , for which @xmath26 , it is necessary to dynamically enforce the ` \n no trapped surface condition ' , @xmath27 . in the meco model , this is accomplished by the non - gravitational force of outflowing radiation . at the comoving surface , the luminosity is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and the distantly observed luminosity is @xmath30 .    _ to guarantee the existence of sufficient internal radiation pressure , it is likely that a meco must possess an equipartition magnetic dipole field . \n _ at the temperatures and compactness of stellar collapse , a pair plasma exists within such a field . \n in addition to the intrinsic resistance to collapse of magnetic flux ( thorne 1965 ) , it has been shown ( pelletier & markowith 1998 ) that the energy of magnetic perturbations in equipartition pair plasmas is preferentially expended in photon production rather than causing particle acceleration . \n photon pressure varies @xmath31 , due to its dependence on pair density ( @xmath32 ) and synchrotron photon energy ( @xmath32 ) . \n lacking the pair plasma , the ratio of magnetic ( @xmath32 ) to gravitational stresses would be constant in a collapsing gas ( e.g. baumgarte & shapiro 2003 ) . \n with photon pressure capable of increasing more rapidly than gravitational stress , a secular equilibrium rate of collapse can be stabilized with the radiation temperature buffered near the pair production threshold . \n the stability of the rate of collapse is maintained by increased ( decreased ) photon pressure ( @xmath31 ) if the field is increased ( decreased ) by compression ( expansion ) . an equipartition field also easily confines the pair plasma . \n thus the collapse differs in a fundamental way from that of only weakly magnetic , radiation dominated polytropic gas or pressureless dust . \n strong recent evidence for equipartition magnetic fields in stellar collapse has been found for grb021206 ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) and strong residual fields much in excess of those expected from mere flux compression have been found in magnetars ( ibrahim , swank & parke 2003 ) . \n kluzniak and ruderman ( 1998 ) have described the generation of @xmath33 g magnetic fields for nuclear densities via differential rotation in neutron stars . \n other possibilities for producing extreme magnetic fields would include ferromagnetic phase transitions during the collapse ( haensel & bonnazzola 1996 ) or the formation of quark condensates ( tatsumi 2000 . )    since distantly observed magnetic fields are reduced by @xmath34 , a redshift of @xmath35 would be needed for the meco model with an equipartition field to accord with the magnetic moments we have found for gbhc , and also to account for agn luminosity constraints ( see the calculation for sgr a@xmath36 below ) . \n _ thus we are motivated by the spoe and empirical observational constraints to look for solutions of the gr field equations that are consistent with objects in extremely redshifted , eddington limited gravitational collapse . _ \n the two key proper time differential equations that control the behavior of the surface of an eddington balanced , collapsing , radiating object are : ( hernandez jr . & \n misner 1966 , lindquist , schwartz & misner 1965 , misner 1965 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 includes magnetic field energy in @xmath15 and radiant energy in @xmath16 and @xmath39 in eddington limited steady collapse , the condition , @xmath40 , holds . with this condition , equation ( 8) , when integrated over the closed surface where the pressure is dominantly that of radiation , can be solved for the net outward flow of eddington limit luminosity through the surface . taking the escape cone factor of @xmath41 into account \n , the outflowing ( but not all escaping ) surface luminosity , l , would be @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the plasma opacity . for simplicity , \n we have assumed here that the luminosity actually escapes from the meco surface rather than after conveyance through a meco pair photosphere . \n the end result is the same for distant observers . \n however the luminosity @xmath45 that appears in equations ( 8 - 9 ) is actually the net luminosity , which escapes through the photon sphere , and is given by @xmath46 thus in equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , the @xmath45 appearing there is given by @xmath47 due to the thermal buffering provided by the equipartition field and pair plasma we can examine a limiting case for which meco mean proper density varies slowly enough that the condition @xmath48 also holds after a time , @xmath49 , that has elapsed in reaching the eddington limited state . in this context from ( 9 ) we have that @xmath50 which can be integrated to give @xmath51 for example , for hydrogen opacity , @xmath52 @xmath53/g , and @xmath54 , this yields a distantly observed meco lifetime of @xmath55 yr . \n the meco state for gbhc is likely preceded by a much faster gravitational collapse of a stellar core . with a neutrino opacity some @xmath56 times smaller than that of photons , the lifetime of eddington limited neutrino emissions would likely be minutes , at most . \n to stabilize the rate of collapse with magnetic pressure and synchrotron generated photons would require a photon luminosity reduced below the neutrino eddington luminosity by the same factor of @xmath57 , to a distantly observed @xmath58 erg / s . \n it is of interest to note that for this to correspond to a meco object radiating at its local eddington limit , a surface redshift of @xmath59 would be required , which accords with our earlier arguments based on empirical magnetic field observational constraints . \n distantly observed meco luminosity is diminished by @xmath60 by gravitational redshift and by @xmath61 by a narrow escape cone at the photosphere of a pair atmosphere . due to its negligible mass \n , we consider the pair atmosphere to be external to the meco . \n it can be shown _ ex post facto _ to be radiation dominated such that @xmath62 is constant throughout . \n estimates of luminosities , photosphere upper limit temperatures and photosphere redshifts can then be found from the eddington balance requirements . \n the fraction of luminosity from the meco surface that escapes to infinity in eddington balance is @xmath63 where @xmath64 . \n the distantly observed luminosity is : @xmath65 by assuming that the escaping radiation is primarily thermal and that the photosphere temperature is @xmath66 , the fraction that escapes to be distantly observed is : @xmath67 where @xmath68 erg / s/@xmath53 and subscript p refers to conditions at the photosphere . \n equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) yield : @xmath69 to examine typical cases , a gbhc with @xmath70 and @xmath35 would have @xmath71 kev , a luminosity , excluding spin - down contributions , of @xmath72 , and a spectral peak at 220 a@xmath73 , in the photoelectrically absorbed deep uv . for an m=@xmath4 agn , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 with a spectral peak in the near infrared at 1.2 micron . _ \n ( sgr a@xmath36 , with @xmath76 , would have @xmath77 k and a 2.2 micron brightness of 6 mjy , just below the observational upper limit of 9 mjy ( reid et al . \n _ since @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 k , we find that @xmath81 for a gbhc with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , this yields a photosphere temperature of @xmath84 k , from which @xmath85 . \n an agn with @xmath86 would have a somewhat warmer photosphere at @xmath87 k , but with a red shift of @xmath88 . \n hence , although they are not black holes , passive meco without accretion disks would ( using any realistic opacity ) have lifetimes much greater than a hubble time and emit highly red shifted quiescent thermal spectra that may be quite difficult to observe . \n from the viewpoint of a distant observer , accretion would deliver mass - energy to the meco , which would then radiate most of it away . the contribution from the central meco alone \n would be @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the specific energy per particle available after accretion disk flow to the marginally stable orbit radius , @xmath91 . assuming that @xmath92 is some fraction , f , of the newtonian eddington limit mass accretion rate , @xmath93 , then @xmath94 where @xmath95 includes both quiescent and accretion contributions to the luminosity . due to the extremely strong dependence on temperature of the density of pairs , it is likely that the photosphere temperature remains near the previously found @xmath96 . \n then with @xmath83 , @xmath82 , and @xmath97 , we find @xmath98 k = 1.1 kev , and @xmath99 , which indicates considerable photospheric expansion . the meco luminosity would be @xmath100 erg / s , which is approximately at the newtonian eddington limit . for comparison , the accretion disk outside the marginally stable orbit at @xmath91 ( efficiency = 0.057 ) would produce only @xmath101 erg / s , with an inner disk temperature also ` ultrasoft ' at @xmath102 kev . \n most photons escaping the photon sphere would depart with some azimuthal momentum on spiral trajectories that would eventually take them across and through the accretion disk . \n thus a very large fraction of the soft photons would be subject to bulk comptonization in the plunging region inside @xmath91 . \n this contrasts sharply with the situation for neutron stars where there is no comparably large plunging region . \n this accounts for the fact that hard x - ray spectral tails are comparatively much stronger for high state gbhc . \n our preliminary calculations for photon trajectories randomly directed upon leaving the photon sphere indicate that this process would produce a power law component with photon index greater than 2 . \n it may be possible to detect meco in several ways . \n firstly , for a red shift of @xmath35 , the quiescent luminosity of a gbhc meco would be @xmath103 with @xmath104 kev . \n this thermal peak in the strongly absorbed uv might be observable for very nearby or high galactic latitude gbhc , such as a0620 - 00 or xte j1118 + 480 . \n secondly , at high state luminosities above @xmath105 erg / s , a central meco would be a bright , small ` ultrasoft ' central object that might be sharply eclipsed in deep dipping sources . \n thirdly , a pair plasma atmosphere in an equipartition magnetic field should be virtually transparent to photon polarizations perpendicular to the magnetic field lines . \n the x -

1 ) the inclusion of more observations , both archival and data collected after purc97 , and 2 ) reporting maps of the positronium continuum emission in addition to the 511 kev line . to extract the positronium continuum component from the underlying galactic continuum emission , we widened the spectral modeling to include thermal bremsstrahlung and exponentially - truncated power - law models . \n we also removed high - energy diffuse continuum emission following a prescription from kinzer et al . \n ( 1999 ) , distributing the emission spectrally according to an @xmath10 = -1.65 power - law and spatially according to a 90@xmath0 x 5@xmath0 2d gaussian@xcite . \n two maps of the 511 kev line emission and two maps of the positronium continuum emission are shown in figure 1 . \n although not identical , the two 511 kev maps share certain fundamental features . both exhibit an intense bulge emission and a fainter planar emission . \n the regions that appear anomalous in the rl map ( relative to symmetrical bulge and disk emissions ) are also anomalous in the svd map . \n the positronium continuum maps are also dominated by an intense bulge and a fainter disk component . \n pairings of bulge and disk components suggest the same families of solutions . \n both suggest that the bulge - to - disk ratio can vary from 0.2 -3 depending upon whether the bulge component features a halo ( which leads to a large b / d ) . \n the most noticeable difference between the four maps is how the ple is characterized . \n both mapping algorithms suggest enhancement of 511 kev line emission from the region reported in purc97 , although at lower flux levels ( @xmath6 1.0 x 10@xmath9 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) . \n the broad 2d gaussian ple described in purc97 is _ not _ an acceptable solution ; the quality of fit is much worse than solutions without a ple . \n by contrast , there is no suggestion of a ple at the location reported in purc97 ( @xmath11 = -2@xmath0 , 7@xmath0 ) in either of the positronium continuum maps . shown in figure 2 \n are 1@xmath0 wide cuts cuts through the four maps , taken at 70@xmath0 relative to the negative - longitude galactic plane . \n it is apparent that the four curves are consistent with the same distribution towards negative latitudes , but differ at positive latitudes . \n the lower panel of figure 2 shows the positive latitude cut after subtraction of the mirror negative latitude cut . \n the enhancement at 511 kev has a corresponding _ deficit _ for positronium continuum for both mapping algorithms . \n an enhancement of 511 kev emission that is due to an additional source of positrons ( relative to the galaxy - wide bulge and disk components ) would be expected to feature an enhancement of both annihilation components . for the lowest f@xmath7 value of zero \n , we would expect the positronium continuum emission to be symmetric and the 511 kev line emission to be enhanced . a positronium continuum _ deficit _ at positive latitudes would not be expected . \n if , alternatively , the ple is a region with no excess of positrons but is where the local f@xmath7 varies from the integrated f@xmath7=0.94 ( suggested both by osse analysis@xcite , and by wide fov germanium detectors@xcite ) , then the 511 kev line emission could be enhanced and the positronium continuum emission could be deficient . \n however , variations of the f@xmath7 it do not conserve photon flux . the 1:1 enhancement - to - deficit ratio suggested in figure \n 2b would not be expected . \n a third possibility is that the enhancement is instead due to the influence of gamma - ray sources that corrupt the spectral fitting . \n two possible mechanisms for this biasing could be from observations made while a source is exhibiting a hard x - ray flare , and/or if the source exhibits a previously undetected hard tail . the fact that both the line and positronium continuum components peak at 511 kev combined with the 45 kev fwhm energy resolution of the osse instrument mean that as many as 30% of the counts at that energy are due to positronium continuum photons . \n it is unclear whether flaring gamma - ray sources can bias the the spectral fitting to a large enough extent to entirely account for the apparent asymmetry in the annihilation radiation . \n a few compact sources which produce this type of biasing have been identified . at the present time , it has not been established which of the three explanations is correct . the cgro / batse instrument made observations of these sources which were nearly simultaneous with the osse observations@xcite . \n it is an objective of the current analysis effort to determine whether joint analysis of osse & batse observations of these sources will permit the unambiguous extraction of annihilation radiation from this complex environment . \n fortunately , although other regions of the inner galactic radian may be similarly biased , the majority of the region is not expected to have been affected . \n the wealth of information available both from the complete osse data - set as well as from the expanding data - set of monitoring of compact sources with the batse instrument may permit definitive statements as to the galactic distribution of positron annihilation radiation , particularly of the existence of a ple . \n johnson , w.n . \n , et al . _ \n apjs _ , * 86 * , 693 ( 1993 ) . \n share , g.h . \n , et al . , _ apj _ * 326 * , 717 ( 1988 ) . \n harris , m.j . \n , et al . , _ apj _ * 501 * , l55 ( 1998 ) . \n ore , a. & powell , j.l . \n , _ phys rev _ , * 75 * , 11 ( 1949 ) . gehrels , n. , et al . \n _ apj _ , * 375 * , l13 ( 1991 ) . \n purcell , w.r . , et al . \n , _ apj _ * 491 * , 725 ( 1997 ) . \n cheng , l .- x . , et al . \n , _ apj _ * 481 * , l43 ( 1997 ) . \n dermer , c.d . & \n skibo , j.g . , _ apj _ * 487 * , l57 ( 1997 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , et al . , _ a & as _ * 120 * , 317 ( 1996 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , et al . , _ \n apj -submitted _ , ( 2001 ) . \n milne , p.a . \n et al . , _ astro . \n * 38 * , 441 ( 1998 ) . \n milne , p.a . \n et al . , _ in proceedings of the 5th compton symposium _ , 21 ( 1999 ) . \n kinzer , r.l . , \n purcell w.r . , & kurfess , j.d . , \n _ apj _ * 515 * , 215 ( 1999 ) . \n harmon , b.a . \n , et al . _ in proceedings of the 1st compton symposium _ , 69 ( 1992 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 1980016642122, "RequestID": "37fcadbad1477a00f171f449ec7a910d26bbcddb", "TotalTokens": 2599}

ampre type pde , discretizing the equation by finite differences and then solving the resulting nonlinear equation system by the newton method . \n the design method can be applied to a variety of wavefront shapes @xcite . \n + an alternative approach to construct freeform surfaces for irradiance and phase control is from ray mapping methods@xcite . \n these methods are based on the seperation of the design process into two separate steps : the calculation of an _ integrable _ ray mapping between the source and the target irradiance and the subsequent construction of the _ continuous _ freeform surfacesfrom the mapping . \n the integrability thereby ensures the continuity of the freeform surfaces and the mapping of the input irradiance onto the ouptut irradiance . since the integrability depends on the physical properties of the optical system it is in general a nontrivial task to find such a mapping . + \n as shown in several publications , there is a strong relation between the inverse problem of nonimaging optics and optimal mass transport ( omt)@xcite . \n the cost function , which has to be applied to a certain optical configuration , is thereby problem - specific . \n for example , the mapping of two collimated beams with arbitrary irradiance onto each other with double freeform _ mirrors _ is described by a quadratic cost function @xcite and can be solved by corresponding numerical schemes@xcite . the same problem statement with double freeform _ lenses _ , which is considered in this work , \n is described by a different cost function , which depends on the opl between the freeform surfaces as it was shown by rubinstein and wolansky@xcite . \n + the investigations presented here are inspired by several publications @xcite , in which the authors applied the quadratic omt cost function to calculate a ray mapping to deal with the lens design problem . with this ray mapping \n , designs have been demonstrated of both single freeform surfaces for irradiance control for collimated input beams and point sources @xcite , and that of double freeform surfaces for irradiance and phase control@xcite . as demonstrated for illumination control with single freeform surfaces in ref . \n @xcite and for collimated beam shaping with double freeform surfaces in ref . \n @xcite the design problems are thereby restricted to a paraxial approximation . \n + here we first investigate the design by ray - mapping methods of double freeform surfaces which map two collimated beams with arbitrary irradiance onto each other _ beyond _ the paraxial approximation . to overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime , which is necessary for the construction of compact systems \n , the design problem will be modeled by two coupled pde s . \n this involves on one hand the jacobian equation , expressing the local energy conservation , and on the other hand a ray mapping pde , enforcing the surface continuity and the constant opl . \n the pdes will then be solved by an optimization scheme with the omt mapping from the quadratic cost function as the intial iterate , leading to a construction approach for the freeform surfaces . \n + to do so , the work is structured as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , by using the law of refraction , the constant opl condition and a surface continuity condition , a pde for an integrable ray mapping , is derived . together with the jacobian equation it builds a system of pdes for the determination of the mapping components . \n it is argued that the pde system is fulfilled within the paraxial approximation by the quadratic cost function omt map . in section [ sec:3 ] , a method for solving the pde system for general lens lens distances is presented . \n it is based on discretizing the pdes with finite differences and solving the resulting system of nonlinear equations by a standard optimization scheme with the quadratic cost function omt map as the initial iterate . \n a summary of the design algorithm and a detailed discussion of the implemenation is presented in section [ sec:4 ] , followed by the application of the presented method to the design of a single - lens and a two - lens system in section [ sec:5 ] . \n finally , in section [ sec:6 ] , a short discussion of the results is presented . \n in ref . @xcite \n a design method was presented for the construction of a single freeform surface for a collimated input beam with irradiance @xmath0 and an arbitrary illumination pattern @xmath1 on a target plane . \n it was shown that in the paraxial approximation the design process can be decoupled into two separate steps . in the first step \n a raymapping @xmath2 is calculated from the theory of optimal mass transport , and in the second step the freeform surface is constructed from the mapping . \n + there are several basic physical principles that a ray mapping needs to fulfill . \n firstly , to map the source irradiance @xmath0 onto the target irradiance @xmath1 , the ray mapping should be energy conserving . \n the local energy conservation is expressed through the jacobian eq . \n @xmath3 secondly , in case of freeform illumination optics , the mapping should allow the calculation of _ continuous _ freeform surfaces . \n as shown in several publications , these so called _ integrable _ ray mappings are related to problem - specific cost functions representing different optical settings , where one has to distinguish between point sources and/or collimated beams , mirrors and/or lenses and so on@xcite . \n the cost function defines a metric between the source distribution @xmath0 and the target illumination pattern @xmath1 and therefore represents an additional constraint to the underdetermined eq . \n ( [ eq:1 ] ) . in the case of a single freeform surface for the redistribution of collimated input beams , the quadratic cost function @xmath4 which is valid in the paraxial approximation , was studied by the authors@xcite . a key property there was the vanishing curl @xmath5 characterizing the quadratic cost function in eq . ( [ eq:2 ] ) @xcite . \n + as shown by rubinstein and wolansky , the cost function for collimated beam shaping with double freeform _ lenses _ takes a different form than eq . \n ( [ eq:2])@xcite . \n the authors propose to minimize the corresponding cost function by a steepest descent algorithm to get the ray mapping@xcite , but unfortunatly a numerically stable implementation is a nontrivial problem . \n + due to its applicability in the paraxial approximation ( see below ) and the availability of numerous published stable numerical schemes for its calculation , the quadratic cost function omt mapping serves as an initial iterate for the optimization scheme presented below . it will therefore build the basis of the design approach presented in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] .      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the freeform calculation with the initial maps @xmath6 shows strong deviations from the predefined specifications , whereas the optimized maps @xmath7 show high quality illumination patterns and a wavefront uniformity beyond the diffraction limit . \n remaining deviations from the ideal wavefront result ( besides fundamental numerical limitiations ) are from eq . \n ( [ eq:14b ] ) , which is not fulfilled exactly and therefore leads to an error accumulation along the integration path of eqs . \n ( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) . \n the precision of the illumination pattern on the other hand is mainly limited by the precision of @xmath6 . \n the main deviations from the predefined distribution @xmath1 are resulting from steep gradients , which can be seen especially for the example  iap \" in fig . \n [ fig:6]d ) . \n this is in agreement with fig . [ \n fig:3]b ) and observations which were made in ref . @xcite . \n a design method for the calculation of compact continuous double freeform surfaces for collimated beam shaping with complex irradiance patterns was presented . \n the method is based on the ray mapping condition ( [ eq:14b ] ) , which was derived from the law of refraction and the surface continuity condition in section [ sec:2 ] and builds together with the jacobian eq . \n ( [ eq:14a ] ) a system of nonlinear pdes for the unknown ray mapping @xmath8 . \n + due to the satisfaction of eq . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) for infinite lens distances by the mapping from omt with the quadratic cost function ( [ eq:2 ] ) , this mapping serves as an ideal initial iterate for an optimization approach for solving the system of eq . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) . as it was shown by approximating the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) by finite differences and using a standard optimization scheme from matlab s optimization toolbox one can ensure a fast convergence to the solution of the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) . \n this was demonstrated by applying the presented method to two design examples with complex target distributions and validating the results by ray tracing . \n the double freeform surfaces showed thereby high accuracy for the irradiance patterns and the wavefront , which was assessed by the calculation of the corresponding @xmath9 values of the normalized differences . \n + further improvements can be made by using omt methods for more complex boundaries of the source and target distributions , which requires the replacement of sulman s method ( with e.g. @xcite ) and the generalization of eq . \n ( [ eq:16 ] ) to more complex boundary shapes . \n the scalability of the distance of the initial map @xmath6 by @xmath10 to the solution of the eqs . \n ( [ eq:14 ] ) suggests the application of e.g. the newton algorithm for a faster optimization . \n + in our future research , we want to generalize the presented approach to double freeform surfaces for wavefronts different from the plane case , like e.g. spherical wavefronts . \n the authors want to thank ralf hambach and mateusz oleszko for valuable discussions , johannes stock for comments on the manuscript and david musick for a grammar and spelling check \n . we also want to acknowledge the federal ministry of education and research germany for financial support through the project fo+ ( fkz : o3wkck1d ) and kosimo ( fkz:031pt609x ) .      p. benitez and j. c. miano , `` simultaneous multiple surface optical design method in three dimensions , '' opt . eng . * \n 43*(7 ) , 14891502 ( 2004 ) . \n j. chaves , `` introduction to nonimaging optics , second edition '' , crc press , 2015 , 321406 .        c. shengqian , r. wu , a. li , and z. zheng , `` design beam shapers with double freeform surfaces to form a desired wavefront with prescribed illumination pattern by solving a monge - ampre type equation , '' j. opt . * \n 18*(12 ) , 125602 ( 2016 ) . t. glimm and v.i . \n oliker , `` optical design of single reflector systems and the monge-kantorovich mass transfer problem , '' j. o. math . sc . * 117*(3 ) , 40964018 ( 2003 ) . \n t. glimm and v.i . \n oliker , `` optical design of two - reflector systems , the monge - kantorovich mass transfer problem and fermat s principle , '' indiana university math . \n j. * 53*(5 ) , 12551277 ( 2004 ) . \n x .- j . wang , `` on the design of a reflector antenna ii , '' calc . var . * 20*(3 ) , 329 - 341 ( 2004 ) . \n j. rubinstein and g. wolansky , `` intensity control with a free - form lens , '' j. opt . \n a * 24*(2 ) , 463469 ( 2007 ) . \n t. glimm , `` a rigorous analysis using optimal transport theory for a two - reflector design problem with a point source , '' inverse problems * 26*(4 ) , p. 16 \n oliker , `` designing freeform lenses for intensity and phase control of coherent light with help from geometry and mass transport , '' arch . \n rational mech . \n 201*(3 ) , 1013 - 1045 ( 2011 ) . \n oliker , j. rubinstein , and g. wolansky , `` ray mapping and illumination control , '' j. photon . energy * \n 3*(1 ) , 035599 ( 2013 ) .                  l.l . \n doskolovich , e.a . \n bezus , m.a . \n moiseev , d.a . \n bykov , and n.l . \n kazanskiy , `` analytical source - target mapping method for the design of freeform mirrors generating prescribed 2d intensity distributions , '' opt . \n express * 24*(10 ) , 1096210971 ( 2016 )", "StartTimeOffset": 1992661579704, "RequestID": "87eaf00abaaddd687a9bf5f5e4c7bdce578a3bb3", "TotalTokens": 3254}

order coefficients are found to vary systematically with the solar cycle . \n we also detect a small but significant variation in the rotation rate derived from the linear combination of odd order coefficients over a period of four and half years . \n the residual rotation rate in the outer layers seem to be correlated with the solar activity while no such signature is found at the base of the convection zone . \n = 3.2 in    = 3.2 in \n we thank h. m. antia for allowing us to use the inversion code . \n this work utilises data obtained by the global oscillation network group project , managed by the national solar observatory , a division of the national optical astronomy observatories , which is operated by aura , inc . under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation . \n the data were acquired by instruments operated by big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar obsrvatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrophsico de canaris , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory . \n this work also utilises data from the solar oscillations investigation / michelson doppler imager on the solar and heliospheric observatory and we thank j. schou for providing us the data sets . \n soho is a mission of international cooperation between esa and nasa . \n nso / kitt peak magnetic , and helium measurements used here are produced cooperatively by nsf / noao ; nasa / gsfc and noaa / sel . \n this work is partially supported under the csir emeritus scientist scheme and indo  us collaborative programme \n nsf grant int9710279 . \n antia , h. m. & basu , s. , 2000 , apj , 541 , 442 . \n antia , h. m. , basu , s. , & chire , s. 1998 , mnras , 298 , 543 . \n brown , t. m. , christensen -

{"ContextTokens": 1177, "GeneratedTokens": 195, "SynthesizedBody": "shortly after the launch of the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in late 1995 , single kilohertz brightness oscillations were discovered in rxte countrate time series data from thermonuclear x - ray bursts in several neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries . \n these oscillations are remarkably coherent and their frequencies are very stable from burst to burst in a given source @xcite . \n these oscillations are therefore thought to be at the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone . \n this suggests that the oscillations are caused by rotational modulation of a hot spot produced by non - uniform nuclear burning and propagation . \n analysis of these oscillations can therefore constrain the mass and radius of the star and yield valuable information about the speed and type of thermonuclear propagation . in turn , this has implications for strong gravity and dense matter , and for astrophysical thermonuclear propagation in other contexts , such as classical novae and type ia supernovae .    a comparison of theoretical waveforms with the observations \n is required to extract this fundamental information . here \n we exhibit waveform calculations that we have produced using general relativistic ray - tracing codes . \n we survey the effects of parameters such as the spot size , the stellar compactness , and the stellar rotational velocity , and demonstrate that our computations fit well the phase lag data from sax  j18083658 . \n to compute observed light curves , we do general relativistic ray tracing from points on the surface to the observer at infinity in a way similar to , but more general than , @xcite and @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the exterior spacetime is schwarzschild , that the surface is dark except for the hot spot or spots , and that there is no background emission \n . the amplitudes would be reduced by a constant factor if there were background emission . \n the angular dependence of the specific intensity at the surface depends on both radiation transfer effects and doppler boosting ( see @xcite ) . for each phase of rotation \n we compute the projected area of many small elements of a given finite size spot . \n we then build up the light curve of the entire spot by superposing the light curve of all the small elements . \n the grid resolution of the spot is chosen so that the effect of having a finite number of small elements can alter the value of the computed oscillation amplitudes by a fraction no larger than @xmath0 . \n after computing the oscillation waveform using the above approach , we fourier - analyze the resulting light curve to determine the oscillation amplitudes and phases as a function of photon energy at different harmonics . \n 0.2truein          panel ( a ) of figure  1 shows the fractional rms amplitudes at the first two harmonics as a function of spot size and stellar compactness for one emitting spot centered on the rotational equator , as seen by a distant observer in the rotational plane . \n these curves demonstrate that a common result of the hot - spot model is large - amplitude brightness oscillations with a high contrast in strength between the dominant harmonic and weaker harmonics , as is observed in several sources . the curves for the first harmonic illustrate the general shape of most of the first harmonic curves . \n initially , the amplitude depends only weakly on spot size . \n however , once the spot grows to an angular radius of @xmath1 there is a steep decline in the oscillation amplitude which flattens out only near the tail of the expansion . \n this expected behavior appears to be in conflict with the decline in amplitude observed by strohmayer , zhang , & swank ( 1997 ) from 4u  172834 , in which the initial decline is steep . \n the cause of this could be that the initial velocity of propagation is large , or that the observed amplitude is diminished significantly by isotropization of the beam due to scattering ( weinberg , miller , & lamb 1999 ) . \n panel ( b ) of figure  1 shows the fractional rms amplitude at the second harmonic under the same assumptions but for two identical , antipodal emitting spots . \n the range in spot size here is @xmath2 since two antipodal spots of @xmath3 radii cover the entire stellar surface . \n note that in this situation , there is no first harmonic . \n these figures show that when there is only one emitting spot , the fundamental is always much stronger than higher harmonics . \n thus , a source such as 4u  1636536 with a stronger first overtone than fundamental @xcite must have two nearly antipodal emitting spots . \n as described in detail in @xcite , we confirm the results of @xcite and @xcite that the rms amplitude decreases with increasing compactness until @xmath4 , then increases due to the formation of caustics . \n we also find that a finite surface rotational velocity increases the amplitude at the second harmonic substantially , while having a relatively small effect on the first harmonic ( left panel of figure  2 ) .    as an application to data , in the right panel of figure  2 \n we use our models to fit phase lag data from the millisecond accreting x - ray pulsar sax  j18083658 . \n the waveforms from the accreting spot are expected to be similar to the waveforms from burst brightness oscillations , and the signal to noise for this source greatly exceeds that from burst sources such as aql  x-1 @xcite . as is apparent from the figure \n , the fit is excellent . \n further data , especially from a high - area timing mission , could be used to constrain the stellar mass or radius from phase lag data .", "StartTimeOffset": 2020598035890, "RequestID": "100b7e6512b369c2bbe3265cbd7db3cef2095dde", "TotalTokens": 1372}

straizys 1992 , and references therein ) , which may indicate the presence of an evolved secondary . \n similarly , our near \n ir magnitudes combined with the quiescent optical magnitudes of the secondary , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( wagner et al . 2001 ) , are consistent with a k / m secondary . \n in particular , @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate an old disc or halo m0/1 and m1v star , respectively , whereas @xmath24 and @xmath25 are consistent with a k7v and m0v star , respectively ( leggeit 1992 ) . \n all this suggests that the near  ir magnitudes are dominated by the secondary s light . \n the spectral type later than that derived from the optical / red spectra may be due to either the relative weakness of the absorption features in kvuma as compared with the k - m dwarf templates owing to very low metallicity ( e.g. frontera et al . \n 2001 ) and/or due to an overestimated contribution of the accretion disc light . \n in fact , recent estimates of the quiescent average optical magnitudes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 orosz ( 2005 ) , as well as @xmath28 ( zurita et al . \n 2002b ) , assuming the relative contribution of the secondary @xmath29 the @xmath30 ( mc clintock et al . \n 2003 ) and @xmath31 to @xmath32 light ( torres et al . \n 2004 ) give the secondary magnitudes , @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath35 , and optical / near  ir colours consistent with an old disc / halo k7/m0v star ( leggeit 1992 ) . \n all our @xmath5 light curves ( fig . \n [ lcmar04 ] ) show modulation with a period of @xmath3 d , with minima roughly coinciding with the spectroscopic conjunctions of the secondary according to the ephemeris given by torres et al . \n the combined light curve folded on this orbital ephemeris and composed from all our data ( fig . \n [ lcfaz ] ) , however , does not reveal a simple ellipsoidal modulation expected for the roche  lobe filling star . instead , both its shape and apparent asymmetries are almost identical with those shown by the superhump modulation found by zurita et al . \n ( 2002a ) in the optical light curves obtained during decline to quiescence , and shown in the bottom panel of their figure 3 . \n this result is very surprising because if the near  ir light curves are dominated by the superhump modulation , it is implausible that the light curves separated in time by @xmath36 year would be in the same phase of the orbital period , with the minima occuring at the time of spectroscopic conjunctions . \n moreover , the quiescent near  ir luminosity of xte 1118 + 480 is much higher than the quiescent optical and uv luminosity ( mcclintock et al . \n 2004 ) which is inconsistent with the expected spectrum of an accretion disk emission . \n thus , most of the observed modulation presumably originates in the tidaly distorted secondary , although some contamination by the superhump modulation may also be present . \n the light curves will be analysed in detail and possible interpretations of their complex shape will be discussed in a forthcoming paper . \n the presence of a roche - lobe filling secondary provides an excellent opportunity to accurately estimate the distance @xmath37 to xtej1118 + 480 for a roche - lobe filling secondary , we have ( eggleton 1983 ) : @xmath38 adopting the mass ratio @xmath39 ( orosz 2001 ) and the secondary s radial velocity amplitude @xmath40 km / s ( torres et al . \n 2004 ) we estimate the system separation @xmath41 , the volume radius of the secondary @xmath42 or @xmath43 . \n using the barnes - evans relation ( cahn @xcite ) , @xmath44 with the @xmath8 surface brightness , @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 and [ m / h]=0.5 ; beuermann et al . \n 1999 ) , and @xmath47 ( average value ) , we estimate the secondary s angular diameter , @xmath48 , and the distance @xmath49 . the surface brightness is a function of metallicity , lower metallicity will push the distance to lower values , \n the effect will , however , not exceed a few per cents . \n in particular , @xmath50 for [ m / h ] @xmath51 ( frontera et al . 2001 ) and @xmath52 kpc for [ m / h ] = 0 ( solar ) . \n the system is not eclipsing , so the inclination is @xmath53 . \n zurita et al . \n ( 2002a ) estimate that @xmath54 lies in the range 7182@xmath55 based on analysis of the ellipsoidal light curve in the optical ( @xmath32 ) range . \n the presence of a strong orbital modulation in our @xmath5 light curves also indicates high @xmath56 . \n so , most likely @xmath57 , and @xmath58 kpc . \n this estimate assumes that there is no accretion disc contribution to the near  ir magnitudes . \n torres et al . \n ( 2004 ; see also zurita et al . \n 2002a ) found a constant @xmath59 contribution of light from the accretion disc to the quiescent optical red emission . adopting the quiescent magnitude @xmath6019 ( orosz 2005 ;

{"ContextTokens": 3675, "GeneratedTokens": 215, "SynthesizedBody": "recent observational progresses revealed that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are extremely energetic explosion originated by core collapse of the massive stars or merger of binary of neutron stars or black holes at cosmological distance . \n the gamma - ray prompt emission below several mev band has been usually observed but the detection of high - energy emission above 100 mev was reported only a few times by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret)@xcite and recently by astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile)@xcite . the observed properties of these high - energy photons from some grbs showed distinct spectral and temporal behavior compared with low energy photons below several mev , suggesting different gamma - ray emission processes between low and high - energy photons@xcite@xcite . \n in addition , comparing observed properties of high - energy photons between short and long duration grbs will help to study the sub classes of grbs . \n however , very low sample number of grbs with high - energy photons before fermi era makes it difficult to reveal the detailed properties of high - energy emission from grbs . \n the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has successfully detected 14 grbs with high - energy photon ( @xmath0100 mev ) so far thanks to its unprecedented effective area above 100 mev of the large area telescope ( lat)@xcite . \n figure[grb_skymap ] shows the sky distribution of all grbs detected by the lat and gamma -

energy photon detected by short - hard grb 090510 provides a stringent photon dispersion limit , which strongly disfavors the quantum gravity model of space - time causes a linear variation of the speed of light with photon energy@xcite . \n in addition to those interesting properties for individual lat grbs , the large number of samples enable us to study the systematic properties of high - energy emission from grbs . \n actually , the high - energy photons of the lat are often delayed and extended compared with the low - energy emission from grbs , suggesting a different acceleration process and/or emission process in high energy emission . and \n also fermi has detected high - energy photons from both short and long duration grbs . \n this would help to classify the sub classes of grbs with high - energy emission properties . in this paper \n , we present the detail analysis result of three grbs with weak lat detection , grb 080825c@xcite , grb 081024b@xcite , and grb 090217@xcite and discuss the global properties of the high - energy emission of grbs by comparing with other lat bright grbs . \n we have performed a detailed temporal and spectral analysis for three grbs with weak lat emission through the careful procedures , which were developed by our collaborations for event selection , selection of the region of interest ( roi ) , and background estimation . in this section \n , we briefly summarize these important procedures for our analysis . see abdo et al . \n 2009a for more detail . \n the standard selection of the lat photon event has been developed by atwood et al . \n there are three event classes , named as `` diffuse '' , `` source '' , and `` transient '' class for specific scientific analysis . in the case of grb observations , the smaller region of the sky and \n shorter time scale compared with diffuse sources allows the event section to be relaxed , and the `` transient '' event class is usually used to detection , localization , and analysis for the prompt emission . on the other hand , diffuse class , which is used to analysis a faint source with longer time interval and covering larger region of the sky \n is also used for the afterglow search of grbs . \n in addition to these standard event classes , we developed more optimized event selection than the `` transient '' class for the spectral analysis based on monte - carlo simulations . from this study \n , we found that more relaxed can be used because the background contamination is less issue due to short time windows of grb analysis . \n this optimized event class , so - called `` s3 '' class is used for the spectral analysis of grb 080825c . for other grbs , grb 081024b and 090217 , the standard `` transient '' class is applied for the spectral analysis . \n the lat point - spread function ( psf ) strongly depends on the incident energy and the conversion point on the tracker , and thus the detector response of the lat is separated into `` front '' and `` back '' events . \n we also consider the energy - dependent region of interested ( roi ) for these `` front '' and `` back '' event individually based on the 95 % containment radius ( psf95 ) and the 95 % lat localization error ( err95 ) as follows : @xmath1 the maximum value of this energy - dependent roi is set to 10 and 12 degree for `` front '' and `` back '' event , respectively not to contain too large background region . \n we apply this energy - dependent roi for all three grbs .      because of very small number of photons detected for three grbs presented here \n , the background estimation should be performed very cautiously . \n the background rate strongly depends on many parameters such as the incident angle of the burst or the position in the instrument . \n therefore , it is not straightforward to estimate the accurate lat background using off - source region around the trigger time . \n there are two components of lat background events ; cosmic - ray ( cr ) background and diffuse gamma - ray background ( from extra - galactic and galactic ) . since these components have different properties , we have developed two different methods to estimate the expected background rate . \n the amount of gamma - ray background only depends on the exposure of a certain direction in the celestial sphere . \n therefore , this component can be estimated by a simple scaling of the number of gamma - rays detected in longer observations . here , we used six months of lat data for this scaling . \n the amount of cr background also depends on the exposure of specific direction of the sky , however , this component also changes with the geomagnetic coordinates at the location of the spacecraft , and this dependence can not be estimated by the same way as the gamma - ray background . \n thus , we utilized monte carlo simulation of the grb observation to estimate the cr background . \n grb 080825c is the first long grb detected by the lat@xcite . \n the gbm triggered on this burst at 14:13:48 ut@xcite . \n we estimated the burst location using `` transient '' class described above . in this analysis \n , we fit the lat data assuming the power - law shape of the point source . \n to estimate the error of the position of this point source , we calculate the test statistics ( ts ) , assuming point source for each grid of the map . as the result of this analysis \n , we found the best - fit position of this grb at ( ra , dec)=(233.9 , -4.5 ) with 0.8 degree of 68 % error radius . \n the detection significance is estimated by several independent method such as unbinned likelihood analysis or some bayesian approaches , and we obtained about 6 sigma by these methods . \n detailed description of these methods can be found in abdo et al . \n 2009a .    the short grb 081024b triggered the gbm at 21:22:41 ut@xcite and the lat ground analysis found high - energy photons from this burst up to 3 gev@xcite . \n thus , this is the first short grbs which is detected gev photon . through the same procedure as grb 080825c using `` transient '' class events , \n the lat location of this grb was estimated as ( ra , dec)=(322.86 , 21.16 ) with 0.22 degree of 68 % error , and the detection significance of this burst is 6.7 sigma . \n another long grb , 090217 triggered the gbm at 04:56:42 ut@xcite . \n this burst firstly detected by the blind search of the lat data by the on - ground automated science processing ( asp ) , and this is confirmed by the follow - up analysis around gbm position@xcite . \n the `` transient '' class events are used to obtain the location and significance of the lat data same as grb 080825c , and the best - fit position is found to be ( ra , dec)=(204.74 , -8.43 ) with 0.37 degree error radius . \n the detection significance is 8.4 sigma and 9.2 sigma with the semi - bayesian method and maximum ts value obtained by unbinned likelihood fit , respectively . \n figure [ latgbmlc ] shows the energy - resolved light curve of three lat grbs . \n the top two panels in each figure show the background - subtracted light curve of nai and bgo detectors of gbm . \n the lat events around the gbm position are plotted on the other bottom panels in each figure . from these light curves \n , we can see various temporal properties of high - energy photons from bursts to bursts . \n first , we can clearly see that the onset of lat high - energy photons are delayed with respect to the gbm low energy photons for grb 081024b . in the case of grb 080825c , \n this delay can be seen but it is not statistically significant . \n furthermore , the lat high - energy photons last longer than gbm low energy emission ; @xmath235 s for grb 080825c , and @xmath23 s for grb 081024b . \n the highest energy photon , 572 mev for grb 080825c and 3.1 gev for grb 081024b are detected when the low energy emission becomes weak . \n whereas the lat high - energy photons shows various properties different from gbm low energy photons for grb 080825c and grb 081024b , few noticeable temporal features can be observed from grb 090217 : there is no delay and extended emission of high - energy photons . \n the time - resolved spectral analysis combining the lat and gbm data was performed for three weak lat grbs . figure [ latgbmspec ] shows the resulting spectral models in the @xmath3f@xmath4 representation . \n each figure shows the best - fit model in each time interval shown in figure [ latgbmlc ] . from this analysis \n , we found no significant evidence of an additional high - energy spectral component such as extra power - law component or high - energy cut - off structure , and the single band function or comptonized model give a good fit for both time - integrated and time - resolved spectrum for all three weak lat grbs . \n we only found a weak evidence of high - energy cut - off from grb 080825c , e@xmath5 mev at the first time bin with the significance level of 4.3 sigma . \n interestingly , significant spectral hardening at the high - energy band in the last time bin can be seen for grb 080825c and grb 081024b , where the gbm low energy emission is almost back to background level . \n the spectrum of this late - time high energy emission can be represented by a single power - law model with the photon index of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for grb 080825c and grb 081024b , respectively . \n this late - time high - energy component is common to other bright lat grbs and the possible origin of this emission is synchrotron self - compton emission during afterglow phase or cascades induced by ultrarelativistic hadrons accelerated by the relativistic jet . \n grb 090217 , however , shows no significant evidence of additional spectral component and spectral evolution in any time interval unlike grb 080825c and grb 081024b . \n table [ grbcomp ] shows the comparison of the various properties between weak and bright lat grbs . above temporal and spectral analysis for three weak lat grbs \n revealed that the delayed onset and long - lived behavior of high - energy photons from grb 080825c and grb 081024b . \n such behavior is also reported from other bright lat grbs such as grb 080916c , 090510 , and 090902b , and we might think that the delayed onset and long - lived high - energy photon is the common feature of grbs . however , we can not find any temporal and spectral feature from grb 090217 . \n such `` featureless '' feature of grb 090217 may suggest the unique mechanism of the broad band gamma - ray emission or indicate that the different high - energy emission class exist . \n when we compare the high - energy emission properties between short and long duration grbs , there is no clear difference between these two classes in both weak and bright lat grbs . \n more grb observations are needed to investigate common and uncommon properties and possible classification in high - energy emission of grbs , and such study would be important to give new insight on the acceleration mechanisms for the high - energy emission of grbs .     error . the vertical dashed - line in each figure shows the time -

right ( lr ) symmetric group  @xcite @xmath11 supplemented by a discrete symmetry group @xmath1 . \n the quarks and leptons are assigned as in the minimal lr model to left - right symmetric doublets . \n the symmetry breaking is implemented also as in the minimal lr model by the higgs fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in the leptonic sector of the model \n , the @xmath14 breaking by the right handed triplet with @xmath15 gives large majorana masses to the rh neutrinos  @xcite . \n unlike in the usual implementation of the seesaw formula however , in our model , the dirac mass for neutrinos vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory due to the @xmath1 symmetry , whose effect on the various fields is given in the table below :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as noted , at tree level , both neutrino dirac masses and the down quark masses vanish . \n we will address the question of down quark masses in the next section . \n as far as neutrinos are concerned , at one loop level they pick up mass from the left diagram in fig . \n [ fig : numass_lfv ] with the neutrino mass matrix given by the one loop formula @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by @xmath18.\\ ] ] the higgs masses are given by @xmath19 note that these couplings @xmath20 are the effective couplings which we get at low energies when the left - right symmetry is broken . \n we assume that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath23 in the ma - model  @xcite . \n then , the light neutrino mass matrix can then be written as @xmath24 note that we can absorb @xmath25 into @xmath26 without loss of generality . \n since we have a rough idea about the form of the neutrino mass matrix in the limit of zero cp phase and small reactor angle @xmath27 , we can use it to get an idea about the elements of the rh neutrino mass matrix . \n it is interesting that all elements of this mass matrix can be determined . \n the neutrino mixing observables  @xcite we use are : @xmath28 the charged lepton masses we take from ref . \n @xcite : @xmath29    to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath30 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath31 gev . \n note that , in order to avoid the @xmath32 detection in the @xmath33-boson decay width , @xmath9 has to be larger than @xmath34 . \n the neutrino masses are given by @xmath35      to fit the neutrino oscillation data , we can use @xmath36 where the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath37 gev , where @xmath9 now has to be larger than @xmath38 . \n the neutrino masses are @xmath39    note that in both cases , there is a strong hierarchy in the rh neutrino sector in a way similar to the charged lepton sector . \n this is what we label as the _ radiative transmission of hierarchy _ from charged leptons to the rh neutrinos . \n note that this mechanism , given a certain form of @xmath40 ( with small mixings ) , naturally allows for large mixing angles in the sm lepton sector , that are not necessarily maximal . \n this is different from many other models , where in most cases only zero or maximal mixing is predicted . \n note however , that there are also exceptions to this : e.g. , the size of the mixing angle could be determined by underlying discrete symmetries  @xcite , or it could arise from an anarchical pattern of the neutrino mass matrix  @xcite .    to see analytically why this happens , \n let us try to reconstruct @xmath40 from the tri - bimaximal form for the pmns - matrix  @xcite , @xmath41 using this and eq .  , we can write down @xmath40 as function of @xmath9 and of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath42 . \n it is given by @xmath43 times @xmath44 if we assume normal ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , with small @xmath48 ) or inverted hierarchy ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) , the corresponding matrices will roughly look like @xmath52 and @xmath53 note that the reconstruction of all matrices ( eqs .  , and  ) has led us to heavy neutrino mass matrices which are hierarchical and stiff . in all cases , having a light neutrino mass close to zero ( @xmath54 in eqs .   and  ) \n can only increase this hierarchy , but not destroy it . especially in eq . \n the 11-entry is fixed , which means that we will generically have one fixed rh neutrino mass that is not too heavy . \n a similar situation happens for the quasi - degenerate case . \n these mass matrices for rh neutrinos have a structure that is easily obtainable from the froggat - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism  @xcite with a @xmath0 family symmetry with @xmath55 charges @xmath56 for the third , second , and the first generation right handed lepton doublets . \n the left - right and @xmath0 invariant yukawa couplings in this case can be written as : @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an appropriate choice of @xmath58 ( roughly @xmath59 in the normal hierarchy case ) , we get the desired hierarchy in both the charged lepton masses as well as in the rh neutrino sector . \n this hierarchy then translates into a structure of the light neutrino mass matrix that naturally yields large mixing angles , although no values are excluded a priori .    we can also give a prediction for @xmath60  @xcite , which is transmitted by the heavy neutrinos ( cf . \n right diagram of fig . \n [ fig : numass_lfv ] ) : the yukawa coupling in the basis where the heavy neutrino mass matrix is diagonal is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath40 . for a charged higgs mass of 100  gev and @xmath63 , \n the prediction for @xmath64 is @xmath65 for normal and @xmath66 for inverted ordering , where we have used eqs .   and  . \n if we go to smaller values for @xmath9 , the branching ratio increases ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 and normal ordering ) , which might be very interesting in light of the upcoming meg experiment  @xcite . \n it is clear from eq . \n ( 4 ) that at the tree level in our model , only the up quarks are massive . \n we present two ways to make the quark sector realistic by giving mass to the down quarks , ( i ) one where the @xmath69 symmetry , that keeps dirac mass of the neutrino to be zero , is softly broken and ( ii ) another one by adding three vector - like down quarks , where we can keep the @xmath69 symmetry exact . \n we only discuss the second option here .    for ( ii ) , we extend the model by adding three @xmath70 singlet , color triplet , @xmath71 quarks ( denoted by @xmath72 ) and two higgs doublets under the @xmath70 groups with @xmath73 ( denoted by @xmath74 ) . under the @xmath1 symmetry , \n the @xmath74 and @xmath75 are invariant , whereas @xmath76 . \n it is easy to write down a potential for @xmath74 with asymmetric mass terms for them so that they have nonzero vevs . \n since the discrete symmetry does not allow the term @xmath77 term in the potential , the additional fields do not destabilize the @xmath78 vev pattern assumed in the bulk of the paper . \n the new yukawa interaction that is invariant under @xmath1 and gauge symmetry is given by @xmath79 after spontaneous symmetry breaking the down quarks now have masses where they pair with the new down quarks ( rather than the usual ones of the sm ) . \n as a result , the @xmath80 partner of the up quark is a heavy down quark unlike in the minimal left - right model  @xcite . \n in fact , after symmetry breaking , one could write the left and right doublets as follows : @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath75 and @xmath83 swap roles ) , where the mass of @xmath84 is in the 10 to 100 tev range . \n we emphasize that there is no direct mass term between @xmath85 and @xmath75 . \n to fit the down quark masses and the ckm matrix , the yukawa coupling need to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vev of @xmath88 . \n this appears to be a completely viable way to generate down quark masses . \n an interesting feature of this model is that the surviving @xmath69 remains an exact symmetry , and as result the neutral member of the second doublet in @xmath78 can act as dark matter  @xcite , since it couples to quarks as @xmath89 , and as long as @xmath90 , the @xmath91 is stable with stability guaranteed by the @xmath69 symmetry  @xcite . \n in summary , we have shown that a radiative one loop model for neutrino masses proposed in  @xcite arises as a low energy limit of a left - right model which then provides a natural explanation of the two elements of the  @xcite proposal : ( a ) the reason for the extra doublet with its particular discrete symmetry property and ( b ) the origin of the right handed neutrino mass . furthermore , the radiative transmission of hierarchies makes large but non - maximal mixing angles in the leptonic sector plausible . \n left - right embedding also reduces the number of parameters in the model , making it predictive in the hadronic and leptonic flavor sectors . \n the work of r.  n.  m. is supported by the us national science foundation under grant no . \n phy-0652363 and alexander von humboldt award ( 2005 senior humboldt award ) . \n one of the authors ( r.  n.  m. ) is grateful to manfred lindner for hospitality at the max -

{"ContextTokens": 3391, "GeneratedTokens": 68, "SynthesizedBody": "alice  is a general - purpose heavy - ion experiment designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark - gluon plasma in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc . \n the alice  detector  @xcite is designed to deal with large particle multiplicities , dn / dy up to 8000 , well above the multiplicities expected for pbpb collisions at lhc energies . \n the alice  collaboration will also study collisions of lower - mass ions and protons . \n the pp collisions will primarily provide reference data for the nucleus - nucleus collisions but in addition a number of genuine pp physics studies will be done . \n the main components of the alice  detector are a central tracking and particle identification system covering the pseudo rapidity range @xmath0 , a muon spectrometer covering @xmath1 , a forward multiplicity detector and a zero - degree calorimeter . \n an overview of the @xmath2 coverage of the alice  systems is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : properties ] . \n the transverse momentum cut - off is only 0.1  due to the extreme minimisation of the material budget of the inner tracking system . on the other hand the @xmath3  measurement reaches up to 50  with full particle identification capabilities at mid - rapidity . \n the central part is embedded in the large l3 solenoidal magnet which provides a field of 0.5  t. the tracking system is subdivided in the inner tracking system ( its ) using different kinds of silicon detectors and a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) . \n the inner tracking system consists of six concentric cylindrical layers of detectors . from inside out \n the inner tracking system consists of two layers of silicon pixel detectors , two layers of silicon drift detectors and two layers of silicon strip detectors . \n the tpc consists of two 2.5  m long drift volumes separated by a central cathode . \n the inner tracking system determines the vertex resolution of the system while the tpc essentially defines the momentum resolution .    the transition radiation detector and the time of flight ( tof ) array cover the full azimuthal angle . \n additional detectors with partial coverage of the central barrel are the photon spectrometer , the high momentum particle identification detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter . \n an overview of the alice  particle identification capabilities is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : properties ] . \n details of the detector design and the expected performance are described in  @xcite . \n read - out of the muon spectrometer is triggered by the muon trigger chambers . \n the central tracking system is triggered by a combination of dedicated trigger detectors ( t0 , v0 ) and a trigger derived from the silicon pixel detectors ( spd ) in the innermost layer of the tracking system . \n each chip in the spd front - end system outputs a `` fast - or '' signal indicating that at least one pixel has fired . \n these signals are combined in a global multiplicity trigger which can be adjusted to select central events in pbpb collisions . however , since the noise in pixel detectors is intrinsically low , the same system was used to trigger on single cosmic muons for commissioning purposes . \n the hardware triggering system is complemented by the high level trigger ( hlt ) system which uses a large processor farm to select or tag events after read - out of the hardware . \n about 30% of this system was installed during the detector commissionng phase . \n in addition to its event selection capabilities this system provides a data quality monitoring facility . \n the experiment is ready for data taking with both proton and heavy - ion beams . \n partially installed are trd ( 25% , completed 2010 ) , phos ( 60% , completed 2010 ) and emcal ( completed 2011 ) . \n the central tracking system , the time of flight system and the forward muon spectrometer are fully installed . \n also the data acquisition system ( daq ) and the detector control system ( dcs ) are fully installed . \n therefore at start - up alice  has full hadron and muon identification capabilities and partial photon and electron identification capabilities . \n all installed detectors have been tested concurrently for noise performance in the l3 magnetic field . \n cabling , grounding and power supply issues have been resolved . during 2007/2008 \n three cosmic data taking periods with runs involving all detectors 24  hours a day were taken . \n the first run of 12 days in december 2007 was mainly used to debug the global and detector specific data taking systems . \n the second run of five weeks ( february - march 2008 ) was used to verify that all systems could efficiently operate without mutual interference . \n the majority of the commissioning data was collected in the third run which started in may 2008 and lasted until the foreseen start - up of the lhc in october .         using the silicon pixel trigger , adjusted to trigger on single particles , \n a sample of muons crossing the entire tracking system has been collected in 2008 . \n in addition the dedicated cosmic trigger system ( acorde ) was used to collect a large sample of single and multiple cosmic muon events . \n the muon spectrometer was triggered using its own muon trigger system . \n the total read - out rate was about 100  hz during several months , thus testing both the data acquisition system and the offline reconstruction software thoroughly . \n the availability of real data from the detectors has stimulated the implementation of additional features in the online software , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : online ] . \n the code has grown by about 15% with a large increase in the activity near the end of the datataking period . \n in addition valuable experience in operating all systems was gained allowing for efficient datataking when the lhc starts delivering beams . in 515  days of datataking a total of about 3  pb of data \n was read - out of which 350  tb was recorded to tape , see figure  [ fig : online ] . \n the muon spectrometer has collected a small sample of nearly horizontally moving cosmic muons which allowed to check the trigger system and gave a first indication of the internal alignment of the chambers . \n the cosmic data provided an opportunity to align the central tracking systems and partially calibrate them . for the smaller detectors beams \n will be needed to calibrate and align because they are in an unfavourable orientation with respect to cosmic muons or because their area is too small to collect a useful sample in an acceptable time . \n the following paragraphs describe the results obtained for the central tracking systems . for further details on the its commissioning results see also  @xcite .                in case of a single muon crossing the inner layers of the tracking system \n the reconstruction software finds two tracks because it searches for tracks coming from the interaction region . \n the distance between the two tracks provides a measure of the vertex resolution . \n the result before and after alignment of the individual layers of the inner tracking system is show in figure  [ fig : its ] ( upper left panel ) . \n the vertex resolution depends mostly on the alignment of the inner ( pixel ) layers . \n the estimated vertex resolution is 40  , close to the design value . \n the silicon drift detectors measure the  coordinate by measuring the arrival time of the electrons on the anodes . \n however , the drift speed depends strongly on the temperature . \n therefore the alice  silicon drift detectors have integrated electron injection devices which allow to monitor the drift speed continuously . during the cosmic run \n the drift speed was measured as a function of the position on the detectors and of time . \n figure  [ fig : its ] shows the result of the drift speed distribution on a detector ( upper middle panel ) and the speed as a function of time ( upper right panel ) . \n the drift speed is stable during many hours of operation as a consequence of the stable thermal conditions in the inner tracking system . \n this allows an effective reconstruction of the position using the measured drift speed map . \n in addition the drift detectors were aligned and the @xmath4  measurement was calibrated . \n the outer two layers of the its , consisting of silicon strip detectors were aligned using the cosmic muon tracks . \n in addition to the position measurements these detectors provide a @xmath4  measurement . \n an example of the response is shown in figure  [ fig : its ] ( lower left panel ) demonstrating that a signal to noise ratio of about  40 is achieved . \n because the silicon strip detectors in alice  are double sided they provide both the  and z coordinates in a single detector . however , although the stereo angle between the strips on each side is relatively small , ambiguities may arise if two particle cross the detector close to each other . \n a significant fraction of these ambiguities can be resolved because the charge measured on both sides of the detector is the same apart from the noise in the respective channels . \n an example of the correlation of the charge measurements on both sides of the same detector is show in figure  [ fig : its ] ( lower right panel ) . \n the time projection chamber has an integrated laser calibration system in order to measure the drift speed . \n figure  [ fig : tpc ] , upper left panel , shows the measurement of the ionisation trails of the laser beams . in order to calibrate the @xmath4  measurement in the tpc \n a radioactive gas was injected in the drift volume . \n the measured energy spectrum of the kr decays , see the upper middle panel of figure  [ fig : tpc ] , shows the excellent energy resolution of the tpc . \n due to electron attachment and diffusion the measured charge depends on the position of the ionisation in the drift volume . \n the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : tpc ] shows the amplitude as a function of the position . both the @xmath4  measurement and the drift speed \n must be corrected for the gas pressure and temperature which are also continuously monitored . \n the extensive commissioning period provided ample data to verify all necessary corrections . \n due to its large volume the tpc could collect more than 10 m cosmic muon and particle shower events . \n this large sample allowed to test the particle identification capabilities of the tpc as shown in figure  [ fig : tpc ] lower left panel . \n a clear separation of electrons , muons and protons is demonstrated at momenta up to 3  . \n the @xmath4  resolution , without a thorough calibration , is already 5.7% , very close to the design value of 5.5% . \n the momentum resolution was studied by separating the cosmic tracks into two halves and comparing the reconstructed momenta . already after the first attempt to align and calibrate a momentum resolution of 6% at 10  is achieved , reassuringly close to the design value of 4.5%  @xcite .    , i.e. 130  ps.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    for the time of flight ( tof ) system a special purpose cosmic trigger , using the signals from the tof system itself , was developed to collect a sample of cosmic muon events crossing two of the tof modules . \n the time projection chamber was used to measure the momentum of the muon and the track length between the two tof modules . since all muons measured this way are relativistic the time difference between the two modules measured by the tof \n can be compared to the time difference calculated from the track length . \n the time resolution of a single module is then found by dividing the width of the distribution by @xmath5 . \n thus the time resolution of the tof system , even with the current preliminary calibration , was found to be 130  ps , see also figure  [ fig : tof ] , showing that also the tof performs close to its design specifications .         the high momentum particle identification system ( hmpid ) , the transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the photon spectrometer ( phos ) are placed in unfavourable positions for detecting cosmic muons . \n nevertheless small samples of data were collected with which the proper functioning of the detectors could be verified . \n figure  [ fig : other ] , left panel , shows the measurement of the track matching precision between the tpc and the hmpid without a precise alignment  @xcite . \n the right panel of the same figure shows the first observed trd signals  @xcite . \n the phos system is not yet completed but one module was operated at room temperature , instead of -20  as foreseen in the design . nevertheless even at room temperature \n an energy resolution of de / e of 0.24 was obtained , see figure  [ fig : other ] centre panel .        in august and september 2008 \n the first protons were injected into the lhc . while the particles extracted from the sps were dumped at the end of the extraction line or at a collimator in the lhc the relative timing of the alice  trigger detectors could be studied . \n the time differences are sufficiently small to allow equalisation in the central trigger processor so that the individual triggers can be combined into coincident trigger conditions . \n the particle showers emitted from the dump at the end of the extraction line provided excellent test signals to compare the particle densities measured by the forward multiplicity detector ( fmd ) , the silicon pixel detectors , the v0 trigger counters and the muon spectrometer . \n when the first particles were sent through the alice  experiment into the next section of the lhc the first beam interaction was observed in the central tracking system . \n figure

{"ContextTokens": 2031, "GeneratedTokens": 189, "SynthesizedBody": "up to the end of 1994 more than 50 extragalactic radio sources have been detected with egret as emitters of high - energy @xmath0-rays . \n the majority of the sources are quasars and optically violent variables ( ovv ) and a number are classified as bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects . \n individual @xmath0-ray spectra in the egret range can generally be well described by power - laws ( von montigny , this volume ) . in case of the bl lac \n mrk421 the spectrum extends up to tev energies ( punch et al . \n 1992 ) . in this paper \n we analyse the class - averaged spectra of agn by summing the observed intensity and the statistic of power - law fits to the observed emission . \n we also derive the spectrum of the average @xmath0-ray agn which is to be compared to the spectrum of the diffuse extragalactic background . \n here we have summed all egret data of phases 1,2 , and 3 . with the standard likelihood techniques we have searched for point sources , \n of which we can identify 44 as agn , 11 bl lac s and 33 quasars and ovv s . \n for all 44 agn we have performed a spectral analysis . \n there is no cut - off visible in the @xmath0-ray spectra with the possible exception of a weak deficiency below 100 mev for the quasars which may be the outer extension of the usual roll - over at a few mev . \n we have also searched for systematical deviations from power - law behaviour in the @xmath0-ray spectra of the 44 agn . for each individual agn \n we have fitted a power - law spectrum to the data . \n the weighted difference between this fit and the measured intensity in the ten energy bands , i.e. @xmath1 , has been summed for all quasars and bl lac s , respectively , to obtain the average deviation . \n no significant deviations from power - law behaviour in the average agn spectrum is observed , neither for quasars and ovv s nor for bl lac s . \n we have summed the observed intensity in ten energy bands to derive the spectrum of the average agn . \n this spectrum is what we would get as contribution to the diffuse extragalactic background if the agn were unresolved . \n the @xmath0-ray intensity of all 44 agn sums up to around 7 % of the diffuse background . \n it is interesting to see that the @xmath0-ray spectrum of the average bl lac is harder than that of the average quasar and ovv ( with formal significance 1.7@xmath2 ) . \n this does not imply that in single viewing periods bl lac s have always harder spectra than quasars . \n in fact we see a remarkable spread of spectral indices for both classes of objects when individual viewing periods are considered . but \n this concerns individual sources . \n the spectrum of the average in both object classes is different , and therefore they contribute with different spectral characteristic to the diffuse @xmath0-ray background . \n the average spectrum of all agn is dominated by that of the quasars and it differs with 2.7@xmath2 significance from that of the observed diffuse extragalactic background ( kniffen et al . \n 1997 ) which is similar to the average bl lac intensity spectrum . \n interestingly , the bl lac s have on average a much smaller redshift with values between 0.031 and 0.94 , while more than 50% of the objects in the quasar and ovv class have redshifts in excess of 1.0 . \n this indicates that in case of quasars we observe a fair range of the luminosity function directly , in contrast to the bl lac case where we see only the tip of the iceberg . in other words , we expect the @xmath0-ray @xmath3 distribution of bl lac s to peak at lower @xmath0-ray fluxes than that of quasars and ovv s . as a result \n the contribution of bl lac s to the diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background may be strong despite the small number of directly observed objects . \n hence it may be that bl lac s provide the bulk of the @xmath0-ray background . \n a large fraction of agn is variable at @xmath0-ray energies . \n any cut - off arising from opacity effects will be more prominent at high flux levels since then the intrinsic photon density of the source is high . \n we have therefore chosen a subsample of agn for which at least a moderate level of variability can be found . in total \n we are left with 26 quasars and ovv s and only 6 bl lac s . \n the analysis is now similar to that described in the previous section except that the spectra are not derived on the basis of the summed data of phases 1 - 3 but only on data of the viewing periods in which the sources showed the highest flux levels . \n there is not very much change compared to the average behaviour in case of bl lac s . \n one has to keep in mind that we are now left with 6 objects and the statistic is not sufficient to distinguish general trends from pathological individuals . \n the behaviour of quasars and ovv s during their peak phase is more interesting . at first \n we see that the flare spectra are harder than the time - average , at least up to a few gev . \n this is a confirmation of a claim by mcke et al . \n ( 1996 ) who found a hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectra with increasing flux level for 8 highly variable @xmath0-ray agn . \n we also see that at energies below 70 mev and at energies above 4 gev the peak spectra show some evidence of a cut - off . to get a better idea of the significance level of the cut - offs \n we have repeated the power - law fits for the peak phases of quasars and ovv s under the constraint that now the fit is based on the energy band of 70 mev to 4 gev and then extrapolated to calculate the true deviations in the outer energy bands . \n the result is shown in fig.1 . at energies below 70 mev \n there is a deficiency of intensity compared to power - law behaviour with total statistical significance of 3.6@xmath2 while at high energies above 4 gev we observe an intensity deficit with 2.5@xmath2 significance . \n this result is stable with respect to the choice of sources . \n we have omitted the sources which have less than 6@xmath2 significance at the time of flare and the outcome remains unchanged . \n we have also included secondary flares , i.e. viewing periods in which the sources have been either within 2@xmath2 of the peak or have been observed with @xmath4 above 100 mev , and again the result is unchanged . \n we have further tested the reliability of our method by monte - carlo simulations . \n these simulations would detect systematic problems in the analysis tools , which may arise from the small photon numbers both at low and at high @xmath0-ray energies . \n we did not detect significant systematic deviations from a gaussian distribution of the variable @xmath5 . even accounting for calibration uncertainties at low @xmath0-ray energies \n the statistical uncertainties are much larger than the systematical uncertainties so that the former are a fair measure of the total uncertainty . \n most quasars show a spectral break at mev energies . \n it is , however , questionable whether such an extended spectra turnover is sufficient to account for the observed deficit below 70 mev , which is a factor 10 higher in energy than the typical break energy . \n we prefer to interprete the result in the sense that the @xmath0-ray spectrum of quasars and ovv s is not a one component spectrum , but rather the superposition of different emission processes . \n simulations show that a low energy cut - off in the injection spectrum of radiating electrons can account for the observed behaviour ( bttcher and schlickeiser 1996 ) . \n the fact that we see this cut - off only at flare states , when photon densities are high , points at opacity effects as cause . in case of backscattered accretion disk photons \n the opacity will sharply increase at a few gev . \n if the efficiency of backscattering is high , which is probably the case for quasars and ovv s , the optical depth will exceed unity and a cut - off will result . \n however , correlations between optical depth and the flux at a few 100 mev will occur only when the @xmath0-ray outburst is caused by an increased flux of target photons . \n one may also think of photon - photon pair production on the high energy end of the self produced synchrotron spectrum . here \n a correlation with the flux level can be naturally explained . \n simulations show that at least in simple geometries the synchrotron - self - compton component tends to swamp the high energy end of the synchrotron spectrum ( bttcher , pohl and schlickeiser , in prep . ) , so that there is no natural reason to let this effect become important at a few gev @xmath0-ray energy . \n bttcher m. , schlickeiser r. : 1996 , , 306 , 86 kniffen d.a . \n et al . : 1997 , , in press mcke a. et al . : 1996 , proceedings of iau symp . \n 175 , kluwer , dordrecht , p.285 punch m. et al . : 1992 , nature , 358 , 477", "StartTimeOffset": 2079247877694, "RequestID": "abd7d23f3f491417678ded17183ba7c3745570ec", "TotalTokens": 2220}
{"ContextTokens": 3148, "GeneratedTokens": 246, "SynthesizedBody": "after the discovery of the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) , that fills the universe as a sea of photons , with a mean temperature of 2.7 k at present epoch , greisen @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite independently pointed out that the mbr would make the universe opaque to uhecr particles with energies approximately @xmath1 ev and above . this hypothesis is well accepted and is known as the gzk cutoff . \n so far , observational data of several experiments about uhecr have report events with energies beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite . \n in addition , the present data show strong discrepancies in the uhecr energy spectrum . on one side , \n the agasa ( extensive air shower ) experiment claims a spectrum beyond the gzk cutoff , without any evidence of the gzk cutoff , on the other side the hires ( air fluorescence ) experiment is in agreement with the expected universal distribution of sources and showing the gzk cutoff in the energy spectrum . \n this means at least that there is a systematic error , probably in the energy determination , in one of the experiments . \n however , this discrepancy can also be attributed to latitude effects , due to the limited coverage of the sky by experiments located in the northern hemisphere . \n so far only experiments with a full ( sugar experiment @xcite ) or partial ( agasa experiment @xcite ) coverage of the galactic central region have reported a cosmic ray excess in the energy region of approximately @xmath0 ev in the direction of the galactic center . \n the accumulating data from auger ( extensive air shower plus air fluorescence ) experiment @xcite , whose southern part is now in progress , on the basis of a larger data set will tell us which is the correct alternative in the near future .    in the past years \n , there are some surveys about a statistical correlation between uhecr events and compact sources at high redshift . depending on the data set , in some cases \n a positive correlation has been reported @xcite , but there are also negative results @xcite . \n the identification of compact objects like bl lac or quasars at high redshift as uhecr sources reinforces a cosmological origin , and has taken to formulate new scenarios such as the violation of the lorentz invariance @xcite as responsible for the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic ray with energies above the gzk cutoff . \n in addition to the top - down models @xcite , where the collapse or decay of super - massive particles like magnetic monopoles , superconducting strings , as well as the @xmath2 z burts @xcite inside a volume with a radius less than 50 mpc from the earth can explain the uhecr data above the gzk cutoff . \n the hypothesis that gamma ray burst ( grb ) might be responsible for the origin of uhecr has been suggest earlier @xcite . \n the grbs are probably the most powerfully events in the universe , and it is believed that protons can be accelerate in a grb by internal shocks taking place in a collimated jet direction . \n the grbs have been observed in spacecraft experiments as short flashes of gamma rays that outshine the rest of the entire gamma - ray sky at a rate of around one event per day @xcite , mostly in the energy band of kev to mev . \n the first measurements of the redshifts in grb afterglows @xcite , together with the highly isotropic distribution of their arrival directions , have established a cosmological origin for them . \n the association of grbs and uhecrs is further supported by the similarity of energy generation rates . \n the average rate of gamma - ray energy emitted by grbs is comparable to the energy generation rate of uhecrs . \n in addition , the almost isotropic distribution of the arrival directions of uhecr and grbs is also an ingredient in favor of an association between them . \n the main constraint on the association between grb and uhecr is that uhecr events above the gzk cutoff require only grbs inside a volume of radius less than 50 mpc from the earth can contribute to the uhecr flux . \n what is the expected rate of grbs in this volume \n ? a pessimistic answer on the basis of only cosmological origin to the grbs gives an estimative of about one grb per 100 years . on the other hand , from an optimistic point of view \n , statistical surveys have shown that it is not always possible to spectroscopically determine the red shift even in some long well located grbs accompanied by x - ray , optical and radio afterglow . \n a plausible explanation for these results is the assumption of a local origin . \n that is to say , they are close to our galaxy or inside it . \n around 70 percent of the observed grbs are the long - soft type with approximately 30 s duration . \n some of these bursts have their measured red shifts clustering in @xmath3 , consequently they have a cosmological origin and they are connected with supernovae events . there is also another category of grbs , the short - hard type with approximately 0.2 s duration , where no red shift and no afterglow have been detected from these bursts . \n probably these short bursts result from a different engine than long bursts , they could be connected with compact binary mergers , like two neutron stars or with a black hole component , as well as binary pulsar . \n they are expected at a high rate of @xmath4 per year in a galaxy like the milk way @xcite . \n these characteristics suggest the two component model ( tcm ) , galactic and extra - galactic for the origin of the grbs . \n another characteristic that strongly support the tcm for the grbs origin is their isotropic distribution of the arrival direction . \n they are regarded to have a uniform distribution in galactic coordinates . \n a more accurate analysis of the angular distribution of grb shows some deviations from a simple isotropic distribution @xcite . under certain assumptions such as an euclidean space and standard candle grbs , \n the formulation of the tcm is plausible . here \n we make an extension of these assumptions to the uhecr events . \n we point out here that a tcm for the uhecr is further supported by the experimental evidences of a uhecr particle excess around @xmath0 ev energies from the direction of the galactic central region . \n a consequence of the seeliger s theorem is the following . \n if sources are uniformly distributed in a spherical volume @xmath5 of radius @xmath6 , and have fixed brightness , then the flux @xmath7 obtained from a source is proportional to @xmath8 , while the number @xmath9 of sources observed down to a given flux limit is proportional to @xmath10 @xmath11 this relation has been observed in radioastronomy as the @xmath12 plot @xmath13 where @xmath14 provided that the sources are homogeneously distributed in an euclidian space . \n then , if a true deviation from this value eventually takes place , we will have the evidence that the space is non - euclidian or / and the sources are inhomogeneously distributed . \n the black line in fig.1 shows the @xmath12 plot obtained for the grbs on the basis of 2704 burst from batse catalog . \n we can see from this figure that a simple @xmath15 ( blue line ) does not fit the data . \n this means that the spatial distribution of grbs is not consistent with a homogeneous case . \n as already has been commented , a possible interpretation for this result is to invoke a non - euclidian space . \n however , another alternative is to introduce a second population of grbs with a gaussian distribution that reflects the radial distribution of matter in the galaxy and its surrounding halo . \n the fluencies of the observed grbs between @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xmath18 imply isotropic burst energies up to approximately @xmath19 erg . while taking beaming angle corrections of about 5 degrees into account , it is expected a narrow distribution around @xmath20 erg . here \n , we assume the same value as in @xcite that gives @xmath21 erg to the gaussian peak which corresponds to a mean flux of 2.8 . \n the best fit is obtained for an amplitude of about 7.5 percent of the first component and a r.m.s . \n value of 13.4 . in short , \n the tcm spatial burst distribution is given by the following cumulutive function @xmath22 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] _ _ _ _ the red line in fig.xx represent this function . \n under the assumption of an association between grbs and uhecr , the hypothesis of a second population of grbs of galactic origin implies also the existence of uhecr of galactic origin . due to the small statistics , especially in the energy region above the gzk cutoff , it is still not possible to mount the log n @xmath23 log s(e ) plot , only on the basis of uhecr data . \n consequently , we make a calibration to obtain the tcm uhecr distribution on the basis of the tcm grbs distribution . \n the detection of an excess of cosmic ray from the direction of the galactic center region observed by agasa and sugar in the energy range of @xmath0 ev opens the door to the possibility that uhecr above the gzk might be created also in our galaxy . \n we assume that the excess of cosmic ray from the direction of the galactic center in the energy range of @xmath0 ev corresponds to the peak of a gaussian distribution and represent the second population of the uhecr . \n this assumption permits us to make a calibration between the grb flux and the energy of the uhecr . \n the other parameters of this second population distribution of uhecr are the same as the grbs distribution . \n figure 2 summarizes the situation where the cumulative distributions for uhecr and for three different energies in the peak of the gaussian distribution are shown . \n it is possible to see that the contribution of the second population to the uhecr flux around the gzk cutoff is sensitive to the value of the gaussian peak . \n the comparison of the predictions of the tcm and the experimental data is shown in fig.3 . \n under the assumption that grbs might be responsible for the origin of uhecr , we have presented here an extension of the two component model of grbs ( galactic , and extra - galactic ) to explain the origin of uhecr . \n the inclusion of a local galactic source for the uhecr origin is further supported by the experimental evidences of an uhecr excess around @xmath0 ev from the direction of the galactic center region . \n this excess can be considered as the peak of a gaussian distribution of the second component and permits us to make a calibration among the grb flux and the uhecr energies . \n perhaps the main constraint to the tcm is , if the uhecr sources are close , why the arrival direction of the events does not point toward their sources ? \n so far , the uhecr distribution does not follow the galactic star distribution . \n this means that probably its surrounding diffuse halo and even the local distribution of galaxies can lodge uhecr sources . \n uhecr event rates beyond the gzk cutoff as observed by agasa experiment can be linked at least in part to grbs of short - hard type , because these grbs neither have afterglows nor redshift suggesting that some of these grbs sources are close to or inside of our galaxy . \n these results are in agreement with others surveys @xcite , showing that grbs with time duration below @xmath24 ms appear to form a separate class of grbs , because from their asymmetry plot the events appear to originate nearby within the galaxy . \n the short - hard grbs probably are formed for instance by coalescence of corotating binary neutron star systems . \n this process is dominated by a strong magnetic field . \n thus , magnetic deflections of the uhecr in the first stages of their propagation can be responsible of a arrival direction of events without pointing toward their sources . \n we are waiting for the next round of the auger experiment . certainly only after a large set of data that we can confirm or refute the tcm for the origin of uhecr . \n this work was partially supported by faperj ( the research fostering foundation of the state of rio de janeiro ) and cnpq ( the national council of research and development ) of brazil . \n k. greisen , phys rev . \n 16 , 748 ( 1966 ) . \n g. t. zapsepin and v. a. kuzmin , sov . \n phys .- jetp lett . \n 1966 , 4 , 78 n. hashida , phys . \n 73 , 3491 ( 1994 ) . \n d. j. bird et al . \n 71 , 3401 ( 1993 ) . \n lawrence , r. j. o. reid and a. watson , j. phys . \n 17 , 733 ( 1991 ) . \n r. clay , publ . \n 18 , 148 ( 2001 ) . \n n. hashida et al . , astrophys . \n j. 10 , 303 ( 1999 ) . \n j. w. cronin , nucl . \n b ( proc . suppl . ) 97 , 3 ( 2001 ) . \n s. l. dubovsky , p. g. tinyakov and i. i. tkachev , phys . \n 85 , 1154 ( 2000 ) . \n d. f. torres , s. reucroft , o. reimer and l. anchordoqui , astrophys . \n j. 595 , l13 ( 2003 ) . \n s. coleman and s. l. glashow , phys . \n d 59 , 116008 ( 1999 ) . c. t. hill , nucl . \n b 224 , 469 ( 1983 ) . \n d. fargion , b. mele , and a. salis , astrophys . \n j. 517 , 725 ( 1999 ) . \n e. waxman , phys . \n 75 , 386 ( 1995 ) . \n w. s. paciesas et al . , astrophys . \n js , 122 , 465 ( 1999 ) . \n e. costa , nature , 372 , 652 ( 1997 ) . \n v. kalogera et al . , astro -

{"ContextTokens": 3161, "GeneratedTokens": 247, "SynthesizedBody": "space - based coronagraphs have observed thousands of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) since their discovery in the early 1970s . \n the observations show that hundreds of cmes can attain speeds of 1000 km / sec or more within a few r@xmath0 which exceed the local alfvn speed at those heights . \n hence , fast cmes can drive shocks which are detected sometimes in the radio wavelengths as drifting type - ii bursts @xcite . \n such indirect observations , however , provide only limited information about the shock ; namely , the driver speed and , the onset and duration of the radio emission .    fortunately , direct imaging and spectroscopic measurements of the density compression at the shock front have been made possible in the last ten years thanks to the lasco coronagraphs and uvcs spectrometer , both instruments aboard the solar heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) . as we will explain , the combination of white light and uv observations can provide the full range of physical parameters ( density , temperature , magnetic field ) across the shock in addition to spatial information about the shock shape and its relation to the driving cme . \n now , the physics of coronal shocks can be studied in detail . \n the off - limb spectroscopy and coronagraphy are , and will be , our only means for studying shocks where they can accelerate particles with the highest energies ( @xmath1 r@xmath0 ) . \n even the forthcoming _ solar probe plus _ mission will only reach to 9.5 r@xmath0 . \n ( @xmath2 ) on 03/07 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) on 06/07 , respectively . \n several streamers are clearly deflected by the shock . \n some examples are denoted with dfl. for the june 6 cme , the driver can not be readily distinguished from the deflected streamers . ] \n because we have reviewed many aspects of coronagraphic imaging of cme shocks in a recent volume of this conference series @xcite , we present here only a brief overview of the progress made over the last two years . the early work on shock detection @xcite has motivated an ever expanding number of detections of cme - driven shocks @xcite . \n these works are based mostly on observations by the secchi instruments which have higher sensitivites than the lasco coronagraphs . \n the white light shocks can now be routinely detected in the inner corona , \n @xmath4 r@xmath0 @xcite , and can be followed out to at least 0.5 au @xcite . \n the secchi and radio observations show that shocks tend to form at 1.5 r@xmath0 and can accelerate electrons out to 4 @xmath5 @xcite . \n the standoff distance between the shock and the driver appears to be 1 - 2 r@xmath0 within the coronagraph field of view @xcite . \n clear white light shock signatures were rare during 2007 - 2010 due to the prolonged activity minimum but there have been several fast events since february 2011 . \n we present two recent examples in figs .  [ \n fig : secchi]-[fig : shock ] . \n the three viewpoints afforded by the secchi and lasco telescopes easily reveal the global reach of cme - driven shocks in the middle corona . \n measurements of the shock longitudinal extent allow us to localize with better precision the injection of solar energetic particles ( seps ) along magnetic field lines @xcite and connect it to the cme source region @xcite . \n shocks can be identified in uv spectra by means of heating , density compression and high speeds associated with them . the first spectral detection of a cme driven shock was made by uvcs in 2000 @xcite . \n the authors measured enhancements in the o@xmath6 and si@xmath7 that were consistent with an mhd shock . \n more than a dozen of shocks have been identified since @xcite . \n a review of plasma physical parameters derived by uvcs across shocks is given in table  [ tab : a ] . \n the plasma heating and compression across the shock lead typically to strong brightening of the si@xmath7 ( si  xii @xmath8521 ) line , brightening or dimming of the o@xmath6 ( o  vi @xmath91032 - 1037 ) lines and dimming of the h  i ly@xmath10 @xmath81216 line . \n these differences are related to the different physical processes involved in the atomic excitations , because coronal ions are mainly excited by both collisions with electrons ( collisional excitation ) and/or by resonant scattering of photons emitted from the underlying layers of the solar atmosphere ( radiative excitation ) ; the latter process is also related to the doppler dimming effect ( see * ?

? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * and fig . \n [ fig : uvcsshock ] , top right panel ) . \n fwhms of broad components typically correspond to post - shock o@xmath6 kinetic temperatures @xmath11k . \n .cme - driven shock parameters derived from uvcs data [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     there is a high degree of complementarity between the coronagraphic ( spatial distribution , speed of driver and shock ) and spectroscopic measurements ( pre- and post - shock plasma parameters ) . indeed , combined analyses of lasco and uvcs observations can obtain the full range of plasma parameters upstream and downstream of the shock , including the magnetic field in both regimes . \n the mhd rankine - hugoniot jump relations for an oblique shock provide not only the post - shock plasma parameters , but also the pre- and post - shock magnetic field strength when the pre - shock coronal plasma parameters , with the exception of the magnetic field , can be determined by spectroscopic measurements ( i.e. , electron density and temperature , pre - shock and shock velocity ) and the density compression ratio across the shock is determined by coronagraphic measurements . \n such results derived by @xcite are summarized in table [ tab : b ] . \n interestingly , the magnetic and kinetic energy density increases are nearly equal ( as expected for equipartition of energy ) , and are both more than two times larger than the thermal energy increase . \n this trailblazing study demonstrates the power behing off - limb spectroscopic observations when combined with coronagraphic cme images . \n in the short space of this article , we tried to demonstrate the ability of coronagraphic and spectroscopic instruments to remotely detect coronal shocks and measure their properties . despite a slow start during the 2000s , \n shocks are now detected and analyzed with increasing frequency . \n coronagraphs , especially the simultaneous observations from secchi and lasco , are capable of deriving the 3d structure of the shock , its standoff distance from the driver , its speed and even the density compression ratio across the shock boundary . \n but they do not measure magnetic field or temperature conditions . \n hence , coronagraphs can not directly discriminate between a shock or a fast mode wave since the observed density compression could be the same . \n however , shocks can now be followed to at least 0.5 au and possibly to earth thanks to recent imag processing developments @xcite . \n more details can be found in @xcite . \n the spectroscopic observations have both advantages and disadvantages compared to the obsevations in the radio or in the visible . on one hand , \n the narrow slits provide only one - dimensional spatial information and the results are quite sensitive to the orientation of the slit relative to the shock front \n . measurements of very fast shocks may also be compromised due to the relatively long integrations for the uvcs spectra ( @xmath12 s ) . \n spectroscopic detection of coronal shocks occurs only by chance , because the field of view of the 40 \n long uvcs slit covers only a limited latitudinal region ( e.g. 75@xmath13 when the slit is positioned at 1.7 r@xmath0 ) . on the other hand , \n spectral measurements are the only means to study the heating of individual ion species and electrons in the collisionless coronal shocks . \n measurement of physical properties in cme - driven shocks and their correlations with sep events will be very useful in establishing the necessary conditions for shocks to accelerate ambient solar wind or suprathermal ions to seps . \n fortunately , off - limb spectroscopic capability will be offered by the forthcoming _ solar orbiter _ \n mission with the metis ( multi - element telescope for imaging and spectroscopy ; see * ? ? ? \n * ) instrument , that will acquire simultaneously off - limb spectra at three heights , thus helping us to disentangle spatial and temporal evolution of plasma parameters across shocks . \n part of this work was funded by various nasa grants . \n soho is an international collaboration between nasa and esa . \n lasco was constructed by a consortium of institutions : nrl ( washington , dc , usa ) , mps ( katlenburg- lindau , germany ) , lam ( marseille , france ) and univ.of birmingham ( birmingham , uk ) . \n the secchi data are produced by an international consortium of the nrl , lmsal and nasa gsfc ( usa ) , ral and univ . \n bham ( uk ) , mps ( germany ) , csl ( belgium ) , iota and ias ( france ) . \n e. antonucci , _ mem . \n s.a.it._ , * 82 * , 412419 ( 2011 ) a. bemporad , & s. mancuso , _ astroph . j. _ , \n * 720 * , 130143 ( 2010 ) a. ciaravella , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 621 * , 11211128 ( 2005 ) a. ciaravella , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 652 * , 774792 ( 2006 ) c. deforest et  al . , arxiv:1104.1615 ( 2011 ) n. gopalswamy , et  al . , _ j. geoph . \n _ , * 110 * , a9 , a09s15 ( 2005 ) n. gopalswamy , et  al . \n _ , * 259 * , 227254 ( 2009 ) n. gopalswamy & s. yashiro , _ astrophys . j. _ , * 736 * , l17 ( 2011 ) s.  w. kahler , et  al . \n , _ solar wind nine aip conf . \n _ , * 471 * , 685 - 688 ( 1999 ) k.  e. korreck , et  al . \n , _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 659 * , 773 - 779 ( 2007 ) l.  c. lee , et  al . \n , _ geophys . \n _ , * 13 * , 209 ( 1986 ) s. mancuso , s. , et  al . , _ astron . astrophys . _ , * 383 * , 267274 ( 2002 ) s. mancuso , & d. avetta , _ astroph . j. _ , * 677 * , 683691 ( 2008 ) s. mancuso , & a. bemporad , _ adv . \n _ , * 44 * , 451456 ( 2009 ) s. mancuso , _ sol . \n _ , * 96 * ( 2011 ) s.  a. maloney , & p.  t. gallagher , arxiv:1106.1593 ( 2011 ) g.  noci , _ astrophy . \n j _ , * 315 * , 706715 ( 1987 ) v.  ontiveros , & a.  vourlidas , _ astrophy . j _ , * 693 * , 267275 ( 2009 ) n .- e . \n raouafi , et  al . \n , _ astron . \n _ , * 424 * , 10391048 ( 2004 ) j.  c. raymond , et  al . _ \n . j. lett . \n _ , * 27 * , 14391442 ( 2000 ) a.  p. rouillard , et  al . \n _ astroph . \n j. _ , * 735 * , 718 ( 2011 ) m. temmer , et  al . \n _ , * 75 * ( 2011 ) a. thernisien , a. vourlidas , & r. a. howard , _ sol . \n phys._,*256 * , 111130 ( 2009 ) a.  vourlidas , et  al , _ astroph . j. _ , * 598 * , 13921402 ( 2003 ) a.  vourlidas , & v. ontiveros , `` a review of coronagraphic observations of shocks driven by coronal mass ejections '' , in _ shock waves in space and astrophysical environments _ , aip conference proceedings , * 1183 * , 2009 , pp . 139146", "StartTimeOffset": 2096536207500, "RequestID": "a44ddf855bab231035ad6e82b7edb1e8fe88ae26", "TotalTokens": 3408}
{"ContextTokens": 3526, "GeneratedTokens": 114, "SynthesizedBody": "the predictive power of qcd lies in the factorization theorem . in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) \n factorization in short and long distance parts allows us to describe the observed hadrons as a convolution of the partonic processes with non - perturbative parton densities and fragmentation functions @xcite . \n single meson production in electron proton scattering @xmath0 occurs partonically already in the absence of strong interactions ( @xmath1 ) , where one parton of the proton ( a quark ) interacts with the leptonic current and fragments into a meson ( @xmath2 ) ( naive parton model ) . \n + since we are interested in perturbative qcd effects we require the meson to carry a non - vanishing transversal momentum with respect to the centre - of - mass frame of virtual vector boson coming from the electron and initial proton ( @xmath3 ) . \n thus at partonic level at least two final state partons are required to balance the transversal momentum . \n the leading order processes with non - vanishing transversal momentum of a fragmenting parton into a meson ( @xmath4 ) are    1 . \n @xmath5 2 . \n @xmath6 ,    where the virtual photon originates from the electron current . \n if the virtuality of the photon @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is not too large compared to the squared z - mass , the contribution from z boson exchange is suppressed and may be neglected . \n dealing then with c - invariant processes we do not have to calculate separately the processes with interchanged quarks and antiquarks . \n factorization , proven generally for dis processes @xcite , describes the events as a convolution of the hard scattering processes with parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n the investigation of single hadron production is interesting for several reasons : first of all it is a test of perturbative qcd and factorization . \n the predictions depend beside the perturbative partonic calculation essentially on universal parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n especially fragmentation functions , fitted to electron positron annihilation data , may be tested , in particular their universality . \n further , the predictions allow for a direct comparison with experimental data , in particular there is no need to use any kind of monte carlo procedure . \n thus we may expect very meaningful results . \n the predictions are due to process ( b ) directly sensitive to the gluon density in the proton and may allow us to draw conclusions concerning the gluon density in the proton . from the experimental side \n precise data are available from the hera collider at desy . for instance \n @xmath9 mesons were measured in the forward region ( with small angles with respect to the proton remnant ) based on events detected in the h1 detector @xcite and charged hadrons were measured at the zeus experiment @xcite .    in 1978 the process ( [ eqep ] ) with non - vanishing transversal momentum of the hadron ( @xmath10 ) was calculated by mndez @xcite at tree level accuracy ( @xmath4 ) . since qcd corrections are typically large and we are confronted with precise experimental data it is desirable to compare these data with predictions of at least next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ( @xmath11 ) accuracy . also nlo - qcd predictions were computed with the assumption of purely transversal photons , neglecting the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the exchanged virtual photon @xcite .    here \n we present a nlo - qcd calculation based on the dipole subtraction formalism @xcite . \n in contrast to the more conventional phase space slicing method there is no need to introduce any unphysical parameter to cut the phase space in soft , respectively collinear regions . also \n all cancellations of infrared singularities occur before any numerical phase space integration is performed . \n thus we may present numerically very stable predictions . \n the differential cross section for process ( [ eqep ] ) reads as a convolution with the parton densities and fragmentation functions as @xmath12 where , as usual , the variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with respect to the partonic momenta and the bar quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with respect to the momenta of the hadrons ( with @xmath22 ) . \n the angle @xmath23 denotes the azimuthal angle between the planes defined on one hand by the directions of the leptons and on the other hand by the momenta of final state hadron and virtual vector boson in the centre - of - mass frame of vector boson and initial parton . \n the sum is over the different initial ( @xmath24 ) and final ( @xmath25 ) state partons and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the corresponding parton density respectively fragmentation function . \n the hard scattering process may be written as a contraction of a lepton tensor ( @xmath28 ) with a hadron tensor ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 if we consider the centre - of - mass system of virtual photon and initial parton , both unpolarized , there can not be any dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath23 . integrating out this angle dependence we find a decomposition into a transversal and a longitudinal part of the virtual photon : \n @xmath31 the computation of the correction to process ( [ eqep ] ) were carried out in the subtraction formalism  @xcite . \n the general idea of the subtraction formalism is to subtract from the real correction an artificial counterterm which has the same pointwise singular behaviour in @xmath32 dimensions as the real correction itself . \n thus the limit @xmath33 can be performed and the real phase space integral can be evaluated numerically . \n the artificial counterterm is constructed in a way that it also can be integrated over the one - parton subspace analytically leading to @xmath34  poles . adding these terms to the virtual part of the correction these poles cancel all singularities in the virtual part analytically and the remaining integration over the phase space \n can be carried out numerically . \n the advantage compared to phase space slicing methods is that all singularities cancel _ before _ any numerical integration is performed . \n also there is no need to introduce an unphysical cut parameter which in phase space slicing methods separates soft , respectively collinear phase space regions from the remaining hard region .    in our case of a convolution of a partonic cross section with distribution functions \n additional kinematic constraints have to be taken into account . \n the momenta of the partons which enter the convolution have to be kept fixed ( called _ identified _ partons ) . \n this leads to modified artificial counterterms . \n its analytical integration gives collinear singularities which cancel the singularities of the non - perturbative distribution functions yielding scheme and scale dependent convergent parts . \n the whole calculation was done with help of the algebra package form  @xcite . at @xmath11 \n the real correction is given by the squared matrix elements of the diagrams    1 . \n @xmath35 2 . \n @xmath36 3 . \n @xmath37 ,    where in turn each final state parton serves as an observed hadron . in process ( c ) \n we have to consider two flavours in the fermion traces . \n this yields 4 diagrams for every pair of different flavours in contrast to 8 diagrams in the case of one uniform flavour . \n care must be taken to adjust statistical factors properly . \n the artificial counterterm was constructed as described by the subtraction formalism . \n the phase space integral over the 3 particle final state can be performed yielding a finite real contribution . \n the virtual contribution of the correction , i.e. the interference term of the born matrix elements and the one - loop matrix elements are computed . here \n we encounter 2-point , 3-point , and 4-point tensor integral contributions which were reduced to scalar integrals via tensor reduction @xcite . \n the scalar integrals , containing ultraviolet and infrared singularities , were computed analytically in dimensional regularization . \n the analytic expressions were compared with the literature @xcite . \n the virtual contribution was renormalized in a mixed scheme , where the wave functions were renormalized on - shell and the strong coupling constant in the @xmath38  scheme , yielding an ultraviolet finite virtual contribution . \n the infrared singularities cancel exactly the contributions given by the integrated artificial counterterm in the subtraction formalism .    from the subtraction of remaining singularities into the parton densities and the fragmentation functions we obtain also finite remainders which depend on the factorization scheme and on the factorization scale . \n in this context we choose the @xmath38  scheme . \n thus we end up with three contributions , the real part , the virtual part , and the part related to identified partons . \n all these finite parts have to be integrated over the 2 respectively 3 particle final state phase space . to this purpose \n a c - routine was written to perform these integrations numerically . \n in the convolution ( [ eqconv ] ) we use the parton densities published by the cteq collaboration @xcite . \n herein the parton distribution set , called cteq5 m , where m denotes the @xmath38 scheme , matches our conditions with the assumption of 5 light quarks . \n we adopt the kkp fragmentation functions to our calculation @xcite . \n since these fragmentation functions are fitted to @xmath39 data with high accuracy and applied here to a dis process the comparison with experimental data will serve as a good check of universality . \n we use the value of the strong coupling constant at the @xmath40-scale as given by the particle data group  @xcite @xmath41 and evolve this value with the nlo evolution equation . in the lo approximation \n we evolve this value with the lo evolution equation for consistency reasons .    in fig . \n [ diffcross ] we show the differential cross section @xmath42 as a function of @xmath10 for fixed values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  gev@xmath47 , where @xmath10 is defined in the centre - of - mass frame of vector boson and initial parton . \n we set the renormalization scale ( @xmath48 ) equal to both the initial ( @xmath49 ) and the final ( @xmath50 ) fragmentation scales @xmath51 , where the initial scale is related to the parton densities and the final scale to the fragmentation functions . \n the steep fall of the cross section over several orders of magnitude makes it hard to resolve the nlo contribution ( full line ) in contrast to the lo prediction ( dashed line ) graphically . \n the lower part of the figure shows the ratio of the nlo correction over the lo result and displays more clearly the higher order effects . \n the correction changes from @xmath52  % for small @xmath10 to @xmath53  % for large @xmath10 . for @xmath54 \n gev we get an even larger correction due to collinear configurations .     for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev@xmath47 . \n the lower part shows the corresponding k - factor @xmath55 of the differential cross sections at nlo and lo.,width=302 ]    the theoretical uncertainty of the predictions of a fixed order calculation is mainly given by the renormalization and fragmentation scale dependence . \n the theoretical uncertainties due to the parton densities and fragmentation functions are not considered here . \n another source of uncertainty lies in the factorization theorem itself since it predicts correct results with an error of @xmath56 which may be become large for very low @xmath10 . \n we check the scale dependence of the cross section for the kinematics already depicted in context with fig . \n [ diffcross ] but with a fixed transversal hadron momentum of @xmath57  gev . in fig . \n [ scaledependence ] the differential cross section is shown where we vary the common scale @xmath58 over two orders of magnitude with respect to the reference scale @xmath59 . \n the scale dependence varies in this range about + 33  % ( + 27  % ) for very low scales to -20  % ( -18  % ) for rather high scales at lo ( nlo ) . \n thus there is only an unexpectedly slight scale dependence reduction at nlo compared to lo .    , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46  gev@xmath47 and a fixed @xmath57  gev . \n the scale @xmath60 is varied with respect to the reference scale @xmath61  gev@xmath47.,width=302 ] \n the calculation of single hadron production in deep inelastic scattering to @xmath11 was presented . owing to the factorization theorem this calculation \n was performed as a convolution of the hard scattering process with universal and process independent parton densities and fragmentation functions . \n this allows for meaningful predictions , directly comparable to experimental data .    results were shown for specific kinematic values . \n a correction of the order of several percent is predicted depending on the transversal momentum of the observed hadron . \n the scale dependence of the correction gives slightly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to lo predictions . \n varying the renormalization and factorization scales over two orders of magnitude yield theoretical uncertainties of about @xmath62  % at nlo . \n an extensive study of nlo effects will be published elsewhere which in particular will include a detailed comparison of predictions with experimental data from the hera experiments h1 and zeus . \n just after finishing the calculation , a preprint appeared on nlo calculations of hadron production with non - vanishing transversal momentum @xcite . in this paper matrix elements \n were adopted from the disent program package and the phase space slicing method was applied to handle singularities . \n thanks to gustav  kramer and bernd  a.  kniehl for proposing this project and collaboration . \n we are very grateful to michael klasen and dominik stckinger for many helpful discussions on the calculation . \n we want to thank michael spira for his advises to apply the subtraction formalism in the rather involved case of _ identified _ partons . for comments on the manuscript \n we thank ingo schienbein . \n j.  c.  collins , d.  e.  soper and g.  sterman , adv . \n high energy phys .   * 5 * ( 1988 ) 1 . c.  adloff \n _ et al . _ \n [ h1 collaboration ] , phys . \n b * 462 * ( 1999 ) 440 m.  derrick _ et al . \n _ [ zeus collaboration ] , z.  phys . \n c * 70 * ( 1996 ) 1 a.  mendez , nucl . \n b * 145 * ( 1978 ) 199 . \n p.  bttner , `` inklusive meson -

{"ContextTokens": 4049, "GeneratedTokens": 209, "SynthesizedBody": "since before the discovery of the first transiting extrasolar planet @xcite , it has been recognized that transits provide a sensitive way to infer the existence of small bodies orbiting other stars @xcite . \n there are now dozens of ground - based photometric searches underway that aim to detect planets of distant stars by means of their photometric signatures @xcite , as well as several space projects with the same purpose @xcite .    until now , \n the only confirmed planet detections by transits @xcite have been based on the ogle survey @xcite , which is performed with a telescope of 1.3 m aperture . \n the strategy of using a moderate - aperture telescope with seeing - limited spatial resolution must be commended for its obvious successes , and moreover because the 3 ogle planets are peculiar , having the shortest orbital periods yet known . but surveys using large telescopes suffer from the faintness of the stars with which they deal ( the @xmath5 magnitudes of the ogle planet host stars range from 14.4 to 15.7 ) . for such faint stars , the necessary follow - up \n observations are difficult and time - consuming , and the precision with which planetary parameters such as mass and radius can be determined is compromised .    for these reasons , \n we have pursued a transiting planet search organized along different lines \n one that uses small - aperture , wide - field telescopes to search for transits among brighter stars . \n the principal challenges facing wide - field surveys such as ours are to attain adequate photometric precision in the face of spatially varying atmospheric extinction and instrumental effects . and , as in all planet - search surveys \n , we must implement efficient methods for rejecting the many false alarms that appear in the photometric light curves . \n these false alarms result almost entirely from eclipsing systems involving 2 or more stars , including grazing eclipsing binaries , small stars transiting large ones , and eclipsing binaries diluted by the light of a third star . for bright - star searches \n , these imposters can outnumber true planetary transits by an order of magnitude @xcite . \n because of the diverse nature of the false alarm sources , several kinds of follow - up observations are needed to reject them all @xcite . \n we report here the first transiting extrasolar planet to be detected by such a wide - field , bright - star survey . \n we also describe the confirmation process in some detail , as an illustration of the necessary steps in verifying that transits are caused by an object of planetary and not stellar mass . \n our initial photometric observations leading to the detection of a planetary transit signature were conducted using the 3 telescopes of the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey ( tres ) network . \n these telescopes ( stare , located on tenerife in the canary islands , psst , located at lowell observatory , arizona , and sleuth , located at mt . \n palomar , california)ftod / sleuth.html ] are being described individually elsewhere @xcite . \n briefly , all 3 are small - aperture ( 10 cm ) , wide - field ( 6@xmath6 ) , ccd - based systems with spatial resolution of about 11@xmath7 per pixel . \n they usually observe in red light ( roughly johnson @xmath8 for stare and psst , sloan @xmath9 for sleuth ) , and they operate in coordination , observing the same field in the sky continuously ( or as nearly as possible ) for typically 2-month intervals . \n the observing cadence at each site is roughly one image every 2 minutes , and the resulting time series are later binned to 9-minute time resolution . \n recent adoption of an image - subtraction algorithm ( based on @xcite ) yields photometric precision of better than 2 mmag for the brightest non - saturating stars ( @xmath10 ) , and better than 10 mmag for @xmath11 . \n we designate the planet described herein as tres-1 , the first confirmed planet detected using the tres network ; we refer to the parent star by the same name , since the distinction between planet and star will be clear from context . \n the star s coordinates , observed characteristics , and index numbers from various full - sky catalogs are given in table 1 . \n the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values come from differential photometry relative to 32 stars with @xmath14 and @xmath12 data in simbad ; @xmath15 was obtained from observations of landolt s standards @xcite , and the @xmath16 values are from the 2mass catalog . \n the field containing this star was observed by 2 sites ( stare and psst ) during the summer of 2003 , with stare obtaining 49 good nights of observations and psst 25 . \n the sleuth telescope was still under development at that time , and so did not observe this field . \n the top panel of figure 1 shows the near - transit portion of the light curve of tres-1 , folded with a period of 3.030065 days . this curve is a superposition of 4 full transits and 2 partial ones , all observed with the stare telescope . \n even though the psst telescope obtained 25 nights of good observations on the field , it observed no transits of tres-1 in 2003 . \n this circumstance arose because the orbital period is very nearly an integral number of days , so that for long intervals , transits can be observed only from certain longitudes on the earth . \n although data from psst played no role in detecting the transits , its data proved essential for a correct determination of the orbital period : we rejected several candidate periods because they implied transit events that were not seen from the western us . \n tres-1 is thus a graphic demonstration of the utility of a longitude - distributed network of transit - detection telescopes . \n the @xmath8-band transit seen by tres has a flat - bottomed shape , a depth of 0.023 mag , and a total duration of about 3 hr . \n these characteristics are consistent with expectations for a jupiter - sized planet crossing a cool dwarf star , but both experience @xcite and theory @xcite show that they are more likely to result from an eclipsing stellar system . \n multiple star systems , in which the eclipsing binary component contributes only a small fraction of the total light , are particularly insidious . \n thus , tres-1 was one of 16 stars that displayed transit - like events among the 12000 stars we monitored in its surrounding field . \n we therefore began an extensive program of observations with larger telescopes , to determine whether the eclipses actually result from a body of planetary mass .    from table 1 \n , the @xmath17 color of 0.48 suggests a star with spectral type of late g or early k. digitized sky survey images show no bright neighbors within the 20@xmath7 radius of a stare stellar image , and adaptive - optics @xmath18- and @xmath19-band imaging with the william herschel telescope showed no companion within 2 mag in brightness , farther than 0.3@xmath7 from the primary star . with its observed @xmath12 magnitude of 11.79 , and ignoring interstellar extinction , the implied distance to tres-1 is about 150 pc . \n combining this distance with the usno - b1.0 proper motion of 47 mas y@xmath20 @xcite gives a transverse velocity of 26 km s@xmath20 , which is fairly typical for low - mass field stars in the solar neighborhood . \n thus , the photometric and astrometric evidence tends to confirm that most of the detected light comes from a nearby dwarf star . \n we observed the star using the cfa digital speedometers @xcite at 7 different epochs , giving coverage of the full orbital phase . \n these instruments record 4.5 nm of spectrum centered on the mg b lines , with spectral resolution of about 8.5  km  s@xmath20 . \n for the 7 exposures spanning 60 days we determined a mean velocity of @xmath2120.52 km  s@xmath20 . the average internal error estimate and actual velocity rms achieved were both 0.39 km s@xmath20 , suggesting that any companion orbiting with a 3.03-day period must have a mass smaller than 5 @xmath22 . \n this conclusion is not firm , however , if there is blending light from a third component . from comparisons of our observed spectra with synthetic spectra calculated by j. morse using kurucz models ( morse & kurucz , private communication ) , we estimate that tres-1 has @xmath23 k , @xmath24 , @xmath25 km s@xmath20 , and metallicity similar to that of the sun . \n the slow rotation is particularly significant , for several reasons : it indicates that the star has not been spun up by tidal interactions with a massive secondary , it forecloses some blending scenarios , and it means that more precise radial velocity measurements can be obtained fairly readily . \n we also obtained a moderate resolution echelle spectrum covering the entire visible wavelength range , using the palomar 1.5 m telescope . based on the comparison of this spectrum with the spectral standards of @xcite \n , we classify the star as k0v ; it shows no sign of a composite spectrum nor of other peculiarities . \n many multiple - star configurations involve components with different colors , which cause the blended eclipses to have color - dependent depths . \n moreover , the detailed shape of eclipse light curves provides two independent estimates of the secondary s size , relative to that of the primary star . \n one of these estimates comes from the eclipse depth , and the other from the duration of the eclipse s ingress and egress portions @xcite . \n consistency between these estimates is an indication that blending with light from a third star is not important . \n we therefore obtained multicolor photometric observations of several transits , using larger telescopes and a variety of filters . at the iac 80-cm telescope \n , we observed a partial transit ( missing the egress ) with johnson @xmath12 and @xmath5 filters ; at the university of colorado sommers - bausch observatory 61-cm telescope , we observed a full transit with johnson @xmath14 and @xmath8 filters ; at the cfa s fred l. whipple observatory 1.2-m telescope , we observed one full and one partial transit with sloan @xmath26 , @xmath9 , and @xmath27 filters . \n the psst telescope also observed 4 transits in @xmath8 during the 2004 season . \n -4pt figure 1 displays all of these observations , along with a fit to a model , which we shall discuss below . \n the light curves show no evidence for color dependence of the transit depth ( beyond that expected from color - dependent stellar limb darkening ) , and both the transit depth and the short ingress / egress times are consistent with transits by an object whose radius is a small fraction ( less than about 0.15 ) of the primary star s radius . \n detailed modeling of the light curves following @xcite was carried out in an attempt to explain the observations as the result of blending with an eclipsing binary . \n we found all plausible fits to be inconsistent with constraints from the cfa spectroscopy . we conclude that tres-1 is not significantly blended with the light of another star .    on \n the strength of the foregoing analysis we obtained precise radial velocity measurements using the i@xmath28 absorption cell and hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope . \n eight observations were collected over a period of 18 days in july 2004 , providing good coverage of critical phases . \n the data reduction involved modeling of the temporal and spatial variations of the instrumental profile of the spectrograph @xcite , and is conceptually similar to that described by @xcite . \n internal errors were computed from the scatter of the velocities from the echelle orders containing i@xmath28 lines , and are typically 10 - 15 m s@xmath20 . \n figure 2 shows the radial velocity measurements , along with a fit to a sinusoidal variation that is constrained to have the period and phase determined from the photometric data . \n this constrained fit matches the data well , and yields a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath29 m s@xmath20 . \n the rms residual of the fit is 14 m s@xmath20 , in good agreement with the average of the internal errors . \n examination of the spectral line profiles in our keck spectra by means of the bisector spans @xcite indicated no significant asymmetries and no correlation with orbital phase , once again ruling out a blend . \n for purposes of an initial estimate of the planetary mass and radius , we assumed tres-1 to have @xmath30k and solar metallicity . by comparing with the accurately - known mass and radius of @xmath31 cen b , which has a similar @xmath32 but probably higher metallicity @xcite , and correcting for the assumed metallicity difference of @xmath33}=-0.2 $ ] using evolutionary models by @xcite \n , we estimate a stellar mass @xmath34 and a radius @xmath35 . \n we took limb darkening relations from @xcite and from claret ( private communication ) , for models with solar metallicity , @xmath36 , and @xmath30 k. we assign ( somewhat arbitrarily ) an uncertainty of @xmath37 to @xmath38 . \n we also take @xmath39 , since adequate fits to the photometry can not be obtained for stellar radii outside this range .    using the approximate orbital period and the constraints and assumptions just described \n , we estimated the orbital semimajor axis @xmath40 and planetary mass @xmath41 from the observed stellar reflex velocity and kepler s laws . \n we then performed a minimum-@xmath42 fit to all of the photometry ( with errors estimated from the internal scatter of the input data , taken when possible from the out - of - transit data only ) , to obtain estimates for the planetary radius @xmath43 and orbital inclination @xmath44 , and refined estimates for the epoch of transit center @xmath45 and for the orbital period @xmath46 . \n our best estimates of the planet s orbital and physical parameters are given in table 2 , and the solid curves in figs 1 and 2 show the fitted photometric and radial velocity variations overplotted on the data .    the error estimates given in table 2 include errors that follow from our uncertainty in the radius and mass of the parent star ( which is assumed to be a main - sequence object ) , as indicated in table 1 . \n these uncertainties ( especially in @xmath47 ) dominate errors in the photometry as regards estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . \n if the stellar radius and mass were known accurately , the uncertainties in @xmath43 and in @xmath44 would be smaller by about a factor of 10 . \n contrariwise , if the star is actually a subgiant ( photometric constraints notwithstanding ) , @xmath43 could exceed the upper limit in table 2 . \n the error in @xmath41 arises about equally from the radial velocity measurement precision and from our uncertainty in @xmath38 . \n the mass , orbital radius , and radiative equilibrium temperature of tres-1 are quite similar to those of hd 209458b , yet the former planet s radius is about 20% smaller . indeed , \n as shown in figure 3 , the radius of tres-1 is more similar to those of the ogle planets , and it closely matches current models for irradiated planets without internal energy sources @xcite . \n this discrepancy between the radii of hd 209458b and tres-1 reinforces suspicion that hd 209458b has an anomalously large radius . \n the confrontation between theory and observation for this object would be facilitated if the stellar radius and ( to a lesser degree ) mass could be better constrained . \n we are undertaking a careful study of the keck spectra of tres-1 , and we will report improved estimates of the stellar parameters derived from them in a later paper . in the long run , however , a better approach is to obtain improved observations . with spaceborne photometry , one can achieve low enough noise to fit for both the planetary and the stellar radius @xcite . \n though one still requires a guess for @xmath38 , the derived planetary properties are much less sensitive to this parameter than they are to @xmath47 . \n similarly , an accurate parallax measurement would imply a useful constraint on @xmath47 . \n thus , tres-1 may be an attractive target for either ground- or space - based interferometric astrometry , since it is relatively bright ( @xmath48 ) , and it has several neighbors of similar brightness within a radius of a few arcminutes . \n we thank the students and staff of many observatories for their assistance in obtaining the data needed for this study . at flwo \n , we thank perry berlind , mike calkins , and gil esquerdo . at the oak ridge observatory , joe caruso , robert davis , and joe zajac . at izaa \n / tenerife , cristina abajas , luis chinarro , cristina daz , sergio fernndez , santiago lpez , and antonio pimienta . at sbo , christine predaina , lesley cook , adam ceranski , keith gleason , and john stocke . \n we also thank a. claret for computing limb -

{"ContextTokens": 4084, "GeneratedTokens": 121, "SynthesizedBody": "despite steady successes in fabrication and measurement techniques , the experimental characterization of multi - qubit systems @xcite remains a challenge due to their complicated level structure . \n our goal here is to determine the system s _ parameters _ , as distinct from the more difficult problem of determining its _ state _ , which has to be tackled using quantum state tomography @xcite . \n for example , neither the strength nor the sign of the qubit - qubit coupling are known a priori . \n one of several standard approaches studies the resonant response of quantum macroscopic systems to an external coherent signal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , allowing to determine the qubit parameters by scanning the frequency range of the external signal . \n the difficulty in the straightforward application of this approach , due to the fact that only few qubits can be actually accessed , and the relation of this problem to the general field of inverse problems , were addressed in @xcite . \n an alternative approach to the standard spectroscopic methods of characterization would use as a drive a broad - band noise . \n we call it _ active noise spectroscopy _ , as distinct from the  passive \" noise spectroscopy of ref . \n @xcite , where the response of the noise spectrum to a _ coherent monochromatic _ drive was measured . \n recently , we have shown @xcite that classical noise applied to a qubit produces persistent oscillations of the off - diagonal density matrix elements (  coherences \" ) despite finite dephasing and relaxation times . \n in other words , a moderate amount of external noise _ enhances _ quantum coherence , which manifests in oscillations with a frequency corresponding to quantum transitions between the ground and first excited states . \n there exists an optimal noise amplitude : at lower noise level , oscillations are suppressed , while as the noise is increased , the oscillations become random and the corresponding spectroscopic peak is eventually smeared away . indeed , for zero noise , the oscillations of the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix decay on the time scale of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dephasing rate . \n moderate phase - insensitive noise excites the system from time to time , allowing the qubit to evolve with its own frequency between the relatively rare noise spikes , thus , uncovering quantum dynamics . \n strong noise produces strong spikes very often , thus leaving no time for the coherent evolution . \n this phenomenon is related to both classical and quantum stochastic resonances , which manifest in various physical systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper \n we investigate how these effects of classical noise can help determine the parameters of a multiqubit system . \n specifically , we consider two coupled qubits and analyze the spectrum of the density matrix excited by white gaussian classical noise . \n we numerically show that the resulting noise spectra contain four peaks , which correspond to the interlevel transitions in the system . from these , the energy spectrum and all the model parameters of the qubits are readily obtained . \n in addition , the correlations in the matrix elements corresponding to different qubits can be used to conclude whether the qubits are coupled ferro- or antiferromagnetically . \n two coupled qubits can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 + g \\sigma^1_x\\sigma^2_x      \\label{eq - ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pauli matrices corresponding to either the first ( @xmath5 ) or the second ( @xmath6 ) qubits , and the eigenstates of @xmath3 are the basis states in the localized representation of the @xmath7th qubit at zero coupling . \n note that the results obtained below do not qualitatively depend on the type of coupling ( e.g. , @xmath8 versus @xmath9 ) : in any case the noise will allow to determine the parameters of the two - qubit hamiltonian . \n for this reason , and for demonstrating the physical principles of noise - induced spectroscopy , we consider two identical qubits . \n the tunneling splitting energies @xmath10 ( in case of the identical qubits we will be investigating here : @xmath11 ) are determined by the design and fabrication details of the device , while the bias energies @xmath12 can be controlled externally and , in our case , are only driven by the noise , @xmath13 the gaussian white noise considered here is zero - averaged and delta - correlated : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the noise intensity , which should be defined for each particular system ( see , e.g. , the example of two flux qubits described below ) . \n the uncorrelated noise sources affecting the qubits ( `` local '' noise ) tend to be more detrimental to their quantum coherence than the correlated ones @xcite , which makes eq . \n ( [ noise ] ) the `` worst case scenario '' .      by writing the qubit density matrix @xmath16 as @xmath17 we can rewrite the master equation @xmath18+\\hat{\\gamma}\\hat{\\rho}\\ ] ] in the form \n @xmath19 here we used the standard approximation for the dissipation operator @xmath20 via the dephasing and relaxation rates to characterize the intrinsic noise in the system . \n also , hereafter we assume for simplicity that relaxation rates are the same for both identical qubits , i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and that the temperature is low enough , resulting in the equilibrium values of the diagonal elements of the qubit density matrices being @xmath23 . all the simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 etc . ) \n do not qualitatively affect our results reported below . \n for instance , if @xmath27 , the spectrum in fig . 2 will have more peaks , corresponding to larger numbers of levels due to the lifting of the artificial degeneracy .    in the limit of zero coupling @xmath28 , there exists a solution of eqs . \n ( [ poxy ] ) with no entanglement between qubits . \n this solution can be written as a direct product of two single - qubit density matrices written through the corresponding bloch vectors : @xmath29 . \n the components of what can be called the bloch tensor @xmath30 are then all zero except for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . \n if the interaction is not zero , the entanglement between these qubits generates all the components of the bloch tensor to be non - zero @xcite and such an entangled state persists on the time scale @xmath33 after the interaction is later switched off [ @xmath34 . \n this reflects the fact that , in the presence of interactions , the eigenstates of the system are entangled @xcite , and the noise terms in the eigenbasis will thus maintain the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix of the two - qubit system .      as a specific example of our approach , which can be experimentally implemented \n , we propose to measure two ( almost ) identical superconducting flux qubits consisting of a superconducting loop interrupted by four josephson junctions and coupled via a coupler loop @xcite ( see figure 1 ) . \n the state of each qubit is controlled by the applied magnetic flux @xmath35 through the loop , where @xmath36 is the flux quantum . in the vicinity of @xmath37 , the ground state of the system \n is a symmetric superposition of the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a clock- and counterclockwise circulating superconducting current @xmath40 , respectively . in the basis \n @xmath41 the two - qubit system can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham ] ) with @xmath42 with classical flux bias fluctuations @xmath43 in the qubit loops around 1/2 , while the tunneling amplitude @xmath44 is determined by the fabrication of the loop and the junctions . \n note that the components of the density matrix can be measured _ directly \n _ , e.g. , by monitoring the current fluctuations in the flux qubits : @xmath45 . \n the direct relation of this spectrum to the current / voltage noise spectrum in the resonant tank @xmath46 circuit coupled to the qubit was used in ref .  . \n using the dimensionless time @xmath47 , we numerically solved the system ( [ poxy ] ) by the ito method for two coupled qubits driven only by white classical noise , choosing parameters for damping @xmath48 close to the ones experimentally found in flux qubits . \n the spectra of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , for @xmath51 , are shown in fig .  2 . \n since this two - qubit system is only driven by noise , the spectrum of both @xmath52 and @xmath53 is enhanced by increasing the noise , and peaks become more distinguished if noise is not too high . \n these spectra exhibit four maxima , whose positions nicely agree with the frequencies of the interlevel transitions ( in units of @xmath44 ) : @xmath54 which have values @xmath55 and @xmath56 . \n two peaks out of these four frequencies are clearly seen on the @xmath57 spectra in fig .  2 , \n while the other two peaks are better seen on the @xmath58 spectra . \n either of these two spectra is sufficient to _ measure both the coupling constant @xmath59 and the tunneling splitting energy @xmath44 _ , while the remaining spectrum can be used for control . \n note here that , unlike the single - qubit case @xcite , there are peaks on both @xmath57 and @xmath58 even for small values of the coupling strength @xmath59 , which illustrates our earlier remark on the entangled nature of the eigenstates revealed by classical noise .    to determine whether the coupling is  ferro- \" or \n antiferromagnetic \" , that is , the sign of the coupling constant @xmath59 , we study the time correlations in the density matrix elements @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . numerically solving equations ( [ poxy ] ) \n we obtained the time sequences @xmath64 shown in fig . \n 3 , where @xmath65 is the discretized time of the simulation . correlations and anticorrelations are clearly seen for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupled qubits , while almost no correlations are seen for the decoupled ones . a qualitative physical picture of these correlations in the time domain \n is readily understood . \n for instance , for ferromagnetic coupling , the bloch vectors of the two qubits tend to allign for weak enough noise . \n a stronger noise excites partially - coherent oscillations in the intervals between two sequential noise spikes , but the qubit - qubit oscillations still tend to preserve the ferromagnetic ordering ( which results in the correlations seen in fig . \n 3 ) even for the dynamicaly evolving qubits . similarly , the antiferromagnetic coupling tends to produce _ \n anti_-correlations in the qubit dynamics , as seen in fig .  3 . \n to quantitatively describe these correlations we plot the sample pearson correlation coefficient @xmath66 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath59 ( bottom panel of fig .  3 ) . here \n @xmath67 is the total number of simulation time steps . \n the module of the correlation coefficient @xmath68 exhibits a maximum at @xmath69 . at larger @xmath70 \n the oscillations become weaker , since the uncorrelated external noises in two qubits suppress each other via their coupling , so that the noise - induced oscillations weaken . \n the sign of @xmath68 coincides with the sign of the coupling @xmath59 , which allows to easily distinguish between ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings . \n we have demonstrated that quantum correlations in a two - qubit system can be highlighted by the presence of classical noise . as an application of this effect , we suggest the use of noise spectroscopy . \n namely , the measurement of the fluctuation spectra of the system , as a means to determine the relevant parameters of the multiqubit system . \n we acknowledge partial support from the national security agency , laboratory of physical sciences , army research office , national science foundation ( grant no . \n 0726909 ) , jsps -

{"ContextTokens": 3971, "GeneratedTokens": 274, "SynthesizedBody": "most of the baryons that comprise 4% of the mass  energy budget of the universe are found in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , primarily appearing as the lyman \n alpha `` forest '' in high  redshift quasar spectra @xcite . at more recent times ( @xmath3 ) \n the process of structure formation has shock  heated the igm to temperatures of @xmath4k , thus rendering the hydrogen nearly fully ionized and producing ( at most ) broad , extremely weak lyman \n alpha absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n known as the warm  hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , this phase is predicted to contain roughly half of the baryonic matter at low redshifts @xcite . \n its extremely low density ( typically @xmath5 ) precludes the detection of whim thermal or line emission with current facilities , so the only way to directly measure these `` missing '' baryons is through far  ultraviolet and x - ray spectroscopic measurements of absorption lines from highly ionized heavy elements @xcite . \n several early attempts to detect these intervening whim absorbers in x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and more recent surveys @xcite yielded only tentative detections at best . \n intervening lyman  alpha @xcite and ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) absorbers had also been seen in  and hst quasar spectra , but their ionization states and possible galactic halo origins ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) are quite uncertain . \n these uncertainties are largely mitigated with the recent detection by @xcite of two x - ray absorption systems at @xmath6 and @xmath7 along the line of sight to the blazar mrk 421 . \n these filaments account for a critical density fraction of @xmath8 , fully consistent with the mass of the missing baryons in the local universe ( albeit with large uncertainties ) . while future proposed missions such as _ constellation  x _ , _ xeus _ , or _ pharos _ ( nicastro et al . , in

confirmation of numerical predictions using observational capabilities that are _ currently _ within our grasp  hence any test of their correctness is of great importance . \n although each of these two absorption systems was detected with high confidence through multiple redshifted x - ray absorption lines , the _ individual _ absorption lines were generally quite weakly detected , mostly at the @xmath10 level . moreover , while they employed high  quality and  data taken during exceptionally bright outbursts of mrk 421 , the many archived  observations of this source were not included in the analysis . with roughly twice the effective area of /letg \n , /rgs is in principle superior for x - ray grating spectroscopy between @xmath11 ; however , its slightly worse resolution ( approximately 60m  fwhm , versus 50m  for /letg ) , higher susceptibility to background flares , and multitude of narrow instrumental features can present serious complications for whim searches . \n independent confirmation of the  results with a separate instrument like  is thus important . while some groups have searched for whim features in a limited number of  mrk 421 spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) , a complete and systematic analysis has yet to be performed . here \n we present a search for @xmath12 whim features employing all `` good '' observations of mrk 421 available in the   archive , and a comparison of these results to those presented by n05 . \n we searched the  archive for all mrk 421 reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data . \n although 31 separate observations were available , 16 had pointing offsets @xmath13  while the rest were offset by less than 15 . \n since spectral resolution and calibration quality can degrade at large offsets , we only included those with @xmath14 . \n one extremely short observation ( 0158971101 , with @xmath15s ) was also excluded to simplify the data reduction process . using the standard  science analysis system version 6.5.0 routines , rgs1 light curves were built for the remaining 14 `` good '' observations ( see table  [ tab_log ] ) , and the spectra \n were reprocessed to exclude periods of high background levels and coadded . \n these combined , filtered rgs1 and rgs2 spectra have effective exposure times of @xmath16ks and over @xmath17 combined rgs1@xmath18rgs2 first  order counts between @xmath19  with @xmath1 counts per 0.06  resolution element in rgs1 near 21 , over twice that in the n05 mrk  421  spectrum . \n we first used the spectral fitting program _ \n _ sherpa _ _ to fit a simple power law plus galactic foreground absorption model to the rgs1 and rgs2 data ; however , at such high spectral quality the rgs response model does not appear to be well  determined , and large residuals remained . for line measurements , we thus only considered @xmath20  windows around each wavelength of interest , using a power law to independently model the rgs1 and rgs2 continua within each window and excluding the strongest narrow detector features ( with typical widths of 70m  or less ) . \n none of the intervening absorption lines were apparent through a visual inspection of the  spectrum , though several of the @xmath21 lines reported by @xcite could be seen clearly . \n a narrow gaussian absorption line ( fwhm@xmath22m ) was included in the model for each line measurement or upper limit reported by n05 . when convolved with the rgs instrumental response \n these absorption lines appeared broadened to the rgs line spread function ( lsf ) widths ( typically fwhm@xmath23m ; * ? ? ? \n the @xmath24 upper limits on all equivalent widths were then calculated ( allowing the central line wavelengths to vary within the @xmath25 errors reported by n05 ) . since the shapes of the rgs1 and rgs2 instrumental responses are quite different , these limits were calculated using both a joint fit to the rgs1@xmath18rgs2 spectra as well as the individual rgs1 and rgs2 spectra . \n it should be noted that wherever one rgs unit is unusable , the total response is effectively halved , at which point it has a similar effective area to /letg . \n the resulting equivalent width limits are listed in table  [ tab_ew ] . \n figure  [ fig_xmmspec ] shows the spectral windows used to determine upper limits on the n05 measured lines , with the data ( black ) , continuum fit ( blue ) ,  measurements and limits ( n05 ; red solid and dotted lines respectively ) , and  limits ( green ) overplotted . in all cases , \n the n05 measurements ( or @xmath26 upper limits ) appear to be consistent with the @xmath24 upper limits we have derived directly from the  data , as shown in the figure and listed in table  [ tab_ew ] . \n the  line at @xmath7 looks as though it might be visible in the spectrum , but this is most likely due to the weak instrumental feature at @xmath27 . for two lines (  and  at @xmath7 ) the  @xmath24 upper limits are approximately equal to the n05 best  fit measurements , but since the n05 values are quite uncertain this result is still consistent . \n why , then , with @xmath28 times the counts per resolution element , was  unable to detect the intervening absorption systems seen by ? \n several factors appear to have been involved in this non  detection , primarily : ( 1 ) narrow instrumental features caused by bad detector columns , ( 2 ) the broader lsf as compared to /letg , and ( 3 ) fixed \n pattern noise at long wavelengths :    1 . \n while broad instrumental features can be taken into account by modifications to the continuum model ( as in n05 ) , it is difficult or impossible to distinguish narrow features from true absorption lines ; thus , any line falling near one of the detector features shown in figure  [ fig_rgsmod ] can easily be lost . \n this was responsible for the non - detection of the @xmath6  k@xmath29 line . \n although it was the strongest line reported by n05 , its wavelength falls directly on a narrow rgs1 feature and within the non  functional ccd4 region on rgs2 , thereby preventing this line from being detectable with either rgs . since 18% of the wavelength space for studying redshifted \n ( @xmath30 ) toward mrk 421 is directly blocked by these narrow features ( with this number climbing to about 60% if resolution elements immediately adjacent to bad columns are included ) , these bad columns present the single greatest hindrance to /rgs studies of the whim . \n 2 .   even for lines \n where both rgs1 and rgs2 data are available and the instrumental response appears to be relatively smooth , the lower resolution of  contributes to the nondetectability of the weaker @xmath12 absorption lines . \n figure  [ fig_lsfplot ] shows the lsfs for both /rgs1 ( solid ) and /letg assuming an unresolved line with @xmath31m  at 21.6 . \n while the core of the rgs1 response is @xmath32% broader than that of the letg , the rgs1 lsf has extremely broad wings : only 68% of the line flux is contained within the central 0.1  of the rgs1 lsf , as opposed to 96% for the letg . \n this reduces the apparent depth of absorption lines by about a factor of two as compared to /letg , severely decreasing the line detectability . \n 3 .   at long wavelengths ( @xmath33 ) \n strong fixed \n pattern noise is apparent as a sawtooth pattern in the instrumental response , strongly impeding the detection of species such as  and . \n indeed , in these wavelength regimes ( the lower two panels of figure  [ fig_xmmspec ] ) , the  and absorption lines are nearly indistinguishable from the continuum . \n we have presented the highest signal  to  noise coadded  grating spectrum of mrk 421 to date , incorporating all available archival data . \n this spectrum serves as an independent check on the recent detection of two @xmath12 whim filaments by n05 . \n while none of the detected absorption lines are seen in the  spectrum , the upper limits derived from the  data are consistent with the equivalent widths reported by n05 ( even though the  data contain a larger number of counts ) , and hence do not jeopardize the validity of the measurement . the non  detections can be attributed primarily to narrow instrumental features in rgs1 and rgs2 , as well as the inferior spectral resolution of  and fixed \n pattern noise at longer wavelengths . \n this underscores the extreme difficulty of detecting the whim , illustrates how the aforementioned ( apparently small ) effects can greatly affect the delicate measurement of weak absorption lines , and re  emphasizes the importance of high resolution and a smooth instrumental response function for current and future whim absorption line studies . \n we thank the  team for their efforts on this excellent mission , the helpdesk staff for

the airborne stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia : becklin 1997 ) ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt / gtm ) , a ground - based 50-m single - antenna telescope ( schloerb 1997 ) that will incorporate the bolocam bolometer array receiver ( mauskopf & bock 1997 ) ;

lat spectrum to the vhe band is either a good estimate or an upper limit for the intrinsic vhe spectrum of the source , since they belong to the same hump in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . \n the extrapolation is done either as a simple extension of the power - law ( or best fit ) model for the fermi - lat data , or using a one - zone synchrotron self - compton model ( ssc ) on the overall sed . \n however , the observational evidence shows that this assumption is not well justified anymore . \n blazars display a wide range in sed peak energies , as well as in emission components ( both in time and space along the jet ) . \n the vhe band samples typically the highest energies of the emitting particle distribution , and is therefore more sensitive to even small changes in the acceleration and cooling processes . \n observationally , irrespective of ebl absorption ( i.e. adopting the same ebl model for all sources ) , the band between he and vhe is the energy range where the spectrum of blazars typically changes the most , either because of the closeness of the sed peak or of the end of the emitting particles distribution . \n therefore , the extrapolation to vhe of the he slope is in general never a good assumption . \n this is particularly true for the high - energy - peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) which are bright in fermi and have been easily detected in the first years of operation @xcite . \n these are characterized by the high - energy sed peak being very close to the lat band ( e.g. mkn421 , mkn501 , pks2155 - 304 , pks2005 - 489 , 1es1553 + 113 etc ) . for them , \n the he and vhe bands sample the two sides of the gamma - ray hump in the sed , and thus the intrinsic vhe spectra are much softer than the he spectra indeed this is the most common case among fermi - detected hbl @xcite . \n the main question however is : can the vhe spectrum be harder than the he spectrum ? can thus the fermi - lat index be used as reasonable upper limit for the hardness of the vhe spectrum , or for its luminosity ? \n concave he - vhe spectra have not been observed ( yet ) directly . \n however , the observational ( as well as theoretical ) evidence is now showing this to be possible . \n let us consider three facts .    1 \n .   bl lacs do show multiple spectral components in their synchrotron emission , which traces directly the shape of the electron distribution(s ) . \n in several cases we have already seen the superposition of two different emission components at high electron energies , with a new component emerging over a previous / steadier sed . \n classical examples are given by mkn 501 in 1997 @xcite , 1es1959 + 650 in 2002 @xcite and pks2155 - 304 in 2006 @xcite ( see e.g. fig . \n the same can thus happen in the inverse compton emission . \n the superposition of multiple spectral components is seen also outside specific flaring episodes , on long ( months to years ) timescales . \n one of the most evident cases was given by pks2005 - 489 in the synchrotron emission ( fig . \n [ f2 ] ) , during multi - wavelength campaigns in 2004 - 2005 . \n the x - ray band in 2005 became more and more dominated by a new harder emission component emerging in the sed , which probably reached its maximum in june 2009 @xcite . \n +   ( 5.08 or 3.93 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) . \n even with the lowest galactic column density , in 2005 the x - ray spectrum can not be joined to the uv data from the optical monitor with a single smooth spectral component @xcite . \n , width=283 ] 3 .   at vhe , \n intrinsic spectra as hard as @xmath4 are already observed , with a low ebl density ( even harder in case of higher ebl densities ) . \n classic examples are given by 1es1101 - 232 @xcite , 1es0347 - 121 @xcite and especially 1es0229 + 200 ( fig . \n [ f3 ] ) , which is characterized by such hard vhe spectrum up to @xmath510 tev @xcite . \n this demonstrates that there exist physical conditions in blazars which can yield tev spectra as hard as @xmath6 , and with higher luminosity than in the synchrotron emission . \n such conditions can in principle form also in specific zones of the jet , and/or in specific epochs . \n the overall sed of such components can easily remain hidden below a more `` standard '' sed and emerge or become dominant only at vhe . \n considering these three facts together , it becomes clear that spectra at vhe can very well be harder than at he . \n this is true especially for those hbl where the fermi - lat index is closer to 2 than 1.5 ( or even steeper than 2 , as in ibl and lbl ) . \n over such a wide range of energies ( 5 orders of magnitude ) , it seems not only possible but even likely that a combination of different spectral components either in time or from different particle populations or different emission mechanisms for the same particles can result in _ concave _ overall spectra . \n it seems only a matter of time ( and statistics ) before up - turns somewhere in the overall 100 mev  10 tev band are directly and significantly detected in the simultaneous gamma - ray spectrum of some blazars .    it should not be surprising , because the observational ingredients are all there . \n in fact , a possible example is already given by the fermi - lat spectrum of mkn501 @xcite , where a flaring episode has already produced a time - average he spectrum apparently hardening towards higher energies ( see fig . \n [ f4 ] ) . \n therefore , in general , fermi - lat spectra can not be reliably used as ul to a ) derive constraints on redshift , or b ) put stronger limits on the intensity of the ebl . \n the results would be as weak / unreliable as their assumptions , and lead to gross over / under - estimates . \n for ebl and resdhift studies , the @xmath6 limit for the intrinsic photon index is still a more robust benchmark than any fermi - lat extrapolation . although it is not a  hard \" limit ( theoretically there are many mechanisms to obtain harder spectra , see e.g. @xcite ) , at present it still represents the borderline between reality and speculation ( for a full discussion , see e.g. @xcite ) . \n observationally , intrinsic spectra with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) have never been observed so far in blazars at high electron energies ( e.g. @xmath9 ) , neither in the synchrotron emission nor in the inverse compton spectrum of low - redshift sources . \n photon indexes of 1.2 - 1 are observed at x - ray energies in high - redshift , low - energy - peaked blazars ( typically fsrq ) , but these appear to be explained as low - energy cutoffs in the electron distribution , if not by internal absorption @xcite . \n in fact , this is a spectral feature that could in principle appear in the fermi - lat band for some tev - peaked sources ( i.e. those where the lat band is deep in the valley between the two sed humps ) . \n however , it would not automatically imply a similarly hard spectrum at vhe , because in such case the vhe band would correspond to the particle distribution well above the low - energy cutoff .    at present the ebl spectrum between 0.1 and 10 @xmath10 m \n is constrained rather well ( mostly within @xmath550% ; @xcite ) , simply by using the range of spectra observed in blazars . \n any further improvement beyond that requires a prediction of the blazars high - energy emission at a level of accuracy which seems not ( yet ) at hand @xcite . \n the uncertainty is systematical , on which model and physical conditions are actually working in blazars . for a given he spectrum and overall sed , \n the range of possible vhe spectra is still large ( @xmath11 ) , even in a ssc scenario , depending on the choice of parameters , zones and adopted particle distributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . and observations are demonstrating that we are still missing some fundamental aspects of the blazar physics . \n one - zone ssc models can work _ a - posteriori _ , but can not be used reliably _ a - priori _ since blazars have multiple emission components , whose behaviour and interplay is still unknown \n . a reliable prediction of the vhe spectrum from the he one is therefore not yet possible , at least in individual sources .    for a real progress in this field \n , it seems now more useful and fruitful to fix the ebl to the most consistent and likely values ( e.g. @xcite ) , and to focus on improving our understanding of the blazar emission properties . \n 99 a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 707 * , 1310 ( 2009 ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 708 * , 1310 ( 2010 ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 710 * , 1271 ( 2010b ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 715 * , 429 ( 2010c ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 723 * , 1082 ( 2010d ) a. abdo et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 727 * , 129 ( 2011 ) a. abramowski et al . \n ( hess coll . \n , lat coll . ) , a&a , * 533 * , 110 ( 2011 ) v.a . \n acciari et al . \n ( veritas coll . \n , lat coll . ) , apjl , * 708 * , 100 ( 2010 ) f. acero et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 511 * , 52 ( 2010 ) m. ackermann et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apj , * 743 * , 171 ( 2011 ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hegra coll . ) \n a&a , * 349 * , 11 ( 1999 ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , nature , * 440 * , 1018 ( 2006a ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 473 * , l25 ( 2007a ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 470 * , 475 ( 2007b ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 475 * , l9 ( 2007c ) f. aharonian et al . \n ( hess coll . ) , a&a , * 502 * , 749 ( 2009 ) l. costamante et al . \n , a&a , * 371 * , 512 ( 2001 ) l. costamante et al . , proceedings esa workshop frascati , arxiv:0206482 ( 2002 ) l. costamante , proceedings of iau symposium no . \n 284 ( arxiv:1204.6426 ) a. dominguez et al . , \n mnras , * 410 * , 2556 ( 2011 ) a. franceschini et al . , a&a , * 487 * , 837 ( 2008 ) g. ghisellini et al . , \n a&a , * 386 * , 833 ( 2002 ) g. ghisellini et al . , \n mnras , * 399 * , 2041 ( 2009 ) r.c . \n gilmore et al . , mnras , * 422 * , 3189 ( 2012 ) h. krawczynski et al . , \n apj , * 601 * , 151 ( 2004 ) e. lefa et al . , \n apj , * 740 * , 64 ( 2011 ) n. mankuzhiyil et al . , apj , * 715l * , 16 ( 2010 ) p. nolan et al . \n ( lat coll . ) , apjs , * 199 * , 31 ( 2012 ) m.r . \n orr et al . , \n apj , * 733 * , 77 ( 2011 ) e. pian et al . , apjl , * 492 * , 17 ( 1998 ) e. prandini et al . , mnras , * 405l * , 76 ( 2010 ) f. tavecchio et al . , apj , * 665 * , 980 ( 2007 ) m.a . \n worsley et al . , \n mnras , * 350l * , 67 ( 2004 )", "StartTimeOffset": 2150279192658, "RequestID": "ebab1ae9e76e4e8031232d4c27fe0e8f0a4eb8e7", "TotalTokens": 3119}
{"ContextTokens": 3851, "GeneratedTokens": 67, "SynthesizedBody": "in the simple quark model the spin of the proton is carried by its three valence quarks so that @xmath0 . here \n @xmath1 = @xmath2 where @xmath3 are distributions for quarks with spin aligned ( anti -

quarks and gluons . \n all partons in the proton can moreover possess orbital angular momentum , which also contributes to the proton spin . within this model , \n the proton spin can no longer be identified with the sum of the quark spins only , and @xmath8 can therefore not be predicted without making additional assumptions . \n the best - known theoretical prediction of @xmath8 is due to ellis and jaffe  @xcite . using su(3)-flavour symmetry with the additional assumption of vanishing of the contribution from strange quarks to the proton spin \n , they obtain @xmath9 . \n deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with polarised charged leptons on polarised targets allows the quark distributions @xmath10 to be investigated . \n these are extracted from the structure function @xmath11 measured in polarised dis using the parton model relation @xmath12 . in the early 1980s the slac experiments e80 and \n e130  @xcite reported the first measurements of polarised dis for @xmath13 . in 1988 , the emc reported measurements  @xcite over a range down to @xmath14 . \n for @xmath13 all the data ( extrapolated to @xmath15 for the determination of @xmath8 ) seemed to confirm the expectations of ellis and jaffe . \n however , as @xmath16 decreased the emc data fell progressively below the expectations of the quark parton model and yielded a very small @xmath8 , which was even consistent with zero at that time . \n the value of @xmath8 has increased since then due to the refinement of our knowledge of f and d , the su(3 ) couplings measured in hyperon beta decay ( see  @xcite for the latest analysis ) . \n however , there is still a significant difference of the measurement from the value expected from the ellis - jaffe sum rule . \n the significance of this disagreement implies that only a small fraction of the spin of the proton is carried by quark spins . \n this surprising result created great theoretical interest . where was the spin of the nucleon ? \n could it be in the gluons ( @xmath17 ) as suggested in  @xcite or could it be in orbital angular momentum ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 )  @xcite . by angular momentum conservation \n the total spin of the nucleon of 1/2 must be equal to 1/2 @xmath20 . \n it was also suggested that the problem did not exist and part of @xmath8 was missed in the unmeasured region at very small @xmath16  @xcite . \n all this interest motivated a new experimental programme to investigate the phenomenon further and this programme is now coming to fruition .    on the theoretical side , \n much confusion was caused by the scheme dependence of @xmath8 in higher orders of perturbative qcd . \n this problem could only be resolved three years ago with the calculation of the two - loop polarized splitting functions ,  @xcite , now allowing to define consistent transformations between different factorization schemes  @xcite . in the recent past , \n the next - to - leading order qcd corrections for the majority of the experimentally relevant polarized observables have been calculated , see for example  @xcite for a review . \n the smc has presented data over the widest range of @xmath16 on the polarised structure functions  @xcite . \n the collaboration has greatly improved the precision of the data at low @xmath16 by demanding an observed hadron in each event . \n this rejects radiative and other events with low depolarisation factors . \n the remaining events are then undiluted by data of poor significance for the asymmetry determination allowing the asymmetry to be measured more precisely . \n furthermore , a much lower @xmath21 trigger has been implemented which allows asymmetries to be measured in the range @xmath22 . \n the data from this trigger serve to investigate the regge region to search for a possible divergence at low @xmath16 such as proposed in  @xcite . \n 1 shows the smc data  @xcite with the behaviour of @xmath23 ( solid curve ) proposed by  @xcite . \n such behaviour is now excluded by the data . \n however , the less extreme behaviours @xmath24 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath25 ( dotted curve ) which were also proposed in  @xcite can not be excluded . \n all the curves were calculated assuming a value of @xmath26 . \n hence they represent lower limits since the curves scale as @xmath27 . \n the first of these behaviours would make a sizable difference to the determination of @xmath28 so its exclusion removes a significant uncertainty . \n direct comparison of these data with the double logarithmic small-@xmath16 resummations of  @xcite is difficult due to the low @xmath21 values involved . a model for extending these resummations into the low @xmath21 region \n is discussed in detail in these proceedings  @xcite , it is in good agreement with the data . \n the values of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath16 measured by smc  @xcite ( preliminary ) . \n the smooth curves show the expected behaviour of @xmath29 as @xmath30 proposed in  @xcite . \n the solid curve shows the behaviour for @xmath31 , the dashed curve for @xmath32 and the dotted curve @xmath33 . \n the smc group have made nlo qcd fits to the world data in an attempt to determine @xmath17 , @xcite . \n the theoretical error on this quantity can be estimated by varying renormalization and factorization scales in the fits  @xcite . \n these variations generate terms which are compensated only in the nnlo order expressions , such that the resulting error can be taken as a measure of the importance of higher orders in the perturbative series . in  @xcite this error \n is assessed by varying the scales between the limits of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , resulting in a rather large variation of @xmath17 . given that most of the data included in the fit are at moderate @xmath36  gev@xmath37 , one would indeed assume that perturbative corrections beyond nlo ( as well as target mass corrections  @xcite ) could be sizable . \n it should however be pointed out that theoretical error and statistical error on @xmath17 are of a similar magnitude , such that improvement on the theoretical side only would not be sufficient for a better determination of @xmath17 . \n this clearly illustrates the necessity for a direct measurement of this quantity . \n interesting recent results have also been reported to this workshop from hermes  @xcite in which the semi - inclusive distributions of charged hadrons have been used to deduce the parton distributions for individual quark flavours to the spin of the proton . \n these data add to earlier smc measurements  @xcite . \n upgrades to the hermes detector will soon allow separation of different hadron species , which might yield the first flavour decomposition of the light quark sea  @xcite . \n a consistent extraction of parton distributions at next - to - leading order requires knowledge of both nlo splitting functions and subprocess cross sections for all experimental observables included in a global fit . up to now \n , these fits were restricted to structure function measurements only . \n however , the range of polarized observables will soon be extended with a variety of new reactions to be measured at compass and rhic  @xcite . for many of these , \n subprocess cross sections are now available at nlo . \n most recently , nlo corrections to the photoproduction of heavy quarks have been calculated  @xcite . \n an important outcome of this calculation is the relative smallness of light quark induced contributions in photoproduction of charm . the considerably improved dependence on factorization and renormalization scale at next - to - leading order indicates moreover the perturbative stability of this observable , which can therefore be used for a reliable determination of @xmath17 once data become available . \n first progress towards the calculation of the polarized splitting functions at nnlo has been reported by gracey  @xcite . using the @xmath38 expansion , \n several terms of the polarized splitting functions could be determined to all orders . \n these results could serve as a consistency check once full results for the splitting functions become available . \n another important test of higher order corrections are the relations between polarized and unpolarized results : these are discussed in  @xcite . \n presently , the contribution of partonic angular momentum to the proton spin is not at all determined . using the recently derived renormalization group equations for the angular momentum distributions  @xcite , it is now feasible to model these distributions . \n the behaviour of the polarized proton structure at small @xmath16 is expected to be governed by leading double logarithmic terms of the form @xmath39 , which are absent in the unpolarized singlet structure functions . \n a resummation of these terms has been performed in  @xcite , and their impact has been the topic of extensive discussions during the workshop . \n it is commonly agreed that the effect of the small-@xmath16 resummation can not be tested on the current small-@xmath16 data from smc  @xcite , which correspond to only very low photon virtualities . a model for @xmath40 at low @xmath21 and small @xmath16 incorporating resummation was proposed by badelek and kwieciski and yields a decent description of the experimental data  @xcite . \n further observables studied in the same double logarithmic framework are @xmath41 at small @xmath16  @xcite and the diffractive content of @xmath40  @xcite , which are however inaccessible at present experiments . like in the unpolarized case , \n decent probes of phenomena at small @xmath16 would only be possible with a polarized electron - proton collider , such as the currently discussed polarized hera option .    in inclusive dis \n , the measurement of the polarized gluon distribution is indirect . \n various more direct measurements of @xmath17 have proposed such as the observation of charm production at compass and in hermes as well as di - jet production using polarised protons in rhic and in hera  @xcite . \n a problem which was discussed extensively at the workshop was the associated production of charmed baryons and mesons . \n first monte carlo studies based on the lund string model  @xcite indicate that such backgrounds may not be serious at compass energies but could become substantial at hermes energies . as a result of the workshop , \n more involved theoretical studies have been carried out . \n modeling associated production as interchange of constituent quarks , ryskin and leader confirm  @xcite that an open charm production measurement at hermes will suffer from a large contamination due to associated production , such that it will not yield conclusive information on @xmath17 . \n another potential probe of the polarized gluon distribution is the photoproduction of @xmath42 mesons . \n the inelastic production is induced by boson - gluon fusion , and thus directly proportional to the gluon distribution . under realistic experimental conditions , it is however very hard to separate inelastic from elastic production . \n a decent theoretical description of unpolarized inelastic @xmath42 production is given in the perturbative two gluon exchange model of  @xcite . \n this model has now been applied by mankiewicz and vnttinen  @xcite to compute production asymmetries in elastic @xmath42 production . \n contrary to earlier claims in the literature , it could be proven that the elastic @xmath42 production cross section is insensitive to the spin states of probe and target , a small spin dependence is induced only from relativistic corrections . as a consequence , elastic @xmath42 production can not be used to probe the polarized gluon distribution , as initially hoped . \n ten years after the release of the emc measurement of the small contribution of quark spins to the proton spin , an extensive amount of spin structure function measurements is available . confirming the initial emc observation , these measurements have contributed much information on the polarized quark distributions in the proton . \n our picture of the proton spin structure is however far form being complete : current data yield only loose constraints on the polarized gluon distribution , and no information is available yet on angular momentum contributions to the proton spin . \n the theoretical understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon has vastly improved , with the large majority of accessible observables now being calculated to nlo . \n theoretical efforts are now extending in various directions : understanding of spin effects at small @xmath16 , computation of nnlo corrections and investigation of angular momentum distributions are examples of currently ongoing research work . \n making further experimental progress towards a determination of @xmath17 seems to be harder than originally anticipated . concerning the prospects of extracting @xmath17 from charm production at hermes energies , \n the working group has concluded that neither elastic @xmath42 production ( vanishing asymmetry at partonic level ) nor open charm production ( large background from associated production ) are reliable channels . \n a measurement from open charm production at compass energies looks far more promising due to the much reduced background . with the recently calculated nlo corrections , the theoretical uncertainties of this observable appear also to be under control . \n in addition to compass , other future experiments promise to yield new valuable information on the nucleon s spin structure . \n a whole range of new observables will become accessible at the rhic polarized proton - proton collider , which is currently constructed at bnl . \n the option of polarizing the hera proton beam , which is under extensive study for the moment , would largely extend the kinematical region covered by present fixed target experiments and allow to study a variety of new channels probing the spin structure of both photon and proton . \n we thank the organisers for creating such an interesting , stimulating and enjoyable workshop . \n we also thank all the participants in working group 6 for their assistance in preparing this talk . \n 99    j ellis and r l jaffe ; phys . \n d9 ( 1974 ) 1444 ; _ ibid . \n _ d10 ( 1974 ) 1669 . \n slac e80 , m j alguard et al ; phys . \n ( 1976 ) 1261 . \n slac e130,g baum et al ; phys . \n 51 ( 1983 ) 1135 . \n emc , j ashman et al , phys . \n b206 ( 1988 ) 364 and nucl . \n phys . b328 ( 1989 ) 1 p g ratcliffe ; phys . \n d59 ( 1999 ) 014038 . a v efremov and o v teryaev , czech.hadron symp . \n ( 1988 ) 302 . \n g altarelli and g g ross ; phys . \n b212 ( 1988 ) 391 . \n s j brodsky j ellis and m karliner ; phys . \n b206 ( 1988 ) 309 . \n f e close and r g roberts ; phys . lett . \n b336 ( 1994 ) 1257 . \n r metrig and w van neerven , z. phys . c70 ( 1996 ) 637 ; + w vogelsang , nucl . \n b475 ( 1996 ) 47 . \n g ridolfi and s forte , these proceedings . \n r d ball and h tallini , these proceedings . \n smc , b adeva et al , phys . \n d58 ( 1998 ) 112001 , 112002 . \n smc , j kiryluk , proceedings of the workshop dis98 , eds . \n g coremans and r rosen ( world scientific , 1998 ) , p.647 . \n j bartels , b i ermolaev and m g ryskin ; z.phys . c70 ( 1996 ) 273 ; _ ibid . \n _ c72 ( 1996 ) 627 . \n b badelek and j kwieciski , these proceedings . \n e leader , these proceedings . \n j blmlein and a tkabladze , these proceedings . \n smc , b adeva et al , phys.lett . \n b420 ( 1998 ) 180 . \n t gehrmann , proceedings of the workshop dis98 , eds . \n g coremans and r rosen ( world scientific , 1998 ) , p.729 . \n m stratmann , these proceedings . \n j gracey , these proceedings . \n j blmlein , v ravindran and w l van neerven , these proceedings . \n p hgler , these proceedings . \n j bartels and m ryskin , these proceedings . \n j bartels , t gehrmann and m ryskin , these proceedings . \n proceedings of the workshop on physics with polarized protons at hera , eds .  a de roeck and t gehrmann , desy -

{"ContextTokens": 2074, "GeneratedTokens": 108, "SynthesizedBody": "european region is one of the most intensively studied areas of the earth from the point of view of regional geodynamics . \n there are more than 100 permanently operating gps receivers , about 10 permanent vlbi stations and more than 10 permanent slr stations . \n lately much attention has been devoted to comparison and combination of results obtained using different space geodesy techniques . \n this work is devoted to comparison of baseline length variations derived from gps and vlbi observations , continuing the cycle of works on this problem , see e.g. . \n it should be mentioned here that observed changes of the baseline length on the one hand are resulted by insufficient corrections for observational effects such as thermal deformations of vlbi antennas , for example , or errors in modeling of tropospheric refraction , but on the other hand they are subjected to a number of insufficiently studied or not taken into account properly geophysical effects that can result in the real changes of the baseline length , these effects may be atmospheric and snow loading , tides , postglacial rebound , and so on . \n it is important that the majority of these effects has both seasonal and secular components .    in this study \n we have analyzed vlbi and gps observations at 6 european stations carrying out both vlbi and gps regular observations and having long enough observational history . \n vlbi baseline lengths were computed with the occam package using all available 24h sessions for the period of 1983.92001.5 . \n details of the method used can be found in @xcite . \n linear trend in the baseline lengths was computed for the whole period of observations and , for more accurate comparison with gps data , for the period of 1996.0 - 2001.0 . \n only later results are presented in this study . in @xcite \n we compared linear trend in variations of baseline length derived from the observations over the period 1996.02001.0 with ones computed using all available vlbi sessions over a period 1990.02001.4 . \n differences of estimated rates are inside one sigma interval for all baselines analyzed here .    for more strict account for variation in baseline lengths due to thermal antenna deformations we used advanced model of this effect @xcite which allow to correct observed station position not only for vertical but also for horizontal displacement . \n at this stage of the research we used zero time delay between change of air and telescope construction temperature , because of lack of such a data for most of antennas . \n however , this mismodelling will effect only intra - day displacement of the telesope reference point , but not seasonal variations . \n it should be mentioned here that account for horizontal displacement is especially important for processing regional networks , whereas vertical displacement due to thermal deformations prevails in variations of global baselines length . in particular , errors in modelling of this effect \n may be a possible reason of seasonal baseline length variations found e.g. in @xcite . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from vlbi data are shown in figure  [ fig : vlbi ] . \n unfortunately , stations crimea and yebes are not equipped with gps receiver . \n =      for computation of baseline lengths between european gps stations we used weekly epn solutions distributed in sinex files . however , this solutions are not suitable for immediate use in geodynamical analysis because they can not provide homogeneous long - time coordinate time series due to periodic changes in reference coordinate system and set of fiducial stations . \n for this reason , direct use of the euref solutions shows jumps in baseline length variations @xcite . besides , method of computation of station \n coordinates used in epn is based on using tight constrains to fiducial stations which cause a distortion of the network , i.e. fictive variations in baseline lengths ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n so , variations of baseline lengths from gps data were obtained from analysis of coordinate time series for epn stations computed by the method described in @xcite . \n this computation is based on de - constraining of the official epn solutions with further transformation to itrf2000 . \n for this study we used 6-parameter helmert transformation to avoid loss of seasonal geophysical signal in baseline length . using our independent coordinate time series allows us to obtain realistic station displacement practically free of network distortion for all epn stations over the period 1996.02001.0 . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from gps data are shown in figure  [ fig : gps ] . \n unfortunately , madr coordinate time series is too short ( less than two years ) that does not allow to get reliable results . \n it should be mentioned that errors in gps baseline length significantly decrease during a period under investigation . \n e.g. , one can see abnormal trend in mate displacement in 1996 . \n however , that does not influence result very much due to relatively small weight of these data . \n =      one of the most important factor affecting variations of station coordinates derived from space geodesy observations is atmospheric loading . \n we investigated influence of this effect using 3-dimensional atmospheric loading time series provided by h .- \n scherneck @xcite . \n the data were averaged over a week interval corresponding to every gps week and variations of baseline lengths were computed from these weekly values . \n variation of baseline lengths obtained from analysis of atmospheric data are shown in figure  [ fig : atmosph ] . \n =    it is interesting that baseline length variations contain not only seasonal but also secular component , even for short baselines , especially for continental - coastal ones , in particular baselines including wettzell stations which are often used in studies on european geodynamics , e.g. @xcite . \n the reason of that may be long - periodic or progressive weather and climate changes , but period of our investigation is too short to separate them .    since variations in height component of station displacement due to atmospheric loading prevail , this effect is especially significant for global baselines . for regional networks \n horizontal displacements yield main contribution to variation of baseline lengths . \n results of computation of variations in baseline lengths are presented in [ tab : result ] . \n one can see that values of rates obtained from vlbi and gps observations are in good agreement for most baselines . \n unfortunately , it is not the case for seasonal variations . \n obviously , interval of investigation is too short and number of used vlbi observations is too small for many baselines . \n indeed , it would be important to verify our results using data obtained from other space geodesy techniques , but only mate and wett stations are equipped with slr units , and only nyal station is equipped with doris beacon ( which is explained by difficulties in collocation of doris beacon and vlbi antenna due to radio frequency interference ) . \n .results of analysis of variation of baseline lengths : baseline length ( l ) , km , number of epochs ( n ) processed and found in the ivs data base , linear trend ( rate ) , mm , amplitude of annual term ( as ) , mm , amplitude of semiannual term ( asa ) , mm . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,>,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     it is also remarkable that influence of atmospheric loading on baseline length rate is significant for many baselines . \n evidently , this effect must be investigated more carefully and properly accounted during geodynamical analysis . \n figure [ fig : lbacc ] shows dependence of error in baseline length rate on length of baseline . \n it is interesting that for gps data error is practically the same for all baselines unlike vlbi data . \n 1em    further steps of our work will include new re - computation of epn coordinate time series based on new combination of individual epn analysis center solutions , reprocessing of vlbi data with new version of software , and more complete analysis of various factors effected variations of baseline lengths . \n analysis of variations in vertical component of station displacement is also planned . \n this research was partially supported by a grant of the st.petersburg scientific center of the russian academy of sciences . \n campbell j. the european geodetic vlbi project  an overview . in : p. \n tomasi , f.  mantovani , m.  prez -

{"ContextTokens": 3979, "GeneratedTokens": 271, "SynthesizedBody": "the human auditory system gives us the extraordinary ability to converse in the midst of a noisy throng of party goers . \n solving this so - called _ cocktail party _ \n problem @xcite has proven extremely challenging for computers , and separating and recognizing speech in such conditions has been the holy grail of speech processing for more than 50 years . \n previously , no practical method existed that could solve the problem in general conditions , especially in the case of single channel speech mixtures . \n this work builds upon recent advances in single - channel separation , using a method known as _ deep clustering _ @xcite . in deep clustering , \n a neural network is trained to assign an embedding vector to each element of a multi - dimensional signal , such that clustering the embeddings yields a desired segmentation of the signal . in the cocktail - party problem , \n the embeddings are assigned to each time - frequency ( tf ) index of the short - time fourier transform ( stft ) of the mixture of speech signals . \n clustering these embeddings yields an assignment of each tf bin to one of the inferred sources . \n these assignments are used as a masking function to extract the dominant parts of each source . \n preliminary work on this method produced remarkable performance , improving snr by 6 db on the task of separating two unknown speakers from a single - channel mixture @xcite .    in this paper \n we present improvements and extensions that enable a leap forward in separation quality , reaching levels of improvement that were previously out of reach ( audio examples and scripts to generate the data used here are available at @xcite ) . \n in addition to improvements to the training procedure , we investigate the three speaker case , showing generalization between two- and three - speaker networks .    the original deep clustering system was intended to only recover a binary masks for each source , leaving recovery of the missing features to subsequent stages . in this paper \n , we incorporate enhancement layers to refine the signal estimate . using soft clustering \n , we can then train the entire system _ end - to - end _ , training jointly through the deep clustering embeddings , the clustering and enhancement stages . \n this allows us to directly use a signal approximation objective instead of the original mask - based deep clustering objective . \n prior work in this area includes auditory grouping approaches to _ computational auditory scene analysis _ ( casa ) @xcite . these methods used hand - designed features to cluster the parts of the spectrum belonging to the same source . \n their success was limited by the lack of a machine learning framework . \n such a framework was provided in subsequent work on spectral clustering @xcite , at the cost of prohibitive complexity . \n generative models have also been proposed , beginning with @xcite . in constrained tasks , \n super - human speech separation was first achieved using factorial hmms @xcite and was extended to speaker - independent separation @xcite . \n variants of non - negative matrix factorization @xcite and bayesian non - parametric models @xcite have also been used . \n these methods suffer from computational complexity and difficulty of discriminative training . \n in contrast to the above , deep learning approaches have recently provided fast and accurate methods on simpler enhancement tasks @xcite . \n these methods treat the mask inferance as a classification problem , and hence can be discriminatively trained for accuracy without sacrificing speed \n . however they fail to learn in the speaker - independent case , where sources are of the same class @xcite , despite the work - around of choosing the best permutation of the network outputs during training . \n we call this the _ permutation problem _ : there are multiple valid output masks that differ only by a permutation of the order of the sources , so a global decision is needed to choose a permutation . \n deep clustering solves the permutation problem by framing mask estimation as a clustering problem . to do so \n , it produces an embedding for each time - frequency element in the spectrogram , such that clustering the embeddings produces the desired segmentation . \n the representation is thus independent of permutation of the source labels . \n it can also flexibly represent any number of sources , allowing the number of inferred sources to be decided at test time . \n below we present the deep clustering model and further investigate its capabilities . we then present extensions to allow end - to - end training for signal fidelity . \n the results are evaluated using an automatic speech recognition model trained on clean speech . \n the end - to - end signal approximation produces unprecedented performance , reducing the word error rate ( wer ) from close to 89.1% wer down to 30.8% by using the end - to - end training . \n this represents a major advancement towards solving the cocktail party problem . \n here we review the deep clustering formalism presented in @xcite . \n we define as @xmath0 a raw input signal and as @xmath1 a feature vector indexed by an element @xmath2 . in audio signals , @xmath2 is typically a tf index @xmath3 , where @xmath4 indexes frame of the signal , @xmath5 indexes frequency , and @xmath6 the value of the complex spectrogram at the corresponding tf bin . \n we assume that the tf bins can be partitioned into sets of tf bins in which each source dominates . \n once estimated , the partition for each source serves as a tf mask to be applied to @xmath7 , yielding the tf components of each source that are uncorrupted by other sources . \n the stft can then be inverted to obtain estimates of each isolated source . \n the target partition in a given mixture is represented by the indicator @xmath8 , mapping each element @xmath2 to each of @xmath9 components of the mixture , so that @xmath10 if element @xmath2 is in cluster @xmath11 . \n then @xmath12 is a binary affinity matrix that represents the cluster assignments in a permutation - independent way : \n @xmath13 if @xmath2 and @xmath14 belong to the same cluster and @xmath15 otherwise , and @xmath16 for any permutation matrix @xmath17 .    to estimate the partition , we seek @xmath18-dimensional embeddings @xmath19 , parameterized by @xmath20 , such that clustering the embeddings yields a partition of @xmath21 that is close to the target . in @xcite and this work , @xmath22 is based on a deep neural network that is a global function of the entire input signal @xmath23 . \n each embedding @xmath24 has unit norm , i.e. , @xmath25 . \n we consider the embeddings @xmath26 to implicitly represent an @xmath27 estimated affinity matrix @xmath28 , and we optimize the embeddings such that , for an input @xmath23 , @xmath29 matches the ideal affinities @xmath30 . \n this is done by minimizing , with respect to @xmath31 , the training cost function @xmath32 summed over training examples , where @xmath33 is the squared frobenius norm . due to its low - rank nature , the objective and its gradient can be formulated so as to avoid operations on all pairs of elements , leading to an efficient implementation .    at test time , the embeddings @xmath22 are computed on the test signal @xmath23 , and the rows @xmath24 are clustered using @xmath34-means . \n the resulting cluster assignments @xmath35 are used as binary masks on the complex spectrogram of the mixture , to estimate the sources . \n we investigated several approaches to improve performance over the baseline deep clustering method , including regularization such as drop - out , model size and shape , and training schedule . \n we used the same feature extraction procedure as in @xcite , with log - magnitude stft features as input , and we performed global mean - variance normalization as a pre - processing step . for all experiments we used we used rmsprop optimization @xcite with a fixed learning rate schedule , and early stopping based on cross - validation . \n * regularizing recurrent network units : * recurrent neural network ( rnn ) units , in particular lstm structures , have been widely adopted in many tasks such as object detection , natural language processing , machine translation , and speech recognition . here \n we experiment with regularizing them using dropout . \n lstm nodes consist of a recurrent memory cell surrounded by gates controlling its input , output , and recurrent connections . \n the direct recurrent connections are element - wise and linear with weight 1 , so that with the right setting of the gates , the memory is perpetuated , and otherwise more general recurrent processing is obtained . \n dropout is a training regularization in which nodes are randomly set to zero . in recurrent network \n there is a concern that dropout could interfere with lstm s memorization ability ; for example , @xcite used it only on feed - forward connections , but not on the recurrent ones . \n _ recurrent dropout _ \n samples the set of dropout nodes once for each sequence , and applies dropout to the same nodes at every time step for that sequence . \n applying recurrent dropout to the lstm memory cells recently yielded performance improvements on phoneme and speech recognition tasks with blstm acoustic models @xcite .    in this work , we sampled the dropout masks once at each time step for the forward connections , and only once for each sequence for the recurrent connections . \n we used the same recurrent dropout mask for each gate .    * architecture : * we investigated using deeper and wider architectures . \n the neural network model used in @xcite was a two layer bidirectional long short - term memory ( blstm ) network followed by a feed - forward layer to produce embeddings . \n we show that expanding the network size improves performance for our task . \n * temporal context : * during training , the utterances are divided into fixed length non - overlapping segments , and gradients are computed using shuffled mini - batches of these segments , as in @xcite . \n shorter segments increase the diversity within each batch , and may make an easier starting point for training , since the speech does not change as much over the segment . \n however , at test time , the network and clustering are given the entire utterance , so that the permutation problem can be solved globally . \n so we may also expect that training on longer segments would improve performance in the end .    in experiments below \n , we investigate training segment lengths of 100 versus 400 , and show that although the longer segments work better , pretraining with shorter segments followed by training with longer segments leads to better performance on this task . \n this is an example of _ curriculum learning _ \n @xcite , in which starting with an easier task improves learning and generalization .    * multi - speaker training : * previous experiments @xcite showed preliminary results on generalization from two speaker training to a three - speaker separation task . here \n we further investigate generalization from three - speaker training to two - speaker separation , as well as multi - style training on both two and three - speaker mixtures , and show that the multi - style training can achieve the best performance on both tasks . \n deep clustering solves the difficult problem of segmenting the spectrogram into regions dominated by each source . it does not however solve the problem of recovering the sources in regions strongly dominated by other sources . \n given the segmentation , this is arguably an easier problem . \n we propose to use a second - stage enhancement network to obtain better source estimates , in particular for the missing regions . \n for each source @xmath11 , the enhancement network first processes the concatenation of the amplitude spectrogram @xmath0 of the mixture and that @xmath36 of the deep clustering estimate through a blstm layer and a feed - forward linear layer , to produce an output @xmath37 . \n sequence - level mean and variance normalization is applied to the input , and the network parameters are shared for all sources . a soft - max \n is then used to combine the outputs @xmath38 across sources , forming a mask @xmath39 at each tf bin @xmath2 . \n this mask is applied to the mixture , yielding the final estimate @xmath40 . during training , we optimize the enhancement cost function @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of permutations on @xmath43 . since the enhancement network is trained to directly improve the signal reconstruction , it may improve upon deep clustering , especially in regions where the signal is dominated by other sources . \n in order to consider end - to - end training in the sense of jointly training the deep clustering with the enhancement stage , we need to compute gradients of the clustering step . in @xcite , \n hard @xmath34-means clustering was used to cluster the embeddings . \n the resulting binary masks can not be directly optimized to improve signal fidelity , because the optimal masks are generally continuous , and because the hard clustering is not differentiable . here \n we propose a soft @xmath34-means algorithm that enables us to directly optimize the estimated speech for signal fidelity .    in @xcite , \n clustering was performed with equal weights on the tf embeddings , although weights were used in the training objective in order to train only on tf elements with significant energy . here \n we introduce similar weights weights @xmath44 for each embedding @xmath45 to focus the clustering on tf elements with significant energy . \n the goal is mainly to avoid clustering silence regions , which may have noisy embeddings , and for which mask estimation errors are inconsequential . \n the soft weighted @xmath34-means algorithm can be interpreted as a weighted expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm for a gaussian mixture model with tied circular covariances . \n it alternates between computing the assignment of every embedding to each centroid , and updating the centroids : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the estimated mean of cluster @xmath11 , and @xmath48 is the estimated assignment of embedding @xmath2 to the cluster @xmath11 . \n the parameter @xmath49 controls the hardness of the clustering . as the value of @xmath49 increases , the algorithm approaches @xmath34-means . \n the weights @xmath44 may be set in a variety of ways . \n a reasonable choice could be to set @xmath44 according to the power of the mixture in each tf bin . here \n we set the weights to @xmath50 , except in silence tf bins where the weight is set to @xmath51 . \n silence is defined using a threshold on the energy relative to the maximum of the mixture . \n end - to - end training is performed by _ unfolding _ the steps of , and treating them as layers in a clustering network , according to the general framework known as _ deep unfolding _ @xcite . \n the gradients of each step are thus passed to the previous layers using standard back - propagation . \n * experimental setup : * we evaluate deep clustering on a single - channel speaker - independent speech separation task , considering mixtures of two and three speakers with all gender combinations . for two - speaker experiments , we use the corpus introduced in @xcite , derived from the wall street journal ( wsj0 ) corpus . \n it consists in a 30 h training set and a 10 h validation set with two - speaker mixtures generated by randomly selecting utterances by different speakers from the wsj0 training set ` si_tr_s ` , and mixing them at various signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) randomly chosen between 0  db and 10  db . \n the validation set was here used to optimize some tuning parameters . \n the 5 h test set consists in mixtures similarly generated using utterances from 16 speakers from the wsj0 development set ` si_dt_05 ` and evaluation set ` si_et_05 ` . \n the speakers are different from those in our training and validation sets , leading to a speaker - independent separation task . for three - speaker experiments \n , we created a corpus similar to the two - speaker one , with the same amounts of data generated from the same datasets . \n all data were downsampled to 8  khz before processing to reduce computational and memory costs . \n the input features @xmath23 were the log spectral magnitudes of the speech mixture , computed using a short - time fourier transform ( stft ) with a 32  ms sine window and 8  ms shift . \n the scores are reported in terms of signal - to - distortion ratio ( sdr ) , which we define as scale - invariant snr . as oracle \n upper bounds on performance for our datasets , we report in table  [ tab : ideal_results ] the results obtained using two types of `` ideal '' masks : the ideal binary mask ( ibm ) defined as @xmath52 , which leads to highest snr among all binary masks , and a `` wiener - like '' filter ( wf ) defined as @xmath53 , which empirically leads to good snr , with values in @xmath54 $ ] @xcite . here @xmath55 denotes the time - frequency representation of speaker @xmath2 . \n casa @xcite and previous deep clustering @xcite results are also shown for the two - speaker set . \n .sdr ( db ) improvements using the ideal binary mask ( ibm ) , oracle wiener - like filter ( wf ) , compared to prior methods dpcl @xcite and casa @xcite on the two- and three - speaker test sets . [ \n cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the magnitude snr is insensitive to phase estimation errors introduced by using the noisy phases for reconstruction , whereas the sdr might get worse as a result of phase errors , even if the amplitudes are accurate . \n speech recognition uses features based on the amplitudes , and hence the improvements in magnitude snr seem to predict the improvements in wer due to the enhancement and end - to - end training . \n [ fig : scatter ] shows that the sdr improvements of the end - to - end model are consistently good on nearly all of the two - speaker test mixtures . \n * asr performance : * we evaluated asr performance ( wer ) with gmm - based clean - speech wsj models obtained by a standard kaldi recipe @xcite . \n the noisy baseline result on the mixtures is 89.1 % , while the result on the clean speech is 19.9 % . \n the raw output from dpcl did not work well , despite good perceptual quality , possibly due to the effect of near - zero values in the masked spectrum , which is known to degrade asr performance . \n however , the enhancement networks significantly mitigated the degradation , and finally obtained 30.8 % with the end - to - end network . \n * visualization : * to gain insight into network functioning , we performed reverse correlation experiments . for each node , we average the 50-frame patches of input centered at the time when the node is active ( e.g. , the node is at 80% of its maximum value ) . \n [ fig : revcor ] shows a variety of interesting patterns , which seem to reflect such properties as onsets , pitch , frequency chirps , and vowel - fricative transitions . \n * conclusion : * we have improved and extended the deep clustering framework to perform end - to - end training for signal reconstruction quality for the first time . we show significant improvements to performance both on signal quality metrics and speech recognition error rates .", "StartTimeOffset": 2173017017262, "RequestID": "c4f30eb5d64a1060ecf82765800a00c4a42219eb", "TotalTokens": 4250}

[ \n smuonstop](left )  @xcite ; the gap along the diagonal is due to the softness of the muons when the @xmath10 \n @xmath3 mass difference is very small . with the additional condition of gaugino mass unification \n , the assumption that the smuon is the nlsp can be relaxed , and the effect of cascade decays such as @xmath11 with @xmath12 can be incorporated . \n these cascade decays occur only at small values of @xmath8 , for which the smuon mass limit of almost 100  gev is slightly degraded .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the question can be raised of the relevance of the tevatron searches for squarks and gluinos . \n indeed , if gaugino mass unification is assumed , as it is the case in msugra , the lep limits on charginos translate into gluino mass limits well beyond those within the tevatron reach . \n similarly , if slepton and squark mass unification is assumed , the lep limits on selectrons are more restrictive than those on squark masses from the tevatron . \n the cdf and dcollaborations should therefore be encouraged to present their results within frameworks other than msugra . \n for instance , in susy - gut models where susy breaking is induced by an f - term which is a * 75 * of su(5 ) , rather than by a singlet , the @xmath13 ratio is of order unity , in which case lep results do not constrain gluino masses above 105  gev or so . \n string inspired models can also lead to similar gaugino mass hierarchies . \n before concluding , i want to quote a result which is a bit off the main track , but still relevant for supersymmetry . \n the cdf and d  collaborations have searched for the rare decay @xmath14 which is expected to be at the 3.5  10@xmath15 level in the standard model , but may be enhanced by a factor of @xmath16 , i.e. , by as much as three orders of magnitude , in supersymmetry . at the time this talk was given , the cdf collaboration had quoted a limit of 7.5  10@xmath17  @xcite , improving substantially over the previous best limit and probing relevant new territory , while the d  collaboration had not yet `` opened the box .

{"ContextTokens": 697, "GeneratedTokens": 187, "SynthesizedBody": "interactions and mergers of galaxies are known to be common and these significantly affect their dynamics and evolution . \n the outer regions of merger remnants covering a radial range of @xmath2 a few kpc to a few @xmath3 10 kpc have been well - studied . these can be fit by an elliptical - like r@xmath4 profile ( class i ) , or a disc - like outer exponential profile ( class ii ) , or a no - fit profile ( class iii ) ( chitre & jog 2002 ) . \n the first two can be explained as arising due to equal - mass mergers ( e.g. , barnes 1992 ) or unequal - mass mergers ( bournaud , combes & jog 2004 ) respectively , while the third case corresponds to younger remnants . however , the central regions of a few kpc in mergers have not been studied in detail so far - which motivated our work ( jog & maybhate 2006 ) presented here , where we study a sample of advanced mergers which show signs of recent interaction such as tidal tails or loops but have a single nucleus . \n elliptical isophotes were fit to the k@xmath5-band images from 2mass while allowing the centre , ellipticity and the position angle to vary to get the best fit . \n figure 1 ( top panel ) shows the result for arp 163 ( a class iii galaxy ) - the isophotes are not concentric , instead the centres ( x@xmath6,y@xmath6 ) of consecutive isophotes show a wandering or sloshing pattern with a @xmath7 variation within the central 1 kpc , indicating an unrelaxed central region . \n further , we measure the lopsidedness of the distribution by fourier- analyzing the galaxy image w.r.t . a constant centre . \n the amplitude a@xmath8 and the phase p1 for @xmath0 were plotted versus radius- as shown for arp 163 in the lower panel of figure 1 , which shows high central lopsidedness @xmath9 over the central 5 kpc region . \n all the sample galaxies show strong sloshing and lopsidedness in the central regions . \n the asymmetry does not depend significantly on the masses of the progenitor galaxies , being similar for class i and ii cases , but it is higher for younger mergers ( class iii ) . \n the corresponding values are smaller by a factor of few for a control sample of non - merger galaxies , confirming the merger origin of the high central asymmetry in our sample .      the ages of remnants are deduced to be @xmath1 1 - 2 gyr as seen from the merger remnants with similar outer disturbed features in the n - body simulations ( bournaud , combes & jog 2004 ) . \n thus the central asymmetry lasts for over @xmath11 local dynamical timescales , and will have important consequences for the evolution of the central region . \n first , it can help fuel the central active galactic nucleus , and second , it can lead to the secular growth of the bulge via the lopsided distribution . \n these need to be studied in detail theoretically . \n since this predicted evolution is due to the central asymmetry that is merger - driven , it could be important in the hierarchical evolution of galaxies .", "StartTimeOffset": 2200517428770, "RequestID": "b9c25b42d6590a77755ae86dd62e97d4b5d8d36b", "TotalTokens": 884}
{"ContextTokens": 2769, "GeneratedTokens": 63, "SynthesizedBody": "the search for new physics beyond the standard model in the future will follow two main paths : higher energy and high \n intensity  @xcite . \n neutrino facilities will play an important role in this program : neutrino masses take us beyond the standard model , and a full determination of the pattern of @xmath1 masses and mixing will require dedicated high  intensity neutrino beams  @xcite . \n however , a high  intensity @xmath1 beam can be used not only to study neutrino properties , but also as a sensitive probe of the electroweak interaction . \n indeed , it has been shown that a wide spectrum of otherwise very difficult or impossible measurements of strong and electroweak processes would become possible at a high  energy neutrino factory  @xcite . \n here we start addressing the issue whether equally interesting measurements might also be possible with a _ low energy _ but sufficiently intense @xmath1 beam . \n indeed , the main role so far of low  energy tests of the standard model  @xcite has been in the study of rare processes . here \n we will investigate whether with sufficiently high  intensity they may lead to competitive measurements of standard model parameters , specifically the electroweak mixing angle . \n the development of future neutrino facilities is driven by the study of neutrino masses and mixings , and will happen in three stages . in \n the first phase various facilities will produce conventional @xmath1 beams from the decay of a secondary meson beam ( producing typically @xmath2 @xmath1/year ) . \n examples of such facilities ( now under construction or just commissioned ) are minos and no@xmath1a , the cern / gran sasso beam , and t2k . in the second stage , \n planned for the beginning of the next decade , `` superbeams '' , i.e. conventional beams but with intensities about hundred times higher , should be constructed , exploiting very high  intensity , and relatively low energy primary proton beams . \n examples of such facilities are the second phase of t2k , exploiting a 50 gev and 7 mw proton synchrotron at jparc , and a possible high  energy superbeam at cern exploiting a 3.5  gev , 45  mw superconducting proton linac ( spl ) . in the third phase , starting perhaps towards the end of the next decade , neutrinos from decays of a _ primary _ beam are planned . \n two possible kinds of primary beams are envisaged : either a neutrino factory , i.e. relatively high  energy ( tens of gev ) muon beam , or a @xmath0beam , i.e. relatively low  energy ( few gev ) radioactive nuclei . \n the advantage of using a primary beam are higher intensity and a better control on the neutrino energy spectrum . \n the @xmath0 beam has the further advantage of giving a pure beam of electronic @xmath1 or @xmath3 , with essentially no contamination from @xmath4 or wrong  sign neutrinos . \n the neutrino factory gives a beam which is exactly 50% @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n because neutrinos only couple to weak interactions , they are an ideal probe of electroweak parameters , specifically of the electroweak mixing angle ( weinberg angle ) which controls the relative strength of neutral ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) couplings . \n electron elastic scattering offers an ideally clean setting for this measurement , which is competitive at a high energy neutrino factory  @xcite , but ( because the cross section grows linearly with the energy ) at a low  energy facility very high intensities are required  @xcite \n . a measurement of the weinberg angle can be obtained from the cc / nc deep - inelastic scattering ratio : this measurement at present is almost competitive , but marred by the uncertainty related to parton distributions  @xcite . \n it would certainly be competitive at a neutrino factory  @xcite . \n as the energy is lowered , the relative ( quasi)elastic contribution to the total cross section grows , and at an energy @xmath7 the elastic and inelastic contribution are of comparable size ( see fig . \n [ xsect ] ) . at this energy , \n at which perturbative treatment of inelastic contribution breaks down anyway , the relative elastic contribution is sizable , while total cross section is still reasonably large . \n this energy is relevant for future facilities , such as jparc , a low \n energy @xmath0 beam or the spl superbeam , and it is natural to ask whether elastic or quasielastic scattering can be used for competitive measurements of weinberg angle .    nucleon cross sections vs. energy . ] \n [ xsect ]    the answer is not obvious , because ( quasi)elastic cross sections depend on eight independent form factors  @xcite : two pairs of electric and magnetic form factors for proton and neutron targets , a pair of strange electric and magnetic form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons ) and a pair of axial isotriplet and strange form factors ( the same for protons and neutrons , up to signs ) . \n the question is then whether the uncertainty in the form factors knowledge spoils the extraction of @xmath8 from these cross sections . \n the simplest answer to the above question is obtained by a counting of the relevant physical observables . with proton and neutron ( from deuterium or other nuclei ) targets and @xmath1 and @xmath9 beams \n , one can measure four independent nc and two independent cc cross sections . \n they depend on eight form factors and the weinberg angle . \n hence , at least three form factors have to be input to the analysis . \n it is convenient to input the electric form factors , whose forward value is fixed by charge .    assuming a flux @xmath10 with energy @xmath11  gev one gets @xmath12 elastic cc events and @xmath13 nc events with either beam or target after one year of running with each beam . \n this flux and energy are typical e.g. of a low \n energy @xmath0beam , with a detector located at a distance of @xmath14  km . \n assuming that the five independent form factors and the weinberg angle are determined in each angular bin this leads to a statistical error @xmath15  @xcite . \n the further theoretical error due to the electric form factor is negligible . \n it is important to observe that these form factors must be input if one wishes to extract all the other form factors and @xmath16 . \n however , the cross section can actually be measured in a large number of angular ( or @xmath17 ) bins ( e.g. several dozens ) . \n one may thus choose to parametrize the form factors and fit these parameters as well as @xmath16 . clearly , with , say , 20 bins and several cross sections even with a very general parametrization all form factors can be determined together with the weinberg angle . \n this suggests that a more detailed analysis is worthwhile . \n the main experimental constraint is the possibility to detect cc and nc events with a neutrino beam energy between one and a few gev . \n this rules out water cherenkov detectors , because the cherenkov threshold @xmath18 for the recoiling proton implies that only protons with recoil momentum @xmath19  gev can be detected , which removes most of the cross section . \n a more promising alternative is a liquid ar tpc  @xcite . in this case \n , the only constraint is that the recoiling proton leaves a sufficiently long track so that it is not confused with nucleon motion due to nuclear effects . \n this gives a constraint on the proton energy @xmath20  mev i.e. @xmath21  mev . with a beam energy of the order of 1 gev , \n about 75% of the scattering events survives this kinematic cut . \n however , recoiling neutrons can not be detected . \n this implies that neutron neutral current ( nc ) events are essentially lost and one is left with only four independent cross sections .    in order to maximize the flux \n , one may envisage the option of having a near detector , located at a few hundreds of meters from the source , thereby obtaining fluxes by many orders of magnitude larger than those at the far detector used for oscillations studies . \n however , in a realistic analysis one should keep into account that an argon tpc might have difficulties in handling interaction rates much larger than a few events per spill . \n this would put a bound on the maximum flux .      in order to get a more quantitative estimate of the accuracy \n one can reach in the weinberg angle determination , we have generated scattering events assuming an incoming flux @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with fixed energy @xmath24  gev . \n these parameters are typical e.g. of t2k ( first phase ) with a near detector at about 300  m from the source . in the present analysis we have considered the case of a liquid argon detector with a mass of 10  ktons . \n an increase in the detector mass would correspond to a reduction in the fit uncertainty that can be easily obtained by standard statistical analysis . \n we have assumed @xmath25 and all the nucleon form factors as given in ref . \n @xcite and in ref . \n @xcite for the axial and strange form factors ; in particular for the strange magnetic form factor we used @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the neutrino momentum transfer , @xmath28 , @xmath29 nucleon mass , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    we have then performed a fit to the events thus generated , leaving as free parameters @xmath16 and the forward value of the strange magnetic form factor @xmath32 . \n we have then repeated this fit by varying the value of the forward strange axial form factor @xmath33 , considering one @xmath34 variation around its central value ( @xmath35 ) . \n these are the only forward form factors which are affected by a significant uncertainty . \n other form factor parameters have a more moderate impact . \n we get @xmath36 , where the systematic error is due to the variation of the strange axial form factor within the range indicated . \n clearly , a more detailed analysis  @xcite would require either fitting of all form factors , or varying some of their parameters within errors . \n in such an analysis we will also introduce a study of the systematical uncertainty related to the choice of the form factor parametrization . \n however , on the basis of this first estimates , we conclude that a determination of @xmath16 with an uncertainty of a few percent is not unreasonable . \n one of us , v.a . , is deeply grateful to the now 2006 organizers for providing a stimulating human and scientific atmosphere . \n he also would like to thank in

{"ContextTokens": 4052, "GeneratedTokens": 104, "SynthesizedBody": "strong multipole components of the magnetic field have long been thought to play an important role in the radio emission from pulsars . \n multipole fields have been invoked for the generation of electron positron pairs in the pulsar magnetosphere . \n for example , the ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) model requires that the radius of curvature of the field lines near the stellar surface should be of the order of the stellar radius to sustain pair production in long period pulsars . \n this is much smaller than the expected radius of curvature of the dipole field . \n such a small radius of curvature could be a signature of either an extremely offset dipole ( arons , 1998 ) or of a multipolar field ( barnard & arons , 1982 ) . \n further , soft x - ray observations of pulsars show non - uniform surface temperatures which can be attributed to the presence of a quadrupolar field ( page & sarmiento , 1996 ) . + magnetic multipole structure at and near the polar cap is also thought to be responsible for the unique pulse profile of a pulsar ( vivekanand & radhakrishnan 1980 , krolik 1991 , rankin & rathnasree 1995 ) . \n the recent estimates that there should be several tens of sparks populating the polar cap is also best explainable if multipole fields dictate the spark geometry near the surface ( deshpande & rankin 1998 , rankin & deshpande 1998 , seiradakis 1998 ) . \n significant evolution in the structure of the magnetic field during the lifetime of a pulsar may therefore leave observable signatures . \n if the multipoles grow progressively weaker in comparison to the dipole then one can expect pulse profiles to simplify with age and vice versa . \n + the evolution of the magnetic fields in neutron stars in general is still a relatively open question . during the last decade , \n two major alternative scenarios for the field evolution have emerged . \n one of these assumes that the field of the neutron star permeates the whole star at birth , and its evolution is dictated by the interaction between superfluid vortices ( carrying angular momentum ) and superconducting fluxoids ( carrying magnetic flux ) in the stellar interior . as the star spins down , the outgoing vortices may drag and expel the field from the interior leaving it to decay in the crust ( srinivasan 1990 ) . in a related model , \n plate tectonic motions driven by pulsar spindown drags the magnetic poles together , reducing the magnetic moment ( ruderman 1991a , b , c ) . \n + the other scenario assumes that most of the field is generated in the outer crust after the birth of the neutron star ( blandford , applegate & hernquist 1983 ) . \n the later evolution of this field is governed entirely by the ohmic decay of currents in the crustal layers . \n the evolution of the dipole field carried by such currents has been investigated in some detail in the recent literature ( sang & chanmugam 1987 , geppert & urpin 1994 , urpin & geppert 1995 , 1996 , konar & bhattacharya 1997 , 1998 ) . \n these studies include field evolution in isolated neutron stars as well as those accreting from their binary companions . \n the results show interesting agreements with observations lending some credence to the crustal picture . \n + in this paper , we explore the ohmic evolution of higher order multipoles in isolated neutron stars assuming the currents to be originally confined in the crustal region . \n our goal is to find whether there would be any observable effect on the pulse shape of radio emission from isolated pulsars as a result of this evolution . in section 2 \n we discuss the details of the computation and in section 3 we present our results and discuss the implications . \n the evolution of the magnetic field , due to ohmic diffusion , is governed by the equation ( jackson 1975 ) : = - ( ) , [ e_induction ] where @xmath1 is the electrical conductivity of the medium . following wendell , van horn & sargent ( 1987 ) \n we introduce a vector potential @xmath2 assuming the field to be purely poloidal , such that : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the stokes stream function . \n @xmath5 can be separated in @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the associated legendre polynomial of degree one and @xmath10 is the multipole radial function . from equation ( [ e_induction ] ) \n we obtain : - r_l = [ e_radial ] where @xmath11 is the fractional radius in terms of the stellar radius @xmath12 . \n the solution of this equation with the boundary conditions : + r_l&=&0 , + r_l & = & 0 , [ e_bc ] for a particular value of @xmath13 gives the time - evolution of the multipole of order @xmath13 . \n here , the first condition matches the correct multipole field in vacuum at the stellar surface and the second condition makes the field vanish at the core - crust boundary ( where @xmath14 , the radius of the core ) to keep the field confined to the crust . \n we assume that the field does not penetrate the core in the course of evolution , as the core is likely to be superconducting . \n the rate of ohmic diffusion is determined mainly by the electrical conductivity of the crust . \n the conductivity of the solid crust is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the phonon scattering conductivity , which we obtain from itoh ( 1984 ) as a function of density and temperature , and the impurity scattering conductivity @xmath17 is obtained from the expressions given by yakovlev & urpin ( 1980 ) . \n + we construct the density profile of the neutron star in question using the equation of state of wiringa , fiks & fabrocini ( 1988 ) matched to negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) and baym , pethick & sutherland ( 1971 ) for an assumed mass of 1.4  . as conductivity is a steeply increasing function of density and since the density in the crust spans eight orders of magnitude the conductivity changes sharply as a function of depth from the neutron star surface . \n thus the deeper the location of the current distribution , the slower is the decay . + \n another important factor in determining the conductivity is the temperature of the crust . in absence of impurities \n the scattering of crustal electrons come entirely from the phonons in the lattice ( yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) and the number density of phonons increases steeply with temperature . \n the thermal evolution of the crust therefore plays an important role in the evolution of the magnetic field . \n the thermal evolution of a neutron star has been computed by many authors , and it is clearly seen that the inner crust ( @xmath18 ) quickly attains an isothermal configuration after birth . at outer regions of the crust , the temperature follows an approximate relation , t ( ) = ( ) ^1/4 t_i ,   _ b [ temp ] where @xmath19 is the temperature of the isothermal inner crust and @xmath20 is the density above which the crust is practically isothermal . \n as the star cools , larger fraction of the crust starts becoming isothermal , with @xmath20 being approximately given by , _ \n b = 10 ^ 10 ( ) ^1.8 [ rho ] the relations [ temp ] and [ rho ] above have been obtained by fitting to the radial temperature profiles published by gudmundsson , pethick & epstein ( 1983 ) . for the time evolution of @xmath21 \n we use the results of urpin & van riper ( 1993 ) for the case of standard cooling ( the crustal temperature @xmath22 in their notation corresponds to @xmath21 above ) . + \n a third parameter that should be considered in determining conductivity is the impurity concentration . \n the effect of impurities on the conductivity is usually parametrised by a quantity @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total ion density , @xmath26 is the density of impurity species @xmath27 with charge @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the ionic charge in the pure lattice ( yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) . in the literature @xmath23 \n is assumed to lie in the range 0.0 - 0.1 . \n but statistical analyses indicate that the magnetic field of isolated pulsars do not undergo significant decay during the radio pulsar life time ( bhattacharya 1992 , hartman 1997 , mukherjee & kembhavi 1997 ) . \n it has been shown ( konar 1997 ) that to be consistent with this impurity values in excess of 0.01 are not allowed in the crustal model .      to solve equation ( [ e_radial ] ) \n we assume the multipole radial profile used by bhattacharya & datta ( 1996 , see also konar & bhattacharya 1997 ) . \n this profile contains the depth and the width of the current configuration as input parameters and we vary them to check the sensitivity of the result to these . we solve equation ( [ e_radial ] ) numerically using the crank - nicholson method of differencing . \n we have modified the numerical code developed by konar ( 1997 ) and used by konar & bhattacharya ( 1997 ) to compute the evolution of multipolar magnetic fields satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions given by equation ( [ e_bc ] ) . \n in figures [ [ f_fig1a ] ] and [ [ f_fig1b ] ] we plot the evolution of the various multipole components of the magnetic field , assuming the same initial strength for all , with time due to pure diffusion in an isolated neutron star . it is evident from the figures that except for very high multipole orders ( @xmath0 ) the reduction in the field strength is very similar to that of the dipole component . for a multipole of order @xmath13 \n there would be @xmath30 reversals across the stellar surface . for typical spin - periods \n the size of the polar cap bounded by the base of the open field lines is @xmath31 of the total surface area . to contribute to the substructure of the pulse \n therefore the required multipoles must have a few reversals in the polar cap which demands that the multipole order must be five or more . on the other hand \n if the multipole order is very large ( @xmath32 ) the fine structure would be so small that it would be lost in the finite time resolution of observations . \n therefore , @xmath13 values in the range 5 to @xmath33 would be the major contributors to the observed structure of the pulse profile . \n however , as seen from figures [ [ f_fig1a ] ] and [ [ f_fig1b ] ] multipoles of such orders evolve similarly to the dipole . \n therefore no significant evolution is expected in the pulse shape due to the evolution of the multipole structure of the magnetic field . as discussed before multipole orders contributing to the required field line curvature for pair - production are low , most prominently a quadrupole . as the evolution of these low orders \n are also very close to the dipole the radii of curvature of the field lines on the polar cap are not expected to change significantly in the lifetime of a radio pulsar . \n + to test the sensitivity of these results on the impurity concentration of the crust and the density at which the initial current is concentrated we have evolved models with various values of these parameters . \n the results are displayed in figures [ [ f_fig2a ] ] and [ [ f_fig2b ] ] where we plot the ratio of the dipole to higher multipoles at an age of @xmath34  years . \n it is seen that the results are insensitive to these parameters , particularly for low orders of multipoles of interest . \n +    krolik ( 1991 ) and arons ( 1993 ) conjectured that except for multipoles of order @xmath35 the decay rates would be similar due to the finite thickness @xmath36 of the crust over which the current is confined . \n the evolution plotted in figure [ [ f_fig1a ] ] assumes that @xmath37  km for which @xmath38 . \n however it is seen from figures [ [ f_fig1a ] ] and [ [ f_fig1b ] ] that significant decay occurs only for @xmath0 , much greater than @xmath39 . \n this is most likely caused by steep increase in conductivity towards the interior . \n + in conclusion , our results indicate that for a crustal model of the neutron star magnetic field there would be no significant change in the multipolar structure with age . \n this fact seems to be corroborated by observations : studies identifying multiple components in pulse profiles ( kramer , 1994 ) show that the number of components does not vary with the age of the pulsar . \n thus the evolution of the multipolar structure of the magnetic field is unlikely to leave any observable signature on pulsar emission . \n this is in contrast with the predictions from the plate - tectonics model of ruderman ( 1991a , b , c ) which suggests a major change in the field structure with pulsar spin evolution . \n we thank a.  a. deshpande , rajaram nityananda , n. rathnasree , v. radhakrishnan , c. shukre and m. vivekanand for helpful discussions . \n we are grateful to v. urpin for providing us the computer -

{"ContextTokens": 3251, "GeneratedTokens": 132, "SynthesizedBody": "the inflationary mechanism is still the most popular alternative to solve the main problems of the standard cosmology : the flatness , homogeneity , horizon and isotropy problems . but this mechanism is not the only one . \n the ekpyrotic mechanism manages to solve these problems by means of a previous phase of contraction before the current phase of expansion ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this slow contraction phase , \n the universe is dominated by a stiff fluid with a determined equation of state ( eos ) : @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pressure and energy density , respectively ) . with this fluid , \n the universe became flat , homogeneous and isotropic before the expansion phase , and the seeds of the structure formation were generated during this contraction phase . \n these seeds , generated by quantum fluctuations , are nearly scale - invariant and are in agreement with the latest data @xcite \n .    among the researches of the ekpyrotic universe , there exists the belief that this mechanism solves the problems of the standard cosmology as well as avoids the problems of the inflationary paradigm @xcite . according to these researches , the inflationary mechanism has two important problems : the initial conditions and multiverse - unpredictability . on the other hand \n , the ekpyrotic cosmology does not have both problems andwith the aid of other ingredients , for example , the galileon cosmology and ghost condensate @xcitemanages to avoid another issue in standard cosmology : the problem of the initial singularity . as we can see , the ekpyrotic cosmology offers us an interesting option to the inflation . \n moreover , the ekpyrotic cosmology may be extended to a cyclic cosmology . in this cyclic scenario @xcite , \n one has a endless sequence where the universe expands and contracts . \n there is no beginning for the timetherefore , the problem of initial conditions is solved in this extended version . \n the ekpyrotic mechanism is able to remove debris generated in a previous cycle , such as black holes ( bhs ) . \n thus the existence of such a mechanism is crucial to build cyclic cosmologies . \n any modern scientific cosmology has the isotropy as a feature . from the beginning of the modernity \n , the cosmology assumes that there is no favourite place or direction in the universe ( contrary to both the plato s cosmology in his _ timaeus _ and the aristotle s view in _ on the heavens _ ) . \n the physics , from this time , describes the universe as isotropic at large scales . \n hence , the current scientific cosmology , an einsteinian cosmology , is assumed to be isotropic .    in this work , by using a determined approach , we intend to show that bhs supported by an isotropic fluid exclude an eos given by the ekpyrotic phase . from the mechanism developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and generalized in @xcite , we study , using the schwarzschild metric as ansatz , the family of deformed bhs with spherical symmetry supported by an isotropic fluid obtained in @xcite . \n we point out that these solutions are forbidden when supported by a stiff fluid ( @xmath3 ) \n . this result may be interpreted as an indirect indication of the ekpyrotic phase as a period that removes inhomogeneities , anisotropies and debris of a previous cosmic phase in cyclic cosmologies that use the ekpyrotic mechanism . \n the structure of this paper is presented in the following : in section 2 we presented the ekpyrotic mechanism and its main features ; in section 3 we show the solutions , supported by a isotropic fluid , constructed by means of deformations in the schwarzschild solution ; in section 4 , the final remarks . \n we adopt the metric signature @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the newtonian constant , and @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum . \n such as the standard big bang cosmology , the ekpyrotic cosmology assumes a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as a solution of the gravitational field equations to describe the spacetime fabric . in the first version @xcite , a brane world model was used . \n but , some years later , a four - dimensional version , an effective model , was introduced in @xcite . assuming the flrw metric @xmath8,\\label{frlw}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the scale factor , which depends on the cosmic time @xmath10 \n , @xmath11 determines the spatial curvature ( @xmath12 flat universe ; @xmath13 open universe ; @xmath14 closed universe ) , and the cosmic matter - energy content is described by a perfect fluid @xmath15 , the generalized friedmann equation reads @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where dot represents a derivative w.r.t . \n time @xmath10 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 mean the energy densities of non - relativistic matter ( including dark matter ) and radiation , respectively . \n the term which depends on the @xmath20 indicates the energy density of anisotropies . \n lastly , @xmath21 denotes the energy density of the scalar field that generates the ekpyrotic phase  interpreted as a perfect fluid in the friedmann equation . \n such a field has the action @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the metric determinant , and an eos written as @xmath24 typically , the potential is given by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath7 playing the role of constants . \n a very steep potential of this type produces an eos for the ekpyrotic phase with a dominant fluid given by @xmath27 . \n such a matter content is dominant in eq . \n ( [ friedmann ] ) during a contraction phase ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) . \n the term that describes the anisotropies , @xmath30 is not dominant over the last term in eq . \n ( [ friedmann ] ) . \n then , the slow contraction phase , where the stiff fluid is dominant over other matter contents , produces a homogeneous and isotropic universe , free of the belinsky - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) instabilities , before the current expansion phase . \n the authors in @xcite have shown that the ekpyrotic mechanism works even when the initial conditions of this slow contraction phase are highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic .    however , the standard ekpyrotic mechanism with one scalar field is considered tachyonically unstable ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to solve this problem , another scalar field \n is introduced to generate a stable mechanism with nearly scale - invariant perturbations and small non - gaussianity @xcite .    in the next section \n , we will show how to build bh solutions supported by an isotropic fluid . to obtain these bhs , the approach which deforms bhs will be presented . \n contrary to the work @xcite , in this work , we do not study the initial conditions of the ekpyrotic phase and its evolution . in this article , we assume an isotropic fluid ( as a linear constraint in the deformation approach ) and show that an ekpyrotic phase does not support these deformed bhs . \n that is , an isotropic universe with eos @xmath3 , or an ekpyrotic phase where the universe is already isotropic ( close to the bounce ) , does not support the deformed geometries . \n the novel part of this work is the use of the deformation approach to show these results . \n it is possible to build isotropic bh solutions by means of deformations . from the standard singular solutions , such as schwarzschild , \n reissner - nordstrm , schwarzschild-(a)-ds and others @xcite , and regular solutions @xcite , at linear level , deformed bhs are obtained by imposing a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor ( the approach was generalized in @xcite , where other constraints were used ) . \n these deformed solutions are close to the standards bhs . \n a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor to generate isotropic solutions means : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the radial and tangential pressures , respectively , and assume the same value due to constraint ( [ constraint_2 ] ) throughout this work . \n the constraint ( [ constraint_2 ] ) used in the field equations ( [ field_equations ] ) , with the aid of the general metric with spherical symmetry @xmath35 yields to @xmath36-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{a'(r)b'(r)}{a(r)}-\\left(\\frac{a'(r)}{a(r)}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath37-\\frac{1}{2r}b'(r)-\\frac{a''(r)b(r)}{2a(r)}=0.\\label{constraint_3}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the deformed solution has @xmath38 in this sense , the birkhoff theorem is not valid .    to obtain a set of solutions close to the known solutions , we choose a function @xmath39 , and the approach yields to a function @xmath40 close to the standard case where @xmath41 in eq . \n ( [ metric ] ) . \n the approach modifies only the function @xmath40 because this modification leads to the solutions with a different spacetime structure ( event horizons , as we will see below ) . in this work , \n we follow @xcite and deal with deformations from the schwarzschild metric , where @xmath42 the ansatz is completed by @xmath43 the subscript @xmath44 stands for linear , and @xmath45 may be seen as the first - order expansion coefficient . then \n , we want to obtain deformed solutions until the linear level ( in @xcite there is a discussion on the possibility of generating deformed solutions beyond the linear level ) . according to @xcite , \n the constant @xmath46 fixes basically three kind of solutions : for @xmath47 one has either regular or singular black holes , @xmath48 may determine wormholes , and for @xmath49 , one has extremal black holes . for @xmath50 \n the standard cases are restored .    in the linear regime , \n the function @xmath51 is determined from @xmath52,\\label{blin2}\\ ] ] which is solution of eq . \n ( [ constraint_3 ] ) using the ansatz ( [ a_0])-([b ] ) , where @xmath53 the zeros of @xmath54 are important because may determine the singularities of the spacetime . in this work , @xmath54 has one real root , @xmath55 . using the ansatz ( [ a_0 ] ) in the eqs . \n ( [ blin2])-([h(r ) ] ) , one has @xmath56,\\label{blin3}\\ ] ] and the metric ( [ metric ] ) is completely determined . the zeros of @xmath57 fix the horizons ( when a metric is written in the form ( [ metric ] ) , the localization of horizons is given by the zeros of @xmath58 ) . according to @xcite , bhs are possible only with @xmath47 ( our value of @xmath46 corresponds to the @xmath59 in the cited paper ) .    for @xmath60 \n , the function @xmath40 has two zeros , @xmath61 . \n the largest zero corresponds to the event horizon @xmath62 . \n the metric is singular at @xmath63 . \n then , the spacetime structure reads @xmath64 this case corresponds to a singular bh in a noncompact universe . \n when @xmath65 , the situation is quite different : there are three zeros in @xmath40 ( the third zero is not zero of @xmath66 ) . \n there is a maximum value of @xmath67 @xmath68 . according to @xcite , these values of @xmath46 \n lead to a singular bh in a compact universe . \n the spacetime structure is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 then , these are the two types of solutions when the ansatz is given by eqs . \n ( [ a_0])-([b ] ) assuming isotropy .    with @xmath66 and @xmath40 fixed , the values of the components of the energy - momentum tensor are : @xmath71 with these components in the energy - momentum tensor , an eos is possible : @xmath72 which is almost constant and always negative outside the event horizon ( see fig . \n 1 ) . for large @xmath67 \n , @xmath73 is about @xmath74 . in the case @xmath60 , \n one has the simple limit @xmath75 at the event horizon , one has @xmath76 . in this sense , these deformed metrics may not be supported ( such as the schwarzschild-(a)-ds metric is by a fluid with eos @xmath77 ) by a stiff fluid ( @xmath3 ) , dominant in the ekpyrotic phase . then , at linear level , bhs supported by an isotropic stiff fluid are ruled out . \n but not only a stiff fluid : as we can see , these metrics are not supported by either a fluid with eos @xmath78 ( radiation ) or a phantom - like fluid ( @xmath79 ) . outside the event horizon \n , the eos assumes @xmath80 , which are values corresponding to a quintessence fluid .     obtained from isotropic deformed solutions . as we can see , this eos is pretty much constant outside the event horizon and rules out a stiff fluid @xmath81 , dominant in the ekpyrotic phase . the dashed line indicates the event horizon . in this graphic \n we use @xmath82 . ] \n the ekpyrotic cosmology is an option for the inflationary mechanism to solve the problems of the standard cosmology ( including the initial singularity ) and to generate nearly scale - invariant quantum fluctuations . \n this alternative cosmology is characterized by a slow phase of contraction , where the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter - energy contend in this phase is dominated by a stiff fluid @xmath83 . \n we show that  by means of a procedure of generating deformed isotropic black holes ( bhs ) at linear level in @xmath40 , adopting a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor  the metrics with spherical symmetry obtained from the schwarzschild metric are not supported by a stiff fluid . \n these metrics are not supported by a stiff fluid in the same sense that the schwarzschild-(a)-ds metrics may be interpreted as solutions with spherical symmetry supported by a fluid with eos @xmath77 . \n we believe that this result may be seen as an _ indirect _ indication ( it is not a strong proof ) of the ability of the ekpyrotic phase to leave the universe free of inhomogeneities and debris ( and bhs may be interpreted as debris ) in a previous phase before the current phase of cosmic expansion \n . this result may be important for cosmological cyclic models that assume an ekpyrotic phase .", "StartTimeOffset": 2281616909316, "RequestID": "1cd30e5a2219e7770ebeb552668b715a0119c257", "TotalTokens": 3383}

rich areas that contain different galaxy structures - galaxy groups , clusters and superclusters . \n the second part of the cosmic web contains nearly completely empty voids . \n this means that matter distribution follows a clearly hierarchical pattern . \n analyse of the properties of the different levels of structure  galaxy groups , clusters and superclusters , can lead us to better understanding of the evolution in the universe . \n study of the galaxy structures started on the 18 . \n century , when charles messier and f. wilhelm herschel independently produced the first catalogues of nebulae . \n w. herschel was one of the firsts who suggested that many nebula that we see are external to our own galaxy . \n he also recognized several nearby clusters and groups of galaxies . \n his work was continued by his son , john f.w . \n herschel , who already hinted at the existence of the local supercluster . in the beginning of the 20 . \n century , it became clear that many nebulae are indeed of extragalactic origin . in 1923 \n reynolds made the first reference to the existence of local supercluster , with the virgo cluster as the main body of the system @xcite . in 1927 \n lundmark studied the large - scale distribution of 55 clusters and noted that the most characteristic feature in the their distribution is the clustering tendency @xcite . \n many nearby galaxy clusters and superclusters were discovered in years 1930 - 1940 . in 1933 \n f. zwicky first estimated the mass of the galaxy cluster , thus establishing the need for dark matter@xcite . \n after the second world war , the lick and palomar sky surveys and the new spectroscopic observations provided the important database for the analysis of the large - scale distribution of galaxies . \n the search for nearby galaxy structures become more systematic . in 1958 \n abell published the catalogue of galaxy clusters @xcite . \n this publication opened a new era in the investigation of galaxy clusters . \n abell s 2712 clusters were selected using the red palomar survey plates because he realized the advantage of the red band over the blue band for the identification of distant clusters . \n abell s subjective selection criteria were also very well chosen . \n he knew that his cluster sample was incomplete at the low richness end , for this reason he defined a statistical subsample of the richest 1682 clusters . \n few years later zwicky et al . @xcite \n published also the catalogue of galaxies and clusters , but this catalogue did not exert such a large influence on the study of clusters . \n the main problem in this catalogue was that the sizes of clusters were distance - dependent and this catalogue could not be used as a statistical homogeneous cluster catalogue .    during that time \n it was realized that galaxy clusters were not the largest structures in the universe and thus the study of superclusters began . in 1962 \n abell @xcite published the first list of superclusters ( although it contained just 17 superclusters ) . in 1978 \n jeveer et al . \n @xcite described perseus and other eight superclusters and noted that majority of clusters form chains ( filaments ) . \n einasto et al . \n @xcite noted that the large - scale structure in the universe resembles cellular structure , with galaxies and galaxy clusters concentrated towards cell walls . \n large - scale numerical simulations , where structure develops via gravitational instability , confirmed this picture . a more detailed description on the history of cluster and supercluster studies has been written by biviano @xcite , where also an extensive list of references can be found . \n in order to study the large - scale distribution of galaxies , we need to know the distance of a large number of galaxies . there exist many different distance indicators , but most of them are not useful to build large and deep catalogues of galaxies because their uncertainties are too large when applied to objects lying at more than 50 mpc . \n fortunately , the cosmological expansion of the universe , provides us with a practical alternative . by hubble s law \n we know that the redshift of a galaxy will be proportional to its distance , so we can use redshift as a substitute for distance . \n galaxies have also the peculiar velocities with respect to the hubble flow and there a number of methods to recover real galaxy distances from their redshifts . by combining redshifts with angular position data \n , we can study the 3d distribution of galaxies within a field of the sky . \n redshifts surveys in the 1980s and the 1990s measured from thousands to tens of thouands galaxy redshifts . \n the first wide - angle redshift survey , which reached beyond the local supercluster , was the cfa redshift survey @xcite . \n it started in 1977 and lasted until 1982 , measuring 2400 redshifts . \n the extension of the cfa , the cfa2 survey ( 1985 - 1995 ) , on time of completion 18000 redshifts . now the multi fibre technology allows to measure redshifts of millions of galaxies . \n the large redshift surveys are usually magnitude limited and this means that in more distant regions we see only brighter galaxies . \n there are different methods to handle this problem . \n one possibility is to calculate the corrected luminosities to compensate the loss of not observed fainter galaxies . \n advantage of such a method is the maximum use of observational data . \n however , there are studies , which need to create volume - limited samples . in this case \n we can fix an absolute magnitude limit for a galaxy sample and reject all less luminous galaxies . \n below we summarize briefly the properties of the recent large redshift surveys - 2dfgrs , sdss , 6dfgs and 2mrs . \n these are the surveys that cover more than 1000 square degrees in the sky . \n the number of galaxy redshifts and the survey area for different redshift surveys are given also in fig . \n [ comp ] .    the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) measured redshifts for approximately 220000 galaxies using the 2df multi - object spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) @xcite . \n it started in 1997 and lasted until 2002 . \n the galaxies with magnitudes brighter than @xmath0 were selected from the apm galaxy catalog . \n this survey covers a region about 1500 square degrees , which is substantially smaller than in the other large redshift surveys as sdss and 6dfgs . \n however , the 2dfgrs survey is deeper than 6dfgs and sdss in its present stage . \n the mean redshift in the 2dfgrs survey is z = 0.1 . \n the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is the largest galaxy redshift survey to date . \n this survey is carried out using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico . during its first phase of operations ( sdss - i , 2000 - 2005 ) , the sdss imaged more than 8000 square degrees of the sky in five optical bandpasses and obtained spectra of galaxies selected from 5700 square degrees of that imaging . during its second phase ( sdss - ii , 2005 - 2008 ) , the sdss completed its original goals and measured around 900000 galaxy redshifts in the region about 8000 square degrees . \n the spectra were obtained for galaxies brighter than @xmath1 . at present , the sdss is continuing its third phase ( sdss - iii ) , which began to collect data in 2008 and is planned to continue until 2014 . \n the latest data release ( data release 9 ) includes about 1.5 million redshifts in the region about 14500 square degrees @xcite . \n however , this huge dataset is not yet homogeneous . to study the large - scale distribution of galaxies , \n it is recommended to use the main continuous region in the north galactic cap , that covers about 7200 square degrees ( the legacy survey ) . \n this region contains about 500000 galaxies . \n the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs)and 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) are both near - infrared selected surveys and base on the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) . \n the 2mass is the photometric survey which mapped almost all of the sky ( 99.998% ) in the near infra - red j , h and k - bands @xcite . \n the 6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgs ) measured redshifts for around @xmath2 galaxies in the 2mass galaxy catalog to a limiting magnitude of @xmath3 @xcite . \n the redshift were obtained using the 6df multi - object spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope in australia . \n the 6dfgs survey covers a region about 17000 square degrees on the southern hemisphere . \n the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) ultimately aims to determine the redshifts of all galaxies in the 2mass database to a magnitude of @xmath4 ( about 100000 galaxies ) @xcite . \n the second phase of 2mrs is now complete , providing an all - sky redshift survey of 45000 galaxies to a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 . \n this survey is the densest sampled all - sky redshift survey to date and its selection in the near infra - red reduces the impact of the zone of avoidance ( where the plane of our own galaxy obscures extragalactic objects ) . \n 2mrs provides complementary redshift information to deeper surveys like sdss and the 2dfrgs which cover smaller fractions of the sky . \n observations of the local universe show that almost half of the galaxies are located in groups . during \n the evolution galaxy groups fall into the rich clusters of galaxies , which can contain several smaller groups within . \n rich galaxy clusters are largest gravitationally bound galaxy systems and their contain about 10 per cent of the galaxies . therefore , the groups and clusters are natural environment for galaxies , and their study is important for understanding the evolution of galaxies and the underlying matter distribution . \n below we give a brief overview about the different group catalogues obtained using different redshift surveys . \n selection of group catalogues is listed in table 1 . \n the number @xmath6 is the number of groups which contain at least three galaxies . \n abell s cluster catalog @xcite was created by visual inspection of the palomar photographic plates . with the help of large redshift surveys \n , we can identify groups in three dimensional space . \n the most frequently used method to date is the friends - of - friends method ( fof , sometimes called the percolation method ) . with the fof method , \n galaxies are linked into systems , using a certain linking length ( or neighbourhood radius ) . \n [ table ]    in 1983 geller and huchra @xcite used fof method to identify groups in the cfa redshift survey . \n they identified 176 nearby galaxy groups which have three or more members . \n eke et al . \n ( 2004 ) @xcite studied the galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs survey . \n the groups were identified by means of fof method which was tested by using the cosmological n - body simulations . \n about 55 per cent of the galaxies considered were found to be in groups containing at least two members . of these , @xmath7 , contain at least three galaxies . \n crook et al . \n ( 2007 ) @xcite used fof method to identify groups in the 2mrs survey . \n they presented two catalogues of groups identified with slightly different linking lengths . \n the first catalogue was created by maximizing the number of groups containing three or more members . \n the second catalogue was created with smaller linking length to identify the largest nearby clusters individually . \n berlind et al . \n ( 2006)@xcite identified galaxy groups in volume limited samples of the sdss redshift survey . \n they optimized the fof method by using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of n - body simulations with galaxies . \n tempel et al . \n ( 2012 ) @xcite constructed a group catalogue for the sdss dr8 sample . \n they used a modified fof method with variable linking lengths to minimize the selection effects in the magnitude - limited sample . \n their final sample contains 30515 galaxy groups with three or more galaxies . \n about 46 per cent of all galaxies were found to be in groups containing at least two members . \n two other commonly used methods to identify the groups of galaxies in redshift surveys are halo - based method and the density - field method . \n the halo - based method was used by yang et al . \n ( 2007 ) @xcite to select galaxy groups from the sdss redshift survey . in the first step \n , this method uses the traditional fof algorithm to find potential group centers and then estimates the properties of the halos associated with each groups . \n this halo information is used to determine the group membership in redshift space . the second method to identify the groups , the density - field method , bases on the smoothed density field of galaxies . \n this method was used by sepp et al . \n 2013 in the sdss redshift survey @xcite . here \n the groups of galaxies are identified at the maxima of the smoothed density field of galaxies and then the fof method is applied to determine the group membership around density maxima . \n galaxy superclusters consist of galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies connected by filaments . \n they form the basic building blocks of the structure in the universe . \n most of the rich clusters are located in the superclusters and many very luminous clusters are in the cores of superclusters . \n studies of the galaxies and galaxy systems in different superclusters are important for understanding the evolution of galaxy groups and the large - scale structure in the universe . \n they are still in the beginning of virialization and in the distant future they will evolve into compact isolated systems as postulated by araya - melo et al . @xcite . from topological studies @xcite \n we know that there exist small deviations from linear gravitational evolution and these effects can be studied using galaxy superclusters . \n early supercluster catalogues have been compiled using data on clusters of galaxies . \n the superclusters of abell clusters were identified by einasto et al . \n ( 2001 ) ( e01 ) @xcite . with the advent of large redshift surveys we can study the large - scale structure of galaxies in much more detail . \n liivamgi et al . \n ( 2012 ) ( l12 - from ) studied the the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the sdss redshift survey and constructed a set of supercluster catalogues l12 @xcite . to delineate the superclusters , they calculated the large - scale luminosity density field and found regions with densities over a selected threshold . \n a similar method to identify the superclusters in the sdss survey was used also by costa - duarte et al . \n ( 2011 ) @xcite and luparello et al . \n ( 2011)@xcite . alternatively , the superclusters can be find also with the fof method . \n this method was used by basilakos @xcite to compile superclusters of galaxies from the sdss survey . \n the sloan redshift survey covers many nearby rich superclusters as the hercules supercluster and the corona borealis supercluster . \n the richest and largest system of galaxies observed in the nearby universe is the sloan great wall ( sgw ) @xcite , @xcite . \n the mean distance to this large system of galaxies is about 230 @xmath8 mpc . \n 2 shows the distribution of galaxies in the sloan great wall . \n the distribution is shown in cartesian coordinates x , y , z ( defined as in l12 ) . \n the numbers are i d numbers of superclusters in the l12 catalogue for the sdss dr8 survey . \n we can see the size of the sloan great wall , its linear size is about 300 @xmath8 mpc . \n the sgw consists of several superclusters of galaxies ; the richest of them is the supercluster scl 27 ( scl 126 in e01 ) , which contain many rich clusters of galaxies . \n another very interesting supercluster in this system is scl19 ( scl 111 in e01 ) . \n the superclusters in the sgw differ in morphology and galaxy content , which suggests that their formation and evolution has been different . \n we would like to thank the organizers of 49th winter school of theoretical physics cosmology and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . \n also we would like to thank l. j. liivamgi for stimulating discussions about superclusters and providing us with fig  [ sss ] . \n a. biviano , from messier to abell : 200 years of science with galaxy clusters , constructing the universe with clusters of galaxies , iap 2000 meeting , paris ( france ) july 2000 florence durret & daniel gerbal eds . , ( 2000 ) , 57p .", "StartTimeOffset": 2287540826490, "RequestID": "5d4386073f67b6d9242ac20d4508fcecc7f838c9", "TotalTokens": 3798}
{"ContextTokens": 1301, "GeneratedTokens": 232, "SynthesizedBody": "galaxies at the highest redshifts , z@xmath05 , are vital objects in observational cosmology . \n they formed during an era of one of the most dramatic phase changes in the history of the universe  the epoch of reionization . \n remarkably , these earliest galaxies were able to dictate the phase of the general medium in which all galaxies are imbedded . \n because of their enhanced [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios , which are the product of core collapse supernova enrichment , and old ages , the densest ( i.e. , globular clusters ) and most massive stellar systems ( i.e. , giant ellipticals ) are thought to have formed at such high redshifts in spectacular bursts of star - formation of relatively short duration ( @xmath4100 myrs to a 1 gyr ) . \n the short duration of the star - formation but the large accumulated mass must mean that these galaxies had very high star - formation intensities  the rate of star - formation per unit surface area . \n it is well - known that galaxies with high star - formation intensities drive vigorous outflows of metals and energy . \n such outflows from high redshift galaxies could have both cleared material from the galaxian surroundings allowing ionizing photons to escape as well as enriching the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . through this \n mechanism problems of how the igm was re - ionized and enriched in metals even at the highest redshifts yet observed ( this is the so - called `` pre - enrichment problem '' ) could be solved . but can we find direct evidence for this scenario in the physical properties of high redshift galaxies ? \n this is what we will attempt to address here . \n at z@xmath55 , there have been a number of significant spectroscopic surveys investigating the nature of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , or `` v- or r - band dropouts '' ) , two of which has been lead by some of the authors . \n there are now over 100 confirmed redshifts in total at z@xmath25 through the work of our eso large program ( the eso distant galaxy survey  ergs ; douglas et al . \n 2007 , in preparation ) and the study of the `` bdfs '' ( e.g. , lehnert & bremer 2003 ; lehnert et al . \n 2007 , in preparation ) . \n the eso lp is based on the ediscs fields , which are 10 widely separated intermediate - redshift cluster fields , while the `` bdfs '' are four adjacent fields observable from paranal in winter . \n our total sample constitutes the largest sample of z@xmath05 lbgs ( `` r - band drop outs '' ) with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts . in all of these fields \n , we have deep r- , i- , z - band , and irac data ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath6 m ) . some of the fields also have observations in other optical / infrared bands , including mips 24@xmath6 m data and hst acs imaging . \n in addition , we have been studying a similar population of galaxies in the goods - s , taking advantage of the deep multi - wavelength data set ( verma et al . 2007 ) . \n from our analysis of some of these extensive data sets ( verma et al . 2007 ) , we conclude :    @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 are young , with typical ages less than 100 myrs , compact , with typical half - light radii of about 1 kpc , and are rapidly forming stars , 10 to 200 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 . \n these ages are very young suggesting that they have been intensely forming stars for only a few dynamical times ( estimated from stellar mass estimates and sizes ) . \n they therefore may likely represent a population of `` primordial galaxies '' . \n @xmath7 these sources are generally so young that they likely did not substantially contribute to reionization . \n the estimates of their ages from sed suggests that they formed at redshifts of about 6 - 7 . their contribution to re - ionization would likely be after the universe was already substantially ionized . \n @xmath7 from sed fitting from the rest - frame uv through optical , the lbgs at z@xmath85 are typically about a factor of 10 less massive that similarly selected galaxies at z@xmath83 ( few x 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 compared to few x 10@xmath12 m@xmath9 ; shapley et al . \n these galaxies represent about 1% of the local mass density ( verma et al . \n 2007 ) . \n @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high stellar mass surface densities , @xmath13@xmath82 - 6 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 and have very roughly approximated core phase densities of 10@xmath16 pc@xmath17 km@xmath17 s@xmath18 \n . both of these are similar to that of bulges and spheriods of m@xmath19 galaxies at low redshift . \n @xmath7 the lbgs at z@xmath85 have high star - formation intensities , well above that needed to drive winds at low redshift , @xmath200.1 m@xmath9 kpc@xmath15 yr@xmath10 ( figure 1 ; heckman 2001 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ) . \n @xmath7 if the z@xmath85 drive strong outflows then they may be able to solve the `` pre - enrichment problem ''  whereby the metallicity of the igm does not appear to evolve strongly with redshift at least out to almost z=6 ( songaila 2001 ; ryan - weber et al . \n quantitatively ( crudely ) estimating the likely metal contribution of these galaxies suggests that they are able to solve the pre - enrichment problem ( see figure 2 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2296028979462, "RequestID": "e512c206cf5a72e72318916d98ea5247a734c93e", "TotalTokens": 1533}
{"ContextTokens": 3236, "GeneratedTokens": 141, "SynthesizedBody": "liquid argon time projection chambers ( lartpcs ) are an appealing class of detectors that offers exceptional opportunities for studying neutrino interactions thanks to the bubble - chamber quality images they can provide . \n the unique combination of position resolution , calorimetry , and scalability provided by lartpcs make them a possible technology choice for future massive detectors . \n there is an active program in the u.s . to develop lartpcs , with the final goal of constructing a massive detector that can be used as a far detector in a long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment . \n the argon neutrino teststand , or argoneut , project is an important early step in this program , and it will be the focus of this document . \n the lartpc technique has been around for several decades , with pioneering work done as part of the icarus experiment @xcite . \n a wire chamber is placed in highly - purified liquid argon , and an electric field is created within this detector . \n neutrino interactions with the argon inside the detector volume produce ionization electrons that drift along the electric field until they reach finely segmented and instrumented anodes ( @xmath0 - wireplanes ) , upon which they produce signals that are utilized for imaging and analyzing the event that occurred , as shown in fig . @xmath1 . applying proper bias voltages to the wireplanes , \n such that electrons drift undisturbed through the initial planes , allows several complementary views of the same interaction that can be combined into a three - dimensional image of the event@xcite . \n calorimetric measurements can be extracted from the pulses observed on the wireplanes . \n this technique allows for very precise imaging , the resolution being dependent on several factors : wire pitch , plane spacing , sampling rate , and electronics s / n levels . \n the wire pitch is typically on the order of several millimeters , the specific value being chosen to maximize resolution without sacrificing s / n levels . \n the rapid sampling rate ( @xmath25mhz ) characteristic of the readout electronics , combined with the slow drift speed of ionization ( @xmath21.5mm/@xmath3s ) at nominal electric field values , equates to an image resolution of fractions of a millimeter along the drift direction ( which is the coordinate common to all the wireplanes of the tpc ) . \n the technology is further made attractive in that the number of electronics channels required for the detector does not scale directly with the volume of the detector if the drift distance is increased appropriately . \n this scaling feature , along with the relatively low cost of argon , makes lartpcs an intriguing option for future massive neutrino detectors .    while lartpcs are an intriguing detector technology , they are not without their challenges . \n one of the biggest challenges is producing and maintaining argon that is pure enough to allow the ionization to drift for the required distances . to address this issue new filters that can cleanse the argon to the required purity levels necessary for a lartpc experiment , and can also be regenerated when they have become saturated , have been developed@xcite . \n these new filters are a necessary step along the path to massive detectors , and they have already been used by several test stands built in the u.s . with the goals of studying detector material effects on argon purity , and looking for cosmic - ray events in a lartpc @xcite . \n argoneut is a lartpc that is currently running in the numi beamline at fermilab . \n the argoneut project was started in order to gain experience building and operating lartpcs in a real beam environment , and also to collect a very interesting data sample that will be used to develop simulation and reconstruction code . \n argoneut will provide a sample of neutrino interactions in liquid argon for the first time ever in the u.s . \n , and for the first time ever in a low - energy beam . \n the only previous lartpc to operate in a neutrino beam was a 50-liter tpc built as part of the icarus program that ran in the wanf beam at cern in the late 1990 s @xcite . \n the energy of the numi beam ( peaking at @xmath23 gev ) is significantly lower than that of the wanf beam ( mean energy of @xmath224 gev ) , making the data accumulated by argoneut particularly interesting since this is an energy - range relevant to neutrino oscillation physics . \n argoneut s tpc is a rectangular volume measuring 90 cm x 40 cm x 48 cm , containing an active volume of @xmath2175 liters of liquid , that is positioned inside of a vacuum jacketed cryostat . \n figure [ fig : tpc_pics ] depicts the tpc before and after it was inserted into the inner cryostat volume . \n the tpc consists of three wireplanes , each with 4 mm wire pitch . \n the innermost induction plane has vertical wire orientation , but is not instrumented with readout electronics and is used primarily for pulse shaping . \n the middle induction plane has 240 wires oriented at + 60@xmath4 with respect to the horizontal beam direction , while the outermost collection plane has 240 wires oriented at -60@xmath4 with respect to the horizontal beam direction . \n both the middle induction plane and the collection plane are instrumented with readout electronics . \n the maximum drift distance in the tpc , from the cathode to the first induction plane is 48 cm . \n the operating cathode voltage of 25kv creates an electric field of 500v / cm , at which the drift speed is 1.55 mm/@xmath3s . \n the inside of the tpc contains 23 field  rings \" that are 1 cm in thickness , formed from machined copper - clad g10 sheets , with consecutive rings connected by four 100m@xmath5 resistors in parallel . \n a custom electronic readout system has been built for the argoneut detector . \n bias voltage distribution cards ( bvdcs ) , that provide filtered voltage to the wireplanes , are placed directly on the tpc . \n each bvdc connects to 24 tpc wires , and sends output signals to ribbon cables that connect to a custom feedthrough circuit board designed by fermilab . \n preamplifier boards , each of which contain 16 fet preamplifiers , reside in a faraday - cage enclosure surrounding the signal - feedthrough board flange . \n the input signals to the preamplifier boards are sent through a wide bandwidth filter that removes frequencies outside of the expected range . \n the amplified signals are sent to digitization boards ( adf2 cards , on loan from the d0 experiment ) which sample the waveform at 5mhz ( 198ns / sample ) . \n the daq system is triggered by a clock signal associated with the numi beam spill , causing each channel to begin recording 2048 adc samples with 10-bit resolution . \n the total readout time for a single trigger is @xmath2400@xmath3s , which is significantly longer than the maximum drift time of particles in the tpc ( 333@xmath3s ) allowing for pre / post - sampling of each spill . \n the pre / post - sampling information is useful for removing spurious tracks that come from outside of the beam window . \n figure [ fig : electronic_pics ] shows several of the components of the tpc readout system . \n the main component of the argoneut cryogenic system is a 550 liter vacuum - insulated cryostat that houses the tpc and contains feedthrough ports for all of the instrumentation of the experiment . \n argoneut uses a self - contained recirculation system to continually pass the liquified argon in the system through the new fermilab style filters . \n boil - off vapor from the inner cryostat is directed vertically up to a 300w gifford - mcmahon cryocooler , where it is condensed and directed back down through one of three return paths to the inner cryostat . \n two of these return paths contain filters , while the third is a bypass line that is used during maintenance of the other pathways . \n the three return lines merge before entering the cryostat , wherein they are guided down to the bottom of the liquid volume and empty through a sintered - metal cap . \n figure [ fig : cryo_pics ] shows the argoneut detector as it looked in the summer of 2008 during a commissioning run on the surface . in this figure \n the outer cryostat flange is removed , showing the inner cryostat wrapped in superinsulation . \n the experiment is outfitted with numerous safety features to maintain the oxygen deficiency hazard ( odh ) rating of the numi tunnel . \n all cryogenic plumbing contains relief valves that are routed to a vent line that extends up the numi shaft and out to the surface . in this way \n any argon gas that is vented , or that might leak from a pipe , is not released into the tunnel but rather is guided out to the surface \n . the outer cryostat acts as a secondary containment vessel in case the inner vessel leaks , and a  bathtub \" acts as tertiary containment in case both cryostats develop leaks . \n the  bathtub \" contains odh sensors that trigger alarms and mixing fans if a leak is detected . \n a dedicated process - control system was built for argoneut that allows remote monitoring of all systems and remote control over important valves . \n argoneut is currently running in the numi tunnel at fermilab , where it is positioned approximately in the center of the beam , and directly upstream of the minos near detector . \n argoneut s tpc is too small to contain the majority of muons produced in neutrino interactions from the energetic numi beamline . to compensate for the information lost by particles exiting the detector \n , argoneut will utilize the minos near detector as a range stack to capture the full trajectories of these particles . since minos is magnetized \n there is the possibility to perform charge identification by matching a track in argoneut with a track in minos . \n despite argoneut s small detector volume , it will collect a significant sample of neutrino / antineutrino interactions . as was mentioned previously \n , this will be the first such sample from a lartpc operating in the u.s . \n , and the first sample ever in a low - energy ( few gev ) neutrino beam . \n there are several physics analyses that can be carried out with the argoneut data sample , with one of the most interesting coming from the several thousand charged - current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) events that will be collected in antineutrino mode . \n these events will be recognized by a muon created in the volume of the tpc , possibly accompanied by one or more proton tracks created by a final - state neutron . by utilizing the minos near - detector to \n range - out muons originating from argoneut their energy can be determined , allowing a first measurement of the ccqe cross - section on argon for neutrinos in the few - gev range . \n this result will be particularly interesting for neutrino oscillation physics , since knowledge of the ccqe cross - section is crucial to oscillation analyses . \n the ability of lartpcs to see low - energy nuclear fragments created in neutrino interactions , and to determine their impact on the cross - section measurements , may also prove to be very interesting . \n members of the argoneut collaboration are working on developing a full software environment for analyzing their data . \n the software being developed will be utilized for everything from simulating neutrino interactions in a lartpc to reconstructing the interactions starting from the raw tpc data . \n such software does not currently exist in the u.s . , but is a necessary tool for any future large lartpc detector where the statistics of the data will be greatly increased . \n one of the main goals of argoneut is to utilize this new software to fully develop the @xmath6 particle identification technique , and to provide a measurement of the capabilities of the technology to separate electron tracks from photon tracks . \n this software will be used for future lartpc detectors , such as the microboone experiment , so early experience gained from argoneut will be important . \n argoneut was filled with liquid argon for the first time in its underground location in may 2009 . \n the initial electron lifetime was much lower than anticipated , but after several weeks of recirculating through the closed - loop filtration system the lifetime had recovered significantly . \n many neutrino events were recorded during this initial run before the summer 2009 fermilab shutdown . \n the raw data from several of these events are displayed in figs . \n [ fig : argoneut_event1 ] , [ fig : argoneut_event2 ] , and [ fig : argoneut_event3 ]    each event display depicts the information from the instrumented induction and collection plane of argoneut . \n the horizontal axis is the wire number within each of the planes , while the vertical axis is the sampling time of the daq , which is common to both the induction and collection views . \n figure [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] depicts the collection plane view , and also shows the raw pulse information for a particular wire ( @xmath7140 ) of the collection plane . \n there are three clear pulses visible in this wire , with the third pulse containing a double - peak that indicates the presence of two closely spaced tracks . \n the collaboration is currently developing algorithms for analyzing the tpc data . \n the dark vertical bands visible in the collection view of figures [ fig : argoneut_event2 ] and [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] are a result of a baseline shift in the adcs after recording energetic hits . \n fourier deconvolution can be performed on the raw data to accurately remove this baseline shift and return the true waveform . \n several hit finding methods are being considered to isolate the important sections of the waveforms recorded after each trigger . extracting overlapping hits , such as those depicted in figure [ fig : argoneut_event3 ] , will provide information about the two - track separation achievable in these detectors . \n the author would like to acknowledge the support staff at fermilab for their invaluable contributions in the planning and construction of argoneut . \n also , the department of energy and the national science foundation .    9 the liquid -

strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) , ks  1731 - 260 ( 524 hz , smith , morgan & bradt 1996 ) , a source near the galactic center ( 589 hz , strohmayer , jahoda & giles 1997 ) , aql x-1 ( 549 hz , zhang et al . 1998 ) , 4u 1636 - 536 ( 581/290 hz , strohmayer et al . \n 1998 , miller 1999 ) , and 4u 1702 - 429 ( 330 hz , markwardt , strohmayer & swank 1999 ) . \n the observed frequencies are close to the 401 hz spin frequency of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , further strengthening the identification of these frequencies with the neutron star spin . \n the detailed energy dependence of these burst oscillations is one avenue that remains to be explored . here \n i show that the low energy photons in a burst oscillation from aql x-1 lag the high energy photons by roughly 15% of the oscillation period . \n lags of the same sign and similar magnitudes have also been detected in other fast signals from low mass x - ray binaries : the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations , qpos ( vaughan et al . \n 1997 , 1998 , kaaret et al . 1999 ) and the sax j1808.4 - 3658 pulsed emission ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) . \n a simple mechanism of doppler shifted emission may explain these lags . \n strong doppler effects are expected to be important since the fast spin rates imply high speeds ( @xmath1 ) . as a hot spot on \n the spinning neutron star approaches the observer ( at early phases ) the emission is doppler boosted and blue shifted , as it recedes ( at later phases ) the emission is deboosted and red shifted . at early phases the spectra are also attenuated due to the smaller projected area . \n the result is that low energy photons are preferentially emitted after the high energy photons . \n a quantitative test of this doppler delay scenario matches the observed low energy lags in aql  x-1 well . \n the possibility of doppler effects and the fact that they may manifest in pulse phase spectroscopy has been noted before by strohmayer et al . \n ( 1998 ) .    in the next section \n i present the measurement of the lag in the x - ray burst from aql x-1 . in section  3 \n i describe a simple model for the relativistic effects and compare the predicted delays to those observed . \n section  4 discusses these results in a broader context . \n for this analysis i consider the x - ray burst from aql  x-1 starting 1 1997 march 1 23:27:40 utc ( see zhang et al . 1998 for a report of this burst ) . \n i use data from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) in an ` event ' mode with high time resolution ( 122@xmath2sec ) and high energy resolution ( 64 channels ) . \n a section of the lightcurve is shown in figure  1 ( top ) . \n there are gaps in the event mode data since the required telemetry rate is high . within the 4 second time window shown in figure  1 ( top ) , \n the power density spectrum for all the channels shows a strong oscillation at 549.7 hz ( figure  1 , bottom ) . in the following \n i calculate fourier transforms within this time window . \n phase delays in a signal between two energy bands are quantified by means of cross spectral analysis ( van der klis et al . \n 1987 ; for more information see vaughan et al . 1994 ; nowak et al . \n the cross spectrum is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the measured complex fourier coefficients for the two energy bands at a frequency @xmath5 . \n the phase lag between the signals in the two bands is given by the argument of @xmath6 ( its position angle in the complex plane ) . \n the error in the phase lag is calculated here from the coherence function uncorrected for counting statistics ( nowak et al . \n the cross correlation code used here has been employed to calculate phase lags in black hole candidates ( ford et al . \n 1999 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 and kilohertz qpos and matches the results reported in the literature . \n figure  2 shows the resulting phase lags from the cross spectra of the 4 seconds of data described above . \n negative numbers indicate that the oscillations in the low energy band ( 3.55.7 kev ) lag those in the higher energy bands . \n the lags are calculated by averaging the signal in the range 549.6550.1 hz . \n the delays in each band up to 30 kev ( where background dominates ) are 3@xmath7 significant . \n the delay between 3.55.7 kev and the entire 5.743.6 kev band is @xmath8 rad , 5@xmath7 significant . \n deadtime effects can in principle affect the measured phase lag . \n the data considered here are in the tail of the burst ( rate of 9280 c / s , full energy band ) where deadtime is less important . \n one method of correcting for deadtime is to subtract a cross vector averaged over high frequencies where no correlation is expected ( van der klis et al . \n employing this correction does not change the values measured here .    due to the data \n gaps it is not possible to perform cross correlations on long stretches of data earlier in the burst . \n cross correlations on 0.5 sec intervals of data earlier in the burst return large errors on phase delays with inconclusive results . \n as a simple model for the lags i consider discrete hot spots on the surface of the rotating neutron star . the rest frame emission of the clump is a blackbody . \n the observed spectrum at frequency @xmath9 at spin phase @xmath10 is : @xmath11 ^ 3\\ ] ] @xmath12^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lorentz factor , @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the rest frame temperature ) , @xmath2 is the sine of the angle between the spin axis and the line of sight , and @xmath17 is a normalization . the above formula is a relativistic transformation of the blackbody which shifts @xmath18 and modifies the normalization such that @xmath19 is conserved ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . \n the @xmath20 term is an area projection factor , with @xmath21 the angle between the normal and line of sight in the rest frame ( @xmath22 ) . \n the phase angle , @xmath10 , is defined such that phase zero is with the spot approaching the observer directly . \n the spots are considered small and isotropically emitting in the rest frame . \n i take @xmath16=1 kev , @xmath23 . \n these are values appropriate for the neutron star ; a more exact value of @xmath16 is in principle possible from the spectral fits but this depends on the fraction of the surface contributing to the modulated hot spot emission . \n a more exact value of @xmath24 depends on the neutron star radius . \n i also take @xmath25 , i.e. a line of sight through the equator . \n the spin frequency is 275 hz and two antipodal hot spots produce an oscillation at 550 hz . \n such a geometry , where the @xmath26550 hz signal is a harmonic of the spin , is suggested by recent results on other burst oscillations ( miller 1999 ) . \n the resulting spectra are blackbodies whose temperature shifts by 10% over the period . averaged over phase , the spectrum is approximately blackbody in shape with @xmath18 within 1% of the input @xmath16 . \n the spectra as a function of @xmath10 , folded through the rxte response matrix , yield lightcurves of count rates in various energy bands . from these lightcurves \n i calculate the phase lag in the 550 hz signal with the fft and cross - correlation programs used in the measurements above . \n the results of this calculation are shown with the data in figure  2 . \n there are no free parameters , only the assumptions taken above . \n the calculated lags will decrease if @xmath16 is increased or @xmath24 is decreased . \n the smaller delay for higher @xmath16 happens since the peak of the lightcurves comes later in phase for higher energy photons , corresponding to a smaller delay between high and low energy photons . \n observing at higher inclinations ( decreased @xmath2 ) will also decrease the lag . \n the lightcurves that yield these predicted lags generally have maxima at earlier phases for higher energies and are more sharply peaked in shape at higher energies . \n this simple model neglects general relativistic effects ( e.g. strohmayer 1992 , miller & lamb 1998 ) . \n two main factors from gr will effect the observed light curves . \n gravitational bending makes the spots observable at @xmath27 or @xmath28 , stretching the pulse . \n light travel time delays , longer for more extreme bending , will also shift the pulse . \n these effects depend on the compactness of the star . \n given the quality of the present data , a more detailed treatment including these effects is not justified . \n an overall gravitational redshift also means that @xmath18 in the local frame is higher , as in x - ray burst spectral models . \n the previous sections show that low energy photons lag high energy photons in the oscillation signal of an x - ray burst from aql x-1 . \n the sign and magnitude of the lags are in agreement with the simple model considered in section  3 of two hot spots on the neutron star producing a doppler boosted and shifted spectra as the star rotates . \n this doppler delay mechanism for producing low energy lags may describe not only the lags in the x - ray burst oscillations but also the lags in the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) and the ( lower frequency ) kilohertz qpos ( vaughan et al . \n 1997 , 1998 ; kaaret et al . \n both show a lag of low energy photons relative to high energy photons with magnitudes of roughly @xmath26100 @xmath2sec ( @xmath29 rad ) for sax j1808.4 - 3658 and @xmath2630 @xmath2sec ( @xmath30 rad ) for the kilohertz qpos in similar energy bands to those considered here . \n some models link the frequency of the kilohertz qpos to a keplerian motion in the disk ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , stella & vietri 1999 ; but see titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) . \n if any of the kilohertz qpos is a result of keplerian motion , one might expect a soft lag due to doppler delays . \n such lags have been observed in what is likely the lower frequency of the two qpos . \n doppler delays are an alternative to previous mechanisms invoked to produce lags . \n comptonization has been one process used to explain low energy lags in sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) . \n low energy lags are produced if high energy photons are injected into a relatively cool comptonizing cloud . \n this is the opposite of the situation normally considered : comptonization by a hot cloud in the same region . \n a hot cloud produces a lag of high energy photons , as shown quantitatively for fast signals by lee & miller ( 1998 ) . \n another mechanism suggested for low energy delays is an extended , cooling hot spot with lower energy photons from the outer regions ( cui , morgan & titarchuk 1998 ) . \n more measurements of phase lags in x - ray burst oscillations are clearly needed , in particular in the @xmath26350 hz oscillations which are likely from single spots . \n improved statistics will also yield a better test of the predicted energy dependence of the lags . \n i thank michiel van der klis , jan van paradijs , mariano and walter lewin for helpful comments . \n i thank katja pottschmidt and coworkers at the university of tuebingen for comparisons of our cross correlation codes . \n i acknowledge support by the netherlands foundation for research in astronomy with financial aid from the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) under contract numbers 782 - 376 - 011 and 781 - 76 - 017 and by the netherlands researchschool for astronomy ( nova ) . \n cui , w. , morgan , e.h . & titarchuk , l. 1998 , apjl , 504 , l27 ford , e.c . , van der klis , m. , , m. , van paradijs , j. & kaaret , p. 1999 , \n apjl , 512 , l31 kaaret , p. , piraino , s. , ford , e.c . & santangelo , a. 1999 , apjl , 514 , l31 lee , h.c . & miller , g.s . \n 1999 , mnras , 299 , 479 markwardt , c.b . , strohmayer , t.e . & swank , j.h . 1999 , \n apjl , 512 , l125 miller , m.c . 1999 , astro - ph/9809235 , submitted apj miller , m.c . \n , lamb f.k . & psaltis , d. 1998 , apj , 508 , 791 miller , m.c . & lamb f.k . \n 1998 , apjl , 499 , l37 nowak , m.a . , \n vaughan , b.a . , wilms , j. , dove , j.b . \n , & begelman , m.c . \n 1999 , apj , 510 , 874 rybicki , g.b . & lightman , a.p . \n 1979 , _ radiative processes in astrophysics _ , \n ( new york : wiley ) smith , d.a . \n , morgan , e.h . & bradt , h. 1997 , apjl , 479 , l137 stella , l. & vietri , m. 1999 , prl , 82 , 17 strohmayer , t.e . , zhang , w. , swank , j.h . , \n white , n.e . & lapidus , i. 1998 , apjl , 498 , l135 strohmayer , t.e . , zhang , w. & swank , j.h . \n , 1997 , apjl , 487 , l77 strohmayer , t.e . \n , jahoda , k. & giles , b. , 1997 , apj , 486 , 355 strohmayer , t.e . \n , zhang , w. , swank , j.h . , smale , a. , titarchuk , l. & day , c. 1996 , apjl , 469 , l9 strohmayer , t.e . \n 1992 , apjl , 388 , 138 titarchuk , l. , lapidus , i. & muslimov , a. 1998 , apj , 499 , 315 van der klis , m. et al . \n 1987 , apj , 319 , l13 vaughan , b.a . \n 1997 , apj , 483 , l115 vaughan , b.a . \n 1998 , apjl , 509 , l145 vaughan , b.a . \n 1994 , apj , 421 , 738 wijnands , r. & van der klis , m. 1998 , nature , 394 , 344 zhang , w. , jahoda , k. , kelley , r.l . , \n strohmayer , t.e . , \n swank , j.h . & \n zhang , s.n . \n 1998 , apjl , 495 , l9", "StartTimeOffset": 2305953963078, "RequestID": "1436e749965620585d6e79c38f2607d186846618", "TotalTokens": 3957}
{"ContextTokens": 2020, "GeneratedTokens": 152, "SynthesizedBody": "in a binary system where at least one of the stars is surrounded by a circumstellar disk , tidal waves excited by the companion propagate into the disk . if the disk and the orbital plane are coplanar , these waves are called density waves . in a noncoplanar system , both density and bending waves are excited . they are respectively of even and odd symmetry with respect to reflection in the disk midplane . \n the pattern speed @xmath0 with which the tidally excited pattern rotates is @xmath1 and @xmath2 for density and bending waves , respectively , where @xmath1 if the binary angular speed . \n the disk is truncated by tidal effects in such a way that its radius is not greater than about one  third of the separation of the system ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 , paczyski 1977 , larwood et al . \n 1996 for the non coplanar case ) . therefore , @xmath0 is smaller than the angular speed of the gas in the disk , and the tidal pattern carries negative angular momentum ( or , in other words , the torque exerted on the disk by the companion is negative ) . through dissipation of the waves , \n the disk then loses angular momentum and disk material flows inwards , whereas the companion star , which excites the waves , gains this angular momentum .    since there is no corotation resonance in the disk , secular exchange of angular momentum between the disk rotation and the orbital motion \n occurs only if the waves dissipate , either in the bulk of the disk or at its boundaries ( goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) . in a laminar disk , dissipation of tidal waves may arise through shocks . \n a shock front forms when the group velocity of the wave relative to that of the fluid ( or , equivalently , the perturbed velocity ) is supersonic . \n shocks are very dissipative so the wave amplitude can not rise much above the level where the front first forms . in other words , \n the wave is decelerated at the shock front in such a way as to restore marginally sonic wave motion . \n conservation of wave action may tend to cause the amplitude of the ( shock)wave to increase again as it propagates further in , but this effect is balanced by shock dissipation maintaining the amplitude at the marginal level . \n tidally  induced angular momentum transport has been considered as an alternative to turbulent transport ( shu 1976 , sawada et al . \n 1986 , spruit et al . \n 1987 , larson 1989 , see also larson in this volume ) . \n it is viewed as particularly attractive in disks where the ionization level is too low for the magnetorotational instability to operate ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) . however , while the presence of spiral waves have been inferred in the accretion disk of the dwarf nova ip  peg ( steeghs et al . \n 1997 ) , there are no indications that they are associated with significant angular momentum transport . \n below we consider successively the case of density and bending waves . \n there are two main obstacles to the propagation of density waves down to small radii . \n first , if the disk is vertically stratified , the wave front tends to be tilted upwards so that the wave action migrates towards the surface of the disk and into any atmosphere it possesses where it can take on high amplitude and be dissipated ( lin et al . \n 1990a , 1990b ) . only under the artificial assumptions of a strict polytropic edge and no dissipation \n can it be channeled into and remain in a very narrow surface waveguide ( ogilvie & lubow 1999 ) . \n migration of wave action towards the surface ( or wave refraction ) is more effective for high azimuthal mode number @xmath3 , but is still efficient for the two  armed spirals which are predominantly excited in binaries . \n this is because even though these waves have a larger wavelength in the linear regime , if they become nonlinear their profile necessarily distort and develop short wavelength components for which refraction might be important . \n the second obstacle to long range wave propagation is a low temperature or , equivalently , a high mach number ( e.g. , spruit 1987 , savonije et al . \n 1994 , godon et al . \n 1998 , armitage & murray 1998 , blondin 2000 ) . \n this is because the characteristic wavelength of the excited waves decreases with increasing mach number , so that it becomes very small compared with the scale associated with the forcing potential ( lin & papaloizou 1993 ) . \n the torque , which is obtained by integrating over the volume of the disk the perturbed mass density times the tidal force , is then very small . \n there have been a number of 3d numerical calculations of tidal shock waves ( see yukawa et al . \n 1997 and references therein , haraguchi et al . 1999 ) but the loss of disk angular momentum has not been computed in these calculations . \n spiral shocks were seen in some of these simulations , but they were much less distinct than in 2d . even in 2d , where refraction is absent and therefore tidal effects are overestimated , the pattern observed in ip  peg can be reproduced only in the outer disk during outburst , when the enhanced viscosity pushes the disk edge into a region of strong gravitational perturbations from the secondary ( armitage & murray 1998 ) , or for unrealistically hot disks ( godon et al . 1998 ) . \n note that observations themselves only show spirality in the outer disk in ip  peg . in 2d , \n calculations by savonije et al . \n ( 1994 ) and blondin ( 2000 ) suggest that wave  driven accretion onto the central star occurs in disks where the mach number is smaller than about 10 , whereas it is inefficient when the mach number is larger than about 20 . \n since the mach number in protostellar disks is thought to be larger than 10 ( the disk aspect ratio is around 0.050.1 ) , tidally \n induced transport is probably not significant in the disk inner parts . \n bending waves are more efficient at transporting angular momentum in a disk than density waves , because they have a longer wavelength ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) . for the same reason they can also propagate down to smaller radii . \n papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) calculated the @xmath4 bending wave response of an inviscid disk with the rotation axis misaligned with a binary companion s orbital rotation axis . \n they assumed that the waves were dissipated by nonlinear interaction with the background flow before reaching the disk inner edge , so that all their angular momentum was deposited into the disk . \n they found that @xmath4 bending waves can lead to the accretion of the disk on a timescale in excess of a few times @xmath5 years . \n terquem ( 1998 ) calculated the tidal torque in a viscous disk ( where the waves are viscously damped ) and found that it can be comparable to the torque communicated internally by horizontal viscous stress acting on the background flow when the perturbed velocities in the disk are on the order of the sound speed . \n the tidal torque can exceed the horizontal viscous torque only if the viscous stress tensor is anisotropic with the parameter @xmath6 which couples to the vertical shear being larger than that coupled to the horizontal shear . \n when the perturbed velocities become supersonic , shocks reduce the amplitude of the perturbation such that the disk moves back to a state where these velocities are marginally sonic ( nelson & papaloizou 1998 ) . \n when shocks occur , the tidal torque exerted on the disk may become larger than the horizontal viscous torque . \n terquem ( 1998 ) also found that if the waves are reflected at the center , resonances occur when the frequency of the tidal waves is equal to that of some free normal global bending mode of the disk . \n if such resonances exist , tidal interactions may then be important even when the binary separation is large . \n however , it is unlikely that in a realistic accretion disk waves can be reflected at the disk inner edge . therefore , in a viscous disk \n , it is unlikely that transport of angular momentum is increased by more than a factor two or so by tidal effects . \n it was also found that if @xmath6 is larger than about @xmath7 , bending waves are damped before they can reach the disk inner parts . \n tidal effects in pre  main sequence binary systems are important for truncating protostellar disks and for determining their size . however , once the disk is truncated , the calculations reviewed above suggest that tidally  induced angular momentum transport does probably not play a dominant role . where the disk is ionized enough so that the magnetorotational instability can develop , transport of angular momentum is most probably dominated by magnetic turbulence . \n if the disk is laminar , the amount of transport provided by tidal waves is unlikely to be large enough to account for the dissipation of the disk on a timescale on the order of a few million years . \n in addition , tidal effects tend to be exerted mainly at the disk outer edge , where the perturbation is the strongest . \n strong tidal effects at the outer edge of the disk would allow mass from the outer region to retract inwards , subsequently weakening the tides at the edge . \n some pile up of mass may result at smaller radii , but whether that would affect significantly the whole disk would depend on the disk mass .", "StartTimeOffset": 2315184547326, "RequestID": "2c1a55a249e2b30c5a7c6b65650021ab8419c45e", "TotalTokens": 2172}

band filter . \n a total of 82 images were collected in this case , with exposure times of 120s and airmasses between 1.081.62 . \n this time we monitored the target over 5.85 hours with an average time of cadence of 4.28 min . \n the photometric precision per frame is @xmath6 3 @xmath16 mmags , from poisson noise alone . \n equation ( 10 ) from dravins et al ( 1998 ) gives a scintillation level of 0.74 mmags in the nd0.9 band and 0.37 mmags in the b - band , for our exposure times , at an intermediate airmass of 1.4 ( we used for these calculations a telescope aperture diameter of 100 cm , an observatory height of 2100 m , and an atmospheric scale height of 8000 m ) . our photometric precision is therefore limited by scintillation . \n each image was bias substracted and flatfielded using the same combined bias and the combined flats in each filter . \n next we performed aperture photometry on the target , comparison , and check stars in each calibrated frame over a series of apertures ranging between 10 and 30 pixels for the nd0.9 data and between 10 and 26 pixels for the b - band data . \n the area used to compute the sky background around each star was the same in all frames , i.e. a 15-pixel annulus at a radius of 40 pixels from the center of the stars . \n the sky background around each star was computed using a @xmath17-clipping algorithm in order to avoid contamination by nearby objects or residual bad pixels . \n the optimal combination of apertures for each light curve was derived following a procedure analogous to the one described in lpez - morales ( 2006 ) . \n the average dispersion of the comparison and check stars is of the order of 0.8 mmags in both filters . \n small differential extinction effects are apparent in the differential light curve of the target and the comparison . \n those effects have been corrected by applying second order extinction correction equations of the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 + where @xmath20 indicates the difference in the associated quantities for each star , as derived by hardie ( 1962 ) . @xmath20nd and @xmath20b are the differences in instrumental magnitude of the target and comparison stars in nd0.9 and b - band , respectively . \n @xmath20x is the difference in airmass between the two objects . \n this value changes with time , depending on the position of the objects in the sky . in our particular case \n , the absolute value of @xmath20x varies between 1.5 @xmath16 and 1.3 @xmath21 for the range of airmass covered by our observations . \n @xmath20(b - v ) is the difference in color between the two stars , in this case @xmath20(b - v ) = 0.3 . \n finally , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the extinction and color coefficients in nd0.9 and b. the values of those coefficients have been adopted from recent measurements by hamuy et al . \n ( 2006 ) , where they compute average values of extinction and color coefficients at the swope telescope over @xmath6 230 nights , in different filter bands . \n for the nd0.9 filter we used the values of the coefficients in v - band . \n the final light curves are presented in figure 1 . \n figure 1a shows the 6.33 hour time series coverage of gj 581 with the nd0.9 filter , with an average standard deviation of the light curve of 1.65 mmags . \n the light curve in b - band is represented in figure 1b . \n the time coverage of this second light curve is 5.85 hours . \n the average standard deviation of the light curve in this case is 1.17 mmags . \n a file containing the data in this figure is available online . \n a sample of the contents of that file are illustrated in table 1 . \n notice that the observed photometric dispersion in the light curves is larger than expected from the scintillation levels computed in section 2 . \n this discrepancy can be attributed to uncertainties in the estimation of the scintillation noise , low - level systematics in our data , or intrinsic variability of the stars . \n to determine whether or not a planet transit is present in our data , we need to estimate the transit duration and transit depth of gj 581b . in turn \n we need to estimate the radius of the planet , the radius of the star , the orbital separation between the two objects , and the orbital period of the system . \n the orbital separation and orbital period have been determined by bonfils et al . \n ( 2005a ) , who find gj 581b to be on a circular orbit around the star , at a distance of 0.041 au , and with an orbital period of 5.366 days . \n gl 581 is an m3 dwarf with an estimated mass of 0.31 @xmath26 0.02 @xmath27 ( estimated from stellar mass - luminosity relations ; see bonfils et al . \n that mass corresponds to a radius of about 0.29 @xmath26 0.03 @xmath5 , based on the mass - radius relation models by baraffe et al . \n ( 1998 ) . \n the radius of the planet will depend heavily on its interior composition . \n a neptune - mass planet can plausibly range from 1.55 to 9.5 @xmath28 , depending on whether the object is fully composed of iron ( seager et al . \n , in preparation ) or if it is an evaporating h / he gas planet ( baraffe et al . 2005 ) . the radius of a planet composed of a large fraction of h / he as close to the host star as gj 581b will also be affected by the amount of stellar luminosity incident on the planet . \n this in turn depends on distance to the star as well as the planet s albedo and energy transportation mechanism . \n these last two parameters are currently unknown for extrasolar planets . at present only an estimation of the albedo of hd209458b has been reported by rowe et al . \n ( 2006 ) , who find a 3@xmath17 upper limit for this parameter of @xmath6 0.25 . \n for all of the above reasons it is difficult to estimate a radius for gj 581b a priori of any measured transits . \n based only on geometry , we can estimate upper limits for the transit depth and hence planet radius . \n assuming an edge - on configuration ( @xmath29 = 90 deg ) and a circular orbit , the transit duration can last between 85 to 99 minutes for the range of planetary radii 1.487 @xmath28 . \n that range of radii also gives transit depths between @xmath6 2.5 and 54 mmags , assuming full transits and a uniform luminosity of the surface of the star ( i.e. , no limb darkening or star spots ) . \n figure 2 shows a schematic of full transits of a 1.48 @xmath28 ( solid line ) , a 3.9 @xmath28 ( dashed line ) , and a 7.0 @xmath28 ( dotted line ) superimposed on our nd0.9 filter and b - band light curves . \n these schematic box models do not include any physical effects associated with either the planet or the star . \n the horizontal error bars below each transit illustrate the uncertainty in the predicted mid - transit time . \n the 2@xmath17 limit in the photometric dispersion of the light curves around the expected time of transit ( binned in a 85 minute time bin ) is @xmath6 2 mmags in both light curves . \n it is clear that transits of the illustrated depths and durations do not occur during either one of the predicted transit windows . from the 2@xmath17 limit above , combined with the radius for gl 876 a \n , we can discard the presence of full transits of planets as small as 1.48 @xmath28 at inclinations higher than 88.1 deg . \n our observations therefore rule out transits of gj581b for inclinations larger than 88.1 deg and a planetary radius larger than 1.48 @xmath28 . \n transits could still be present if @xmath30 because they are not detectable within the photometric dispersion of our light curves . only higher precision , either ground- or space - based , observations will be able to find out if transits of planets smaller than our radius detection limit occur . \n intrinsic low - amplitude photometric variability of the star will most likely impose the final limit to detectable transit depths . \n we do , however , note that the star appears to be more photometrically stable at short time scales than at the time scale of months to years measured by weis ( 1994 ) . \n we emphasize that planets of all plausible interior compositions are larger than 1.5 @xmath28 . \n this comes from the mass - radius relation for cold homogeneous iron planets ( seager et al . \n , in preparation ) . \n iron is the most dense abundant material from which planets are formed . \n its unlikely that a planet is solely composed of iron , but any other material will make the planet less dense and hence larger . \n similarly , including temperature affects for a planet in an 0.041  au orbit around an m star will make the planet larger , marginally so for a rocky planet and moreso for a gas planet . for reference , \n the solar system terrestrial planets have iron cores ; mercury has a a 60 - 70 percent iron core by mass and earth has a 32.5% iron core by mass ( with 10% of lighter material ) . \n the absence of detectable transits means the radius and hence nature of gj 581b remains unknown . \n planets larger than our detection limit of 1.48 @xmath28 may include : `` rock giant '' silicate planets like massive earths , a water world ( akin to neptune without a gas envelope ) or even an evaporating gas planet . \n we thank the technical personnel at las campanas observatory for their help with the instrumental parts of this project . \n m.  l -

{"ContextTokens": 3912, "GeneratedTokens": 109, "SynthesizedBody": "particle covered liquid interfaces are increasingly being exploited in a wide variety of technological and medical applications @xcite . coating a liquid drop with a hydrophobic powder \n renders the drop non - wetting with the resulting liquid marbles free to roll on rigid surfaces or even float on water @xcite , a feature that has also proven useful as an adaptation to life on small scales @xcite . in a similar vein \n , it is hoped that by encapsulating the active ingredients of drugs within a monolayer of colloidal particles ( thereby forming a _ colloidosome _ @xcite ) more medicines will soon be administered by inhalation , so improving their efficacy . in the latter case , the particle coated interface exists only in the preliminary stages of manufacture , but in neither case have previous investigations been concerned with understanding the properties of particle monolayers at liquid interfaces . in this article , we show that in fact such particle monolayers behave collectively like 2-dimensional elastic solids and further , we characterize the properties of this two - dimensional solid .    a variety of solid - like behaviours are observed for monolayers of hydrophobic particles sprinkled densely onto an air - water interface for a wide range ( @xmath0 - @xmath1 ) of particle sizes . \n for example , such a monolayer buckles under sufficient static compressive loading ( see figs . \n [ pics ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) demonstrating that it can support an anisotropic stress . \n this stress state can only be supported by a material with a non - zero shear modulus , which is the signature of a solid . \n once the compressive stress is removed , the monolayer returns rapidly ( @xmath2s ) to the undeformed state , ironing out the wrinkles formed by the buckling . this elasticity is also reminiscent of a solid and is in stark contrast to what is commonly observed in both dry and wet granular systems , which also resist compression but do not , on the whole , return to the undeformed state once the compressive stress is removed . \n furthermore , the solid will also fracture under relatively small tensions and is manifested by the spectacular branching fracture induced by the addition of a drop of surfactant as shown in fig . \n [ pics ] ( c ) . here \n , the disparity in surface tension between the clean and contaminated areas is enough to open up a tensile crack that propagates with surfactant advected to the crack tip by marangoni flows . \n these behaviours are curious since the monolayer has solid - like properties only in the presence of the liquid and is reduced to a cohesionless powder once this liquid is evaporated naturally , making this an unusual composite material . \n capillary forces are responsible for the formation of the solid monolayer via the aggregation of particles trapped at the interface and give the monolayer cohesion under deformation . \n the particle monolayers we study are distinct from other two - dimensional interfacial systems such as langmuir monolayers @xcite because the large size of the particles ( diameters of up to 6 ) makes them non - brownian objects which interact solely via capillary attraction . in this respect \n they are similar to conventional bubble rafts @xcite , and so we dub them particle rafts \n . however , bubble rafts of a similar scale are more easily deformable in compression and stack into multiple layers under the effects of large compressive stresses rather than forming larger scale wrinkles . \n this latter difference is due to the fact that bubbles are considerably less dense than the bulk fluid , ensuring that it is energetically cheaper to stack them than to deform the bulk interface significantly , which is a requirement of wrinkle formation . for a monolayer particle raft loaded in uniaxial compression , \n the steric interaction between particles allows for anisotropic stresses while attractive capillary forces prevent stress relaxation due to particle creep in the direction orthogonal to the uniaxial compression .     and ( b ) lycopodium particles with mean diameter @xmath3 . \n ( c ) shows the crack in a monolayer of particles with diameter in the range @xmath4 near equilibrium . here \n the needle is used only to place surfactant on the surface ; the gradient in interfacial tension causes a crack to open . \n the scale bar in each image corresponds to @xmath5 .,height=151 ]    although the dynamics of crack propagation in this system are of interest , we defer further discussion to the future and focus in this article on characterising the elastic properties of the particle raft . in this system , it seems reasonable to assume that the particle raft behaves approximately as an isotropic solid , in which case its elastic behaviour can be completely characterised in terms of the young s modulus , @xmath6 , and poisson ratio , @xmath7 ; in the next section , we shall determine these parameters theoretically . \n microscopic theories of elastic solids usually rely on the existence of a minimum in the interaction potential of the constituent particles , so that the elastic modulus is related to the curvature of this potential at the minimum . in the present situation , \n however , the following modification of a simple argument by lucassen @xcite suffices .    for a conventional two - dimensional elastic solid , the mean stress , @xmath8 , and strain , @xmath9 ( where the subscripts @xmath10 denote the two principal directions ) , are related by @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath7 is the poisson ratio of the solid . \n if we replace the stress by a thickness - averaged isotropic tension , @xmath12 , then this relation reads : @xmath13 we then have : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the area of the system covered by liquid , @xmath16 is the area covered by solid particles and @xmath17 is the total area of the system . \n the area covered by particles is constant regardless of the tension applied since the solid particles are effectively rigid at the individual level in comparison to the raft as a whole which collectively can be soft . \n in addition , @xmath18 ( with a constant of proportionality that may , in general , be different to @xmath19 ) so that ( [ average ] ) can be rearranged to give the effective young s modulus : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the solid fraction of the interface . \n while naive dimensional analysis would predict that @xmath22 , by recalling ( [ 2deq ] ) , we might expect that @xmath6 should only enter through the combination @xmath23 . \n this would lead us to expect that @xmath24 for some function @xmath25 , which we know must have the feature that as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , since the particles are assumed rigid . \n the argument leading to ( [ law ] ) showed that @xmath28 , which does have the desired divergence properties and is perhaps the most natural such function . \n an estimate of the value of @xmath7 may be determined from the assumption that the particles are hexagonally close packed discs that interact only by means of an attractive central force and a repulsive steric interaction : a reasonable approximation for the case of spherical particles . \n figure [ poisson ] demonstrates the origin of the poisson effect for a single rhombic cell in the lattice in which the two central particles are displaced by a distance @xmath29 . from elementary geometry , \n the rhombus joining the centres of the four particles in the undeformed state has width @xmath30 and height @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the particle radius . during the deformation , \n the width decreases to @xmath33 and the height increases to @xmath34 so that the poisson ratio is simply @xmath35 .        under the same assumption that the particles have a perfectly circular cross - section and are monodisperse \n , we may determine from elementary geometry that in hexagonal close packing , @xmath36 . \n this gives an estimate of the typical value of the young s modulus : @xmath37    the calculations above are based on the assumption that the particles are hexagonally close packed discs when , in fact , their shape is irregular leading to non - ordered packings . \n however , this approximation provides estimates for the values of @xmath7 and @xmath38 , which can then be used to obtain an estimate for the prefactor in ( [ high ] )    the results ( [ law],[high ] ) show that the elastic properties of the system are determined just by the surface tension , @xmath39 , and the particle diameter , @xmath40 . \n in particular , there is no dependence on the particle elasticity since we have neglected the possibility of particle deformations in setting @xmath41 in the argument leading to ( [ law ] ) . this is consistent with the picture that it is much easier to deform the layer by collective relative motion of particles than to deform the individual particles . \n we also see that the shape of the particles enters only via the dimensionless parameters @xmath38 and @xmath7 . \n physically , the argument above shows that the elasticity of the particle raft arises because of changes in the interfacial area that are a result of the imposed deformation . in the undeformed state , the interfacial area \n is minimized ( since this state is an equilibrium state ) subject to the constraint that the solid particles are not deformable . \n once a deformation occurs , the particles rearrange themselves to accommodate this imposition but the interfacial area associated with the new state is necessarily larger than that of the equilibrium state ( since we have more constraints under deformation ) and so energy is stored in the additional interface created . \n to test the simple expression in ( [ law ] ) , we used an elastic buckling assay of the particle raft to determine the wavelength ( see fig . \n [ pics ] ) of the instability and thence infer the value of the young s modulus as a function of the particle size . to measure this dependence , \n each powder was in turn deposited by sprinkling onto an air - liquid interface contained in a home - made langmuir trough ( dimensions @xmath42@xmath43@xmath441 cm for small particles sizes , @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 cm for large particles ) . the barrier of the langmuir trough consisted of a slide of the same width as the trough itself but slightly smaller thickness allowing the level of the liquid to equilibrate by flow beneath the barrier ( see fig . [ setup ] ) . \n the barrier was used to compress the particle monolayer until the buckling instability sets in ; a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig . [ setup ] . \n the rate of compression leading to the buckling instability is not a factor in determining the wavelength of wrinkles produced as we measure the wavelength in the static configuration once any transients due to the induced flow in the liquid sublayer have decayed . \n photographs of the wrinkled surface were taken using a high resolution ccd camera ( 1600@xmath481200 pixels ) for different runs . \n single wavelengths were measured at different points of different photos ( at least ten measurements ) using image analysis software ( imagej , nih ) and the mean value calculated . \n .,height=151 ]    the particles used were primarily made from pliolite ( eliokem ) , a highly hydrophobic material , ground and sorted into different samples ranging in mean diameter from @xmath49 to @xmath50 mm . \n however , we also used a number of other hydrophobic powders both to obtain a wider size range and test the dependence of the results on the particles used . \n these included silanised lycopodium @xcite ( grain size @xmath51 ) , graphite powder ( grain size @xmath52 ) , powdered chemigum ( eliokem , grain size @xmath53 ) and polystyrene powder of different mean grain sizes ( ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) - the formation of a two - dimensional solid apparently only requires that these particles be trapped at the liquid - air interface . for particles larger than @xmath56 \n , we were able to use the ccd camera to measure the particle size and comparing 20 grains of a particular sample gave us estimates for the polydispersity of that sample . for samples below this threshold \n , we relied on the size ranges specified by the manufacturer .    since the powders used were neither monodisperse nor uniformly spherical , the solid fraction of the monolayer , @xmath38 , was , in general , different from the maximum possible packing density of two - dimensional discs ( which is close to @xmath57 ) . \n therefore , @xmath38 was measured just prior to the onset of instability using image analysis software ( imagej , nih ) by changing the threshold on each image ( the good contrast between liquid and particle phases ensuring that the exact value of the threshold used is immaterial ) . \n the experimental measurements of @xmath38 gave a mean value @xmath58 with standard deviation @xmath59 . \n most experiments were performed with the base liquid being water ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) but we also performed experiments with saline solution ( @xmath62 , by weight , so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) to test for the possibility of electrostatic interactions mediated by the water . \n previously it has been shown that the presence of the powder does not alter the surface tension coefficient as determined from comparisons between experiments on liquid marbles and numerical results for pure non - wetting drops @xcite and so in the subsequent analysis we used surface tension coefficients for pure liquid samples .    in fig . \n [ lamdep ] , we plot the wavelength as a function of the mean particle diameter for a range of different particle sizes and the two different base liquids . \n the results of these experiments lie on a single line and so we conclude that the precise geometry of the particles used as well as electrostatic effects are of minimal significance @xcite .    . \n the dashed line shows the prediction from ( [ high ] ) . \n all data points are for pliolite at an air - water interface unless indicated otherwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=260 ] . \n the dashed line shows the prediction from ( [ high ] ) . \n all data points are for pliolite at an air - water interface unless indicated otherwise.,title=\"fig:\",width=272 ] \n classical elasticity theory @xcite allows us to deduce the effective mechanical properties of this unusual two - dimensional solid from the measured wavelength which is assumed to be large compared to the particle size . \n we assume that the raft behaves as a thin sheet of isotropic , homogeneous elastic material of thickness equal to the particle diameter @xmath40 in plane stress . at the onset of the buckling instability , \n the deflection of the raft is small and so its vertical displacement , @xmath65 , measured relative to its equilibrium position in the absence of any compressive force satisfies the beam equation @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the bending stiffness of the sheet , @xmath68 is the compressive force per unit length in the sheet , @xmath69 is the density of the liquid whose weight provides the restoring force , and @xmath70 is the acceleration due to gravity . \n substituting @xmath71 into ( [ eqm ] ) gives us an expression for the compressive force @xmath68 as a function of @xmath72 ; minimizing the result yields the selected wavelength @xmath73 . \n rewriting this expression gives the young s modulus @xmath6 in terms of the observed wavelength and the particle diameter as :    @xmath74    using ( [ young ] ) the data shown in fig . \n [ lamdep ] can be used to calculate the effective young s modulus of the particle raft as a function of particle diameter @xmath40 , with the result shown in fig . \n [ youngmod ] . \n we see that the young s modulus is approximately inversely proportional to the particle diameter with a constant of proportionality close to the surface tension coefficient @xmath39 , as is predicted by our simple model ( [ law ] ) .    substituting the mean value for solid volume fraction measured experimentally @xmath75 and @xmath35 into ( [ law ] ) \n we get @xmath76 , indicated by the solid line drawn in fig . \n [ youngmod ] , while the dashed line corresponds to ( [ high ] ) . \n linear regression performed on this data suggests that @xmath77 in si units , which compares favourably to the theoretical prediction based on @xmath75 , which is @xmath78 . finally , substituting the expression for the young s modulus ( [ law ] ) with proportionality constant unity and rearranging ( [ young ] ) yields an expression for the wavelength of the wrinkles : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the capillary length , which result is plotted as the solid line in fig . \n [ lamdep ] and fits the experimental data well . \n linear regression on the data suggests that @xmath81 , which is close to the theoretically predicted result , which in si units reads @xmath82 . \n we have seen that a two - dimensional monolayer of packed particles trapped at a liquid interface behaves like a two - dimensional elastic solid whose properties we have characterised . \n our theoretical model for this behaviour shows that the properties of the particle raft are relatively insensitive to the details of the capillary interaction but do depend on the geometry of packing and has been verified by experiments on a wide range of particle rafts . \n some variations in the experimental results could be accounted for by the polydispersity of the particle sizes and shapes and the resulting non - uniform packing . however , in such cases the value of @xmath7 is different from @xmath83 , introducing an additional complexity that is beyond the scope of the present work . \n many interesting questions associated with particle rafts involving both their dynamic and non - linear response remain to be answered . \n for instance , it is not clear what governs the speed of propagation of the cracks alluded to in the introduction . \n plastic behavior induced by shear in a couette geometry shows that the particle rafts respond by localization of the deformation to a small region of the sheet , as for two - dimensional bubble rafts @xcite . \n however our system may be more amenable to investigation since individual grains in particle rafts are effectively rigid . \n indeed , this suggests that particle rafts could serve as a model two - dimensional granular system . \n is supported by the choate fellowship at harvard , p.a . \n is supported by an eu marie - curie fellowship at cambridge , and l.m . \n is supported by the us office of naval research and the us national institutes of health .", "StartTimeOffset": 2327606406114, "RequestID": "e3b6b9e4b6b2fd3222195aafabfec8536a6b258a", "TotalTokens": 4021}

threshold regime has also been demonstrated . \n we make an exhaustive study throughout the parameter regime of our problem and show the detailed behaviour of sr peak as function of @xmath7 in our model . \n we consider an overdamped brownian particle moving in a bistable potential @xmath8 under the influence of a zero mean white gaussian noise @xmath9 with correlations @xmath10 . \n the langevin equation for such system is @xmath11 and the corresponding fokker planck equation ( fpe ) is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability density of the particle at position @xmath14 at time @xmath15 . \n the barrier height @xmath16 . \n we consider both weak forcing @xmath17 as well as strong forcing @xmath18 limit . \n depending on the parameter regime , the brownian particle is either dominated by intra well or inter well oscillations . for small driving force the motion \n is mostly dominated by intrawell oscillations . at certain optimal noise strength the interwell motion \n is enhanced due to the combined effect of noise and weak periodic modulation . such resonant enhancement of interwell motion is termed as stochastic resonance ( sr ) . in this particular case \n the oscillatory driving force keeps the system away from equilibrium . \n the energy required to drive the system ( @xmath19 ) can be calculated from sekimoto s stochastic energetics formalism  @xcite and its has been shown that @xmath19 depends nonmonotonically on the noise strength @xmath1 . \n since the mean current in the system is zero , hence no work is done by the system and all the input energy is dissipated into the bath . \n this suggests that input energy is related to dissipative loss or hysteresis loss in the system  @xcite . \n our effort is to find the signatures of sr in the input energy of the system as function of system parameters @xmath20 .    the input energy per period(@xmath4 ) \n is defined as  @xcite @xmath21    the average @xmath22 is done over an ensemble of particles . \n the asymptotic probability distribution @xmath13 is calculated by solving the fpe ( [ fpe ] ) . \n the input energy @xmath19 can be rewritten in terms of asymptotic distribution as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 . \n this distribution is obtained after the initial transients have died down and asymptotically probability density assumes a unique limiting periodic distribution in time . \n the maxima of @xmath19 as function of @xmath1 is taken as a signature of sr . \n we numerically solve eqn . \n ( [ fpe ] ) by method of finite difference to obtain the asymptotic distribution @xmath25 . \n @xmath19 is obtained by numerically integrating eqn . \n ( [ main ] ) . throughout this work \n all the physical quantities are in dimensionless unit  @xcite . \n the input energy shows a rich structure as function of @xmath26 . \n we mainly concentrate on low amplitude drive , @xmath27 . in this regime input energy \n shows a sharp maxima both as function of @xmath28 . in fig . \n [ ein - d ] we plot @xmath19 as function of @xmath1 for @xmath29 and different values of @xmath2 . \n the peak in the input energy can be attributed to the synchronization of escape from the potential well and the external periodic drive as has been extensively discussed in previous literatures @xcite . \n with increasing @xmath2 the temperature at which @xmath19 peaks increases as shown in fig . \n [ ein - d ] . \n the most favourable condition for hopping to other potential well is when the barrier height is minimum . \n when @xmath2 is increased the brownian particle spends less time in the most favourable condition and hence stronger fluctuations are needed to cross the barrier . \n barrier height also decreases with increase in amplitude of external drive . \n hence for reasons similar to above the resonance peak shift towards lower temperature as shown in the inset , where we have plotted @xmath19 _ vs _ \n @xmath1 for various values of @xmath30 as mentioned in the caption . however , our main motive is to check whether these resonance features are also observed when the frequency of the external drive is varied . in fig . \n [ ein - omg ] we plot @xmath19 as function of @xmath2 for @xmath31 and different values of temperature . \n unlike other response function like snr , ra which characterize sr and has monotonic dependence on @xmath2 , input energy shows a nonmonotonic and a peaking behaviour with @xmath2 . for small amplitude drive and at low temperature the resonant frequency is very close to half the kramer s rate for the unperturbed system ( the resonance condition being @xmath32 ) . for @xmath33 , the kramer s rate ( @xmath34 ) \n is @xmath35 , which is very close to @xmath36 . with higher amplitude the resonance peak shifts to higher frequency for a given temperature as shown in the inset . \n thus sr as a bona fide resonance is established . \n it is known that for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the dynamical threshold above which deterministic switch events take place driven by the periodic signal alone ( absence of noise ) , sr is not observed . \n the dynamical threshold depends on both the modulation frequency and the wave form @xmath39 . for the form given in eqn . \n (  [ langv ] ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the smallest zero of the airy function @xmath43 , is order of unity @xcite . \n we investigate the marginal supra - threshold regime ( @xmath44 ) and show that sr is observed with increasing temperature provided @xmath30 is not very large compared to @xmath38 . \n the occurrence of sr in this regime is related to noise induced stability  @xcite . in fig . \n [ supra ] we plot input energy for four different valued of @xmath30 at @xmath45 . \n figure  [ trajec ] shows the corresponding deterministic trajectories . as shown in fig . \n [ trajec ] , @xmath46 is the threshold , i.e , the particle is just able to cross the barrier at @xmath47 . \n hence higher values of @xmath30 is above dynamic threshold . for @xmath48 \n the input energy shows a resonance peak with increasing temperature . \n this peak in @xmath19 in supra - threshold regime is shown for a very small window of @xmath30 . \n for the specific parameter values as above , the peak vanishes for @xmath49 . \n this peak can be ascribed to resonant trapping as discussed in previous literature  @xcite . however , in supra - threshold regime @xmath19 clearly exhibits peaking behaviour as function of @xmath2  @xcite for all values of @xmath30 . \n this is more akin to conventional resonance ( absence of barrier ) . \n in conclusion we have calculated that the input energy pumped into the system by an external drive using the method of stochastic energetics . \n this input energy is shown to be a good quantitative measure of sr . \n moreover sr is shown to be a bona fide resonance . \n l. gammaitoni , p. hanggi , p. jung , and f. marchesoni , rev . \n phys . * 70 * , 223 ( 1998 ) . \n l. gammaitoni , f. marchesoni , and s. santucci , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 1052 ( 1995 ) ; m. h. choi , r. f. fox , and p. jung , phys . \n e * 57 * , 6335 ( 1998 ) ; g. giacomelli , f. marin , and i. rabbiosi , phys . rev . \n 82 , 675 ( 1999 ) ; f. marchesoni , l. gammaitoni , f. apostolico , and s. santucci , phys . rev . \n e * 62 * , 146 ( 2000 ) . v. berdichevsky amd m. gitterman , j. phys . a * 29 * , l447 ( 1996 ) . \n m. c. mahato and s. r. shenoy , phys . \n e * 50 * , 2503 ( 1994 ) ; m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , phys . \n e * 55 * , 6266 ( 1997 ) . \n m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , mod . \n b * 11 * , 815 ( 1997 ) ; m. c. mahato and a. m. jayannavar , physica a * 248 * , 138 ( 1998 ) . \n k. sekimoto , j. phys . \n . jpn . * 66 * , 6335 ( 1997 ) ; f. takagi and t. hondou , phys . \n e * 60 * , 4954 ( 1999 ) . \n t. iwai , physica a * 300 * , 350 ( 2001 ) ; t. iwai , j. phys . soc . jpn . * 70 * , 353 ( 2001 ) . \n f. apostolico , l. gammaitoni , f. marchesoni , and s. santucci , phys . \n e , * 55 * , 36 ( 1997 ) ; r. n. mantegna and b. spagnolo , phys . \n lett * 76 * , 563 ( 1996 ) . \n a. l. pankratov , phys . \n e * 65 * , 022101 ( 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2333596389126, "RequestID": "cc82f92286536e99a58165d44de897cb7474010d", "TotalTokens": 2954}
{"ContextTokens": 3623, "GeneratedTokens": 105, "SynthesizedBody": "many of complicated quantum procedures admit an interpretation in terms of some classical analogues . the mass renormalization in qed represents a peculiar case . it is universally recognized due to an incredible exactness of its predictions , and \n its origin lies in the classical theory of a pointlike electron ; nevertheless , there are serious problems with physical interpretation and mathematical correctness of this procedure .    in this paper , we consider a semiclassical model of a spinning particle based on the kerr - newman solution of the einstein - maxwell theory . \n this solution has double gyromagnetic ratio , as that of the dirac electron and may be considered as a model of electron in general relativity @xcite .    in this paper \n we would like to show that the mass renormalization and regularization of the singularities in the kerr - newman source are perfectly realized by gravitational field in a very natural manner . \n it allows one to conjecture that the methodological problems in qed may be related to the ignorance of gravity . \n qed ignores gravitational field arguing that its local action is negligible . \n it is true , but only partially . \n the kerr solution gives a contr - example to this assertion , showing that the local action of the gravitational field may extend on the compton distances due to the stringy structure of the source . \n however , the main effect of gravity is apparently related to a non - local action . \n we would like to show here that in the semiclassical model of the kerr spinning particle , gravity provides the mass renormalization . \n the mass of an isolated source is determined only by an asymptotic gravitational field , and , therefore , it depends only on the mass parameter @xmath0 which survives in the asymptotic expansion of the metric . on the other hand , \n the total mass can be calculated as a volume integral , which takes into account densities of the electromagnetic energy @xmath1 material ( mechanical mass ) sources @xmath2 and energy of the gravitational field @xmath3 . the last term is not taken into account in qed , but it provides perfect renormalization . for a spherically symmetric system , the expression may be reduced to an integral over radial distance @xmath4    m = 4_0^_em dr + 4_0^_m dr + 4_0^_g dr [ mtot ] . \n it looks like the expressions in a flat spacetime . \n however , in the kerr - schild background it is a consequence of the exact tolman relations taking into account energy of matter , energy of gravitational field ( including the contribution from pressure ) and rotation @xcite . in the well known classical model of an electron as a charged sphere with electromagnetic radius @xmath5 integration in ( [ mtot ] ) \n is performed in the diapason @xmath6,$ ] where @xmath7 the total mass is determined by electromagnetic contribution only , and contribution from gravity turns out to be null . however , if @xmath8 the electromagnetic contribution exceeds the total mass and this extension is to be compensated by the negative gravitational contribution . \n indeed , the results will not depend on the cut parameter @xmath9 and , moreover , on radial distribution of matter at all \n . some of the terms may be divergent , but the total result will not be changed , since divergences will always be compensated by a contribution from a gravitational term . \n it shows that , due to the strong non - local action , gravity may be essential for elementary particles , on the distances which are very far from the usually considered planck scale . \n the kerr - newman solution breaks the prevailing point of view that the local action of gravitational field of a particle extends to its schwarzschild radius . \n the schwarzschild singular point turns in the kerr rotating geometry into a singular ring which extends on the compton sizes , since its radius @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , is the compton one , which exceeds the schwarzschild one for an electron at @xmath12 . \n angular momentum @xmath13 for parameters of electron is so high that the black hole horizons disappear , and the source of the kerr spinning particle represents a naked singular ring which may have some stringy excitations , generating the spin and mass of the extended particle - like object - `` microgeon '' @xcite . \n therefore , the kerr source represents a closed singular string of the compton size , and can not be localized in the region which is smaller then the compton size . \n it was shown , that this source is indeed a string @xcite resembling a heterotic string of superstring theory . note \n that this singularity is a branch line of the kerr space which turns out to be two - sheeted , and the disk spanned on this ring plays the role of gates to anti - world ( `` negative '' sheet ) , where the signs of charges and masses , and the directions of the fields are changed . \n so , the kerr string is an `` alice '' one , and all the fields have to fill these ` gates to anti - world ' which have the giant compton sizes ( @xmath14 cm ) . \n note that in qed it is the region of virtual photons . \n one more remarkable structure of the kerr geometry is pnc ( principal null congruence ) . \n it is a vortex of the lightlike rays ( twistors ) which fall on the ` negative sheet ' on the kerr disk , penetrate it and turn into outgoing ` out'-fields on the ` positive sheet ' of space ( see fig.1 ) . \n pnc is a very important object since the tangent to congruence vector @xmath15 determines the kerr - schild ansatz for metric g^=^+ 2h k^k^n [ ks ] ( where @xmath16 is the auxiliary minkowski metric ) and the form of vector potential a_= a ( x ) k_[aem ] for electrically charged solution , i.e. it determines polarization of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields around the kerr source and the directions of radiation for the nonstationary excited solutions @xcite . \n the kerr congruence is determined by the kerr theorem @xcite in terms of twistors . \n the kerr singular ring is a focal line of the kerr pnc . \n the kerr - schild form of metric allows one to consider a broad class of regularized solutions which remove the kerr singular ring , covering it by a matter source . \n there is a long - term story of the attempts to find some interior regular solution for the kerr or kerr - newman solutions @xcite . \n usually , the regularized solutions have to retain the kerr - schild form of metric and the form of kerr principal null congruence @xmath17 as well as its property to be geodesic and shear - free . \n the space part @xmath18 of the kerr congruence @xmath19 has the form of a spinning hedgehog . \n indeed , by setting the parameter of rotation @xmath20 equal to zero , the kerr singular ring shrinks to a singular point , and @xmath18 takes the usual hedgehog form which is used as an ansatz for the solitonic models of elementary particles and quarks . \n it suggests that the kerr spinning particle may have relation not only to electron , but also to the other elementary particles . \n indeed , the kerr - schild class of metric has a remarkable property , allowing us to consider a broad class of the charged and uncharged , the spinning and spinless solutions from an unified point of view . \n our treatment will be based on the approach given in @xcite , where the _ smooth _ regularized sources were obtained for the rotating and non - rotating solutions of the kerr - schild class . \n these smooth and regular solutions have the scalar function @xmath21 of the general form h = f(r)/(r^2 + a^2 ^2 ) [ hf ] . for the kerr - newman solution function \n @xmath22 has the form f(r)f_kn= mr -e^2/2 [ hkn ] . \n regularized solutions have tree regions :    \\i ) the kerr - newman exterior , @xmath23 , where @xmath24    \\ii ) interior @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and function @xmath27 and @xmath28 to suppress the singularity at @xmath29 and provide the smoothness of the metric up to the second derivatives ;    \\iii ) a narrow intermediate region @xmath30 $ ] which allows one to get a smooth solution interpolating between regions i ) and ii ) . \n it is advisable to consider first the non - rotating cases , since the rotation can later be taken into account by an easy trick . in this case , taking @xmath31 and the parameter @xmath32 one obtains for the source ( interior ) a space - time of constant curvature @xmath33 which is generated by a source with energy density    = 1 4 ( fr -f)/^2 , [ rhof ]    and tangential and radial pressures    p_rad=- , p_tan=- 1 8f/ , [ p ]    where @xmath34 it yields for the interior the stress - energy tensor @xmath35 or    = -p_rad =- p_tan= , [ rho ]    which generates a de sitter interior for @xmath36 and an anti de sitter interior for @xmath37 . if @xmath38 we have a flat interior which corresponds to some previous classical models of an electron , in particular , to the dirac model of a charged sphere and to the lopez model in the form of a rotating elliptic shell @xcite . \n the resulting sources may be considered as the bags filled by a special matter with positive ( @xmath39 ) or negative ( @xmath40 ) energy density . \n the transfer from the external electro - vacuum solution to the internal region ( source ) may be considered as a phase transition from ` true ' to ` false ' vacuum in a supersymmetric @xmath41 higgs model @xcite . \n assuming that transition region iii ) is very thin , one can consider the following graphical representation which turns out to be very useful , see figure 2 . \n the point of phase transition @xmath9 is determined by the equation @xmath42 which yields @xmath43 from ( [ rho ] ) , we have @xmath44 and obtain the equation    m= + 4 3 r_0 ^ 3 .    in the first term on the right - hand side , one can easily recognize the electromagnetic mass of a charged sphere with radius @xmath9 , @xmath45 , while the second term is the mass of this sphere filled by a material with a homogenous density @xmath46 , @xmath47 thus , the point of intersection @xmath9 acquires a deep physical sense , providing an energy balance by the mass formation . \n in particular , for the classical dirac model of a charged sphere with radius @xmath48 the balance equation yields the flat internal space with @xmath49 if @xmath50 , the interior is de sitter space , and a material mass of positive energy @xmath51 gives a contribution to the total mass @xmath0 . if @xmath52 this contribution has to be negative @xmath53 which is accompanied by the formation of an ads internal space . \n all the above treatments are valid for the rotating cases , and for the passage to a rotating case , one has only to set    = r^2 + a^2 ^2 , and consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 as the oblate spheroidal coordinates @xcite . \n it looks wonderful , however it is a direct consequence of the structure of function @xmath21 , in which the nominator is independent from the rotation parameter @xmath56    the kerr - newman spinning particle with a spin @xmath57 acquires the form of a relativistically rotating disk which foliates on the rigidly rotating ellipsoidal shells , and the board of the disk has @xmath58 @xcite . \n the corresponding stress - energy tensor ( [ rho ] ) describes in this case the matter of source in a co - rotating with this disk coordinate system . \n the disk has the form of a highly oblate ellipsoid with thickness @xmath9 and radius @xmath59 which is of order of the compton length . \n interior of the disk represents a `` false '' vacuum having superconducting properties @xcite , so the charges are concentrated on the surface of this disk , at @xmath60 . inside the disk , \n the local gravitational field is negligible . \n classical models of a spinning particle encounter an unavoidable conflicts with quantum theory . \n the kerr singular string acquires electromagnetic wave excitations @xcite . in classical theory these excitations lead to a radiation which breaks axial symmetry of the kerr - newman solution and leads to non- stationarity . as a result , only an average metric takes the kerr - newman form . in the kerr - schild formalism @xcite , \n electromagnetic excitations are related to a field @xmath61 which induces electromagnetic radiation along the kerr congruence @xmath62 and non - stationarity of the solutions . \n this radiation leads also to infrared divergence of the mass , and there are arguments that this radiation has to be renormalized @xcite , setting the field @xmath63 . \n in quantum theory oscillations are stationary and absence of radiation caused by oscillations is postulated , although the radiation is present in qed too , being related to radiative corrections : the field of virtual photons , vacuum zero point field and vacuum polarization .    in a semiclassical approach , one can use the receipt of the quantum field theory in curved spaces@xcite , which takes into account the quantum effects concentrated in the divergent vacuum zero point field . by the transfer to the classical einstein - maxwell theory , \n these quantum vacuum fields have to be subtracted from the classical stress - energy tensor by a regularization @xcite . \n it was conjectured in @xcite that regularization of the kerr - newman stress - energy tensor has to be related with a subtraction of electromagnetic radiation caused by field @xmath64 which propagates along the kerr congruence @xmath62 , and involves non - stationarity by a loss of mass . \n twofoldedness of the kerr geometry confirms this point of view , since _ the outgoing radiation on the ` positive ' out - sheet of the metric is compensated by an ingoing radiation on the ` negative ' in - sheet_. it shows , that the field @xmath64 has to be identified with the vacuum zero - point field and may be subtracted from the stress - energy tensor by means of regularization , which has to satisfy the condition ( [ cons ] ) . \n such regularization may be performed , @xcite , and leads to some modified kerr - schild equations @xcite . \n it shows that electromagnetic excitations on the kerr background are similar to the casimir effect and may be interpreted as a resonance of the zero - point fluctuations on the ( superconducting ) source of the kerr spinning particle @xcite . \n although , the exact nontrivial solutions of the regularized system have not been obtained so far , there were obtained corresponding exact solutions of the maxwell equations which show that any ` aligned ' excitation of the kerr geometry leads to the appearance of some extra ` axial ' singular lines ( strings ) which are semi - infinite and modulated by de broglie periodicity @xcite . \n the recently obtained multiparticle kerr - schild solutions @xcite support this point of view , leading to the conclusion that the radiating twistorial structure of the kerr pnc belongs to the vacuum zero - point field , pointing out on the twistorial texture of vacuum @xcite . \n * note added after publication : * a development of the presented point of wiev is given in gr - qc/0606035 , where we arrive at the conclusion that the gravitational kerr s description of spinning particle may be dual to the qed description , similar to the other dualities in superstring theory , like ads / cft , strings / solitons and so on . \n burinskii , sov . \n jetp , * 39 * 193 ( 1974 ) ; in :  problems of theory of gravitation and elementary particles\",*11 * 47 ( 1980 ) , moscow , atomizdat , ( in russian ) . \n lpez , phys.rev . \n * d 30 * 313 ( 1984 ) . \n a. burinskii , phys . \n d * 67 * , 124024 ( 2003 ) ; a. burinskii and r.p . \n kerr , _ nonstationary kerr congruences _ , gr -

gap engineering \n , it is suitable to have an easily manipulated quantum well model that yields the optimized properties prior to fabrication . \n a technique was developed using supersymmetric quantum mechanics to optimize the quantum well structure in respect to maximizing the gain in optically pumped intersubband lasers @xcite . \n this method adds a bound state lower than the existing ground state energy of a potential well , thereby , varying the well s initial shape in the process . \n the resulting quantum well may not have the symmetric structure of the initial well used . \n in contrast , this work will show that one obtains a lower ground state by an appropriate embedding of a quantum well in another quantum well while maintaining the symmetry of the initial composite potential .    here a composite quantum well is constructed through the use of modified pschl - teller ( mpt ) potentials @xcite similar to that used in ref . \n these potentials are related in form to rosen - morse potentials @xcite and have been used successfully to model disordered quantum wires @xcite . \n the mpt - type of potentials are chosen since they offer a high degree of control and flexibility . moreover \n , different single potential wells can be joined smoothly at the edges forming one continuous potential . \n therefore , the systematic numerical procedure established in solving the eigenvalue equation for one composite quantum well can readily be used even when the parameters of the constituent single wells are varied . \n the effective changes in the energy spectrum and scattering properties that occur when a quantum well is embedded in another well will be investigated in this paper . \n this will serve as aid to experiments in that constructed composite quantum wells of the same type and symmetry with different embedded well sizes have fundametally different features . \n is in units of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is in angstrom.,width=309 ] \n a quantum well -

in - a - well system consists of two left and right wells , labelled with indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and a center well denoted by index @xmath8 . \n their location relative to the origin are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in this work , \n the width parameter @xmath12 is the same for all wells studied and it is kept to a constant value of @xmath13 . only the value of the depth parameter @xmath14 is varied . here \n the depth parameters of the side wells , @xmath15 , are set equal , that is , @xmath16 . \n this is done to retain the symmetric shape of the well about the origin . \n the middle well has a depth parameter @xmath17 and its value can be different from @xmath18 . by varying the values of @xmath18 , @xmath17 and the shift parameter @xmath19 , the size of the effective embedded potential well relative to the resulting main quantum well can be controlled . \n figure 1 illustrates a composite well as obtained from its constituent potential wells . \n note that the model represents the conduction band of a quantum well system . \n the bound states of a single electron in the composite well system described above can be obtained by using eq . \n ( [ potential ] ) in the schrdinger equation in one dimension @xmath20\\psi(z)=e\\psi(z)\\;. \\label{se}\\ ] ] it follows that the wavefunction can be determined through an iterative procedure from eq . \n ( [ se ] ) in the central difference form @xcite , that is , @xmath21\\psi(z )   \\nonumber \\\\ \n + 2\\psi(z )   -

in - a - well system that will be studied here is the scattering of a free particle from this potential landscape via the transfer matrix approach . \n the transmission probability is obtained from the ratio between the amplitude of the transmitted wave ( @xmath28 ) and that of the incident wave ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 the transfer matrix technique yields @xcite @xmath31 e^{i[\\kappa(z+\\delta z ) -\\kappa(z)]z}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath32\\right)^{1/2}/\\hbar$ ] . here \n @xmath33 is the incident particle s kinetic energy . \n it is further assumed here that the effective mass does not vary in space . \n length measurements are given in angstroms and energy measurements are in units of @xmath34 . \n figure [ fig1 ] shows a quantum well - in - a - well system , whose subwell size is 24@xmath35 of the full well depth . \n the properties of the composite well is studied using a single mpt well of the same depth as a benchmark . \n in addition , a parabolic well having the same width is fitted to the composite well for comparison . \n the same approach is used to obtain the bound states for the single mpt well and the parabolic well .    , \n @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while for the single mpt well @xmath38 . \n the inset shows the eigenenergies @xmath39 where @xmath0 is the bound state index.,width=309 ]    one finds that the composite well s ground state is lower by @xmath40 relative to the ground state of the single mpt well of the same depth . \n in this example , the ground state of the parabolic well is lowest as expected due to its deeper potential depth . \n note that the composite well has more bound states than that of single mpt well of the same depth or the parabolic well of the same width . \n further , the interval between bound states are more evenly distributed in the composite system as compared to the single mpt well . \n the distribution of states for the composite well is more similar to the even distribution of energy states of a parabolic well of the same width rather than that of the single mpt potential . \n next , fig . \n [ fig3 ] illustrates three well - in - a - well systems of the same depth , symmetry and base width . \n the latter is the potential width at @xmath41 . \n what varies in this plot is the depth of the component side wells yielding systems having different depths of embedded wells . \n figure [ fig3 ] shows systems with embedded wells of depths ( a ) 88@xmath35 , ( b ) 64@xmath35 and ( c ) 28@xmath35 relative to the composite well s full depth . \n the corresponding bound states of the three composite wells are shown in fig . \n as the depth of the component side wells increases the number of bound states also increases . \n well ( c ) has the most number of bound states . \n furthermore , the change in slope of the plot of eigenstate @xmath39 relative to the bound state index @xmath0 , towards a constant value indicates the shift towards an even distribution of the energy states . \n this occurs for the case of well ( c ) since the shape of the edge of this well approaches that of a parabolic potential . \n recall that for the case of the simple harmonic potential well , the energy levels are evenly distributed . \n so as the bottom of the component side wells approaches the depth of the middle well , we expect a straight line \n . however , near the base of the potential the shape retains the tail of a modified pschl - teller potential well , hence the last two bound states are nearer to each other as compared to those adjacent states in the middle and edge of the well . \n another phenomenon which is affected by the potential is the transport of a particle above it . \n recall that in the case of a finite rectangular well of width @xmath42 , or similarly , a potential barrier of the same width , transmission resonance is observed when the wave number takes on integral multiples of @xmath43 @xcite . \n it has also been demonstrated that a low energy incident electron above a rectangular well may be captured into a bound state due to dissipation @xcite . \n transmission resonance is only restored for particle kinetic energies beyond the `` captive '' energy region @xcite .    in the case of scattering above a single mpt potential , transmission resonance is observed when @xmath14 is an integer regardless of the magnitude of the kinetic energy of the incident particle @xcite . unlike in the well - in - a - well systems studied here , there are no resonant wells . \n this is true even for well ( a ) in which its constituent wells , by themselves , are absolute transparent potentials . \n figure [ fig5 ] shows the transmission probability of a free particle with effective mass @xmath4 above each composite well in fig . \n a particle has a lower probability of transmission if the kinetic energy of the particle approaches zero . \n as expected , the larger the kinetic energy of the incident particle the more likely it is to be transmitted . \n the monotonic increasing trend of the transmission probability for the composite wells remains valid even when the well width is increased . \n this is in contrast to the appearance of an oscillatory nature of the transmission coefficient when the width of a finite rectangular well is widened . \n the behavior of interest is that well ( a ) has the lowest probability of transmission relative to systems ( b ) and ( c ) . \n note that for a particle scattered in a finite rectangular well in the non - resonance regime , the transmission probability increases with decreasing depth and width . \n the opposite behavior is , thus , observed here , wherein the most shallow side wells and the most narrow middle well yield a composite system that creates more disturbance to particle transmission . in the perspective of an incident particle with energies corresponding to @xmath44 , wells ( b ) and ( c ) are more slowly varying potential functions relative to well ( a ) . \n the abruptness of the change in the potential in ( a ) provides a stronger force in reducing the probability of transmission in this @xmath45 regime . \n this paper presented a simulation model for a composite quantum well - in - a - well system and investigated the quantum mechanical properties arising from such construction . \n a superposition of modified pschl - teller potentials is chosen for the model because the constituent wells can easily be varied without increasing the numerical complexity in solving the schrdinger equation . \n this work showed that deviations in quantum well structures of the same functional form and depth yield entirely different properties as shown in the differences in their ground state energies , the number and distribution of bound states and the transmission probabilities of an incident free particle above the composite wells . \n tailor - made quantum well systems as presented here offer ease and flexibility that can be suited to desired features for application purposes . \n c. villagonzalo is grateful for the support provided by the office of the vice president for academic affairs through the university of the philippines system grant .", "StartTimeOffset": 2350494276486, "RequestID": "8190eb4982060866b2f9826b97c7965a546eaaa9", "TotalTokens": 2990}
{"ContextTokens": 3412, "GeneratedTokens": 180, "SynthesizedBody": "it is now commonly accepted that most asteroids in the size range 200 m \n 10 km are rubble piles , i.e.   assembles of boulders of various sizes held together only by mutual gravity . \n the main evidence for this is the existence of the surface disruption spin limit ( ( * ? ? ? \n * pravec & harris 2000 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * snchez & scheeres 2014 ) ) . \n the rotation periods of asteroids in this size range are in almost all cases longer than 2.3 hours , corresponding to the limit at which the centrifugal force at the surface equals to the gravitational force . \n rubble piles are products of asteroid collisions leading to disruption of bodies and re - assembly of fragments . \n the rotation periods of asteroids smaller than 200 m are often shorter than the surface disruption spin limit , sometimes shorter than one minute . \n these bodies were therefore considered to be mostly monolithic with significant strength . \n nevertheless , ( * ? ? ? \n * snchez & scheeres ( 2014 ) ) considered small van der waals forces between the grains inside rubble piles . \n they found that the strength of rubble piles may be about 25 pa and that this low strength is sufficient to hold together small asteroids with rotational periods of the order of minutes . \n in particular they argued that the asteroid 2008 tc@xmath1 may have been a rubble pile despite of its rotational period of 99 seconds . \n asteroid 2008 tc@xmath1 was discovered 19 hours before it impacted the earth on october 7 , 2008 ( ( * ? ? ? \n * jenniskens et al . \n photometric observations before the impact revealed that the asteroid was an elongated body in excited rotational state with period of rotation 99.2 s and period of precession 97.0 s ( ( * ? ? ? \n * scheirich et al . \n 2010 ) ) . by combining various data , \n the most probable dimensions were estimated to be @xmath2 m , mass 40,000 kg , bulk density 1800 kg m@xmath3 , and porosity @xmath4 ( ( * ? ? ? * borovika et al . \n the impact occurred in sudan and numerous small meteorites ( @xmath5 kg ) were found in the desert ( ( * ? ? ? * jenniskens et al . \n surprisingly , the meteorites were of various mineralogical types ( ( * ? ? ? \n * bischoff et al . 2010 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * shaddad et al . 2010 ) ) . \n the body was therefore clearly heterogeneous and seems to be good candidate for a rubble pile . \n the data on the behavior of the body during the atmospheric entry are , unfortunately , scarce . \n there was a major flare at the height of 37  km and probably other flares at 53 , 45 , and 32 km ( ( * ? ? ? \n * jenniskens et al . \n 2009 ) , ( * ? ? \n * borovika & charvt 2009 ) ) . \n fireball flares are evidences of meteoroid fragmentation \n . atmospheric fragmentation of meteoroids is a common process ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? \n * ceplecha et al . 1993 ) ) . \n it occurs when the dynamic pressure , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is atmospheric density and @xmath8 is meteoroid velocity ) exceeds meteoroid strength . while the tensile strength of monolithic rocks ( meteorites ) exceeds 30 mpa , the strengths of meteoroids inferred from their atmospheric fragmentations was found to be in the range 0.1  10 mpa ( ( * ? ? ? * popova et al . \n the lowered strength is likely caused by internal fractures . in this respect almahata sitta was not exceptional . \n the flares occurred at pressures 0.3  1.3 mpa . \n such strength is much higher than 25 pa expected for rubble piles .    in this paper \n i explore the possibility that the observed fragmentations are in fact only the secondary break - ups of the building boulders of rubble piles . at least in some cases \n the first break - up may occurs at pressures of @xmath9 pa . \n the question is if we can find evidences for the initial high altitude fragmentation in the bolide data .    , @xmath10 , @xmath11 kg m@xmath3).,width=307 ] \n since there are no detailed data on the almahata sitta bolide , i will inspect another good candidate for rubble pile  the beneov meteoroid . the beneov meteoroid entered the atmosphere over the czech republic on may 7 , 1991 ( ( * ? ? ? * spurn 1994 ) ) . \n the bolide was well observed by three all - sky cameras and two high resolution photographic spectrographs ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika and spurn 1996 ) ) . \n four small meteorites were recovered in 2011  2012 . \n the meteorites were of different mineralogical types ( h and ll chondrites with achondritic clast ) , similarly to almahata sitta ( ( * ? ? ? \n * spurn et al . 2014 ) ) . \n the initial mass of the meteoroid , derived primarily from the amount of radiated energy , was 2000  4000 kg ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . 1998 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * ceplecha & revelle 2005 ) ) . \n the diameter was therefore larger than one meter . \n the initial velocity was 21.3 km s@xmath12 and the trajectory was almost vertical . \n obvious fragmentations occurred at heights 38 km and 25 km , under dynamic pressures of 2.5 mpa and 9 mpa , respectively . nevertheless , the deceleration at heights around 45 km was so strong that the body must have been fragmented already there . \n figure  [ decel ] demonstrates the observed deceleration . \n the lag in trajectory is plotted as a function of height . \n the lag is the difference between the actual position of the fireball at a given time and the position expected for constant velocity . \n the lag is zero as long as there is no deceleration . \n naturally , at a given height , deceleration will be larger for a smaller body ( provided that shape and density is the same ) . \n surprisingly , the observed lag does not follow the curve for a mass of 2000 kg . instead , the mass corresponding to the observed lag is only 40 kg . \n the discrepancy was noted already by ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . ( 1998 ) ) but the mass was then computed for @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the drag coefficient and @xmath15 is the shape coefficient ) . \n here we use a more realistic value @xmath16 . \n the density of the meteoroid is assumed to be @xmath11 kg m@xmath3 . \n lowering the density to 400 kg m@xmath3 would explain the observed deceleration , however , such a low density is unrealistic considering the types of the meteorites . \n it is much more likely that the meteoroid was already disrupted into large number of fragments at a height of 50 km . \n the mass of the largest fragment was about 40 kg . \n the question is where the disruption occurred . \n the dynamic pressure of 25 pa was reached at the height of 113 km , while the bolide started to be visible only at the height of 91 km . in principle \n it can be possible that the initial disruption occur earlier than the meteoroid surface reach the temperature needed for ablation and radiation . in that case \n we would not see a direct evidence for fragmentation height in the bolide data . \n nevertheless , it can be expected that fragments of various masses are formed in the disruption . \n mass segregation then occurs since smaller fragments decelerate more . at lower heights \n , the fireball will not be a point - like object but will be elongated with wake formed by smaller fragments . \n the length of the wake will depend on the mass distribution of fragments and on the height of fragmentation . \n the earlier the fragmentation occurred , the longer will be the wake .    to investigate beneov wake \n , we can use the high resolution spectral photographs . \n they were taken with lenses of focal length of 360 mm . \n the spatial resolution at bolide range 100 km is of the order of several meters . \n each camera was equipped by a transmission diffraction grating in front of the lens . \n as it is usual for bolides , the spectrum consisted primarily of atomic lines of metals evaporated from the meteoroid , in particular fe , mg , na , cr , mn , and ca . \n for our purposes it is important that the cameras were periodically closed by a rotating shutter . \n the frequency was 15 hz and the open - to - close ratio was approximately 2:1 . \n if the bolide were point - like , no signal would be visible between the shutter breaks . \n this was the case at the beginning , at heights above 84 km .    at lower heights , strong wake developed . \n figure  [ spectrum ] shows parts of the spectra at heights 70 km and 45 km . \n the wake at 70 km was so long that it filled the whole gaps between the shutter breaks . \n however , this was the case only for certain spectral lines , in particular low excitation lines of fe and mg with low transition probability . \n these lines are known to be strong in meteor wakes ( ( * ? ? ? \n * halliday 1968 ) ) . \n that kind of wake is , however , not produced by fragments but by cooling rarified gas behind the meteoroid . \n the situation changed at lower heights . at 45 km , \n the wake was shorter but its spectrum was more similar to the spectrum of the bolide head ( fig .  [ spectrum ] ) . \n we suppose that the wake was produced here mainly be small fragments lagging behind the large fragments forming the head . \n the length of the wake was about 250 meters at the height of 50 km . \n such length can be explained by fragments of masses 40  0.1 kg separated at 65 km . \n if separated at 113 km , the mass range must have been narrower , 40 \n 0.5 kg . while the larger mass range is more likely , \n the difference between these two scenarios is not substantial . \n the reason is that deceleration at heights above 80 km is negligible ( even for gram - sized fragments ) . \n the length of the wake is therefore , unfortunately , not very sensitive to the actual height of disruption . \n we will now look more closely at the light curve of the beneov bolide . \n figure  [ light ] shows the light curve as measured by ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika & spurn ( 1996 ) ) . \n shown are also two models of the ascending part of the light curve . \n there were no flares in this part , which would point out to fragmentation events . \n however , the slope changed several times . the steep slope at the beginning ( time @xmath17 s ) \n can be ascribed to the onset of ablation . \n this part was not modeled in detail . \n our model ( described in ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika et al . \n 2013a ) ) assumes that the ablation is in full progress . in that case \n the slope of the light curve in the middle part of the bolide is almost constant . \n indeed , the observed slope corresponds to the modeled slope during two intervals : 0  0.2 s ( heights 75  70 km ) and 0.7  1.4 s ( 60  45 km ) . in between \n , the slope was steeper . \n the model of instantaneous disruption at the height of 65 km shows a step on the light curve with the increase of brightness by more than two magnitudes at 65 km . \n the step is due to increased cross section of the meteoritic material after disruption . in reality , the disruption was more gradual and occurred within 0.5 s at heights 70  60 km . \n the second model , which assumed that the meteoroid had been disrupted already before the start of ablation , predicts too bright bolide at heights above 60 km and can not explain the observed change of slope . \n we therefore conclude that the disruption of beneov meteoroid started at the height of 70 km . \n the dynamic pressure at that time was 50 kpa , i.e.  three orders of magnitude higher than the strength of rubble piles . \n although not a rubble pile , the bulk strength of beneov was lower than of other meteorite dropping meteoroids ( ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2011 ) ) . \n the initial disruption was severe  the largest fragments were of only 1  2% of the original mass ( @xmath0% in terms of size ) . \n but the low strength is in accordance with the heterogeneous nature of the recovered meteorites ( ( * ? ? ? \n * spurn et al . 2014 ) ) . \n note that the similarly massive umava meteoroid fragmented at similar pressures , namely 25  140 kpa ( ( * ? ? ? \n * borovika & spurn 1996 ) ) . \n the behavior was , however , completely different in that case . \n the body was completely destroyed at height 59 km after several disruptions accompanied by large amplitude flares . \n umava was likely a cometary body with extremely high microporosity and low density ( @xmath18 100 kg m@xmath3 ) and easily disintegrated into dust . \n we can also briefly look at the chelyabinsk event of 15 february 2013  the largest well observed impact ( ( * ? ? ? \n * brown et al . \n 2013 ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2013 ) ) . \n the impactor size was @xmath19 meters ( mass @xmath20 kg ) , the entry speed was 19 km s@xmath12 , and trajectory slope 18@xmath21 . \n the first obvious fragmentation occurred at a height of 45 km under dynamic pressure of 0.5 mpa . \n catastrophic disruption occurred at 1  5 mpa ( ( * ? ? ? * borovika et al . \n 2013b ) , ( * ? ? ? \n * popova et al . 2013 ) ) . \n deceleration was negligible until the disruption , yielding a lower limit of the mass before the disruption of @xmath22 kg ( ( * ?

[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to the ber test , we performed a receiver margin analysis , or eye scan , using the xilinx ibert tool . \n the kintex-7 gtx transceivers have built - in diagnostic features which provide a mechanism to measure and visualize the receiver eye margin after rx equalizer  @xcite . \n sweeping the receiver sampling point and vertical offset voltage enables the generation of a ber map or statistical eye diagram , where the color represents @xmath5 . \n figure  [ fig : eye_diagram ] shows an example of the measured statistical eye diagram and the open blue region indicates that we can have error free operating points . \n the size of eye corresponds to the quality of the high speed serial communication after the rx equalization . \n all gtx transceiver channels have been tested and characterized using the ibert tool . \n furthermore , the eye scan has been done with a xilinx kintex-7 evaluation kit ( kc705 )  @xcite , which provides a `` golden '' reference for comparison studies . \n comparing the pulsar iia eye diagrams against the xilinx reference design helps us learn more about high speed layout techniques , which will be used in the next iteration of the board ( section  [ sec : pulsa2b ] ) . \n communication over the lvds lines between the fmc mezzanine and the main fpgas has been tested successfully at 400  mhz single data rate ( sdr ) and 200  mhz double data rate ( ddr ) . \n thirty - four lvds pairs running at this speed yield a bandwidth of 13.6  gb / s , which exceeds the atlas ftk requirements for the data formatter board . \n a crate - level testing followed the single board - level testing . \n we set up an atca shelf with a network switch blade in the hub slot and seven pulsar iia front boards as well as rtms in the node slots , as shown in figure  [ fig : crate_level_testing_photo ] .        in our system test \n the ipmc microcontroller communicates with the switch blade over the base interface network . \n we first log into the switch and then telnet into each pulsar iia board , where commands are issued to program the fpgas and monitor various board sensors . \n the default firmware image is setup to drive data over all gtx transceivers to the fabric , rtm and local bus channels . \n the xilinx ibert tool has also been used in the the crate to test the backplane performance . \n while our 10 g atca backplane is rated for only 3  gb / s per lane it has proven to work admirably at up to 6.25  gb / s across all slots , as shown in figure  [ fig : eye_scan_atca ] . \n leveraging the experience we gained through designing , building and testing the pulsar iia system we are in the final stages of laying out the next generation board , the pulsar iib ( figure  [ fig : pulsariib_block ] and figure  [ fig : pulsariib_photo ] ) . \n the new board design replaces the two kintex k325 t devices with a single large virtex-7 fpga . \n the gtx transceiver count has increased up to 80 channels , providing a significant bandwidth increase to the rtm , fabric and mezzanine cards . \n the power regulator sections of the board have been redesigned to handle the increased power required by the virtex-7 fpga . \n the pulsar iib boards will be used for the atlas ftk data formatter system . \n we anticipate that the boards will also be used for cms l1 tracking trigger early technical demonstrations  @xcite . \n the pulsar iia is our first atca prototype board and works as designed , as demonstrated by our successful stand - alone and crate - level tests . through this prototype development process \n we have gained experience using the latest xilinx fpgas and high speed serializers to communicate over the atca full mesh backplane . \n furthermore , the pulsar iia boards have successfully interfaced with other atca system components such as commercial switch blades and shelf manager cards . \n the pulsar iib boards will be used in the atlas ftk data formatter system starting in 2015 . \n the pulsar iib design forms the basic building block of a high performance scalable architecture , which may find applications beyond tracking triggers , and may serve as a starting point for future level-1 silicon - based tracking trigger r&d for cms , where the full mesh backplane is used most effectively for sophisticated time multiplexing data transfer schemes . \n our baseline design also works well as a general purpose fpga -

however , the reader should keep in mind that is not the whole story . recall that when fitting an interaction , the linearized equations are cast in the form @xmath48 . \n our analysis in this paper is entirely with the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , but in any fit one must also look to @xmath49 ( which in practice is the deviation of the theoretical spectra from experiment ) . for example , in @xcite it was found that using a contact interaction brought better agreement than a monopole interaction . \n one can understand this in terms of conjugate gradient methods @xcite : the direction of local steepest gradient may not in fact point towards the global minimum .    by our measures so far , both the tbre and the empirically - fit usdb look qualitatively similar . \n therefore we take a final analysis by comparing the dominant linear combinations of the usdb with those from the tbre . \n this is show in fig . \n 3 , using the same analysis as for fig .  2 . for comparison with the previous results , \n the leading eigenvalue is @xmath50 . \n we have analyzed the sensitivity of the low - lying spectra of the random two - body ensemble of interactions to variations of the hamiltonian matrix elements ; by using singular value decomposition , we find the dominant linear combinations , which would be important in any fit to experimental data . \n we found the svd eigenvalues follow a pattern remarkably similar to that shown by semi - realistic / semi - phenomenological interactions such as usdb . \n we also analyzed the most dominant linear combinations of matrix elements by computing the overlap with monopole and contact interactions . \n overall , both the tbre and the empirical usdb had qualitatively similar results . \n the u.s . \n department of energy supported this investigation through contracts de - fg02 - 96er40985 and de - fc02 - 09er41587 , and through subcontract b576152 by lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract de - ac52 - 07na27344 . \n a. poves and a. zuker : phys . \n rep . * 70 * , 235 ( 1981 ) . \n g. martnez - pinedo , a. p. zuker , a. poves , and e. caurier , phys . \n rev . c*55 * 187 ( 1997 ) . \n y. utsuno , t. otsuka , t. mizusaki , and m. honma : phys . \n c * 60 * , 054315 ( 1999 ) . \n m. honma , t. otsuka , b. a. brown , and t. mizusaki , phys . \n c * 69 * , 034335 ( 2004 ) . t. suzuki , s. chiba , t. yoshida , t. kajino , and t. otsuka phys.rev . \n c * 74 * , 034307 ( 2006 ) . \n skyrme , philos .  mag .  * 1 * , 1043 ( 1956 ) . \n m. bender , p .- h . \n heenen , and p .- \n reinhard , rev . \n phys . * 75 * , 121 ( 2003 ) u.  van kolck , prog . \n . phys . * 43 * , 337 ( 1999 ) ;

( [ beta ] ) \n thus , the parameter @xmath2 occurring in the tsallis statistics is shown to be entirely induced by the fluctuations of the parameter of the usual exponential distribution @xcite . following this interpretation , \n the average process employed to obtain @xmath24 characterizes an implicit connection with the tsallis statistics . \n to apply our distribution , eq . \n ( [ q - w ] ) , to investigate experimental and numerical simulated data , we consider the cumulative distribution for @xmath24 , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath44,\\ ] ] with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in connection with the @xmath2-exponential function , the @xmath2-logarithm function \n is usually defined as @xcite @xmath47 thus @xmath48=\\exp_q[\\ln_q(x)]=x$ ] . by using eq . \n ( [ q - rank ] ) , we obtain that the graph of @xmath49 $ ] versus @xmath9 gives a straight line since @xmath50\\,=\\beta\\,ln(t)\\,-\\,\\beta\\ln(\\alpha).\\ ] ] therefore , if a cumulative distribution relative to the dielectric breakdown for a given set of data , @xmath51 , is well described by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , then the @xmath2 parameter present in the @xmath2-logarithm is obtained through a linear adjustment , and the parameter @xmath17 is the slope of the graph . this procedure introduced here \n will be referred as a @xmath2-weibull plot .    to compare the usefulness of the weibull and the @xmath2-weibull distributions , we analyze experimental @xcite and simulation results . \n figure [ fig1](a ) , which is adapted from the work of wu et _ al . _ \n @xcite , shows a curvature in a graph @xmath52 $ ] versus @xmath7 $ ] . \n the variation of this slope is associated with oxide thickness fluctuations . \n in fact , wu _ et al . \n _ @xcite were able to generate this slope variation by performing simulations in which the oxide thickness obeyed a gaussian distribution . \n extrapolation of the slope of this plot from higher failure percentiles ( conventional experimental window ) to lower failure percentiles leads to an error in @xmath3 projection and , consequently , in projection of reliability . \n it is necessary to use large and time - consuming sample sizes ( thousands of devices ) in order to obtain @xmath3 distributions down to lower percentiles and avoid erroneous projections . \n the same @xmath3 data can be correctly fitted in the entire range of percentiles by the @xmath2-weibull distribution , as shown in fig . [ \n fig1](b ) . in the @xmath2-weibull plot \n , the data follow a straight line . \n we conclude that , by taking the fluctuations of the modal parameter of the weibull distribution into account , one obtains a statistical distribution which completely describes @xmath3 data when oxide fluctuations are present . \n therefore , the @xmath2-weibull distribution allows improved @xmath3 projection for ultra - thin oxides and does not require a very large number of samples , _ \n i.e. _ , correct @xmath3 extrapolation can be performed in the conventional experimental window . \n this is a striking benefit brought by the @xmath2-weibull distribution . \n in addition to correct @xmath3 projection , we have found that the @xmath2-weibull also improves area scaling , another important consideration for reliability studies @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig2](a ) , we have used the data from the work of teramoto _ et al . _ @xcite . \n they studied the time - dependent dielectric breakdown for @xmath10 thin sio@xmath4 oxides with samples areas of @xmath12 and @xmath53 , and subjected to a @xmath54 applied field . \n it is clear , when comparing fig . \n [ fig2](a ) and fig . \n [ fig2](b ) , that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better area scaling than the weibull one , another remarkable benefit . \n when @xmath3 data are plotted in a limited range of percentiles , the differences between the @xmath2-weibull and the weibull distributions become less apparent , but can still be seen . as an example , we consider the simulations performed by sombra _ \n they developed a percolation model to describe the dielectric breakdown of a mos capacitor investigating effects of bias polarity , oxide film thickness and electric field strength . \n the hot electron injection is either through the gate or the substrate . in fig . \n [ fig3](a ) we have performed a linear fit of the simulation data of sombra @xcite with the weibull distribution , while in fig . \n [ fig3](b ) we depict the same data but with a linear fit through the @xmath2-weibull distribution . \n one can see once more that the @xmath2-weibull distribution gives a better fit than the weibull one , for small and large @xmath3 . \n in summary , we conclude that : ( _ i _ ) fluctuation on the modal value is a mechanism to explain deviations from the weibull distribution in reliability studies of electronics devices ; ( _ ii _ ) this fluctuation leads to a generalization of the weibull distribution ( @xmath2-weibull distribution ) and a connection with the tsallis statistics ; and ( _ iii _ ) the generalized weibull distribution leads to a better adjustment of experimental and simulated data in comparison with the weibull one , giving improved @xmath3 extrapolation and area scaling . \n finally , the results presented here can be very useful for an improved description of the dielectric breakdown in the high dielectric constant materials @xcite which will be present in future generations of advanced mos devices . \n the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the brazilian national research council ( cnpq ) under contract cnpq - nanosemimat # 550.015/01 - 9 , and the ministry of planning ( finep ) through ctpetro under contracts # 65.00.02.80.00 and # 5000013/01 - 2 , during the development of this work . \n g. d. wilk , r. m. wallace , and j. m. anthony , j. appl . \n phys . * 89 * , 5243 ( 2001 ) ; r. a. mackee , f. j. walker , m. f. chisholm , phys . \n . lett . * 81 * , 3014 ( 1998 ) ; r. a. mackee , f. j. walker , m. f. chisholm , science * 293 * , 468 ( 2001 ) ; v. fiorentini and g. gulleri , phys . \n 89 * , 6101 ( 2002 ) ; d. muller , t. sorsch , s. moccio , f. baumann , k. evans - lutterdodt , and g. timp , nature * 399 * , 758 ( 1999 ) .                                c. tsallis , j. stat . phys . * 52 * , 479 ( 1988 ) ; c. tsallis , r. s. mendes and a. r. plastino , physica a * 261 * , 534 ( 1998 ) ; c. tsallis , in : s. abe , y. okamoto ( eds . ) , _ nonextensive statistical mechanics and its application _ , lecture notes in physics , springer , heidelberg , 2001 ; see http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br for periodically updated bibliography on the subject .", "StartTimeOffset": 2411975165766, "RequestID": "5ec916da2083bc42a7e1fe0fe082c725f69c117e", "TotalTokens": 3744}

{"ContextTokens": 3683, "GeneratedTokens": 253, "SynthesizedBody": "the recent discoveries of x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts by the beppo sax satellite @xcite have revolutionized the approach to these phenomena . for the first time since \n their discovery 30 years ago @xcite gamma ray bursts have been identified with sources at other wavelengths . in consequence \n optical afterglows have been discovered @xcite , which lead to identification of host galaxies @xcite . at the time of writing more than a dozen afterglows \n have been identified . \n the optical lightcurves of the grb afteglows decay as a power law @xmath0 with the typical values of the index @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in some cases the host galaxies have been found by observing the flattening of of the lightcurve . \n the underlying steady flux is identified as the emission of the host galaxy . in a few cases \n the host galaxies themselves were found as extended objects . \n this allowed to measure the offset between the location of the gamma - ray burst and the center of the host galaxy . \n a list five grbs and the offsets from their host galaxies is shown in table  [ table1 ] . \n the offsets are generally small and the afterglows lie directly on the host galaxies . in other cases where the host galaxy have been only found from the flattening of the lightcurve we know that the location of the host galaxy and the grb do not differ substantially from the simple fact that the host galaxies have been identified . \n there are two basic categories of theoretical models of the central engines of gamma - ray bursts within the cosmological model . \n the first class connects gamma - ray bursts with mergers of compact objects , e.g. neutron stars and/or black holes . \n there exist numerous scenarios in this set of models , some of them link grbs with the coalescence of a black hole neutron star binary @xcite . in other models like in the recent paper by @xcite the grb events are related to mergers of two neutron stars . \n compact object merger model provides enough energy to power a grb , and it has been showed in the numerical simulations @xcite that the coalescence may last up to a second . \n the analytical estimations of @xcite extend this timescale up to a minute . \n the second class of models @xcite relates grbs to explosions of supermassive stars , so called hypernovae . \n a direct prediction in this class of models is that gamma - ray bursts are related to the star forming regions . \n the relation between the grb location and the host galaxies does not have to be true in the models that relate grbs to compact object mergers . \n tutukov and yungelson have calculated the compact object merger rates , and also found that compact object binaries may travel the distances up to @xmath3kpc before merging . in a more detailed study \n @xcite calculated a population of compact object binaries using the population synthesis method of pols and marinus and then calculated the spatial distribution of mergers in the potentials of galaxies for w few representative masses . \n they found that approximately @xmath4% of mergers take place outside the host galaxies ) . \n they have used the a maxwellian kick velocity distribution with @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 @xcite    in this work we use the the population synthesis code based on @xcite and extended by belczyski and bulik . \n we concentrate on the dependence of the properties of the compact object binaries on the parameters used in the population synthesis code . \n we find that the most important parameter that determines the population of compact object binaries is the kick velocity a neutron star receives at birth , however this distribution is poorly known . \n iben and tutukov claim that the properties of pulsars can be explained by only the recoil velocities with no need for the kicks . \n blaauw and ramachandran find that a single kick velocity of @xmath7kms@xmath6 suffices to reproduce the pulsar population . \n cordes and chernoff proposed a weighted sum two gaussians : 80 percent with the width @xmath8 km  s@xmath6 and 20 percent with the width @xmath9  km  s@xmath6 . \n we outline the model of the binary evolution and propagation in a galactic potential in section  2 . \n the results of the calculation are presented in section  3 and we discuss them in section  4 . \n in order to study the spatial distribution of compact object mergers we use the population synthesis method . \n we use the population synthesis code @xcite which concentrates on the population of massive star binaries , i.e. those that may eventually lead to formation of compact objects and compact object binaries . \n we include the evolution of the binaries due to interaction and mass transfer and also the kicks that a newly born neutron star receives in supernova explosion . \n a binary may be disrupted in each of the supernova events . \n the surviving binaries obtain center of mass velocities , which change their trajectories and may even eject them from their galaxy . \n while the evolution of single stars depends only on their mass and metallicity the evolution of binaries is also a function the initial orbit ( semimajor axis @xmath10 , and eccentricity @xmath11 ) of the two stars . \n we assume that the distribution of the initial parameters can be expressed as a product of distributions of four parameters : the larger star ( primary ) mass @xmath12 , the mass ratio of the less massive to the more massive star in the binary @xmath13 , and the orbital parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e that this quantities are independent . \n the distribution of primary masses used here is @xcite @xmath14 and we adopt a flat distribution of the mass ratio @xmath13 . \n the semi major axis distribution is scale invariant , i.e. @xmath15 with the limits @xmath16 , and we draw the eccentricity from a distribution @xmath17 . \n we assume that the kick velocity distribution is a three dimensional gaussian , and parameterize it with its width @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 we generate population of compact object binaries for a few values of @xmath18 in order to asses the sensitivity of our results to this parameter . \n .grbs with measured offsets from the centers of their host galaxies . [ cols=\"<,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ] \n the kick velocity distribution is not very well known . \n therefore , we use the population synthesis code with four values of the kick velocity distribution width : with no kick velocities @xmath20 km  s@xmath6 , and with @xmath21 km  s@xmath6 . \n this covers the range of values this distribution is likely to have . \n this the same approach as adopted in our previous work @xcite . \n the binaries receive kicks for two reasons . \n first , the envelope of the supernova is lost from the system and it carries away some momentum . thus even in the case when there is no kick velocity a binary achieves an additional velocity @xcite . \n second , if the supernova explosion is asymmetric both the newly formed compact object may receive a kick velocity which affects the orbit of the binary after the explosion as well as its center of mass velocity . \n the fate of a binary system in a supernova explosion depends on the value and direction of the kick velocity , on the orbital phase at which the explosion occurs , and on the parameters of the binary : the masses and orbital parameters @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . \n we present the population of compact object binaries in the plane spanned by the center of mass velocity ofter the second supernova expolsion and time to merge in figure  [ vt ] . \n the orbital @xcite effects are isolated and shown in the top left panel of figure  [ vt ] , where we present the results of the simulation with @xmath22 . \n there is a tail of long lived systems with lifetimes much longer than the hubble time and small velocities , stretching outside of the boundaries of the plot to the lifetimes even of @xmath23years . \n these systems originally had large orbital separations , and hardly interacted in the course of their binary lifetime . in the case when there are no kicks the center of mass velocity of the comapct object binary depends on the amount of mass lost in the supernova explosion . in the extreme case of large mass loss , the center of \n mass velocity approaches the orbital velocity at the moment of supernova explosion , and it can never exceed it . \n the velocity of the system increases with increasing mass loss , however the systems that loose too much mass become unbound . \n this is why the lower part of the plot below @xmath24years is empty . \n with increasing the kick velocity also the typical velocity of a system increases and there appear short lived systems in tight orbits . \n they can now survive a large mass loss when the kick velocity has a favorable direction . \n thus as the kick velocity is increased only the tightly bound systems ( with short merger time ) can survive the supernova explosions . \n another effect of the kick velocity is that the long lived systems with @xmath25 much longer than the hubble time , which were present in the case @xmath26 km  s@xmath6 disappear . \n the typical velocity of a system increases with the kick velocity . \n however , the population of the comapct merger binaries is not much affected when the kick velocity becomes large , e.g. changing the kick velocity distribution width from @xmath26 km  s@xmath6 to @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 produces a much stronger effect than going from @xmath27 km  s@xmath6 to @xmath28 km  s@xmath6 . \n most of the systems are disrupted by such high velocities , and the surviving ones are only those for which the kick are not so large and have a favorable direction . \n another effect of increasing the kick velocity is that the typical lifetime of a system becomes smaller . \n when the kick velocity is large only very tight , and/or highly eccentric systems survive , hence the typical lifetime of compact object binaries decreases . \n it should be noted the typical center of mass velocity of the compact object binaries increases roughly linearly with the kick velocity , while the lifetime decreases approximately exponentially .    in figure  [ vt ] \n we also plot following @xcite the lines corresponding to the hubble time ( the dashed line ) , and we mark the region with the stars that will escape from a galactic potential . in order to escape a binary must satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) it has to have a velocity larger than the escape velocity , ( ii ) the distance @xmath29must be larger than the size of the galzxy . \n we also draw the line at @xmath30myrs , to denote the systems that merger within the hubble time . \n all the systems to the right of the solid line in figure  refvt have velocities above @xmath7 km  s@xmath6 , and live long enough to travel further than @xmath31kpc . \n we should also note that although each panel in figure  [ vt ] contans @xmath32 systems , the production rate of compact object binaries decreases exponentially with the increasing kick velocity ( see eq . 13 in belczyski and bulik ) .    in figures  [ distuz ] and  [ distvt ] we present the cumulative distributions of the projected distance from the center of the host galaxy in case ( i ) and from their the place of birth in case ( ii ) , respectively , of the systems that merge within the hubble time . \n when the binaries propagate in the potential of a large galaxy the kick velocity only weakly influences the the distribution of the mergers . below the radius of @xmath33kpc the distribution \n is determined by the potential well . \n this is where all short lived and slow systems merge . \n there exists however a tail of high velocity , long lived systems ( see figure  [ vt ] ) that manage to escape . \n the escaping fraction is a weak function of the kick velocity . \n typically the number of systems that merge further than @xmath31kpc from the center of the host galaxy is @xmath34% , except for the unphysical case of no kick velocities when it drops below @xmath35% .    in the other extreme case of small host galaxies for which we neglect the gravitational potential \n the escaping fraction can be even larger . \n the escaping fraction decreases from @xmath36% for the kick velocity @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 to about @xmath38% for @xmath39 km  s@xmath6 . \n the reason for such behavior is clearly seen from figure  [ vt ] . in the product of center of mass velocity and time to merge the dominant role is played by the fast decrease of the time to merge with the increasing kick velocity @xmath18 . \n these quantitative results are visualized in figures  [ empty - dot ] and  [ gala - dot ] . here \n we show the distribution of @xmath32 mergers around massive galaxy and in the empty space . \n we are showing four panels that cover the scales from @xmath33kpc to @xmath33mpc . in the case of the propagation in a massive galaxy \n we are showing the projection in the plane of the galactic disk so the effects of the rotational velocity and the asymmetry of the potential well are visible . \n both calculations have been done for the case of the kick velocity distribution width @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 . \n we find that a significant fraction i.e. more than @xmath35 percent of compact object mergers take place outside of the host galaxies . \n the figures obtained for our case of no gravitational potential should be considered as an upper limit only . \n in contrast the observations show that the grb afterglows lie on the host galaxies @xcite . \n however , our sample of the observed grbs with afterglows is yet limited to the bursts longer than @xmath40s as bepposax triggers on this timescale . \n long bursts could be connected with the hypernovae - like events and therefore they are closely associated with the galaxies . \n compact object mergers may be connected with the short bursts , although it has been argued that mass transfer in the coalescence of compact object may last much longer @xcite . \n our results are consistent with the calculation by @xcite , for the case of a massive galaxy and the kick velocity distribution width @xmath41 km  s@xmath6 . \n we have verified the dependence of the distribution of compact object mergers on @xmath18 . \n our results show that for the case of massive galaxies the escaping fraction weakly depends on the distribution of kick velocities . \n we include also binaries with objects that are higher mass than the canonical @xmath42 . \n these binaries are formed through accretion from a giant companion onto the neutron star . in this calculation \n the highest mass of a compact object is below @xmath43 . \n the distribution of these more massive binaries is slightly more concentrated around the galaxies . \n it has to be noted that there is a numnber of potential selection effects which may affect the results of this study . assuming that compact objcet mergers are reponsible for grbs there may be qualitative differences between the ns - ns mergers and ns - bh mergers . as indicated above \n , their spatial distribution around host galaxies is different . \n also the typical timescale of the bursts may be different between these two classes . \n gamma - ray bursts form two separate classes ( long vs. short ) with different brightness distributions and spectra ( short burst are harder than the long ones ) . \n so far the study of afterglows has been possible only for the long bursts \n . it may be the case that compact object mergers are connected with the short bursts for which so far no information about the host galaxies exist . \n the host galaxies have been identified in a long observational procedure : a gamma - ray burst lead to identification of a fading x - ray source , and then to discovery of the optical afterglow . \n precise observations of the optical afterglows lead to the disory of host galaxies . \n there are bursts for which the x - ray or optical afterglows were not found . \n since afterglows are usually connected with external shocks , gamma - ray bursts that take place outside of galaxies have much weaker afterglows because of the low density of intergalactic matter . \n begelmann etal . \n begelman and meszaros argue that the afterglow emission depends scales only with the square root of the density of the outside medium . \n the mean external densities measured from the analysis of the known afterglow lightcurves are typically @xmath44  @xmath45 @xcite , while the intergalactic medium may be as rarified as @xmath46@xmath45 . \n hence the afterglow of a burst taking place outside a galaxy may be up to two orders of magnitude weaker than the one in a galaxy . \n it shows that there may be a strong preference against identification of host galaxies for the bursts that take place outside of galaxies \n .    acknowledgments . \n this work has been funded by the following kbn

four different mobility modes are shown for the 4tm human vkor model ( figure 3 ) and the 3 tm human vkor model ( figure 4 ) . \n for the human 4tm vkor model ( figure 3 ) , the 4th tm domain including cxxc motif ( including c132 and c135 ) shows large mobility in the translation , rotation , slide and tilt movements in relatively small mode number ( 50 - 100 approximately ) . \n interestingly , the mobility of the 1st tm domain increases in translation , slide and tilt movements in high frequency mode ( mode number 150 - 200 approximately ) . for the human 3tm vkor model ( figure 4 ) , \n the 3rd tm domain including cxxc motif shows large mobility in translation , rotation , slide and tilt movements in low frequency mode . \n it is a common feature that the tm domain including cxxc motif shows significant mobility for both human 3tm/4tm vkor models . \n we compare the cumulative squared overlap values for the 1st tm domains of the 3tm/4tm human vkor models (

\n the mobility of the 1st tm domain of the 4tm human vkor model shows more mobility than that of the 1st domain of the 3tm human vkor model in the tilt , slide , and rotation mode ( figure 4 ) . in a similar way \n , the mobility of the 4th tm domain of the 4tm human vkor model shows more mobility than that of its corresponding 3rd domain of the 3tm human vkor model in the tilt , rotation and translation mode ( figure 6 ) . \n significantly , the mobility of the 3rd tm domain of the 4tm human vkor model is greater than that of its corresponding 2nd domain of the 3tm human vkor model in the translation , tilt , slide , and rotation mode ( figure 5 ) . \n nma analysis shows that the mobility of the individual tm domain of the 4tm human vkor is more than that of the its corresponding tm domain of the 3tm human vkor model . \n we compare the backbone rmsd values of each domain ( excluding loop regions ) for the 3tm/4tm human vkor models during 60 ns simulation ( figure 7 ) . \n the backbone rmsd values show large fluctuation up to 20 ns for all the tm domains for both 3tm/4tm human vkor models , implying that the dynamical equilibration process occurs up to 20 ns in the simulation . after 20 ns , \n backbone rmsd of all the tm domains reach plateau values , implying that the system approaches to equilibrium state . \n the less mobility of the 3tm human vkor model is relevant to hydrophobic interactions between the leucine / isoleucine residues on each tm domain . \n the hydrophobic interactions between the leucine / isoleucine residues contributes to the stability of each tm domain : leu22 ( tm1):leu105(tm2 ) , leu15(tm1):leu128(tm3 ) , and leu108(tm2):ile136(tm3 ) @xcite . \n figure 9 shows the hydrophobic interactions between leucine / isoleucine residues and their bond lengthes measured during 60 ns simulation . \n up to 20 ns simulation , the bond lengths show dramatic changes , implying the dynamical equilibration process . \n the nma analysis based on the elastic network model estimates the mobility of the tm helices in the translation , rotation , slide and tilt mode for the last snapshot of the 3tm \n /4tm vkor models . in an alternative approach to nma , the backbone rmsd value ( excluding loop regions ) from the md simulation trajectory shows the entire time profile of individual tm domain movement during 60 ns . \n interestingly , the nma analysis results are compatible with the backbone rmsd results after 40 ns of the md simulation . from the analysis of the tm domain mobility based on the nma and md simulation \n , we conclude that the tm domains of the 4tm human vkor model are more mobile than their corresponding tm domains of the 3tm human vkor model . \n it implies the 3tm human vkor model is more stable than the 4tm human vkor model . \n the origin of the stability of the 3tm human vkor model comes from the hydrophobic interactions between the leucine / isoleucine residues on each tm domain . \n the movement of individual tm domain of the 3tm human vkor model is more suppressed by the hydrophobic interactions between the leucine / isoleucine residues than that of the 4tm human vkor model . \n b.

{"ContextTokens": 3823, "GeneratedTokens": 177, "SynthesizedBody": "since the launch of the xmm - newton and chandra satellites @xcite , measurements of the x - ray emission from hot gas in clusters of galaxies have achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy and depth . \n however , the physical origin of the scaling relations between observable quantities , such as the luminosity of the x - ray emitting gas and its temperature , remain only partly understood . \n there are currently a number of surveys @xcite in progress with the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the processes that define correlations such as the luminosity - temperature ( l - t ) relation of clusters . \n for this potential to be realised we require a sound theoretical basis upon which to work . to this end , \n numerical hydrodynamical simulations have become indispensable tools and continue to grow in size and complexity @xcite but they have to date lacked a sufficiently large dynamic range in mass . in this work \n we use a hydrodynamical model of a large volume that contains over a hundred galaxy clusters . for the first time we are able to study the evolutionary processes within a cosmological context \n as we have hundreds of well resolved objects spanning a large dynamic range rather than the more typical handful @xcite ( hereafter r04 ) , or idealised models @xcite . \n this paper is organised as follows : in the remainder of this section we summarise the work done to date on defining the physical processes that define the shape of the l - t relation . then , in section 2 , we give an account of the simulations we have undertaken , explain how our cluster sub - sample was selected and how the properties of these clusters were derived . \n section 3 details our results before we discuss their implications and conclude in section 4 . \n x - rays are chiefly emitted from the hot gas in clusters via thermal bremsstrahlung ( for dark matter halos more massive than @xmath1 their temperature is typically above @xmath2 ) . \n for such a homologous population @xcite showed that simple scaling relations were expected between bulk properties such as the mass , temperature and luminosity . \n observational work subsequently found that the properties of x - ray clusters where indeed related but the slopes of the relations were not those derived by kaiser . \n @xcite assumed that galaxy clusters were self - similar entities and that therefore only a single property , such as the mass , was required in order to describe the other bulk properties . \n such a homology results in an l - t relation with a power - law slope of 2 . \n however , as figure  [ obsdata ] demonstrates , x - ray observations of clusters with a median redshift of @xmath3 found that the slope was closer to 3 @xcite and perhaps became even steeper on group scales @xcite . \n hydrodynamical simulations performed in the absence of cooling or any additional heat sources other than compression and shock heating have long been known to reproduce the self - similar hierarchy well @xcite . \n unfortunately they do not reproduce either the slope or the normalisation of the observations , producing clusters that are too bright for any given temperature , even at the bright end . following this work , \n simulations with limited physics within a cosmological volume have been used in an attempt to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between theory and observation regarding the slope of the l - t relation @xcite . \n these models showed that a simple cooling or preheating scheme was sufficient to match the simulated l - t relation to that observed at redshift zero . \n more recently @xcite investigated the effects of feedback on the x - ray properties of clusters in hydrodynamical simulations , and demonstrated that their results were in good agreement with both the observed scaling relations and structural properties ( e.g. entropy and temperature profiles ) , particularly for cool - core clusters . \n @xcite investigated the role that preheating , cooling and concentration of the halo profile can have on the scaling relations . \n they found that , for a realistic range of halo concentrations , the scatter generated was minimal in comparison with observed values . \n variations in the cooling time of the gas in the centre of clusters could account for much of the scatter but is limited by the age of the universe and so could not explain the whole range . \n finally , varying feedback from supernovae and agn could explain the entire range , but required an order of magnitude difference in energy injection to cover the whole envelope . \n their result implies that it is processes in the cores of clusters that are primarily responsible for driving the scatter in the scaling relations . \n this confirms earlier work by @xcite and @xcite . \n @xcite identify the scatter with strong cool core clusters , and expect the scatter to be smaller at high redshift due to the diminished prevalence of such systems . \n nowadays , the general consensus is that the scatter is largely due to the strength of the x - ray core . in this work , which includes strong preheating , \n x - ray cores are absent . \n this allows us to study the shape of the relation without the additional complication of a large intrinsic scatter .    in this work \n we will use a sample of halos identified from the full simulation volume . with these \n we will show that because mergers tend to move clusters up the l - t relation they extend it beyond the point where the most massive , relaxed clusters are expected to lie . \n thus many of the brightest , most luminous objects are ongoing or recent merger events which ( as r04 point out ) may be difficult to resolve observationally if they are close to the peak of the merger . \n in addition , because we have many closely spaced outputs we can track the motion of each of our clusters on the l - t plane , allowing us to define a `` mean merger '' vector . as this vector is not perfectly parallel to the l - t relation but rather falls slightly below it , a gentle roll in the relation naturally arises . \n the simulation used in this work is part of the millennium gas simulations @xcite . \n this sequence of hydrodynamical simulations all have the same volume as the millennium simulation @xcite as well as utilising the same amplitude and phase for the initial perturbations . \n the cosmological parameters for both the millennium simulation and the gas counterparts were : @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where the hubble constant is characterised as @xmath6 these cosmological parameters are consistent with recent combined analyses from _ wmap _ data @xcite and the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite . the simulation volume is a comoving cube of linear size @xmath7 containing @xmath8 million dark matter particles and @xmath8 million gas particles . \n their masses are @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . \n the simulation includes radiative cooling of the gas , with the metalicity set at a constant value of @xmath11 , similar to that observed within the intra - cluster medium @xcite and preheating . \n the preheating is implemented in a similar way to @xcite : at redshift @xmath12 the whole volume is heated to @xmath13 , a value chosen such that the resulting l - t relation at redshift @xmath14 matches observations . \n star particles are formed from cold , dense gas particles when a temperature threshold ( @xmath15 k ) , a density threshold ( @xmath16 g.@xmath17 and an overdensity threshold ( @xmath18 times critical ) are all passed , but the process of converting gas to stars has no effect on the thermal dynamics of the system , other than to make the particles collisionless . \n the effect of the preheating in this simulation is so extreme as to prevent any further star formation since redshift @xmath12 .      at redshift zero \n the entire volume was processed to obtain a set of friends - of - friends halos with a linking length of @xmath19 times the mean interparticle separation . within each of these halos \n the most bound particle was found and used as the centre for a spherical over - density calculation that extended to @xmath20 , a radius enclosing an over - density of 200 times the cosmic mean . \n the analysis presented in this work is for a fixed radius of @xmath21 ( the radius enclosing an over - density 500 times the the cosmic mean density ) , roughly @xmath22 for nfw halos @xcite of typical concentration . within this radius \n we calculate the bolometric luminosity and the emission weighted temperature assuming a standard @xcite cooling function for a uniform metalicity gas of @xmath23 . \n three sub - samples were selected from the top , bottom and median of the l - t relation . \n we refer to the sample of clusters that are more luminous and/or cooler than expected as coming from the top of the relation , with conversely under luminous , hot clusters coming from the bottom . \n we also select a control sample of clusters from close to the median of the relation . \n the clusters were selected such that the range of masses within each sample spanned the entirety of the available relation . \n we only consider objects containing more than 1000 particles and that are at least two virial radii away from any larger neighbour . \n this ensures a meaningful estimate of the cluster bulk properties . \n once selected at redshift zero , each of our 108 clusters was traced backwards in time until their mass dropped below our imposed resolution threshold of 1000 particles . \n the final locations of the selected clusters on the l - t plane are shown on figure  [ sample ] , where the high scatter clusters are indicated by open circles , low scatter by open squares and the control sample by filled circles . \n the full sample is shown faintly in the background , together with our fitted median relation indicated by the line . \n once the mass accretion histories of the sample had been extracted a small amount of smoothing was introduced in order to remove merger induced ringing in the cluster mass . \n the l - t histories of nine low scattered halos ranked by final mass are shown in figure  [ llt ] , with their respective mass accretion histories given in figure  [ lm ] . \n the dark track in the l - t plane follows the history of each object from redshift 1.5 to the present day . \n the background points show the location of the entire sample of clusters in the l - t plane at @xmath24 . to the bottom right of each panel \n are two additional vectors . \n the short line shows the mean evolution of the control sample between @xmath25 and the present . \n the other longer line shows the evolution of each particular group over the same redshift interval . \n while the control sample moves slightly up in luminosity and down in temperature , 8 of the 9 low scattered clusters move dramatically to larger luminosities and temperatures , nearly parallel to the spine of the l - t relation . \n this is in agreement with the trend noticed by r04 . \n figure  [ lm ] , which shows the corresponding mass accretion histories for these objects demonstrates that 8 of the 9 low scattered objects are in the process of an ongoing major merger and are much hotter and brighter than would be typical for objects of their mass . in each of these panels \n merger events are denoted by the bold sections of line . \n the masses at redshift 1.5 are significantly lower than expected in all bar one case , ( the mean mass accretion history for objects of each mass is indicated by the dotted line on figure  [ lm ] ) . \n figures  [ hlt ] & [ hm ] show the l - t evolution and mass accretion histories for nine of the high scattered clusters . \n these nine halos end up significantly above the mean relation and as can be seen from their l - t tracks in figure  [ hlt ] eight of the nine ( all except panel e ) slightly lose temperature rather than gain temperature along with the mean of the control sample . \n the mass accretion history makes it clear why this is the case : all bar panel ( e ) assemble their final mass early , with significantly more mass in place at @xmath26 than that collected by the control sample . \n the object in panel ( e ) has just undergone a merger . \n we conclude , as did @xcite , that high - scattered objects are in general early forming with consequently slightly more concentrated dark matter profiles resulting in slightly more luminous objects at a particular final mass . \n as discussed in the previous section the motion of an object on the l - t plane during a merger is a significant driver behind finding it below the mean l - t relation at any given mass , particular at the high - mass end . to explore this \n further we extracted a sample of mergers from the mass accretion histories of the clusters used previously in this work . in order to distinguish a merger from gradual accretion we require that a cluster gains significant extra mass over a short period of time . \n specifically we define a merger in the following way :    * a growth in mass through the merger event of at least 15% of the cluster s final mass . \n * a ratio of at least @xmath27:@xmath28 between the mass before the merger and the mass at the peak of the merger . \n * the mass accretion rate must exceed 14% of the final mass per gyr . \n merger events automatically identified using this procedure are shown on the mass accretion history figures  [ lm ] & [ hm ] as the bold sections of the lines . \n the peak of a merger is considered to be the point at which the cluster s mass is greatest . as the dark matter \n halos subsequently pass through each other the final mass is usually below this value . as can immediately be guessed by simply comparing the number of bold line sections in figures  [ llt ] & [ hlt ] the mean number of mergers undergone by clusters in the low - scattered sample is over three times higher than clusters in the high - scattered sample . \n by identifying the location on the l - t plane of each object at the start and peak of each merger we can produce a `` cricket score '' diagram ( figure  [ mergefit ] ) , where each line denotes the motion on the l - t plane due to one merger . as the merger timescale is short \n the net drift of the relation is small while the merger is ongoing . \n as can be clearly seen , the net effect of a typical merger is to move an object up the relation and on average slightly below it . \n this tendency for mergers to fall below the mean relation is further evidenced by the large number of ongoing mergers present amongst the low - scattered objects . \n interestingly , an `` average merger '' vector , indicated by the dotted line on figure  [ mergefit ] , closely parallels the slope of the very high mass clusters . \n the tendency for mergers to boost clusters along , but at a slight angle to , the relation also drives a slight roll that is found at the high mass end of the l - t relation . \n this work examines the physics that underlies the spine of the x - ray l - t relation . due to our strong preheating prescription \n our halos do not have strong cores and as such do not reproduce the large scatter in the observed l - t relation , allowing us a clear window into the basic physics . \n we intend to examine the physical origin of the observed scatter in future work @xcite where a more physically motivated energy feedback prescription will be used and bright cooling cores are present . \n preheating schemes such as the one used here are well known to accurately reproduce the slope and normalisation of the l - t relation as a whole @xcite . \n the model we have implemented also accurately reproduces the mean location of halos on the l - t plane at the present day but in a much larger volume than has typically been used previously . in the real world \n bright cooling cores will further complicate matters but the processes discussed here which relate to the outer halo properties will underlie these , with the variation in core properties leading to a scatter about the relation discussed here .    by identifying mergers using the mass accretion histories of our objects and matching these episodes to the motion of each object on the l - t plane \n we have derived a `` mean merger '' vector in this plane . \n this vector lies largely parallel to the cluster l - t relation , as previously noted by ro4 . at any particular time \n the mass function of the dark matter haloes present within a volume will be exponentially truncated at the high mass end above some characteristic mass scale . \n the large boost generated during a merger will produce points on the l - t plane appearing to lie above this characteristic mass , where there should be few objects . \n we therefore expect the majority of the brightest objects to be experiencing ongoing mergers , although they may be difficult to identify if they are close to their peak . \n the mean merger vector we have derived is not exactly parallel to the l - t relation but rather lies slightly below it . \n this behaviour leads to all bar one of our low - scattered objects being obvious recent or ongoing merger events ( figure  [ lm ] ) . \n we also note that at the high mass end the vast majority of our haloes lie below the mean relation shown on figure  [ sample ] . \n the fact that the mean merger vector lies slightly below the mean relation provides a natural explanation for the slight curvature evidenced in the simulated relation .    in summary , while it is straightforward to reproduce the observed slope and normalisation of the x - ray luminosity  temperature relation using a simple preheating scheme , such a scheme does not reproduce the observed scatter . as a preheating model includes the full underlying framework of the hierarchical build up of structure bulk mergers are not significant drivers of this scatter . \n mergers can , however , produce objects that are brighter and hotter than would be expected from the cluster mass as merger events drive objects along the l - t relation towards the bright end . \n we find that a typical merger track does not exactly parallel the l - t relation but rather lies slightly below it , leading to a prevalence of recent or ongoing merger events on the low - scattered side of the relation . \n this process also leads to a slight curvature of the mean relation at the high mass end . \n the millennium simulation referred to in this paper was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing centre of the max - planck society in garching . \n the millennium gas simulations were carried out at the nottingham hpc facility , as was the analysis required by this work .", "StartTimeOffset": 2464672171152, "RequestID": "24834b1a6259fcf5968eb27993846b8ee4124978", "TotalTokens": 4000}
{"ContextTokens": 3270, "GeneratedTokens": 215, "SynthesizedBody": "it is not yet known what exactly induces and maintains galactic warps . \n it may well be that a number of mechanisms  from among those proposed already , or some new ones \n act together or alone to produce this ubiquitous phenomenon . \n some proposed mechanisms rely on a dark galactic halo as a direct actuator or as a mediator of perturbations ( for reviews with extensive references see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) \n . the modified dynamics ( mond ) repudiates dark halos , but it offers a new mechanism that increases the warping efficacy of external perturbers over and above their possible tidal effects , which , notoriously , are too weak . \n this results from the nonlinearity of mond and is most clearly demonstrated in the case where a system ( a galaxy ) falls in an external field that by itself is approximately constant in space . in a linear theory , such as newtonian gravity \n , the constant external field has no effect on the internal dynamics of the system ( motions with respect to its center of mass ) ; in mond it very much does . when the external field dominates the internal field of the system it is easy to deduce what its effects are , as discussed e.g. in @xcite , and @xcite . in the present context \n the external acceleration is small compared with the internal ones at the position of the warp , which necessitates numerical studies . \n for our mechanism to work in field galaxies , one or more perturbers must be present . \n there is , indeed , growing evidence that the appearance of a warp in a galaxy is strongly correlated with the presence of nearby perturbers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . \n even galaxies that had been thought to be isolated might , in fact , not be so ( @xcite ) . \n of course , perturber companions have always been suspected , but their direct tidal effects on disks seem to be too small .    the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate , by numerical solutions of simplified galaxy - perturber systems , that , with reasonable parameter values , this mond effect produces galactic warps of the magnitude observed . \n we have not included effects due to variations in the external field ( due to the motion of the perturber , or to the motion of the galaxy in a parent cluster ) . from the symmetry of our model problem \n the warps we produce have a straight line of nodes . \n the method is described in section 2 ; the results are detailed in sections 3 and 4 ; conclusions are drawn in section 5 . \n we use the nonrelativistic , modified - gravity formulation of mond suggested by @xcite . the acceleration field @xmath0 produced by a mass distribution @xmath1 is derived from a potential @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath3= 4\\pi g\\rho\\ ] ] instead of the usual poisson equation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the acceleration constant of mond . the form \n @xmath10 has been used in all rotation curve analyses , and we also use it here . \n this nonlinear potential equation is solved numerically using multi - grid methods as detailed in @xcite , and adumbrated in @xcite . \n we consider two classes of models . to simulate a far away companion , or the effect of the mean field of a cluster on a member galaxy , we solve for the field of a rigid disk in the presence of a given external acceleration field @xmath11 . in this case \n the field equation is solved subject to the boundary condition at infinity @xmath12 . \n then @xmath11 is subtracted from @xmath13 to get the field relative to the galaxy . \n this latter determines the galaxy s internal dynamics , warps , etc . to simulate the effect of a nearby companion , exemplified here by the effect of the magellanic clouds ( mc ) on the milky - way ( mw ) \n , we solve fully for a disk - plus - perturber system ( in which case @xmath14 at infinity ) . \n then , the center - of - mass acceleration of the galaxy is computed using the surface - integral method given by eq.(14 ) of @xcite , and is subtracted from the acceleration field to get the internal dynamics .    in each case , after the acceleration field relative to the center of mass of the galaxy is found , we find closed , nearly circular , nearly planar , test - particle orbits . \n the orbits are integrated for many periods to insure that , within our accuracy and patience , they are closed . \n thus , inasmuch as adiabaticity is a good approximation , these are non - precessing orbits . \n they are also found to be stable under small changes in their initial conditions . \n these are taken to trace a warp , in the spirit of the tilted - ring model ( @xcite ) . \n we take the model galaxy to be an exponential disk smoothly truncated at a radius that we use as our unit length , @xmath15 , and with a scale length of @xmath16 in these units . \n the surface density is of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 . \n the disk lies in the @xmath19 plane . to optimize the warping effect we take the external field to lie @xmath20 from the @xmath21 axis in the third quadrant of the @xmath22 plane . \n its absolute value is taken as @xmath23 in units of @xmath9 . \n ( we work in units where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , so masses are given in units of @xmath26 . ) in a more extensive study we plan to calculate the effect as a function of the field direction ( relative to the disk axis ) and also to follow the test particle orbits as the external field changes with time to mimic the relative motion of the galaxy and perturber . \n for the present , pilot study we ran models with two values of the disk mass @xmath27 and @xmath28 . \n the ( mond ) accelerations of the isolated disk models at @xmath29 are @xmath30 ; i.e. respectively , ten and twenty times larger than the external field . \n both accelerations are small compared with 1 ( @xmath9 ) so we are rather deep in the mond regime in the warp region . in the deep - mond regime \n the theory has obvious scaling properties so the above parameters represent a family of models spanned e.g. by scaling by the same factor @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 fixed ) . \n the results are summarized in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . \n we first show for each model a plot of the absolute value of the torque @xmath36 in the @xmath22 plane containing the disk axis and the external field ( @xmath37 is the field in the center - of - mass frame ) . \n this is a quantity that brings out clearly the departure of the field from both axisymmetry and left - right symmetry . in the spherical case @xmath38 everywhere ; \n in the isolated - disk case the @xmath38 line is the @xmath21 axis ( and the @xmath39 axis ) . \n this torque plot is also useful for homing in on closed orbits of the potential whose center is near the galactic center , because these should cross the @xmath22 plane near the zero - torque line . \n the orbits are found by actual integration , starting from a set of initial conditions . \n the projections of some such orbits are then shown . \n we surmise that in the spirit of the tilted - ring model they delineate the shape of the warp . \n the disk of the milky way is known to be warped beyond the solar circle ( @xcite , and for a recent description and references @xcite ) . at galactic longitude @xmath40 the hi disk curls steadily away from the plane . at @xmath41 the disk curves southward before turning back towards the plane ( see @xcite for an analytic expression that approximates the warp shape beyond 11 kpc ) .    the line of nodes in the tilted - ring picture is straight within the uncertainties , and is nearly perpendicular to the plane spanned by the inner - disk axis and the radius vector to the magellanic clouds . \n this makes the cloud system a prime suspect in producing the warp . \n it was , however , appreciated long ago that the tidal field of the clouds , in their present position , is too small to distort the disk to the extent observed . \n for example , @xcite estimated that a cloud mass @xmath42 would generate a warp of amplitude @xmath43 70 pc at a radius of 16 kpc . \n it has , however , been suggested by @xcite that a `` live '' halo that actively responds to the perturbation of the clouds might augment the effect to produce a warp of the observed magnitude and geometry . \n mond , as we said , excludes a dynamically important halo , but might lead to a large enough warp due to the non - linear effect discussed above . \n we model the system as follows . \n the mw is taken as a pure disk in the @xmath19 plane , centered at the origin , with the cutoff , exponential surface - density law described in section 3 ( with @xmath16 ) ; its dimensionless mass is @xmath44 . \n the magellanic clouds are represented by one point mass @xmath45 at a position whose dimensionless coordinates are ( 2.52 , 0 , -1.63 ) . \n this is at @xmath46 from the center of the galaxy , and at the correct galactic latitude of the lmc . \n this ratio would correspond for example to @xmath47 kpc ( @xcite ) and an lmc distance of 45 mpc ( @xcite ) . \n the uncertainties in these parameters are still large . \n two mass ratios were considered : @xmath48 . \n ( the b luminosity ratio of the clouds to the mw is about 0.2 . \n since the baryonic @xmath49 values of the two might be different , reasonable values of the mass ratio lie between 0.1 and 0.4 . ) other nearby galaxies are expected to have a smaller effect than the lmc ; for example , m31 , despite its higher mass , causes a rather smaller acceleration near the mw .    in figure [ fig3 ] we show , for each mass ratio , two closed , quasi - circular , stable orbits beyond the cutoff radius of the disk  presumed to delineate our calculated warp  together with a representation of the observed warp ( as given by the formula in @xcite ) . \n we see that for a constant external field whose ratio to the field of the isolated disk at @xmath50 is only ( 5 - 10)@xmath51 , a noticeable warp beyond this radius is indicated by test - particle orbits . \n this acceleration ratio increases in proportion to the galactocentric radius , but , still , rotational velocities will be affected only little even up to @xmath52 . note that the warp is not symmetric but is less pronounced on the attracting side of the field . \n we used an external - field inclination that is favorable for an s - shape warp . \n when the field is in the disk plane , the axisymmetry is broken but the up - down one is not , so no warp will be induced . \n if the field is perpendicular to the disk , axisymmetry is preserved but not the up - down one ; this might induce bowl - shaped warps . \n ( in the limit of a highly dominant , perpendicular , external field , the analytic results in @xcite show that the geometry remains up - down symmetric , but for a weak perturbing field this is not so . )    regarding the results for the mw - mc system , we see that even for a mass ratio of 0.1 a satellite at the position of the mc produces enough field distortion to accommodate inclined , quasi - circular orbit that rise to @xmath53 at @xmath54 on one side , and to a height of @xmath55 at @xmath56 on the other . with a mass ratio of 0.2 the amplitude of the warp is close to that observed for the mw . \n . a larger volume of the parameter space has to be surveyed . \n this includes more values of the relative strength of the perturbation , different disk - perturber alignments ( leading perhaps to a wider varieties of warp shapes ) , more complex perturbations such as two or more satellites , which would bend the line of nodes at larger radii , where we can not approximate the combined effect by a constant field . \n we would also have to study other galaxy mass distributions . \n for example , we expect that if a considerable fraction of the galaxy mass is put in a round bulge , a warp will form more easily . for the same reason , if @xmath57 is smaller ( but the mc distance remains the same ) the warp will be stronger at the same position . \n . we must reckon with the fact that in many relevant cases the geometry of the perturbation changes considerably during the response time of the disk ( say the orbital period at the position of the warp ) . \n this is true of galaxies moving in or near the core of galaxy clusters ; it is also true for the mw - mc system . \n the warp geometry will thus not just follow the perturbation adiabatically but , at larger radii , the geometry may reflect the past history of the perturbation ( leading , among other things , to curvature of the line of nodes ) . according to proper - motion observations and models of the mc and the magellanic stream motion \n ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the mc binary is moving on a nearly polar orbit around the galaxy with a tangential velocity that is now comparable with the rotational velocity of the galaxy . \n this means that the radius vector to the mc changes its angle with the galaxy s axis by @xmath58 during the galaxy s orbital period at about 15 kpc . \n this means that the adiabaticity assumption we have made might be broken , and more and more so at larger radii . \n our subtraction of a constant center - of - mass acceleration is then also not valid . \n this could lead to a more complicated warp geometry than the integral - sign shape that we get with adiabaticity . because the mc orbit is nearly polar we expect the line of nodes to remain straight . \n we think self - gravity of the mass in the warped region is not so important . \n this is because the relative contribution of the warped mass to the acceleration field is small everywhere , even within the warp itself . \n ( the surface density in the warp is smaller than the integrated surface density there . ) \n this contribution can then be treated as a perturbation  linearizing in it the mond field equation  and in mond such density perturbations produce an even weaker effect than in newtonian dynamics ( hence the added stability in mond ) . \n so we can at least expect that the nonlinearity of mond will not beget some peculiar amplification of self gravity . \n but we do not really know what these effects might be  a point that has to be checked numerically . \n we plan to perform @xmath59-body simulations whereby the @xmath60-body warped disk and the point - mass perturber orbit each other . this will account for non - adiabaticity and for self gravity in the disk , and also partly for point 2 above .", "StartTimeOffset": 2476151923434, "RequestID": "cc4487021c1127ec5ff4aaec91d0ef5e27238e0e", "TotalTokens": 3485}
{"ContextTokens": 1714, "GeneratedTokens": 321, "SynthesizedBody": "the elodie library is based on spectra retrieved from the observatoire de haute - provence archive ( moultaka et al . 2004 ) . \n the spectra were obtained with the elodie spectrograph attached to the 1.93 m telescope , they have a spectral resolution of about r=42000 and consists of 67 echelle orders covering in total the wavelength range 389.2 to 680 nm without any gap . \n some of the spectra were acquired for the purpose of building a stellar library , and others were selected from the archive to complete the coverage in effective temperature ( t@xmath0 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and to achieve the flux calibration ( by providing enough external comparisons and repeated observations of the same stars ) .    an early library , not calibrated in flux , was published in soubiran et al . \n the first flux - calibrated release of the library was published by prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) , it contained 906 spectra . \n the last previous release , elodie.3 was announced in prugniel & soubiran ( 2004 ) and represented a major progress in the coverage of the space of atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] ) .    the present version , elodie.3.1 is based on the same collection of spectra than elodie.3 . fig . \n 1 , 2 and 3 show the distribution of the 1388 stars of the library in the hr diagram , t@xmath0 - [ fe / h ] and t@xmath0 - @xmath1 planes . \n the main interest of this new version is the extended wavelength coverage , now including the h & k lines , and limited by the blue limit of the spectrograph . \n some important improvements are also summarized in the next section . \n the library has been used for population synthesis using the pegase.hr program ( le borgne et al . \n 2004 ) , and these models were used to study the stellar populations of galaxies and star clusters . the advantage of these models is the high spectral resolution provided by the library which allows to constrain simultaneously the internal kinematics and the parameters of the stellar population ( for instance age and metallicity ) . thanks to this library , the analysis is not anymore limited to the low resolution of the spectrophotometric indices . \n specific methods for the simultaneous analysis of the kinematics and of the stellar population were developed in ocvirk et al . \n ( 2006 ) and chilingarian ( 2007 ) . \n it was found that these approaches of full spectrum fitting are increasing the precision on age and metallicity by a factor 3 ( a factor 10 on observing time to get the same precision ) ( koleva et al . \n 2006 ) . \n the comparison between models based on the current release of the library and other models are presented in koleva et al ( 2007a ) and validation using galactic clusters in koleva et al . \n ( 2007b ) . \n we are now preparing a further version , elodie.4 , which will contain about 5000 spectra . \n this will allow a better investigation of the effect of the @xmath3-element abundances in stellar populations , possibly by coupling the library with a basis of theoretical spectra as presented in prugniel et al . \n since the first version of the library , the reduction procedure described in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) has been improved in several aspects but the general philosophy remains the same . \n the first steps of the data processing up to the extraction of the orders are made with the standard elodie pipeline ( baranne et al . , 1996 ) . \n the reconnection of the orders , and the flux calibration are explained in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) . \n extension of the wavelength range . \n : :    in the previous releases the first 4 orders in the blue were not    processed because of the difficulty of their reconnection and    calibration due to the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . \n the    sensitivity of the detector is indeed dramatically dropping near the    blue limit . \n we improved our procedure and we could include the blue    region , extending to the h & k lines . \n subtraction of the diffuse light . : :    when working on the blue region of the spectra , we discovered that the    diffuse light on the standard pipeline was often under -

comparison in the library allow to detect    inconsistencies and to determine internal values : each wavelength    point of the spectra is modeled as polynomials in    t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] fitted to the    compiled parameters and the inversion of this function returns    internal determinations of the parameters ( see prugniel & soubiran    2001 , le borgne et al . \n 2004 ) . +    on one side we have updated the compiled input parameters , using    recent publications and fixing errors , and on the other side we    improved the polynomial functions used to model the spectra . \n the    present version is better , but , as seen in fig . \n 2 and 3 , some    artifacts persist in the temperature range 6500 - 7500k at low    metallicity ( some input metallicities are underestimated ) . \n +    by comparing the observed spectra with the polynomial model , we get an    idea of the quality of the model and of the consistency of the    atmospheric parameters . \n the rms residuals from the absolute model    ( ie . using the input atmospheric parameters ) is 2.0% . \n the rms    residuals from the internal model ( iterated using the atmospheric    parameters returned after an inversion with the absolute model ) is    1.4% . \n the decrease of the rms residuals after the iteration is due to    an improvement of the consistency of the atmospheric parameters . \n the    final residuals include the effect of the noise and of all the    neglected parameters , like rotation , detailed abundances ... the    internal determination of the atmospheric parameters may be biased    with respect to the input values : we checked these biases by averaging    them in some regions of the parameters space , and did not find    evidence for clear bias . \n tables 1 & 2 , and fig . \n 4 & 5 compare the lick indices measured on the elodie spectra with those of the lick ( worthey et al . \n 1994 ) and jones ( worthey & ottaviani , 1997 ) libraries . \n the comparison with the lick data shows an important spread due to the lower quality of the lick data , but the comparison with jones library reveals an excellent consistency . \n the zero -

the present paper simulates the cmb in a poincar dodecahedral space  @xcite and checks the quadrupole - octupole alignment . \n absolutely no correlation is found . \n we use the late jesper gundermann s simulation  @xcite of the cmb in the poincar dodecahedral space , with modes through @xmath4 . this simplified simulation , while neglecting the doppler contribution and the sound speed , nevertheless produces a low-@xmath3 power spectrum essentially identical to the spectra produced by more refined simulations . \n thus we may be quite confident that if the dodecahedral topology imposed a nontrivial quadrupole - octupole alignment , this simulation would capture it . as we will see in section  [ sectionmeasuring ] , however , absolutely no such correlation is found . \n even if one were to add a doppler term and sound speed to the simulation , the distribution in figure  [ figurequadocthistogram ] would change by at most a tiny amount , not nearly enough to introduce a nontrivial quadrupole - octupole correlation . \n for each simulated cmb sky , we use the polynomial method  @xcite to compute the two quadrupole vectors @xmath5 and the three octupole vectors @xmath6 . following  @xcite \n , we take the cross product @xmath7 , which we normalize to obtain a unit vector @xmath8 orthogonal to the plane of the quadrupole . \n similarly , we take the cross product of each of the three possible pairs of octupole vectors @xmath9 which we normalize to obtain unit vectors @xmath10 orthogonal to each of the three octupole planes . \n the three dot products @xmath11 then measure the extent to which the quadrupole plane does or does not align with each of the three octupole planes \n .    in a simply connected universe one expects no correlation between the quadrupole vector @xmath12 and each octupole vector @xmath13 . \n as @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( for some fixed @xmath14 ) wander randomly over the 2-sphere , their dot product follows a flat distribution on the interval @xmath15 $ ] ( this is a consequence of the wonderful fact that radial projection of a sphere onto a circumscribed cylinder via @xmath16 preserves area ) . \n hence each @xmath17 , being the absolute value of the dot product , follows a flat distribution on @xmath18 $ ] .    in the real universe \n the quadrupole aligns surprisingly well with the octupole , giving dot products @xmath19 for the dq - corrected tegmark ( dqt ) cleaning @xcite of the first - year wmap data or @xmath20 for the lagrange internal linear combination ( lilc ) cleaning @xcite of the same data . \n the question of whether a multiconnected spatial topology might explain the observed quadrupole - octupole alignment may be rephrased more precisely as : does a given topology predict a flat distribution for each @xmath21 or does it predict a distribution skewed towards the high end ? for the poincar dodecahedral space , our simulations ( recall section  [ sectionsimulating ] ) yield a flat distribution ( figure  [ figurequadocthistogram ] ) , implying that the dodecahedral topology does nothing to explain the quadrupole - octupole alignment .    to be fully rigorous \n we should point out that even though the individual dot products @xmath21 follow the same flat distribution in the dodecahedral topology that they do in the simply connected model , it s nevertheless conceivable that their sum @xmath22 might follow a slightly different distribution in the two cases , depending on the internal correlations among the three @xmath21 in the dodecahedral case . in practice , however , our simulations find the observed sum to be unusual at roughly the @xmath2 level regardless of whether we compare to the dodecahedral topology or a simply connected space . \n the poincar dodecahedral space topology , while explaining the weakness of the low-@xmath3 modes , completely fails to explain the quadrupole - octupole alignment . \n while this negative result leaves one feeling less optimistic , good scientific practice demands that one analyze a few other plausible topologies before reaching any firm conclusion about whether topology might play a role . \n one must also keep an open mind about what observations may or may not be due to random chance alone . \n the quadrupole - octupole alignment might be due to chance , while the weakness of the low-@xmath3 modes has a physical explanation . or perhaps exactly the reverse is true . at this point \n the mystery remains open . \n i dedicate this article to my friend and collaborator jesper gundermann , whose untimely death on 10 june 2006 saddened all who knew him . \n his energetic enthusiasm and deep love of science brought joy to those of us lucky enough to work with him . \n copi , d. huterer and g.d . \n starkman , `` multipole vectors  a new representation of the cmb sky and evidence for statistical anisotropy or non - gaussianity at @xmath25 '' , _ phys . rev . _ \n * d70 * ( 2003 ) 043515 , astro - ph/0310511 . \n p. bielewicz , h.k . \n eriksen , a.j . \n banday , k.m . \n grski and p.b . \n lilje , `` multipole vector anomalies in the first - year wmap data : a cut - sky analysis '' , _ astrophys . \n j. _ * 635 * ( 2005 ) 750760 , astro - ph/0507186 . \n luminet , j. weeks , a. riazuelo , r. lehoucq and j .- p . \n uzan , `` dodecahedral space topology as an explanation for weak wide - angle temperature correlations in the cosmic microwave background '' , _ nature _ * 425 * ( 2003 ) , 593595 . \n eriksen , a.j . \n banday , k.m . \n grski and p.b . \n lilje , `` on foreground removal from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by an internal linear combination method : limitations and implications '' , _ astrophys . \n j. _ * 612 * ( 2004 ) 633646 , astro - ph/0403098 .", "StartTimeOffset": 2490920093802, "RequestID": "d9e53dccf551681d7e3c5b89dac93ba01897274a", "TotalTokens": 1680}

it is actually a 2-d application of dodecahedron cells method . \n different cells have been applied to analyze the topology of galaxy distribution , such as truncated octahedrons ( coxeter 1937 ; gott 1967 ; gott 1986 ) , voronoi foams ( icke and weygaert 1987 ) , dodecahedron cells ( kiang 2004 ) ; 2d topological structure of the observed universe has been investigated by variety of methods , such as genus method ( davies & coles 1993 , colley 1997 , hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) , percolation and ? \n lamentarity ( pandey & bharadwaj 2008 ) . \n colley ( 1997 ) found that the 2d genus of the las campanas redshift survey is very close to a gaussian random field , hoyle claimed the genus of 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey team ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) reveals a smaller number of isolated voids than clusters ( hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) .    the motivation of this paper is to investigate the topological relation between low density regions ( such as voids ) and high density regions ( such as clusters ) to get more understanding of the early universe . \n our article is organized as follows . in section 2 \n we present the hexagon cells method . in section 3 \n we study the data from the 2mass . \n we summarize the results in section 4 and have conclusions in section 5 . \n if we partition the 2-d space into cells with the shape of hexagon , we can get hexagonal lattice . \n hexagonal lattice is one of the five 2d lattice types and is the only lattice which can fill the 2d space inseparably with more edges than square . in the natural world \n , honeycomb is an interesting example of hexagonal lattice . for bees , hexagon is the most efficient shape for the bees living and storing of food . in the reality , \n the hexagon structure provides the maximum strength and that it is used in designing airplane wings and satellites walls . \n the reason of using hexagon cells in this paper is that we want to have the direction detection as many as possible for our unit cells . \n hexagon cells could detect the neighbors in six directions and provide us the rich topology information , and at the same time fill in the space without overlap or missing region . \n for an application of hexagon method on galaxy distribution , similar with the definition of rhombic cell in kiang ( 2003 ) , if a hexagon cell contains no galaxies , then we call it an empty cell ; otherwise , it is a filled cell . automatically empty cells represent the low density region and filled cells represent the high density region . by this definition \n , we could discover if the filled and empty regions have the same morphology and give us a quantitative description of the topology . \n we know the hexagons have 6 neighbors and 6 edges shared with neighbors . \n if two neighbor cells are both filled or both empty , then we define their common edges as inner edge ; otherwise we call it as outer edge . \n we use n to define the number of inner edges . \n the physical meaning of n is to find the same kind of neighbors for each hexagon and investigate the aggregation pattern for filled and empty cells . in this way \n n is the approximation of the two point correlation function in a specific small scale . \n if filled cells are not distributed in space randomly , we can expect the distribution of n will be depart from the well - known binomial form , same thing for empty cells . \n this in turn will tell us the morphology similarity and difference of high density and low density regions . \n based on the definition of @xmath0 , we could divide the six edges into inner edges and outer edges two groups and consider the connectedness of inner edges or outer edges . \n we use @xmath2 to represent the number of connected inner edges group and use @xmath3 to represent the number of connected outer edges group , that is @xmath1 ( see fig . \n 1 ) . so @xmath4 means a single cell surrounded by 6 unlike neighbors ( same with @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 means a single cell surrounded by 6 like neighbors ( same with @xmath7 ) . \n @xmath8 means likely that the cell is on the boundary of the clusters or voids , so its two kind of neighbors are connected separately . \n @xmath9 represents a string - like structure and the string penetrates the cell and results in two groups for each of kind neighbors . \n @xmath10 is complicated and its special shape possibly implies a mesh structure . \n to better understand the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distribution difference between observed and random sample , similar with the method mentioned by kiang ( 2003 ) , we define statistic @xmath12 as a measure of the degree to which the observed frequency of cells exceeds its random expectation for each different structure defined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n @xmath13 is for observed sample , @xmath14 is for random sample .      to investigate the uncertainties of the results , we use same method which kiang ( 2004 ) used in rhombic cell analysis . \n obviously the present application of hexagon cell analysis revealed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 results are highly sensitive to the exact placing of the grid of hexagon cells . because when the galaxies are fixed , if the cells are moved it will get same galaxies to lie in different cells , we call it as the zero offset . \n we start our calculations by placing the centre of our zeroth cell ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) at galactic coordinates ( 0,0,0 ) . \n what we found was that if we displace our entire grid of cells by an amount up to and including one unit of a0 , in any combination of the three directions , then the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath15 will generally be different , but slightly . \n if we define the length of cell is 1 , we simply consider 4 shifts which are ( 0 , 0.5 ) , ( -0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0.5 ) . \n the four shifts will be combined with the origin gridding to get average @xmath0 and @xmath15 value with stand deviation . \n generally the shift will result in the unequal number of filled and empty cells , but it is very tiny ( around 1/1,000 ) , moreover , it makes more sense for us to keep the length of the cell rather than adjusting it to get equal number of filled and empty cells , so we fix the length of cells when we shift . \n the 2mass ( xsc , jarrett et al . 2000 ) data we use is provided by cao et al ( 2006 ) , detailed information can be found in their paper . simply speaking , they select galaxies inside an elliptical isophote with surface brightness of 20 mag @xmath16 in ks band . to have 2-d plane data , they subject the 2mass data to an equal - area projection by the lambert azimuthal algorithm :    @xmath17    where @xmath14 is a relative scale factor , @xmath18 is the galactic latitude and @xmath19 is the galactic longitude . \n this hemisphere scheme projects the whole sky into two circular planes , a northern and southern sky . \n we select a square with @xmath20 in the central part of each circular plane . \n we have two fields of @xmath20 in the northern and southern skies . \n the northern square has 323,000 galaxies and the southern includes 342,000 galaxies . \n before we analyze the data , we could get the binomial distribution for reference . \n the binomial distribution gives the discrete probability distribution @xmath21 of obtaining exactly @xmath22 successes out of @xmath23 bernoulli trials ( where the result of each bernoulli trial is true with probability @xmath24 and false with probability @xmath25 , as given by eq.4 below : ) . \n @xmath26    since for any neighbors of a cell , the probability of a filled or empty cell is the same ( we have the same number of filled and empty cells ) , so @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for an @xmath0 distribution , @xmath29 ( 6 walls for hexagon ) , and n=(0,1,2,4,5,6 ) . from eq . ( 4 ) the probability function of a binomial distribution is ( 1/64 , 6/64 , 15/64 , 20/64 , 15/64 , 6/64 , 1/64 ) for n= ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . for @xmath1 , since this is related to specific arrangements , it is better to list all combinations and calculate the probability than using eq.(4 ) . \n since there are 6 walls , each wall could be inner wall or outer wall , so the total combinations give @xmath30 arrangements . \n if we use `` 1 '' for inner wall , and `` 0 '' for outer wall , we could write number 0  63 with 6-digits binary format , such as 000000 , 000001 .... then the 64 binaries are exactly all possible arrangements of @xmath1 . \n we list the results in table 1 :    . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath31 from @xmath0=6 ( or @xmath6 ) filled cells have a much stronger ( 21@xmath32 for northern sky and 15@xmath32 for southern sky ) aggregation property than empty cells . \n this is consistent with hoyle ( 2002 ) who found that the number of isolated voids is smaller than the number of clusters in the 2df survey . \n @xmath31 the most general case is @xmath33 ( 20/64 probability for standard distribution ) ; however , we can see the @xmath0 value at @xmath33 is smaller than standard distribution . \n this can be explained as that aggregation makes filled and empty cells have more probability on @xmath34 than standard distribution , hence reduce the probability at @xmath33 . \n @xmath31 for @xmath0=1 , filled cells are closer ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 6@xmath32 for southern sky ) to standard distribution than empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less or longer fiber structure than filled cells as the end of fiber always has @xmath0=1 . \n @xmath0=1 must result in a @xmath8 structure , we do not see much difference between filled and empty cells for @xmath8 in table 1 . \n this suggests @xmath0=1 structure is the minority in most @xmath8 structures , in other words , @xmath8 includes much more cells on the boundary of filled and empty cells than of the end . \n @xmath31 @xmath9 has also significant difference ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 8@xmath32 for southern sky ) between filled and empty cells . \n empty cells have much more frequently penetrated by filled cells than filled cells penetrated by empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less fiber structure than filled cells and is consistent with @xmath0=1 results . \n with a direct measurement by the hexagon cell method , we found there are significant differences in topology between high density regions and low density regions in 2mass data . \n the accuracy is assured by the zeroshift technique . \n we found low density regions have less fiber structure and are less clustered than high density regions to high accuracy . \n the difference could be caused by the evolution , which suggests that evolution might include more things other than gravitational instability ( bond @xmath35 szalay 1983 ) ; or caused by the original asymmetry of quantum fluctuation in the early universe ( turner 1998 ) . overall speaking , \n low density regions have slightly closer topology to random distribution than high density regions . \n we also found the topology of 2mass southern sky map is slightly closer to random distribution tan northern sky . \n our work provides a supplement for genus analysis , which shows that high density and low density regions have almost identical properties ( park et al , 2001 ; gott 1986 ) or are slightly different ( hoyle et al 2002 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2501567405202, "RequestID": "b43d7b1a46646bacf8185909d448369a8d4c217d", "TotalTokens": 3291}
{"ContextTokens": 3359, "GeneratedTokens": 393, "SynthesizedBody": "optical tweezers have seen deployment in a wide range of applications in biology , soft materials , microassembly , and other fields . as well as being used for the trapping and manipulation of a wide range of natural and artificial objects , \n optically trapped probes are used to measure forces on the order of piconewtons . \n compared with this diverse range of experimental applications , theory and accurate computational modelling of optical tweezers has received much less attention and has remained relatively undeveloped , especially for non - spherical particles and non - gaussian beams . \n this is unfortunate , especially when we consider the growing fields of controlled rotation of complex microparticles  prototype optically - driven micromachines  and fully three - dimensional manipulation using complex optical fields , where the application of theory and modelling provide insight into the physics , and allow engineering and optimisation . \n since optical forces and torques result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle via scattering , the theory and computational modelling of optical tweezers is , in essence , the theory and computational modelling of the scattering of light or electromagnetic radiation . since typical particles that are optically trapped or manipulated \n are on the order of the wavelength in size , approximate methods such as geometric optics or rayleigh scattering are inapplicable , and solution or either the maxwell equations or the vector helmholtz equation must be resorted to . as scattering by particles in this size range \n is of interest in many fields , a wide variety of analytical and computational methods have been developed . \n thus , there is a solid foundation on which to develop computational modelling of optical micromanipulation . \n there are , however , complications that prevent simple direct application of typical light - scattering codes . the first , but not necessarily the most important , \n is that optical tweezers makes use of a highly focussed laser beam , while most existing scattering codes assume plane wave illumination . \n perhaps more fundamental is the need for a large number of repeated calculations to characterise an optical trap  even for an axisymmetric ( but nonspherical ) particle trapped in a circularly polarised gaussian beam , we already have four degrees of freedom . \n clearly , this places strong demands on computational efficiency .    due to this requirement for repeated calculation of scattering by the same particle \n , we employ the _ t_-matrix method  @xcite . \n below , we outline the employment of the _ t_-matrix method for the calculation of optical forces and torques . \n while most implementations of the _ t_-matrix method are restricted to simple geometries , this is not a limitation inherent in the method ; fundamentally , the _ \n t_-matrix method is a _ description _ of the scattering properties of a particle , not a method of calculating the scattering properties . \n therefore , in principle , any method of calculating scattering can be used to obtain the _ \n t_-matrix for a scatterer . \n we discuss such `` hybrid '' methods , where a computational method not usually associated with the _ t_-matrix method is used to calculate the _ \n t_-matrix of a scatterer , and hence the optical force and torque . \n a further important consideration is that optical micromachines , while complex , are likely to possess a high degree of symmetry ; this can be exploited to reduce computation times by orders of magnitude . \n we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by modelling the optical trapping and rotation of a cube . \n the two principal symmetries of such shapes  mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about the normal to the mirror symmetry plane  are exactly the symmetries that typify the ideal optically - driven rotor . \n the _ t_-matrix method in wave scattering involves writing the relationship between the wave incident upon a scatterer , expanded in terms of a sufficiently complete basis set of functions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a mode index labelling the functions , each of which is a solution of the helmholtz equation , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the expansion coefficients for the incident wave , and the scattered wave , also expanded in terms of a basis set @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the expansion coefficients for the scattered wave , is written as a simple matrix equation @xmath7 or , in more concise notation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the elements of the _ t_-matrix . \n t_-matrix formalism is a hilbert basis description of scattering . \n the _ t_-matrix depends only on the properties of the particle  its composition , size , shape , and orientation  and the wavelength , and is otherwise independent of the incident field . \n this means that for any particular particle , the _ \n t_-matrix only needs to be calculated once , and can then be used for repeated calculations . \n this is the key point that makes this an attractive method for modelling optical tweezers , providing a significant advantage over many other methods of calculating scattering where the entire calculation needs to be repeated .    the natural choice of basis functions when describing scattering by a compact particle is to use vector spherical wavefunctions ( vswfs )  @xcite . \n the optical force and torque are given by sums of products of the modal amplitudes  @xcite . \n notably , neither how the vswf expansion of the incident field nor how the _ t_-matrix can be calculated has entered the above description of scattering . \n a variety of methods exist for the former  @xcite , and the latter task is generally the more challenging computationally . \n most implementations of the _ t_-matrix method use the extended boundary condition method ( ebcm ) , also called the null field method , to calculate the _ t_-matrix . \n this is so widespread that the _ t_-matrix method and the ebcm are sometimes considered to be inseparable , and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably . \n however , from the description above , it is clear that the _ t_-matrix formalism is independent of the actual method used to calculate the _ \n t_-matrix  @xcite . \n a number of alternative methods have been used for the calculation of _ t_-matrices . \n notably , such `` hybrid '' methods , for example the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) method used by mackowski  @xcite can be used for the calculation of _ \n t_-matrices for particles of arbitrary shape , internal structure , and electromagnetic properties . \n complex internal structure will generally require a discretisation of the internal volume of the particle , rather than a method based on surface discretisation . \n we are working on both finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) and dda based hybrid _ t_-matrix solvers . \n the _ t_-matrix elements are strongly dependent on the symmetry of the scatterer  @xcite . \n we can deduce the principal features from floquet s theorem , relating solutions to differential equations to the periodicity of their boundary conditions . \n if we have a scatterer with @xmath1th - order rotational symmetry about the @xmath10-axis , an incident mode of azimuthal index @xmath11 couples to scattered modes with azimuthal indices @xmath12 and so on . for scatterers that are mirror - symmetric , upward and downward coupling must be equal , in the sense that , for example , a mirror - symmetric scatterer of 2nd order rotational symmetry ( such as a long rod ) , t - matrix elements coupling from @xmath13 modes to @xmath14 modes will have the same magnitudes as the elements coupling from @xmath14 to @xmath13 modes . for chiral scatterers , these _ \n t_-matrix elements will , in general , be different . \n this directly affects the optical torque ; the vector spherical wavefunctions are eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 . \n essentially , the radial mode index @xmath1 gives the magnitude of the angular momentum flux , while the azimuthal mode index @xmath11 gives the @xmath10-component of the angular momentum flux . \n therefore , the coupling between orders of different @xmath11 describes the generation of optical torques about the beam axis .    for the case of a rotationally symmetric scatterer , this means that there is no coupling between modes with differing angular momenta about the @xmath10-axis@xcite . \n therefore , it is not possible to exert optical torque on such scatterers except by absorption ( or gain)since the incoming and outgoing angular momenta per photon are the same , the only optical torque can result from a change in the number of photons . \n in general , the use of absorption for the transfer of optical torque is impractical , due to excessive heating . \n therefore , a departure from rotational symmetry is required . \n this can be either at the macroscopic ( the shape of the particle ) or microscopic ( optical properties of the particle ) level . \n birefringent and elongated or flattened particles are simple examples of introducing such asymmetry ; notably , such particles were the first to be controllably optically rotated through means other than absorption , for example by beth in the first measurements of optical torque  @xcite . \n particles with these properties have also been rotated in optical traps  . as such particles can still be axisymmetric about one axis , rapid calculation of optical forces and torques is still possible  @xcite    more complex particles have also been fabricated and rotated  @xcite , but in these cases , there are few results from computational modelling  @xcite . \n as such structures typically possess discrete rotational symmetry , the restrictions on coupling between azimuthal orders can be used to reduce the number of _ \n t_-matrix elements that need to be calculated . \n this can greatly reduce the time required . \n this is also the case for the hybrid methods described above . for a scatterer with @xmath17th - order discrete rotational symmetry , \n it is only necessary to perform calculations for a @xmath18 portion of the entire structure . \n if , in addition , there is mirror symmetry about the @xmath19 plane , the parity of the vswfs will be preserved . \n therefore , an odd-@xmath1 te mode will only couple to odd-@xmath1 te modes and even-@xmath1 tm modes . \n this halves number of non - zero _ t_-matrix elements , and halves the portion of the structure that needs to be modelled . \n a simple example illustrating both the relationship between optical torque and symmetry , and the exploitation of particle symmetry for more efficient calculation of optical forces and torques , is the optical trapping of a cube . \n the cube embodies both of the symmetries  mirror symmetry and discrete rotational symmetry about the normal to the mirror symmetry plane  that typify the ideal optically - driven rotor . \n as the cube has 4th - order rotational symmetry , and mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath20 plane , each incident modes only couples to approximately @xmath21 the number of significant scattered modes . \n although the column - by - column calculation of the _ t_-matrix still requires the same number of least - squared solutions , each of this is of a smaller system of equations , and much faster . \n for example , the two wavelengths wide cube used in our example below required 30 minutes for the calculation of the _ t_-matrix on a 32 bit single - processor 3ghz microcomputer , as compared with 30 hours for an object of the same size lacking the cube s symmetries . \n only one octant of the cube was explicitly included in the calculation . \n if figure 1 , we show the optical force and torque exerted on a cube with relative refractive index of @xmath22 , and faces @xmath23 across , where @xmath24 is the wavelength in the surrounding medium . once the _ t_-matrix is calculated , to calculate the optical force and torque at a particular position requires less than 1 second ( unless the point is far from the beam focus , in which case , up to 10 seconds or so can be needed ) . \n \\(a ) ( b ) +    ) , while in ( c ) and ( d ) , the beams are lg@xmath25 and lg@xmath26 respectively . \n the solid lines are for plane polarised beams , while dotted and dashed lines are for circularly polarised beams with spin parallel to and antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) , while in ( c ) and ( d ) , the beams are lg@xmath25 and lg@xmath26 respectively . \n the solid lines are for plane polarised beams , while dotted and dashed lines are for circularly polarised beams with spin parallel to and antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum.,title=\"fig : \" ]     + ( c ) ( d ) +    ) , while in ( c ) and ( d ) , the beams are lg@xmath25 and lg@xmath26 respectively . \n the solid lines are for plane polarised beams , while dotted and dashed lines are for circularly polarised beams with spin parallel to and antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) , while in ( c ) and ( d ) , the beams are lg@xmath25 and lg@xmath26 respectively . \n the solid lines are for plane polarised beams , while dotted and dashed lines are for circularly polarised beams with spin parallel to and antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure 1(a ) , we see that cubic shapes can be stably trapped axially , while 1(b)(d ) show that optical torque can be generated by such structures . \n the increased efficiency resulting from the use of orbital angular momentum  @xcite is clear . \n the symmetry properties of a scatterer can be used to dramatically speed the calculation of the scattering properties of a particle . if these are expressed in the form of the _ \n t_-matrix , this enables rapid and efficient calculation of optical forces and torques . \n since typical optically - driven microrotors possess discrete rotational symmetry , they are ideal candidates for this method . in addition \n , mirror symmetry about a plane can also be used to further reduce the computational burden . finally , `` hybrid '' _ t_-matrix methods can be used for particles with geometries or internal structure making them unsuitable for traditional methods of calculating _ t_-matrices . \n m.  i. mishchenko , g.  videen , v.  a. babenko , n.  g. khlebtsov , and t.  wriedt , `` _ t_-matrix theory of electromagnetic scattering by particles and its applications : a comprehensive reference database , '' _ j. quant . \n 88 , 357406 , 2004 . \n j.  h. crichton and p.  l. marston , `` the measurable distinction between the spin and orbital angular momenta of electromagnetic radiation , '' _ elec . \n j. differential equations _ , vol . \n conf .  04 , 3750 , 2000 . \n t.  a. nieminen , h.  rubinsztein -

{"ContextTokens": 1750, "GeneratedTokens": 165, "SynthesizedBody": "radio galaxies display a wide range of structures in radio images . \n the most common large - scale structures are called lobes : these are double , often fairly symmetrical , roughly ellipsoidal structures placed on either side of the active nucleus . a significant minority of low - luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated . \n some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes . \n hence , the radio galaxies morphologically are divided into fri and frii types . \n the fri objects ( ` edge - darkened doubles ' ) generally contain prominent , often two - sided jets , with the lobe emission trailing off into intergalactic space . whereas , the frii objects ( ` edge - brightened doubles ' , ` classical doubles ' ) contain hot spots in one or both lobes . \n it seems that frii radio galaxies ( see fig .  [ fig:3c98 ] ) are usually isolated field sources and form a remarkably homogeneous set . on the other hand , the fri radio galaxies are much more varied . \n they are not only found as isolated field sources , they are also often found in clusters @xcite . \n for example , head - tail galaxies , which are fri objects , are almost always associated with clusters of galaxies and are characterized by a highly elongated radio structure with the associated optical galaxy at one end . a classical example ( see fig . \n [ fig:3c129 ] ) is 3c129 ( a narrow - angle - tail ) which , along with its companion 3c129.1 ( a wide - angle - tail ) , is a member of an x - ray cluster . in the canonical picture , \n the characteristic shape is explained by the kinematics of the source , which is governed by the dominant gravitational force in the cluster and the properties of the beams and jets @xcite . \n similarly , wide - angle - tail galaxies are intermediate between standard fri and frii objects , with collimated jets and sometimes hotspots , but with plumes rather than lobes , found at or near the centres of clusters . here again , the characteristic shape is mainly due to the dominant gravitational force in the cluster . \n therefore , the general morphology of radio sources lends encouragement to ideas of confinement , or at least radio morphology partly governed by an external gas ( @xcite , and see hardcastle in this proceeding ) , but some objects persist in complicating the simple picture . \n for example , b1059@xmath0169 ( fig . \n [ fig : b1059 ] ) which shows x - shaped structure . \n such sources are characterized by two axes , the ` wing ' axis oriented at an angle to the ` active ' axis , giving the total source an ` x ' shape . \n these two sets of lobes usually pass symmetrically through the centre of the associated host galaxy , and the majority of these sources are frii and the rest are either fri or mixed . \n these have been modelled via backflow from the lobes along with buoyancy - driven outflow . \n precession of the radio axis also comes to mind . \n they have also been put forth as derivatives of central engines that have been reoriented , perhaps due to a minor merger . \n alternatively , they may also result from two pairs of jets that are associated with a pair of unresolved agns ( see  @xcite for a detailed summary ) . \n the key point is that interpretation of radio source morphology , in general , is not necessarily simple . \n * spectral ageing * under the standard model of a frii source evolution , the source grows longer as the jet pushes back the external medium . \n if there s no significant re - acceleration within the lobes and no significant transport of particles since the last acceleration , then the central regions are ` older ' than the outer regions , in the sense that particles located in the central regions were processed through the hot spot shock at a time before those currently radiating at the ends of the radio source . \n hence , the spectral index of the radiation from the central regions should have a steeper spectral index than that at the ends . \n whereas , in the case of fri sources , e.g. , in almost all head - tail and wide - angle - tail galaxies , the radio spectrum has been found to steepen with distance along the tail and has been interpreted in terms of ageing of electron population . \n finally , in several of the formation scenarios mentioned above for x - shaped sources , the wings are interpreted as relics of past radio jets and the active lobes as the newer ones . \n hence , the wings are expected to show steeper spectra than the active lobes in standard models for electron energy evolution . \n in recent years we have used the gmrt ( @xcite ) to study morphology of several radio galaxies at 240  mhz and 610  mhz , with a resolution of about 10  arcsec  and  5  arcsec , respectively . \n the gmrt visibility data were analyzed using aips in the standard manner . \n all details of the analysis procedures used are given in @xcite . \n the gmrt has a hybrid configuration with 14 of its 30 antennae located in a central compact array with a size 1.1 km ( comparable to the vla d configuration ) and the remaining antennae distributed in a roughly ` y'-shaped configuration , giving a maximum baseline length of 25 km ( comparable to the vla b configuration ) . \n hence , a single observation with the gmrt samples the ( @xmath1 ) plane on both short and long baselines , and can map detailed source structure with a reasonably good sensitivity . \n i bring together two remarkable results obtained using gmrt .    * similar / dis - similar radio morphologies * it is remarkably unusual that any frii source has a morphology at low radio frequency ( less than a few hundred mhz ) that is different from its high radio frequency ( ghz ) morphology . \n [ fig:3c98 ] shows 3c98 as an example showing similar radio morphologies at 240 mhz and 1.5  ghz . \n in addition the 74  mhz and the 4.9  ghz radio morphologies are also identical . \n the observations of some 3c radio galaxies at 151mhz and 1.4ghz @xcite show that the lobe lengths at these different frequencies are the same and they also suggest that the particles responsible for the low - frequency emission are entirely co - spatial with those responsible for the high - frequency emission . \n this suggests that synchrotron - emitting particles of all energies permeate the lobe magnetic field in the same way , despite the fact that the higher energy particles have shorter radiative lifetimes than the lower energy ones . \n this hints that low - frequency synchrotron emission fades ( nearly ) as rapidly as high - frequency synchrotron emission @xcite ; and so , are the observations really inconsistent with the idea that synchrotron cooling is not the dominant energy - loss mechanism for the synchrotron plasma ? @xcite note that by the time we get to 100 ghz there really are fairly obvious morphological differences in lobes , although the sensitivity of those observations is not great . whereas , the fri sources , in particular the head - tail galaxies and wide - angle - tail galaxies show signs of synchrotron cooling in spectral index images @xcite made using narrow frequency spacing ( 240 mhz and 1.4 ghz ) and often show the presence of steep spectrum diffuse emission at low radio frequencies , which is not seen at high radio frequencies ( fig . \n [ fig:3c129 ] ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ] \n presently the gmrt observations have provided several high resolution , high sensitivity images , and it is now possible to probe , statistically , the morphological properties of radio sources . \n i have presented above two unusual results , but it will still be important to obtain observations using gmrt of complete , unbiased samples of radio galaxies to draw general conclusions about the population of radio galaxies as a whole . \n we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible . \n gmrt is run by the ncra of the tifr . \n i warmly thank my collaborators m.j . \n hardcastle , r.p . \n kraft and a.p . rao and especially a.l . \n roy for a careful reading of this manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 2526457961580, "RequestID": "0bf60d1e252dd184f4eddad3bcc2eceabcd613e5", "TotalTokens": 1915}

einstein condensate vortices@xcite , phase - contrast microscopy@xcite , image filtering for extra - solar planet detection@xcite , stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) microscopy@xcite and the encoding of optical quantum information@xcite . \n the considerable utility of optical vortices has driven the development of several methods for their production . \n most commonly , a phase shift of the form @xmath0 is applied to an incident laser beam where @xmath1 is the topological charge and @xmath2 is the azimuthal coordinate about the beam centre in the transverse plane . \n one method to apply the required phase shift is to use a computer - controlled spatial - light modulator ( slm)@xcite . \n this approach has the considerable advantages of being flexible and allowing the phase profile to be dynamically varied on 10 ms timescales . \n slm s , however , suffer from high cost and limited spatial and phase resolution . \n conversion efficiencies can be quite high for low - order optical vortices but begin to suffer from resolution limits as the order is increased . \n another approach is to use lithographic processes to construct a phase mask@xcite . \n these phase masks have restrictions in terms of phase resolution , spatial resolution , maximum phase shift and useable area , although advanced lithographic techniques can relax many of these restrictions .    here \n , we report on the production by direct machining of spiral phase mirrors ( spms ) that are suitable for generating optical vortices . \n we demonstrate that the resultant phase mirrors can deterministically produce high - quality optical vortices over a large range of topological charges from 1 to 1000 . \n these mirrors can be produced economically and the size of the optics is restricted only by the geometry of the machining enclosure . \n the spms are machined from aluminium using a single - crystal diamond tool . \n the machining is performed by an ultra - precision lathe , produced by moore nanotechnology . the tool position relative to the part surface \n is adjusted while the part is rotated at a constant rate on the spindle . \n high - resolution position encoders ensure that the tool is positioned with nanometric precision for each point on the part surface . \n the cutting speed is limited by the acceleration of the lathe s linear axes , although we can relax this restriction by breaking the spm into segments . \n each segment is a linear ramp with a total height corresponding to a @xmath3 phase shift . \n figure [ sem ] shows an sem image of a charge 100 spm composed of 25 segments , each of which imparts an @xmath4 phase ramp . for the charge 100 spm , we estimate that the central defect accounts for 0.006% of the total mirror surface , while the sharp jumps between segments collectively account for approximately 3% of the total area .    for our analysis , we produced 25 mm diameter optics , which required cutting times ranging from 30 minutes to two hours for charges of 1 to 100 , respectively . \n the size of the optic can be scaled without losing quality or increasing cutting time simply by selecting a diamond tool of an appropriate radius . \n to verify the performance of our phase plate , we made transverse beam profile measurements that can be compared to theoretical models . \n the illumination of an spm with a tem@xmath5 mode results in a beam profile that can be expressed as a hypergeometric gaussian mode ( hygg)@xcite . these modes have a cylindrically symmetric amplitude and propagate from a gaussian profile at the spm into a ring - shaped profile in the far - field . \n figure [ propagation ] a ) shows the calculated radial amplitude of a propagating charge 15 hygg mode immediately after it is created . \n experimental intensity profiles are obtained by illuminating machined spms with a 532 nm laser beam that has been transmitted through a mode -

field . \n the phase of the vortex in the near - field , figure [ propagation ] e ) , has been obtained by interfering the vortex with a collimated gaussian beam and scanning the relative phase of the two beams . \n ccd images of the interference patterns are captured and the phase profile is obtained by fitting a sine function to the intensity recorded at each pixel . \n we verify that the machined spms produce high - quality vortices over a range of topological charges by examining the intensity and phase profiles of charge 1 and charge 100 vortices . \n figure [ charge1and100 ] ( a - c ) shows the results for the charge 1 vortex . due to the slow evolution of the charge 1 vortex , imaging optics were used to record the intensity pattern and the propagation distance which was used for the calculated intensity was selected to fit the measured profile . \n figure [ charge1and100 ] ( d - f ) shows the results for a charge 100 vortex . there is some deviation from the calculated intensity in the peripheral fringes ; however , the primary feature is in good agreement with the calculated intensity distribution . as with the charge 15 analysis \n , the propagation distance was corrected to account for the spm not being located at the beam waist . \n the phase profile shows three distinct regions . \n the central region has zero charge and originates from the undiffracted portion of the beam . \n an intermediate region shows a charge of 25 , which we believe is an artefact of the 25 step design used to create the spm . \n the inner region is , however , of little consequence because the outer region , beyond a radius of 0.25 @xmath7 , contains 98% of the optical power and shows the intended charge 100 optical vortex .    the intensity distribution of the same charge 100 vortex , imaged in a plane that features the smallest observed ring thickness , is shown in figures [ highcharge ] a ) and b ) . \n the minimal undiffracted order , even at high charges , is notable when compared to slm - produced vortices@xcite .    in an attempt to find the limits of the direct machining process , we manufactured a charge 1000 spm ; however , our ability to properly characterise the vortices degraded after a charge of roughly 100 due to limited ccd resolution . \n figure [ highcharge ] c ) shows the measured intensity profile of the charge 1000 optical vortex .     scale . \n c ) intensity profile of a charge 1000 optical vortex . \n d ) the vortex produced by a charge 15 spm with a @xmath8 period modulation of the phase ramp . ] \n spiral phase mirrors that can be manufactured by this technique are not limited to linear azimuthal phase ramps . \n modulated phase profiles@xcite can be produced provided that the modulation is slow compared to the loop bandwidth of the positional feedback on the lathe . to demonstrate this flexibility , we cut a charge 15 optical vortex with a sinusoindally modulated phase ramp , shown in figure [ highcharge ] d ) . \n the modulation has a period of @xmath9 and a depth of 0.1 . \n it is also possible to cut the spms on a curved surface . in this way \n , spms could be created on spherical or even aspherical mirrors to provide integrated focusing optics . \n we have demonstrated that the direct machining of spiral phase mirrors using a diamond tool can produce high - quality , high - charge optical vortices . \n in addition to low cost , technical simplicity and flexibility , this fabrication method has the advantage of being applicable to a variety of metallic and soft crystalline optical materials , which may allow the production of transmissive as well as reflective vortex producing optics . \n we thank a. luiten , a. g. white , m. hosseini and n. devlin for fruitful discussion . \n we gratefully acknowledge the technical support provided by t. stewart and e. alarie from moore nanotechnology . \n this research is supported by the australian research council ( project numbers ce110001027 and dp1092891 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2534224357644, "RequestID": "2b7f037962b5f61a120fc5a47247ad54dc5c1604", "TotalTokens": 2194}
{"ContextTokens": 2892, "GeneratedTokens": 158, "SynthesizedBody": "we report measurements of strange particle momentum distributions in jets from p+p @xmath4 collisions measured by the star

comparisons to charged hadron momentum distributions . \n furthermore , predictions for the modification of jet chemistry in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p have been made @xcite . \n these predictions show the @xmath5 and @xmath6 ratios in jets are expected to be higher in the presence of a medium . \n it is therefore essential we test theoretical descriptions of identified particle momentum distributions in p+p jets , if predictions in the modification of heavy - ion jet chemistry are to be made . \n finally , since jets are from hard processes , comparisons of particles yields in jets to inclusive spectrum measurements may help elucidate the contributions from hard processes to those measurements as a function of @xmath7 . \n the data presented are from @xmath8 8 million jet - patch triggered p+p @xmath9 gev events recorded in 2006 by the star experiment . \n the jet - patch trigger is designed to select events with jets , and thus requires energies above 8 gev to be deposited in an area @xmath10 within the electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite . \n the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is used to detect the charged particles @xcite , while the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter , bemc , is used for neutral particles . \n three jet finders are employed from the fast - jet package @xcite : @xmath11 , anti-@xmath11 and sis . \n we select recoil jets with respect to the triggered jets to measure fragmentation functions . \n this is because the triggered jets have a bias towards the neutral jet component . \n the jets are found within a resolution parameter , r @xmath12 and a jet axis @xmath13 cut @xmath14 to ensure the jet area lies within the tpc / bemc acceptance . \n the resolution parameter can be thought of as an effective jet radius in the @xmath15 plane . \n the minimum @xmath7 cut for a charged particle is 200 mev / c , while the minimum calorimeter tower energy is 200 mev . \n towers which match charged particles are removed from the jet to avoid over counting of electrons and minimum ionising particles ( mips ) . \n no corrections are applied to the jet energy scale which means the reconstructed jet @xmath16 is likely to be less than the actual jet @xmath7 due to tpc / bemc detection inefficiencies , and missing neutral energy principally from undetected @xmath17 and @xmath18 particles . \n studies are underway to determine a correction for this . \n finally , in order to measure the momentum distributions of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 particles , v0s are identified within the jet area from tpc tracks . \n the invariant mass distributions are calculated to extract the yields of these particles via their dominant decay channels : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in conjunction with a minimum @xmath16 cut of 1 gev / c \n , a series of topological cuts are placed on the v0s to minimise the relative background contribution , and ensure the signal to background ratios are approximately the same for each particle . \n the residual background after all cuts is not yet removed from the fragment yields . \n strange particle momentum distributions as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath16 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . \n the momentum distribution is expressed in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the reconstructed jet and fragment @xmath7 respectively . for a particular particle species

different jet finders . \n a data point is the mid point value between the lowest and highest values the three jet finders give . \n the measured v0 yields are not yet corrected for acceptance and tpc tracking inefficiencies . \n the pythia predictions are obtained by processing pythia events with star s detector simulation , and running the track , jet , and v0 reconstruction software on the simulated output in the same way as the real data . \n this ensures the pythia events are subject to the same acceptance restrictions / detector inefficiencies as the real data . \n all pythia predictions shown in these proceedings are from version 6.4 with tune a. we find that pythia gives a reasonable description of the @xmath3 data . \n jetset ( the jet production scheme in pythia ) has also been shown to describe @xmath29 fragmentation functions in @xmath30 collisions well , where the jet energies range @xmath31 gev @xcite . \n furthermore , pythia has been shown to describe charged hadron momentum distributions in p+p collisions at the same center of mass energy @xcite . on the other hand , we note that the pythia description of @xmath1 and @xmath2 momentum distributions are less satisfactory . \n although the predictions appear to predict the correct yield over all @xmath28 , they tend to over predict the yields at low @xmath28 and under predict the yields at intermediate @xmath28 . whether this is due to a mismatch in the reconstruction of pythia events and real data , or due to physics , \n is under investigation .    in figure [ fig2 ] , \n we show ratios of integrated yields @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 gev / c as a function of reconstructed jet @xmath16 . \n the analysis shows the @xmath32 ratio is below 1 showing the baryon asymmetry in the colliding system ( p+p ) is transferred to jets over all jet energies measured . \n we also find the @xmath32 ratio is consistent with the value obtained from inclusive spectra measurements @xcite . \n pythia also seems to reproduce the magnitude of the ratio . \n the jaggedness of the predictions is due statistical fluctuations which are @xmath35 and not shown . regarding the @xmath33 ratios in jets , these are higher than values from inclusive spectrum measurements over all @xmath7 . \n the inclusive spectrum measurement will be dominated by production below 1 gev / c . \n when we compare the ratios in jets to the inclusive spectrum measurement above 1 gev / c , we find they are generally consistent . \n this may mean that @xmath19 and @xmath21 spectrum measurements with @xmath34 gev / c have a dominant contribution from hard processes i.e. jet production . \n however , measurements of the same ratio from the underlying event are needed to further qualify this observation . \n we also find pythia again reproduces the magnitude of the ratio .    in figure [ fig3 ] \n , we show the position of the maximum of the @xmath28 distribution , @xmath36 , for the various particles as a function of the reconstructed jet @xmath7 . \n since the @xmath7 dependent tracking inefficiency / acceptance will distort the shape of the @xmath28 distribution , we correct the distributions using embedding which determines the v0 reconstruction efficiency . \n a gaussian is fitted in the peak region to extract @xmath36 . \n the fit range is chosen to avoid the region in @xmath28 affected by the minimum @xmath16 cut on the fragments . \n in the mlla scheme , the position of the maximum can be described by the following relation @xcite ; @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath39 is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the jet opening angle , and @xmath42 is the effective transverse momentum ( relative to the jet axis ) where a parton ceases to branch in the parton shower . \n mlla predictions for momentum distributions of hadrons with mass @xmath43 typically assume @xmath44 @xcite . \n equation [ equ : mlla1 ] then implies a scaling behaviour of @xmath36 with the mass of the hadron i.e. @xmath36 should decrease for the higher mass hadrons . \n the value of @xmath36 should also increase with jet energy for a given hadron which is observed in figure [ fig3 ] for all particles . \n however , we find that @xmath45 which is contrary to the expected scaling . on the other hand , @xmath46 and @xmath47 which is consistent with such a scaling assuming pions dominate particle production in jets . \n a similar observation was made for @xmath48 fragmentation functions for similar jet energies in @xmath30 collisions @xcite . finally , we note in interest that if we extract the mode of the transverse rapidity , @xmath49 , distribution ( motivated by this study @xcite ) , we find a mass scaling in @xmath49 space i.e @xmath50 for a given reconstructed jet @xmath7 bin . for a given particle species , \n we also find @xmath51 increases with jet energy .    in figure [ fig4 ] \n we show the momentum distributions of _ non - leading _ charged hadrons for the cases where the leading particle is a charged hadron , @xmath19 , or @xmath21 . \n we want to investigate whether tagging jets according to the species of the leading hadron , preferentially selects on gluon or quark jets . \n both measured data @xcite and theoretical predictions show hadron multiplicities are larger in gluon jets compared to quark jets : mlla gives the ratio 9/4 for gluon / quark jet multiplicities . \n thus , if tagging jets with particle a preferentially selected gluon jets , and tagging jets with particle b preferentially selected quark jets , we would expect the jets associated with particle a to have more non - leading charged hadrons compared to jets associated with particle b. however , in figure [ fig4 ] we observe at given jet energy , the charged hadron multiplicities are the same for each of the tagged jets . \n this might be expected for the highest jet @xmath16 bin where jet production is expected to be dominated by hard scattering of valance quarks , however at lower jet energies there should be mixture of quark and gluon jets @xcite . \n therefore , our observation suggests quark / gluon jets can not be tagged in this way . \n further studies are underway to confirm this . \n in summary , we have shown measurements of strange particle momentum distributions . we have found that pythia describes the @xmath21 momentum distributions well , however we observe some deviations for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 data . \n we have found that @xmath32 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets are consistent with values obtained from inclusive spectra . \n @xmath52 ratios ( @xmath34 gev / c ) in jets were found to be similar to values obtained from inclusive spectra in the same @xmath16 range . \n this may suggest that @xmath53 and @xmath21 production above 1 gev / c is dominated by hard processes in p+p @xmath9 gev collisions . \n we investigated a mass scaling of the peak position of @xmath28 ( inferred from mlla ) , and found although @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath45 . \n finally , we have found tagging jets with leading strange baryons / mesons may not preferentially select on quark / gluon jets . \n 10

{"ContextTokens": 3974, "GeneratedTokens": 188, "SynthesizedBody": "we propose a model for a distributed information network in which each node at a given time can obtain information from a limited number of other nodes to which it is connected . from the information residing in these nodes , \n each one of them can perform specific tasks ( calculation , classification , etc . ) involving all the information contained in the network nodes . in a system where information is distributed at different sites , the access to this information can be an expensive procedure if the number of sites is high . \n moreover , if a set of @xmath0 nodes want to do at any given time a calculation of a magnitude involving information contained in all other ones , the direct access of all to all nodes requires a number of requests of order @xmath1 , which is very high if @xmath0 is large . \n here we pose the problem of a set of @xmath0 elements ( nodes ) , each characterized by the value of a magnitude @xmath2 , in general different for each node , so that each and every one of the elements wish to calculate the average value of @xmath2 ( or a function of @xmath2 ) in the set , by accessing at one time to information contained in other @xmath3 elements of the set ( @xmath4 ) with which it is connected . \n this is in line with systems using epidemic protocols @xcite or gossip ones @xcite , such as the newscast protocol @xcite . in these systems \n the goal is not to enable both point - to - point communication between nodes , but rapid and efficient dissemination of information . \n the system intends to perform a specific collective task ( for example , calculating the average value of a variable in the set of nodes , setting the position of each node in a ranking according to the set value of the variable , etc . ) so that , eventually , all nodes have access to the result obtained from the set . to do this we consider a network in which each element is connected to other @xmath3 ones ( neighbors ) , from which it extracts information . \n the neighborhood of each element can be changed along the process of calculation , so that each node can exchange a neighbor randomly with another node . \n we discuss issues such as scalability and convergence , considering different sizes and data sets . \n we also compare the results obtained for the dynamically changing network with those obtained from the fixed static network . to do this we compare network configurations from different times of evolution with those corresponding to the initial fixed network ( which may take the form of a conventional cellular automaton ) . \n in a gossip framework there is an exchange of information among system elements in this exchange of information , which is a dynamic process , one receives information from another ( also can be a reciprocal exchange ) . in turn \n , the receiver of information can give information to other peers . \n overall the transmission process basically comprises three aspects : peer selection , data exchanged or transmitted between peers and data processing . in our model \n we consider a network arranged in a two - dimensional lattice ( we do this initially to compare with a conventional cellular automaton with moore s neighborhood @xcite ) with @xmath5 sites forming a square lattice . to each node \n is randomly assigned the value of a variable @xmath2 , in general different for each node . \n the objective is that each node `` knows '' the average value of this variable in the whole at the end of the process . \n each node has access to limited information on each step of calculation . to obtain specific results \n , it has been considered that each node , at each instant , can only store eight values of other nodes , and that initially each node has access to the data of the eight nearest neighbors in the lattice . \n this can be matched with a two - dimensional cellular automaton with moore s neighborhood . throughout the process \n the neighborhood of each site is not fixed , but each node exchanges a neighbor with another randomly chosen node . \n this implies a double selection ( with appropriate calls to random numbers routines ) , one of them for the site of exchanging and the other for choosing the neighbor exchanged . \n the average value of the variable of each site and its eight neighbors ( inputs ) is assigned to the variable of the corresponding site for each system update . \n the updating of all sites is simultaneous , although it could also be carried out sequentially . since in the course of evolution neighborhoods randomly change , the initial regular structure of the network is irrelevant ( only holds the fact that each node has eight input and eight outputs , generally different ) . \n however , in order to formally create a by analogy with the above mentioned cellular automaton , we initially identify each node as a point on a square lattice @xmath6 ( figure [ fig : networks]a ) , but now , after the dynamic exchange of information , the system is turned into a complex directed network and connections do not generate a square lattice ( figure [ fig : networks]b ) a and b are represented in a circular layout in order to compact the graph , as an orthogonal layout ( square lattice like ) is not friendly looking due to the high number of nodes . ] .        to test the scalability we have considered various system sizes ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) . \n also we have considered two data distributions : ( a ) a uniform random distribution , ( b ) a distribution of values grouped into four quadrants as shown schematically in figure [ fig : grouped_values ] . for comparison , as mentioned above , three cases are considered : the network that dynamically changes , the fixed network with the configuration that is reached at a given moment of the dynamical evolution and the fixed network with the initial square lattice structure ( cellular automaton ) . in the latter two cases , \n the neighborhoods do not change and each node has permanent access to its pre - established eight neighbors . \n we defined a parameter , @xmath11 , to evaluate how the computation progresses in each system update , i.e. , convergence to the desired value with a given accuracy . \n @xmath12    we have imposed the condition that the calculation is stopped when the variation of @xmath11 between two successive updates is less than a preset value . \n we have also established a limited number of system updates . moreover , using the cytoscape software @xcite , we have analyzed some of the properties of the network [ 11 - 12 ] to establish the relationship between its topology and the degree of computation efficiency . \n we have taken the value of @xmath13 as the its limit of @xmath11 and have scored the number of updates required to reach a value of @xmath11 less than the successive powers of 10 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . \n the table [ tab : tab1 ] shows the results for the evolving network for a set of data randomly distributed according to a uniform distribution . as can be seen , the number of updates is low and the scalability is very good , because for large variations in the size of the system the number of updates nearly remains the same . \n each node has to perform a small number of updates . since for each update of the entire system one must perform @xmath16 updates of the values of the nodes , then , the total number of individual operations is virtually proportional to system size , i.e. escalates as @xmath0 ( a direct calculation escalates as @xmath17 ) . \n figure [ fig : results1]a graphically show this behavior where the number of updates slowly increases when @xmath11 is diminished . \n it must be noticed that the number of updates remains the same for a certain @xmath11 independently of the network size . \n @xmath5 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & 3 & 6 & 8 & 11 & 13 + @xmath24 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 11 & 14 + @xmath25 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 11 & 14 + @xmath26 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 11 & 14 +     value in an evolutionary network for a randomly distributed data set . \n the bar graph shows a linear increase of the number of updates with the required precision and remains constant when increasing the network size . \n ( b ) number of updates required to reach the @xmath11 value in two fixed networks for a randomly distributed data set : ( i ) evolutionary network configuration when @xmath18 . \n ( ii ) evolutionary network configuration when @xmath22 . \n as in the case of using evolutionary network , the number of updates needed to reach a certain precision in the calculus increases linearly with this precision . in this case , the increase in the network size makes the number of updates to remain nearly constant . \n ( c , d ) number of updates required to reach the @xmath11 value applying a cellular automaton with moore neighborhood for a randomly distributed data set . \n ( c ) varying @xmath11 . \n ( d ) varying the network size . \n contrary to the two anterior cases of study , the use of cellular automata makes the number updates increase in an exponential tendency as the precision and the network size grow.,width=377 ]    let s now change the computation order . instead of updating the system as the network evolves , the evolution takes first place and then , for a fixed network successive updates are done . \n the results for this case can be seen in table [ tab : tab2 ] . here \n the configurations that are considered are those reached with the evolutionary network when ( i ) @xmath27 and ( ii ) @xmath28 . in these cases , \n the differences with the evolutionary network are not very significant , but for larger values of the limit of @xmath11 convergence is slightly faster , and for lower values of this limit convergence is slightly slower in the case ( i ) and slightly faster in the case ( ii ) . \n again , the number of updates slowly increases linearly when @xmath11 is diminished in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) ( figure [ fig : results1]b ) . \n + @xmath5 &

: tab3 ] shows the results obtained for the same random distribution of data using the fixed network forming a square lattice ( cellular automaton with moore s neighborhood ) . \n as can be seen , the number of updates required to achieve a given accuracy rapidly grows with size . to be concrete \n , the number of updates increases exponentially when @xmath11 is diminishes ( figure [ fig : results1]c ) and the size of the network increases ( figure [ fig : results1]d ) . \n @xmath5 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 12 & 16 + @xmath24 & 4 &

have made an analysis of some of the properties of these networks . \n we have considered the clustering coefficient , the diameter and the characteristic path length ( cpl ) . \n the clustering coefficient of a node is the ratio @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of links between the neighboring nodes and @xmath35 is the maximum number of links that would be possible among them ; the clustering coefficient of the network is the average value of clustering coefficients of all the network nodes . \n the network diameter is the maximum distance between two nodes . \n the characteristic path length gives the expected distance between any two nodes . \n it is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes . \n as can be seen , the shorter the cpl the better the communication along the network . by construction \n the number of links of each node in these networks is the same ( eight inputs and eight outputs ) . \n the clustering coefficient of the evolutionary network has a very low value and that of the cellular automaton is high . \n the two significant parameters are the diameter of the network and the characteristic path length . \n the values of these parameters for the fixed networks considered are shown in table [ tab : tab4 ] . as can be seen , \n whereas in the four evolutionary network configurations considered the diameter and the characteristic path length have small values , and do not change significantly with the limit of @xmath11 , in the cellular automaton these values are much higher and rapidly growing with size ( figure [ fig : topol_param]a ) . for the cellular automaton convergence is very slow , the number of updates required to reach the limits of @xmath11 is very high and the scalability is very poor . \n therefore this fact suggests that the speed of convergence and scalability of the calculus in the network is strongly associated with the values of these two parameters . \n this can be seen as manifesting the property of `` small world '' , which appears in different types of complex networks @xcite . \n topologically speaking , the evolutionary networks are distributed in a more sparse way than the cellular automaton , according to the clustering coefficient values . regarding cpl and diameter values , \n the evolutionary networks are much ` better ' connected than the cellular automaton , in terms of information dissemination . \n a network with low cpl means that the information contained in one node is more accessible to the rest of the nodes than in a network with high cpl . \n all this gives a method that re - distributes a network in a way where information is easy to share , and so , computationally speaking , with a low cost in collective computations . \n network & diameter & characteristic path length & clustering coefficient + evolutionary network @xmath36 when reaching @xmath20 & 5 & 3.5 & 0.007 + evolutionary network @xmath37 when reaching @xmath20 & 6 & 4.6 & 0.001 + evolutionary network @xmath38 when reaching @xmath18 & 8 & 5.9 & 0.036 + evolutionary network @xmath38 when reaching @xmath22 & 8 & 5.7 & 0.000 +

networks when the data is not randomly distributed but strongly grouped . in this case the scalability is still very good as in the case with randomly distributed data . \n the number of updates also slowly increases in a linear way as in the rest of studied cases for the evolutionary network.,width=226 ]    next we have examined the influence of the way in which data are distributed . instead of a random distribution , \n we have considered other one in which data is strongly grouped . \n this consists of four different values distributed in the nodes associated to each of the four quadrants shown in figure [ fig : grouped_values ] . \n the results for the evolutionary network are shown in table [ tab : tab5 ] . as can be seen \n scalability is very good as in the case of the data with random distribution , although the number of updates required is somewhat greater than in the case of random data distribution . as in the rest of the studied cases , \n the number of updates slowly increases in a linear way ( figure [ fig : topol_param]b ) . \n @xmath5 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & 8 & 11 & 13 & 16 + @xmath24 & 8 & 11 & 13 & 16 + @xmath25 & 8 & 11 & 13 & 16 + @xmath26 & 8 & 11 & 13 & 16 +    finally , note that if during the process you add new nodes are added or deleted , the update could proceed as follows :    * if a node is deleted , its input links could be redirected to its output target nodes , so that those nodes that had access to it now are addressed to those to which the deleted node accessed . \n * if a node is inserted , it provides access to eight of the existing nodes ( as input links ) , and in exchange , each of these nodes will deliver to the new node a link to one of its neighbors ( as output nodes ) . \n this will allow to perform a system robustness analysis . \n if the variation in the number of nodes is not very sudden , it is expected the overall system to be not severely impacted , given the information transmission speed . even in the case of a change in many nodes \n , it can be expected that a good accuracy in the result of the global parameter will be reached again in a reduced number of updates , i.e. resilience is very good . \n in a networked system , which nodes have a limited access to information only from a few neighbors , the collective computation involving the whole data set is very efficient when the network changes dynamically , or with a fixed structure generated by the same dynamic process . in this case \n , a fast convergence towards the average value is achieved . \n also the number of computing updates shows a good scalability with the size of the network . \n this is associated with the diameter and the characteristic path length of the network . given the high rate with which the system converges to the desired value \n , the system is also is expected to be robust to changes in the number of nodes or in the values distribution assigned to the network . \n these results clearly contrast with what happens in a fixed regular network in which the convergence is slow and the computation required hugely grows when the size of the system increases . \n this work is

{"ContextTokens": 3115, "GeneratedTokens": 213, "SynthesizedBody": "wind farm simulations require intensive computational resources and advanced turbine models in order to capture rich amounts of information such as loads along the blades , aerodynamic forces , and power output accurately @xcite . the actuator line model ( alm ) \n is known to depend on a high grid resolution ( on the order of 50 grid points per rotor ) when using large - eddy simulations ( les ) to provide grid - converged results @xcite . however , in order to study large wind farms and the associated large - scale properties of coupling with the atmospheric boundary layer , wind farms consisting of many turbines must be considered @xcite . \n when many turbines must be included in the computational domain , fine spatial resolution on each rotor is often not affordable , especially if one wishes to repeat the les varying flow conditions , rotor designs , etc . \n it is thus of interest to study and better understand the performance of the alm approach when using very coarse discretization ( on the order of 10 les grid - points per rotor diameter ) . \n it has been seen that power extracted from an alm in les is very dependent on the grid resolution and the width of the kernel used to smear the forces @xcite . \n the wake structures are also affected by means of the spatial filter in the velocity field which is not able to resolve the structures smaller than the grid size . \n the subgrid - scale closure of the les models the smaller scales of the flow , but because of the spatially filtered velocity may differ from the real unsmoothed velocity , differences of predicted forces and power at the rotor blade can exist \n . the axial induction can be affected by the smearing of the velocity field .    here , we study the implementation of an alm in coarse simulations ( 14 les grid - points per rotor ) . \n first , we examine the performance of the alm model for a single wind turbine with turbulent inflow conditions for which detailed wind tunnel experimental data are available . \n second , a formulation is presented to address differences in power caused by the width of the kernel being used . a single turbine in uniform inflow \n is studied to document the effect of the smearing kernel on blade loads and power production . \n the current study uses lesgo , @xcite the johns hopkins turbulence research group s large - eddy simulations framework including a recent implementation of the alm . @xcite \n lesgo solves the filtered navier - stokes equations for very large reynolds number @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes spatial filtering , @xmath2 is the velocity , @xmath3 is pressure , @xmath4 is density , @xmath5 is the subgrid scale stress tensor , and @xmath6 is the body force . \n the code uses pseudo - spectral representation in the two horizontal directions with the third ( vertical ) direction using second - order centered finite differencing . \n the approach is kinetic - energy conserving . \n time advancement is done using a second order adams - bashforth scheme . \n subgrid - scale modeling is based on an eddy viscosity type scale - dependent lagrangian dynamic model @xcite . \n the model represents the deviatoric part of the sgs stress tensor , @xmath7 , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dynamically computed smagorinsky coefficient , @xmath10 is the grid resolution , and @xmath11 is the symmetric part of the resolved velocity gradient tensor @xcite . \n the alm implementation in lesgo @xcite incorporates a wind turbine into the navier - stokes equation , see eq . \n [ eq : ns ] , as a body force term @xcite . \n this body force is calculated dynamically depending on the local velocity at the location of each actuator point . \n the actuator points are used to calculate the blade forces with a high accuracy before they are projected on the computational grid used to calculate the flow field . \n lift and drag are calculated based on tabulated airfoil data and then smeared onto the flow field as body forces by means of a gaussian kernel @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the distance from the actuator point , and @xmath14 establishes the width of the kernel . \n the two turbines used for this study are the turbine used in the experiments from the group at cole polytechnique fdrale de lausanne ( epfl ) which has a 0.15 m diameter , @xcite and the nrel 5mw reference , which has a 126 m rotor diameter @xcite . \n the turbine used by the group at epfl is a gws / ep-6030 . \n @xcite . the chord and pitch angle along the blades are found in their previous work @xcite . \n the lift and drag coefficient tables were obtained by using a cambered airfoil , i.e. we used airfoil ( 9 ) from the work by sunada et al . \n @xcite in order to match the wake profiles close to the center of the wake , a nacelle has to be included in the model . \n power and thrust coefficient curves have been obtained using blade element momentum theory and are shown in figure [ fig : cpct ] . \n it can be observed that this turbine provides a poor performance in terms of power , i.e. low @xmath15 value , compared to a large scale turbine which operates on a range closer to the betz limit . \n the thrust coefficient , however , is closer to typical values observed for operational large scale turbines . \n we now present simulation of a wind turbine with turbulent inflow . \n we use the experiment from the epfl group @xcite , here focusing on the single - turbine case . \n the inflow condition is matched by using a concurrent - precursor simulation matching the given roughness height and friction velocity of the experiment @xcite . \n the tip speed ratio of the turbine is set to @xmath16 as in the experiment . as a first step \n we compare the current implementation of the actuator line model ( alm ) with and without the effects of the nacelle . here \n the les uses a coarse discretization , 14 points across the rotor . \n the alm has been tested with and without a nacelle and tower modeled as drag objects with @xmath17 coefficients of 1.0 and 0.5 respectively . \n is the mean velocity at hub - height at the inflow location ( -1d ) . ] \n figures [ fig : multiplotu ] and [ fig : multiplotupup ] show streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity profiles across the wake for a single turbine in a turbulent boundary layer . \n the non - dimensional scale used is the hub - height velocity @xmath18 . \n it is to be noted that in order to obtain good agreement between the experiments and simulations a nacelle model needs to be included . \n the current implementations provides excellent agreement for the velocity profiles of the wake . \n the turbulence intensity computed in the les under - predicts the experimental measurements . \n this is expected from les , since some of the scales are filtered , thus reducing the fluctuations . \n the overall trends agree quite well , and it can be observed that at 2 - 3d downstream the wake of the nacelle and tower have a big influence in both the mean velocity and turbulence intensity . \n the wake profiles obtained agree very well with the experiments . \n however , quantities at the turbine , such as power and thrust , are very dependent on the grid resolution and the value of the kernel width @xmath14 . \n @xcite the power coefficient obtained from the simulation for this turbine is @xmath19 . \n this power coefficient is significantly higher than what is predicted by the turbine design using bem ( figure [ fig : cpct ] ) . while the overall thrust may be realistic ( since the wake profiles agree well ) , the differences between the predicted @xmath15 and the expected @xmath15 from bem points to possible problems due to the smearing of velocity inherent in alm with very coarse les resolutions . in order to better understand the discrepancy \n , first we perform a simulation under uniform inflow , and then present some initial thoughts of how the model inaccuracies may be remedied . \n we consider the simulation of the nrel wind turbine with laminar uniform inflow . \n we use les with a grid resolution of @xmath20 4 m in each direction , an inflow velocity of 8 ( m / s ) , a prescribed tip - speed ratio of @xmath21 , and vary the gaussian kernel width @xmath14 . \n it is known that wind turbine loads along the blades depend significantly on the filtering size of the gaussian kernel used to smear the forces of the turbine . \n figure [ fig : bem ] shows angle of attack , axial velocity , lift and drag along the blade for an nrel 5mw reference turbine modeled as an actuator line with different kernel widths ( @xmath14 ) .            from this figure \n we can see that the largest difference is in axial velocity . \n this difference will cause differences in the lift and drag curves , that are more pronounced as we move further towards the tip . \n these differences change the total power that the turbine is extracting from the flow . \n next , we present some analytical considerations focusing on the effects of the spatial filtering inherent in les and its impacts on the alm computations of forces . \n we take the lift component of the body force term per unit width in a 2d frame and write it ( simplifying ) as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the chord , @xmath4 is the density , @xmath24 is the lift coefficient , and @xmath25 is the magnitude of the local velocity on the reference frame of the moving airfoil section . the @xmath24 coefficient is a function of @xmath25 through its dependence on angle of attack . for small angle of attack , @xmath26 and thus the angle of attack \n can be expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the axial velocity . \n the lift coefficient for small angles of attack is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath31 is an offset . \n we will assume @xmath32 so that @xmath33 the filtered body force can be defined as @xmath34 now we can also write a similar equation for the unfiltered force : @xmath35 and from here : @xmath36 if we use the argument that the velocity magnitude @xmath25 is dominated by the rotational component of the velocity vector ( which is valid for high tsr s ) then we can take the velocity magnitude out of the filtering operation and we obtain @xmath37 the relationship in eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] enables us to interpret the results shown in fig . \n [ fig : bem ] ( top right ) in the sense that the ratio of unfiltered force equals the ratio of unfiltered to filtered _ axial _ velocity . \n we wish to determine the unfiltered force but only know the filtered force . \n if we can model ratio of unfiltered and filtered axial velocity , eq [ eq : ratio ] would enable us to determine the correct ( unfiltered ) force .    while the derivation of eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] was based on spatial filtering , we now interpret variables filtered at a scale @xmath14 as the variables one obtains by running les and alm with a kernel width @xmath14 . \n while this assumption can not be firmly established on theoretical grounds , in practice it is a useful assumption and is commonly made in les . \n for example , if we denote the axial velocity and force obtained in a simulation with a kernel @xmath14 as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and associate the scale @xmath14 with the filtering scale , then @xmath40 and @xmath41 . as a next step , \n we filter eq . \n [ eq : ratio ] at another filter scale @xmath42 and assume that the @xmath14-variables are not affected by this smaller - scale filtering \n . then one can rewrite eq . [ \n eq : ratio ] according to @xmath43 we can use simulations performed at various @xmath14 s to test this relationship , as a first step in establishing possible correction strategies for the alm approach .    returning to our simulations of the nrel case , we consider @xmath44 m , and attempt to use the results from the other 4 runs with @xmath45 to rescale the force @xmath46 . if eq . \n [ eq : ua2 ] holds , the distribution of @xmath47 should coincide with the rhs of eq . \n [ eq : ua2 ] , i.e. with @xmath48 , regardless of @xmath45 chosen . \n the first region of the blade is made of cylindrical sections which produce no lift , thus the approach presented is not used in this section . as seen in figure [ fig : ua ] the curves collapse through most of the blade except close to the tip . \n the reason for this is that near the tip , the 3d effects of the kernel become more noticeable \n .     values ( left ) and re - scaled axial velocity ( right ) to @xmath49 8 m case as a function of blade length , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 m. the data points coincide with the actuator points used in the simulation.,title=\"fig : \" ]   values ( left ) and re - scaled axial velocity ( right ) to @xmath49 8 m case as a function of blade length , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 m. the data points coincide with the actuator points used in the simulation.,title=\"fig : \" ] \n the alm has been validated on a relatively coarse resolution with experimental measurements from the group at epfl @xcite . \n the les provides good agreement with the experiments , but a nacelle and tower model are required to obtain the proper wake deficit . \n when analyzing power output computed by the alm , the values are higher than those predicted by blade element momentum theory . a theoretical analysis is presented that attempts to relate filtered forces to filtered velocities , highlighting the impact of filtering of the axial velocity on the force distribution . \n the derived relationship is tested based on simulations done at various @xmath14 values and is seen to hold rather well , except when approaching the tip of the blade . \n the results imply that one may be able to predict the fine - grained force corresponding to an @xmath14 smaller than that of the simulation , if one were able to deduce the corresponding axial velocity from the data at coarser @xmath14 . \n such a model - based defiltering operation is the focus of ongoing investigations . \n lamt was supported by nsf ( igert ) , while international travel and cm were supported by nsf ( iia 124382 , the windinspire project ) . \n rjams is supported by the research program fellowships for young energy scientists ( yes ! ) of the foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) supported by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2576917749012, "RequestID": "96bf6b5961c443b3cba282eede37aafb909fd49a", "TotalTokens": 3328}

ins ) . \n we were thus able to obtain a series of places the users visited in chronological order . \n the activity sequence is obtained by neglecting the absolute timing of events in the raw dataset . to generate the activity sequence of a certain user , we first sifted out all the events that are associated with the user and we then listed the chronologically ordered sequence of states identified by a unique number . for the whrrl dataset , we labeled each activity as a group one if the user was checking in with others . to determine the extent to \n which user behavior is predictable we used standard information - theoretic methods similar to those used in the analysis of gene expression  @xcite . \n for instance , we consider a user @xmath9 as having @xmath10 possible states , where each state in the sequence can correspond to either an online conversation partner or a check - in location . \n an example of a user s activity sequence is shown in figure  [ fig : activity_sequence_sample ] , where two states , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , form the sequence . \n we then used the observed sequences to examine the degree of second order dependences , which signal the extend to which activities depart from random interactions . \n we used entropy to measure the randomness of a user @xmath9 s activities . \n the estimated probabilities for all states @xmath13 have the property that @xmath14 . \n if we assume that these probabilities do not change with time , the randomness of user @xmath9 s possible states can be measured by the uncorrelated entropy , defined as @xmath15 notice that if each state is equally probable , this uncorrelated entropy is maximal and equal to @xmath16 to measure the randomness of the sequence from knowledge of the previous states we introduce the conditional entropy , defined as @xmath17 and we quantify the predictability of the user s activity sequence by using the mutual information @xmath18 for each user , the inequalities @xmath19 are satisfied . \n @xmath20 is equal to the amount of information one can gain about the next state by knowing the current state . if there is no second order correlation between state sequences , @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 , and @xmath20 takes the minimum value of @xmath23 . \n if the next state is completely determined by the previous state , or in other words the user activity is completely predictable , @xmath20 takes the maximum value of @xmath21 . \n the calculations of these quantities require an accurate estimation of the probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n however , in the absence of unlimited data , estimating these probabilities with finite sampling renders a biased estimation of the entropy , since the finite sampling makes the user activity less variable than it is , resulting in a downward bias of the entropy , and a upward bias of the the mutual information  @xcite.the problems associated with estimating entropies for sparse data have been extensively explored in the literature and a variety of remedies proposed  @xcite . \n the most common solution is to restrict the measurements to situations where one has an adequate amount of user activity data  @xcite . in what follows we filter out users who are below a certain activity level , @xmath26 in our observational period . \n since both @xmath27 and @xmath28 generally decrease by different amounts when taking into account finite size effects , we also performed a through bootstrap test to confirm that the empirical values of mutual information are significantly different from zero . \n another widely accepted method is to estimate the magnitude of the systematic bias that originates from finite size effects and then subtract this bias from the estimated entropy . \n to do so , we used the panzeri - treves bias correction method  @xcite in our calculations . \n the lead terms in the bias are , respectively @xmath29 =   - \\frac{1}{{2n\\ln ( 2)}}[\\overline m   - 1],\\ ] ] and @xmath30 =   - \\frac{1}{{2n\\ln ( 2)}}\\sum\\limits_j { [ \\overline { { m_j } }    - 1]},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the estimated number of outcome states , @xmath32 denotes the number of different states @xmath33 with nonzero probability of being observed given that the previous state is @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the total number of observations . \n thus , the leading term of the mutual information bias equals @xmath36 = \\frac{1}{{2n\\ln ( 2)}}\\{\\sum\\limits_j { [ \\overline { { m_j } }    - 1 ] - [ \\overline m   - 1]}\\}.\\ ] ] in what follows , we include the above adjustments to eliminate the impact of the finite size amount of data . \n we start by looking at the predictability of individual activities as measured by both the entropy and the mutual information extracted from sequences in the whrrl and epinion datasets , respectively . \n the histograms of @xmath37 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 calculated from user activity sequences are shown in figure  [ fig : indv_entropy ] . \n the gray solid line in the plot shows a normal fit to the frequency count . \n the gap between @xmath27 and @xmath37 suggests a preference for certain activities , while the difference between the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the figure indicates the existence of second order correlations between states . \n values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for each individual in the online conversation network and the location check - in one are shown in figure  [ fig : h1_h2 ] . \n the straight line corresponds to @xmath27 equal to @xmath28 . \n one interesting fact is that all the dots are below the straight line , which confirms that there is a positive difference between @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all individuals . \n this difference , which is the mutual information conditioned on previous states of user activity , is plotted in increasing order as the red line in figure  [ fig : mutual_info ] for ( a ) conversations and ( b ) location check - ins . \n the positive values of the mutual information indicate information gain , or predictability , conditioned on historical states . \n we now examine the validity of the positive mutual information values in greater detail . \n there are usually two limitations when performing mutual information measurements . \n the first one is the potential bias resulting from the finite data size . \n the second one is the possibility of missing data points in the observation process . to make sure that our results are significant and \n are not impacted by these two limitations , we performed the following analysis . to establish that the observed positive value of the mutual information is not due to the finite size of our data sets \n , we performed a bootstrap test similar to that used in human conversation studies  @xcite . \n the null hypothesis of this test is that the mutual information has a positive value because of the finite size of the dataset . for this test \n we set the significance level to @xmath38 . \n we first shuffled the true activity sequence and constructed a new sequence by drawing elements randomly one by one from the original sequence without replacement . \n if there is a second order correlation in the original sequence the shuffled sequence breaks the order and will thus have a higher @xmath39 value , while the value of @xmath40 would be the same before and after the bootstrap . \n this would result in a mutual information @xmath20 value smaller than that of the true sequence . \n the test checks if the value of @xmath20 obtained from the original activity sequence is significantly different from the shuffled one . to obtain an estimate of the distribution for the shuffled sequence we performed the shuffling procedure a @xmath26 times for each user and calculated \n each individual s shuffled mutual information . \n the value of the simulated sequence ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 is shown by the blue column in figure  [ fig : mutual_info ] . as can be seen \n , the red line ( mutual information for true activity sequence ) lies well above the upper end of the @xmath42 error bar , which suggests that the value of the original sequence is significantly different from that generated by the simulated sequences . \n we can then reject the null hypothesis at the @xmath38 significance level and conclude that the positive mutual information we obtained is not due to the limited size of the data . \n furthermore , the fact that the mutual information is significantly different from zero suggests that a user s current online activity predicts his next interactions . \n next , we assessed the impact of potential loss of data points in the observation period by marking off a percentage of data points from the observed location check - in sequence from whrrl dataset . in real applications of predicting user behavior , a key question to apply maximum likelihood estimation \n depends on the size of observations and the ratio of missing points . to examine the impact of ratio , we perform a mark - off on the bootstrap test of mutual information . \n we hide data points randomly from the true sequence while keeping the chronological order in the remaining sequence . \n for example if we have a mark - off rate of 0.5 , then @xmath43 of the states from the true sequence is marked off . \n the result of the bootstrap test after mark - off is shown in figure  [ fig : whrrl_markoff ] . \n in the plot , the red dot shows the mutual information of the true sequence after performing mark - off procedure . \n the thick blue bar in the plot demonstrates the mutual information of the exact same sequence with shuffling . \n the mutual information is significantly different from that of the random shuffled sequence until the mark - off rate reaches @xmath44 . for values of the mark - off rate larger than @xmath44 , the difference between the two is broken when we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the sequence is significantly different from randomly shuffled . \n it is thus a confirmation that the deterministic pattern we observed is a robust one . \n this test also suggests the existence of a higher order correlations , larger than two , in human social online behavior . \n thus , the deterministic pattern discussed in this study is a robust phenomenon which can be applied to the general situations with missing or incomplete observations . \n as mentioned earlier , we also explored whether individuals acting alone are less predictable than when becoming members of a group . \n specifically , we investigated how predictable each user s is when engaged in group activities as compared with the predictability of individual ones . in the whrrl dataset users \n can expose their position with a group of other users thus providing a sequence of group attendances by users and filtering out the places that were checked in by the user alone . \n we then calculated the information entropies and performed the same bootstrap test as before . \n the calculated mutual information of the activity sequences and shuffled sequences are shown in figure  [ fig : whrrl_group_mutual_info ] . \n interestingly , the gap between the red line of true observation and the upper end of the error bar is is smaller than the one we obtained for the individual activities . \n in contrast with figure  [ fig : mutual_info](b ) , the differences between the randomly shuffled sequences and the true observations are smaller . \n to quantify the observed difference , we calculated the gap between the mutual information from the true activity sequence and the @xmath42 percentile value of the shuffled sequences , defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 . \n this allows for a comparison of sequences with different lengths . \n the relative frequency plot of this @xmath47 and @xmath48 is plotted in figure  [ fig : whrrl_indv_group_unbias ] . \n the upper plot in figure  [ fig : whrrl_indv_group_unbias ] shows the density plot of the gap for individual activity sequences while the lower plot shows the gap for group activities . \n as can be seen , the gap for individual activities has a larger of the mode compared with that of the group activities . under the assumption that both populations from @xmath47 and @xmath48 are random , independent , and arising from a normally distributed population with equal variances , the two sample t - test rejects the null hypothesis of an equal mean with a p - value of @xmath49 under @xmath38 significance level . \n this implies that it is harder to predict the a user s group activities than his individual ones . \n the values of @xmath47 versus @xmath48 for each individual are plotted in figure  [ fig : whrrl_indv_group_unbias ] . \n the mean of @xmath47 is larger than @xmath48 . \n one possible explanation for this observation is that when individuals attend group activities , the decision as to what to do next is not usually made by the individual himself . \n thus , the tendency to follow others in their decisions tends to break one s regular patterns . \n this extra randomness would result in a larger value of @xmath39 and thus become less predictable . \n in summary , we have shown that sequences of user online activities have deterministic components that can be used for predicting future activities . using methods from information theory \n , we experimentally measured how much additional information can be gained from knowledge of previous states within a users activity sequences . \n while the degree of predictability varies from person to person , we also established that it is different when individuals join a group . besides the intrinsic interest of these findings \n , the fact that one can predict online social interactions should be helpful in improving the design of algorithms and applications for online social sites . \n c. w. would like to thank hp labs for financial support . \n c.w . and b.h . \n conceived and designed the study . c.w . collected the data . \n c.w . and b.h . \n discussed the results and wrote the manuscript .", "StartTimeOffset": 2605750103820, "RequestID": "09038bd6325cb66ff7c0b63b2e5cae3cfc70ba39", "TotalTokens": 4201}

{"ContextTokens": 3367, "GeneratedTokens": 235, "SynthesizedBody": "galaxy formation by gravitational condensation out of the expanding cosmological background universe is affected by the complex interplay of gravitational dynamics of collisionless dark matter and the gas dynamics of the baryon - electron fluid , including the feedback on the latter which results when energy is released by the stars and agn s that form . \n results are presented here of 3d numerical gas dynamical simulations of the effect of this energy release , utilizing our anisotropic adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( `` asph '' ) method . \n current computational limitations make it virtually impossible for numerical simulations of the initial value problem involving a realistic initial spectrum of small - amplitude , gaussian random noise primordial density fluctuations to resolve the full range of length and mass scales necessary to form galaxies and the stars within them at the same time . \n we choose , instead , to focus here on an idealized model of structure formation which we can hope to resolve more accurately , thereby elucidating some of the most important aspects of the problem which may be relevant , as well , to more realistic initial conditions . \n we are particularly interested in studying the effects of nonspherical geometry and continuous cosmological infall on the problem of explosion - driven blow - out from galaxies during their formation . \n it is well - known that structure formation from gaussian random noise proceeds in a highly anisotropic way , favoring pancake and filament formation over the formation of quasi - spherical objects . \n our previous work ( @xcite,@xcite ) has demonstrated , however , that a cosmological pancake , modeled as the nonlinear outcome of a single plane - wave density fluctuation , is subject to a linear gravitational instability which results in the formation of filaments and lumps in the central plane of the pancake . \n the lumps of collisionless dark matter that form in this way are quasi - spherical and develop a universal density profile which is reminiscent of the universal profiles found from n - body simulations of 3d gaussian noise density fluctuations in hierarchical clustering models like the cdm model . as such , they provide an ideal test - bed for exploring the gas dynamics of structure formation and feedback effects without the troublesome complexity of gaussian random noise initial conditions . \n the pancake problem , moreover , is completely scale - free , once all lengths are expressed in units of the pancake wavelength @xmath1 , time is expressed in terms of the cosmic scale factor @xmath2 , divided by the scale factor @xmath3 at which the unperturbed pancake collapses to form density caustics in the dark matter and shocks in the gas , and the energy release is expressed in units of the total energy contained in a comoving cube of side @xmath1 . \n as such , each simulation of galaxy formation via 3d pancake gravitational instability serves to represent the generic behavior independent of the particular mass or collapse epoch of the object which forms . \n in order to preserve this universality and scale - free character of the problem , we will neglect radiative cooling in these first calculations . \n once the key features of this scale - free problem are delineated , we will later consider the scale - dependent effects of radiative cooling and photoheating . among the results we seek to quantify in this way \n are :    * the amount of energy release required to blow the gas out of a dark matter halo . * the efficiency for ejecting the fraction of gas which is initially responsible for receiving the energy release ( and , in the case of supernova explosions , the metallicity associated with the sn ejecta ) . \n * the distinction between `` blowout , '' in which the energy release results in the escape of some energy and gas into the surrounding igm but leaves the bulk of the gas in the object unaffected , and `` blowaway , '' in which most or all of the gas is ejected from the dark matter potential well . * the energy release rate required to shock - heat the entire igm by the overlapping effect of energy release from neighboring objects . \n we consider an einstein - de sitter universe ( density parameter @xmath4 , cosmological constant @xmath5 ) with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the contributions of baryons and dark matter to @xmath10 , respectively ) . \n the initial conditions correspond to the growing mode of a single sinusoidal plane - wave density fluctuation of wavelength @xmath1 and dimensionless wavevector @xmath11 ( length unit = @xmath1 ) . \n we adjust the initial amplitude @xmath12 such that a density caustic forms in the collisionless dark matter component at scale factor @xmath13 . \n we perturb this system by adding to the initial conditions two transverse , plane - wave density fluctuations with equal wavelength @xmath14 , wavenumbers @xmath15 pointing along the orthogonal vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and amplitude @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n we use the notation @xmath22 to designate a pancake perturbed by two such transverse perturbation modes . all results presented here \n refer to the case @xmath23 unless otherwise noted . \n the presence of the two perturbation modes will result in the formation of two perpendicular filaments in the plane of the pancake , with a dense , quasi - spherical cluster at the intersection of the filaments .      in 3d \n , our previous @xmath0 simulations of collisionless matter involving @xmath24 particles and @xmath25 grid cells in a comoving cubic box of side equal to @xmath1 , with gravitational softening parameter @xmath26  grid spacings demonstrated that the quasi - spherical lumps that form as one of the generic outcomes of pancake gravitational instability in 3d , evolve self - similar density profiles of universal shape ( @xcite,@xcite ) . \n the universal profile is well - approximated as a power - law @xmath27 over a large range of density , which flattens somewhat at small radii , a shape which is independent of the details of the initial perturbations to the pancake . \n this self - similar profile is similar to the universal profile found to fit the results of 3d n - body simulations of the collisionless dark matter in a cdm model @xcite . \n this suggests that this 3d instability of cosmological pancakes which leads generically to the formation of such quasi - spherical dark matter halos may be used as an alternative to the details of the cdm model with its gaussian random noise initial density fluctuations as a test - bed in which to study halo and galaxy formation further .    to illustrate the universal density profile associated with this pancake instability , we show in figure  1 results from @xcite and @xcite for one particular case , @xmath23 , for various values of the expansion factor , as well as a summary of results for several different perturbation modes , at @xmath28 \n galaxy formation which leads to star formation can be affected by feedback when stars evolve to the point of supernova ( sn ) explosions and the resulting shock - heating and outward acceleration of interstellar and intergalactic gas . \n previous attempts to model this effect have typically been along one of three lines , that which adopts a smooth initial gas distribution in a galaxy - like , fixed dark matter gravitational potential well ( e.g. @xcite ) , that which considers a single , isolated , but evolving , density fluctuation ( i.e. without merging , infall or the effects of external tidal forces ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that in which the galaxy forms by condensation out of gaussian random noise primordial density fluctuations such as in the cdm model ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . in the first case , the computational ability to resolve shocks which propagate away from the sites of explosive energy release is generally greater , while the last is perhaps more realistic in terms of the initial and boundary conditions , but the resolving of shocks is still generally quite poor . \n we compromise here between these two limits by using the pancake instability problem as the model of galaxy formation in which to explore the feedback effect of the explosive release of energy by sne inside a protogalaxy . \n this affords some of the benefit of greater ease of the first approach mentioned above in resolving the explosion - driven shocks which are the crucial element in blowing gas out and away . \n it also provides a self - consistent cosmological origin and boundary condition for a protogalaxy or cluster , including the important effect of anisotropic gravitational collapse and continuous infall .    sharing the initial conditions described above for the formation of a dark matter halo via 3d pancake instability mode @xmath23 is an additional component of baryon - electron gas . \n we model the explosive release of energy due to sne in terms of a single impulsive explosion which may represent a starburst or the collective effect of multiple sne . \n we initiate the explosion by waiting until the first gas particles at the center of our dark matter halo reach a density contrast relative to the average background density , @xmath29 , exceeding @xmath30 , at which point we suddenly multiply the thermal energy of these particles by a factor @xmath31 and share some of the explosion energy smoothly amongst their nearest neighbor particles via asph kernel smoothing as well . \n this occurs at @xmath32 . \n while we have performed a series of simulations for different values of @xmath31 , we shall report here only the results for two limiting cases : @xmath33 ( no explosion ) and @xmath34 ( blowaway regime ) . \n simulations end at an expansion factor @xmath35 . \n ( note : the proper , numerical prescription for depositing the energy of explosions in the interstellar gas surrounding the explosion site is a complicated question , dependent as it is on explosion details which are unresolvable by current numerical treatments . \n some recent discussion of this question is contained in @xcite and @xcite , including the question of the fraction of the energy of a given sn explosion which ends up as kinetic energy of the sn remnant rather than as thermal energy . however , since the simulations described here are adiabatic and neglect radiative cooling , it is self - consistent for us to deposit the entire explosion energy initially as thermal energy . ) \n all our gas dynamical simulations are based upon the new 3d version of our asph method ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , coupled to a @xmath0 gravity solver . \n the simulations reported here use @xmath36 gas particles , @xmath36 dark matter particles ( with unequal particle masses , @xmath37 ) , and a @xmath0 grid of @xmath24 cells with softening length @xmath26 grid spacings . \n in the absence of explosion , the simulation produces two orthogonal filaments within the pancake central plane at whose intersection is located a denser , quasi - spherical ball of gas which sits in the gravitational potential well of a dense , quasi - spherical dark matter halo like that in figure 1 . in the case with explosion , we found that away from the central object , the pancake and the filaments within it are hardly affected . \n however , gas has been blown out of the center and some exterior gas which was infalling along directions perpendicular to the pancake plane has been swept back out , as well , some as far as to the outer edge of the box .    in figure 2 , we show a shaded contour plot of the gas temperature at @xmath35 , in a plane perpendicular to the pancake and intersecting the center of the central cluster . \n the explosion is confined by the gas in the plane of the pancake ( seen edge - on on this figure ) outside the central object , with the hottest gas at the very center . \n the filaments are hardly affected , however , nor is the shocked pancake gas far from the central object . \n this edge - on view of the pancake reveals that a major blow - out has occurred in which the explosion , led by an outer shock , has propagated all the way to the edge of the box , half - way to the nearest neighbor pancake , and collided there with the explosion shock expanding away from the neighboring pancakes central object and toward the pancake in this box . \n the temperature plot reveals multiple shocks interior to the explosion , especially along the symmetry axis of the blow - out . \n although the central object in which the explosion took place was quasi - spherical , the existence of the pancake plane and of the filaments which intersect at the location of the central dark halo ensure that a highly anisotropic explosion results and serves to channel the energy and mass ejection outward along the symmetry axis . \n velocity arrows for the gas particles at @xmath35 are displayed in figures 3 and 4 . \n figure  3 shows a thin slice of the computational volume which contains the pancake central plane ( i.e. a top view looking down on the pancake central plane ) . \n figure  4 shows a slice perpendicular to the pancake ( that is , the same plane as in figure  2 ) . \n these show that outflow is restricted to the symmetry axis , while infall continues within the pancake plane and especially inward along the filaments . \n the effect of the explosion in blowing gas away is illustrated by figure 5 , in which different particle groups are distinguished according to their fate with and without the explosion . in the top panel , \n the solid dots show the particles which were the original recipients of the explosion energy and , by implication , the metal - enriched sn ejecta , which were previously located at the very center of the central dark halo at @xmath32 . \n gas initially outside this core region which was within the halo defined according to a mean overdensity @xmath38 but which did not receive the initial explosion energy or ejecta directly is shown as open dots . \n all of the gas originally inside the halo when the explosion occurred has been blown away by @xmath39 . \n the lower panel of figure 5 shows _ all _ those gas particles which were found to be inside the central halo with mean overdensity @xmath38 at @xmath35 in the case with _ no _ explosion but which are _ not _ inside this overdensity at @xmath39 in the case _ with _ the explosion . \n the effect of the explosion on the build - up of the gas mass of the `` galaxy '' by continuous infall is illustrated by the plot in figure 6 of the collapsed gas fraction in the box , defined as the gas of overdensity @xmath38 , for the cases with and without the explosion . with no explosion \n , the central mass grows continuously from @xmath40 to @xmath35 to encompass 10% of all the mass in the box . with the explosion , \n however , all the gas in the central halo is blown away shortly after the explosion occurs at @xmath32 , but by @xmath41 , unobstructed infall within the pancake plane and along the filaments starts to resupply the central halo with gas at a significant rate . \n * we find that blow - out and blow - away are generically anisotropic events which channel energy and mass loss outward preferentially along the symmetry axis of the local pancake and away from the intersections of filaments in the pancake plane . \n * this means that metal ejection from dwarf galaxies at high redshift due to explosive energy release is less likely to pollute the local filaments and pancake in which the dwarf galaxies reside and more likely to channel the metals away from those denser regions . * despite the complete blow - away of gas initially in the dark matter potential well of the `` galaxy '' by the large explosion simulated here , continuous infall is not completely halted in the directions away from the preferred direction of blow - out , so infall partially replenishes the gas which is blown - away . \n this work was supported by nasa grants nag5 - 2785 , nag5 - 7363 , and nag5 - 7821 , nsf grants phy-9800725 and asc-9504046 , and the high performance computing facility , university of texas .", "StartTimeOffset": 2625862044516, "RequestID": "2b36540c4b26cef5be36383ede669402a0794553", "TotalTokens": 3602}

mchardy et al . \n 2004 ) to a larger sample of comparatively weaker agn . \n our parent sample is the whole set of xmm - newton observations of pg quasars available in the public archive as of august 2004 . \n they cover 42 objects , with largely inhomogeneous exposure times . \n their spectral properties are presented by porquet et al . \n ( 2004 ) and jimnez - bailn et al . \n ( 2004 ) . in this paper \n we will concentrate on the spectral variability pattern in objects dominated by comptonization in the whole xmm - newton energy bandpass ( 0.110  kev ) . \n consequently , we will consider in the following only the 20 pg quasars , whose xmm - newton epic spectra are well fit with a double power - law model by jimnez - bailn et al . \n ( 2004 ) .      in fig . \n [ fig1 ] we show the 310  kev versus 0.11  kev hardness ratio ( hr )    against the 0.110  kev count rate as measured on light curves with a time binning @xmath6  s. in only 2 objects ( @xmath710% of the cases ) one observes a correlation more significant then the 99% confidence level according to a k - s test . \n moreover , these correlations have two opposite signs : positive in pg0947 + 396 , and negative in pg1202 + 281 . \n we conclude that on such short timescales variations of the x - ray emission produced by the two comptonization media are largely independent . \n they are probably dominated by local fluctuations in the accretion flow or in the disk illumination , which do not affect the disk - corona system as a whole . \n there are only two pg quasars , for which xmm - newton observations at multiple epochs are available : pg1407 + 265 and pg1440 + 356 . \n the former was observed twice , in january and december 2001 . \n the latter was observed by xmm - newton 4 times in the framework of a specific program to determine the timescale of the spectral variability pattern . \n the first observation was performed on december 2001 , the remaining three in january 2003 , at the relative distance of three days each . in order to spectrally characterize their variability properties \n , we fit the data with a combination of two comptonizing continua , trying different geometries for the seed photons influx and the comptonizing media . \n the following results refer to a physical scenario where the two spherical reservoirs of comptonizing electrons ( a two - phase corona ) share the same soft photons input flux ( a region at the peak of the accretion disk thermal distribution , and smaller than the disk gradient temperature scale ) . \n we show in fig . \n [ fig2 ]    the iso-@xmath9 contour plot for the temperature ( @xmath10 ) versus plasma optical depth ( @xmath11 ) for the comptonizing medium producing the bulk of the x - ray emission in the soft x - ray band . in both cases \n the best - fit parameters corresponding to observations separated by the longer intervals ( @xmath71  year ) are different at a confidence level larger then 99% for two interesting parameters . \n intriguingly enough , in pg1407 + 265 a change in the optical depth of the comptonized medium is favored , whereas in pg1440 + 356 a feedback mechanism between these quantities may force the contours to follow a source - specific `` track '' in the kt vs. @xmath11 plane . given the well known degeneracy of the above parameters in comptonization models @xcite , one should refrain from attributing a too literal meaning to the best - fit parameters values . \n however , regardless of their true values , one can firmly conclude that in these two cases the mechanism responsible for the spectral variability operates on time scales longer than about 1  week and shorter than about 1  year . \n although this is still a rather loose constraint ( which could be improved in the future if xmm - newton will pursue similar monitoring programs sampling intermediate timescales ) , it already rules out dynamical timescales playing an important role . \n viscous instabilities in the accretion flow are a more likely candidate for the ultimate physical driver of the long - term variability . \n we are undertaking a systematic study of the x - ray variability pattern of the pg quasars using xmm - newton observations . in this paper \n we focus our attention on the variability pattern in `` naked '' quasars , whose emission across the whole xmm - newton band is due to comptonization . \n the main results can be summarized as follows :    * on short ( @xmath12hours ) timescales there is no correlation between the variability in the soft and the hard x - ray regime * variability of the comptonizing plasma physical parameters is observed when observations separated by more than 1 week ( and less than 1 year ) are compared", "StartTimeOffset": 2637424715670, "RequestID": "ddc04820ba638af76a1fcbec1db18996f0b80c1e", "TotalTokens": 1577}

rodr@xmath7guez - franco et al . 1999 \n ; zapata et al . \n 2005 , 2006 ) . \n at least seven optical herbig - haro objects ( hh 202 , hh269 , hh529 , hh203/204 , hh530 , hh625 , and hh 528 ) originate from this region ( bally et al . 2000 ; \n odell & doi 2003 ) . \n odell & doi ( 2003 ) suggested that all the above optical herbig - haro objects ( except hh 625 and hh 530 ) originated from a region only arcseconds across in the omc-1s region , referred to as optical outflow source ( oos ) . \n however , no ir or radio sources are found in the oos region . \n therefore the exciting sources of these herbig - haro objects remain unclear . \n thus we conducted polarimetry in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands since infrared polarization studies could indicate the illuminating / exciting sources of the infrared nebulae and the outflows ( nagata et al . \n 1983 ; hodapp 1984 ; sato et al . 1985 ; tamura et al . \n 1991 ) .    in this paper , \n we report the discovery of several infrared reflection nebulae ( irne ) . \n we also discuss the exciting source candidates of the optical herbig - haro objects in the omc-1s region . \n near infrared ( nir ) polarization images were obtained on 2005 december 26 with the nir camera sirius , a simultaneous three - color infrared imager for unbiased survey ( nagayama et al . 2003 ) and its polarimeter mounted on the irsf , 1.4 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory in sutherland , south africa . \n the image scale of the array is 0@xmath845 pixel@xmath9 , giving a field of view of @xmath10 . \n the polarimeter is composed of an achromatic ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath11 m ) waveplate rotator and a polarizer unit which are located upstream of the camera . \n more details are described elsewhere ( kandori et al . \n the polarizations were measured by stepping the half waveplate to four angular positions ( 0@xmath12 , 45@xmath12 , 22.5@xmath12 and 67.5@xmath12 ) . \n 10 dithered frames were observed per waveplate position , and we observed 9 sets for the object , giving @xmath13 frames of 10 s integration per waveplate position . \n seeing conditions were @xmath14 1@xmath85 ( fwhm ) in the @xmath0 band . \n the data were reduced in the standard manner of infrared image reduction : subtracting a dark - frame and dividing by a flat - frame . \n in addition , the data for each waveplate position ( @xmath15 ) were registered , and then combined . \n stokes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 parameters , degree of polarization ( @xmath19 ) , and position angle ( @xmath20 ) are calculated as follows ( see e.g. , tamura et al . \n @xmath21 for the region of @xmath22 of omc-1s , the polarized intensity images , and polarization vector images in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands obtained with the above calculations are shown in figure [ image](b ) and figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively . \n the entire field ( @xmath10 ) of the data is discussed elsewhere ( tamura et al . \n figures [ image](a ) and ( b ) show how the total intensity and polarization images differ from each other . both figures [ image](a ) and ( b ) are color - composite images in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 & @xmath2 bands ( @xmath0 : blue , @xmath1 : green , @xmath2 : red ) which are constructed with the calculations in @xmath23 . in figure [ image](b ) \n , there are several nebulae in the yellow box region , which are much more clearly seen than in figure [ image](a ) . \n this is because they are obscured by a diffuse nebula in the intensity image . \n we identify them as irne and refer to them as irn 1 to 6 as shown in figure [ hh ] . \n figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show polarization vector images superposed on the intensity image in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands in a yellow box region in figure [ image](b ) , respectively . in figures [ vector](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , the polarization vectors show different centrosymmetric patterns suggesting that irn 1 & 2 , irn 3 , 4 , & 5 , and irn 6 are illuminated by three independent sources . in order to identify these sources \n , we plotted the nir ( 3.6 @xmath11 m ) , mir ( 8.8 , 11.7 , and 18.75 @xmath11 m ) and radio ( co 2 @xmath24 1 ) sources in figure [ vector](d ) . \n we refer to these sources as marked in figure [ vector](d ) , e.g. source 144 - 351 . \n the nir , mir , and radio sources are detected by the _ \n spitzer space telescope _ , smith et al . \n ( 2004 ) , and zapata et al . \n ( 2005 ) , respectively . \n in addition , we plotted the vectors in the @xmath2 band rotated by 90@xmath12 in figure [ vector](d ) , since the direction normal to each polarization vector indicates the source of illumination . \n the convergence of these lines show that source 144 - 351 , source 145 - 356 , and source 136 - 355 are most likely to be the sources of illumination for irn 1 & 2 , irn 3 , 4 , & 5 , and irn 6 , respectively . \n since diffuse radiation from the trapezium cluster is not negligible in the @xmath0 & @xmath1 bands ( tamura et al . \n 2006 ) , we only use the vectors in the @xmath2 band in order to identify the source of illumination . \n we consider that these irne correspond to the walls of the outflow material , since a close relationship has been suggested between irn and co bipolar outflow ( nagata et al . \n 1983 ; hodapp 1984 ; sato et al . \n 1985 ; yamashita et al . 1989 ) . \n the relationship is that these outflows are or were powerful enough to open a cavity within their parent molecular cloud , in a direction that tends to be perpendicular to the optically thick circumstellar disk , allowing radiation from the star to escape along the polar directions , and then be scattered off dust grains associated with a bipolar outflow . \n indeed , viewed at low spatial resolution , the extension of irn tends to be consistent with that of co outflow .    based on this interpretation , a suggested geometry of each outflow and associated irn \n is depicted in figure [ vector](d ) ; the blue and red cones means blueshifted and redshifted outflows , respectively . \n irn 6 associated with source 136 - 355 has a clear mono - pole structure , which means that irn 6 corresponds to a blueshifted outflow . \n the redshifted counterpart irn is probably obscured and invisible . \n other examples of such mono - polar irne are r mon ( aspin et al . \n 1985 ) , cep a ( jones et at . \n 2004 ) , and gl 2591 ( minchin et al . 1991 ) . \n irn 3 & irn 4 have a bipolar structure extending north - west to south - east ; we suggest that irn 3 corresponds to a blueshifted outflow and irn 4 corresponds to a redshifted outflow . \n this is because irn 3 is detected in all of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , & @xmath2 bands , while irn 4 is only in the @xmath2 band , which suggests a heavier extinction toward irn 4 . \n similarly , we consider that irn 1 and irn 2 have a likely bipolar structure extending east to west ; we suggest a blueshifted outflow component in irn 2 and a redshifted outflow component probably in irn 1 . \n this is because irn 1 is redder than irn 2 in figure [ image](b ) . \n in addition , the small region of irn 5 seems to be associated with a local high density region . \n table [ degree ] summarizes the measured maximum degrees of polarization in irn 1 to 6 . subtracting the local background polarization , which is determined at ( @xmath2510@xmath26 , 10@xmath26 ) in figures 2 , produced larger degrees of polarization in the irne . \n however , this had little effect on the geometry of the centrosymmetric polarization patterns . \n this is most likely to be due to the contribution of unpolarized ionized gas emission in the background diffuse radiation . \n although the apparent polarization of these irne is small ( a few % ) , the level of degrees of polarization after the background subtraction is comparable to that of other irne such as gl 2591 ( @xmath27 in the @xmath28 band ; minchin et al . \n 1991 ) . \n .maximum degrees of polarization in the @xmath29 bands . \n the values in the parenthesis are after the background subtraction .

( \n 2005 ) conducted high resolution ( @xmath39 ) co line observations , and reported a blueshifted co outflow emanated from source 136 - 360 at pa @xmath40 . hence source 136 - 360 is a likely source of hh 625 . \n unfortunately , we were unable to detected any irne associated with source 136 - 360 . \n we have conducted the polarimetric imaging of omc-1s . \n we found that there are at least six irne in this region and identified the illuminating sources of these nebulae ; irn 1 and 2 , irn 3 to 5 , and irn 6 are illuminated by the ir sources , source 144 - 351 , 145 - 356 , and 136 - 355 , respectively . in addition , from a comparison of the extension of irne and the direction of herbig - haro objects , we suggest the exciting source of the optical herbig - haro objects ; hh529 , a pair of hh202 and hh528 or hh 203/204 , hh 530 and hh269 are originated from source 144 - 351 , 145 - 356 , and 136 - 355 , respectively . \n table [ summary ] summarizes the illuminating sources of irne and the driving sources of herbig - haro objects . \n further high spatial resolution co observations should be undertaken for revealing the kinematics of outflows in omc-1s . \n we are very grateful to the referee , jhon bally , for helpful suggestions . \n we also thank robert odell for useful comments . \n this work was partly supported by mext japan , grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas , and no .", "StartTimeOffset": 2641667048874, "RequestID": "2bab5548a444f4d0b0a4958deb3f79775b6bd8c9", "TotalTokens": 3792}

density ] ) . \n this procedure has the shortcoming of having a non electromagnetic element , the relativistic particle , introduced in the discussion . \n a more enlighting treatment of the subject is the one presented for example in ref.@xcite . \n there , the interaction of electromagnetic wave packets coming from vacuum with electric currents in a non ideal conductor are considered . \n the impulse transferred to the currents is computed and showed to be consistent with ( [ momentum - density ] ) and ( [ deltap ] ) . in this paper we show that this same idea can also be applied to the propagation of light in matter . \n as we already commented , what happens with momentum inside matter is still not completely clear from the theoretical point of view . for the energy , \n poynting @xcite proposed that eq.([poynting - eq ] ) remains valid with @xmath15 and @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the free current density , @xmath18 is the electric displacement and @xmath19 is the magnetizing field . \n it may be shown that eq.([poynting - eq ] ) is consistent with maxwell s equations only for materials with linear polarizations , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n in particular it holds for a material with permittivity @xmath22 and permeability @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25\\mathbf{b}$ ] , but it also holds in the more general situation of a non - isotropic material . \n poynting s density is the vacuum energy density @xmath7 plus terms that depend on the polarization @xmath26 and the magnetization @xmath27 , @xmath28 the electric term corresponds to the energy density of deformation of matter as it develops electric dipole moments . \n the magnetic term is the work density made on microscopic currents by the induced electric field . \n the work done on electric and magnetic moments is already included in poynting s energy density , that is the reason why in the right hand side of equation ( [ poynting - eq ] ) only the power of the free current density appears . in other words , for an electromagnetic wave in a material medium , poynting s expression corresponds to the energy density of the whole wave , including the change of energy of matter as the wave propagates in the medium .    for the momentum density of the fields in matter \n the situation is less clear . \n there is a dispute that has lasted more than a century @xcite on the subject . \n minkowski @xcite proposed @xmath29 which for individual photons corresponds to using ( [ particle - momentum - ultra ] ) replacing @xmath30 by the speed of light in matter @xmath31 . \n this was challenged by abraham @xcite who proposed instead @xmath32 which for photons corresponds to using directly ( [ particle - momentum ] ) .    to shed some light on this issue , \n in this paper we study a simple example that can be solved exactly . \n it consists of a packet of plane waves propagating in a material with permeability @xmath23 and permittivity @xmath22 . \n the medium being homogeneous there is no refraction and the wave travels conserving momentum and energy . inside the material there is a flat thin film of conducting material in which ohm s law holds , @xmath33 . \n when the wave packet falls on the film it splits in reflected and transmitted packets , whose amplitudes are fixed by the boundary conditions ( see figure [ [ paquetes ] ] ) . the total work done on the currents in the conducting film can be calculated using ( [ power - density ] ) . \n the result is consistent with poynting s energy density ( [ poynting - density ] ) . \n also , the impulse on the currents of the film can be calculated using ( [ force - density ] ) . \n we found that the result is consistent with momentum conservation only if the momentum carried by the waves is given by minkowski s expression ( [ minkowski ] ) . \n consider a medium with electric and magnetic permeabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 filling the space . at the plane @xmath34 there is a sheet of thickness @xmath35 made of a conductive material of resistivity @xmath36 . a packet of electromagnetic plane waves polarized in the direction @xmath37 is traveling in the @xmath38 direction . \n suppose it has a spatial length @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 a time scale , and a wave length @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in terms of a suitable function @xmath45 which vanishes outside the interval @xmath46 $ ] \n the incident wave is , @xmath47 the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath34 @xmath50 is continuous , @xmath51 implying @xmath52        there is an electrical current in the sheet . \n the magnetic field is discontinuous at @xmath34 . \n taking a rectangular path of length @xmath53 in the @xmath54 direction and width @xmath35 in the @xmath38 direction we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the plane surface with boundary @xmath57 ( see figure [ [ camino ] ] ) . the second integral vanishes because the width of the surface is negligible . \n the current density is @xmath58 substituting this in the previous equation we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 introducing @xmath61 and solving the system we have , @xmath62 the energy of the wave is given by poynting s expression @xmath63 for @xmath64 we consider a cylindrical piece of the incident packet with axis parallel to @xmath38 and cross section @xmath65 . \n the energy is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 the energies of the reflected and transmitted waves are , @xmath69 ^ 2u_1\\ , \\\\ \n u_3&=&\\epsilon e_3 ^ 2 a v \\bar{t}=\\left[\\frac{1}{1+b}\\right]^2u_1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the power density on the current is @xmath70 the total power transferred by the wave is , @xmath71 and the work on the current is @xmath72 ^ 2}u_1\\ .\\ ] ] the energy is conserved @xmath73 let us now discuss momentum conservation for this system . \n we compute first the force applied on the sheet . \n the force density on the current is @xmath74 in the approximation where @xmath35 is infinitesimal , the current density in the sheet , @xmath75 , is constant because the electric field is continuous . \n the magnetic field then varies linearly between its values at both sides of the sheet . in computing the total force one \n has to take the average on the sheet volume . \n for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{h(t)}{v}e_1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this in ( [ force ] ) and using ( [ currentdensity ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) we get \n @xmath79 the impulse applied to the current sheet is @xmath80    the momentum carried by the wave is directed in the same direction in which the wave propagates , that is , the direction of @xmath81 . \n the momentum density of the wave may be written in the form , @xmath82 with @xmath83 a constant to be determined . \n for @xmath84 the momentum density is minkowski s and for @xmath85 it is abraham s . \n then , the momentum carried by the incident wave is @xmath86 analogously @xmath87 for the balance equation we get , @xmath88 momentum is conserved if @xmath84 . the momentum density \n ( [ momden ] ) turns out to be minkowski s expression , @xmath89    the key in the previous argument is the factor @xmath90 that appears in the impulse ( [ applimp ] ) . \n this can be traced back to the magnetic force in lorentz s force ( [ force - density ] ) and the relationship between the magnetic and electric amplitudes in electromagentic waves . \n this relation is a consequence of maxwell s equations . for obtaining abraham s result the factor \n should have been @xmath91 . \n the calculation presented in this paper assumes the validity of maxwell s equations and lorentz s force density on the conduction current . using the properties of the electromagnetic wave solutions of maxwell s equations in a simple setup we showed that momentum conservation requires the use of minkowski s expression for the momentum density of the electromagnetic field in a linear medium . \n although the use of the explicit solution of maxwell equations with boundary conditions puts our approach a little ahead of most introductory physics university courses it is still a very simple and elementary construction which allows the discussion of electromagnetic momentum in material media in a self - consistent way . in particular \n it also may be used to treat the case when the wave propagates in the vacuum . \n long d.  j.  griffiths , am . \n 80 , 7 ( 2012 ) . \n d.  halliday , r.  resnik and j.  walker,_fundamentals of physics _ , 10th edition , john wiley and sons , new york , 2014 , p. 983 . \n h.  d.  young and r.  a.  freedman , _ sears and zemansky s university physics _ \n , 13th edition , addison -

{"ContextTokens": 3864, "GeneratedTokens": 159, "SynthesizedBody": "the axial coupling constant @xmath0 of the nucleon has been studied theoretically as well as experimentally for many years . \n it can be defined as the value of the axial form factor of the nucleon at vanishing 4-momentum transfer . \n more explicitly , one considers the isovector axial current @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the up and down quark fields , respectively . \n we work in the limit of exact isospin invariance , i.e.  @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks are assumed to be degenerate in mass . \n the proton matrix element of this current has the form factor decomposition @xmath4 u ( p , s ) \\ , . \n \\label{ff}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 denotes the 4-momentum transfer and @xmath6 is the proton spinor for momentum @xmath7 and spin vector @xmath8 . \n the states are normalized according to @xmath9 , we take @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the nucleon mass . \n so @xmath12 is determined by the forward matrix element @xmath13    in parton model language , the forward matrix elements of the axial current are related to the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quarks . denoting by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) the contribution of the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) quarks , one has @xmath16 and similarly for the @xmath3 quarks . \n thus we can write @xmath17 \n .    in this paper we report on new results for @xmath0 obtained by means of monte carlo simulations of lattice qcd with two dynamical quark flavors . while eq . \n ( [ gadef ] ) lends itself immediately to an evaluation on the lattice , it is not yet possible to perform the simulations at physical quark masses . \n moreover , the size of the lattice is necessarily finite and in practice not very large . \n thus , apart from the unavoidable continuum extrapolation , we have to cope with the thermodynamic limit and the extrapolation to small ( physical ) quark masses , the so - called chiral extrapolation . \n guidance for these extrapolations is provided by chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) .    in its standard form \n , cheft describes low - energy qcd by means of an effective field theory based on pion , nucleon ,  fields taking into account the constraints imposed by ( spontaneously broken ) chiral symmetry . as long as one stays in the @xmath7-regime of cheft \n ( with appropriate boundary conditions ) , the lagrangian does not depend on the volume . \n so besides the quark - mass dependence the very same lagrangian governs also the volume dependence , and finite size effects can be calculated by evaluating the theory in a finite ( spatial ) volume . \n thus the finite volume does not introduce any new parameters and the study of the finite size effects yields an additional handle on the coupling constants of cheft . \n there are several ways to treat baryons in cheft . here \n we apply the ( non - relativistic ) small scale expansion ( sse )  @xcite , which uses explicit pion , nucleon and @xmath18(1232 ) degrees of freedom , and extend the previous calculations of the quark - mass dependence of @xmath0  @xcite in this scheme to finite volume . \n the dependence on the lattice spacing @xmath19 could be included  @xcite ( for a review see ref . \n @xcite ) , but we shall not consider this possibility here .    a somewhat more phenomenological approach to the chiral extrapolation of @xmath0 ( and other nucleon matrix elements ) has been developed in ref . \n the volume dependence of such matrix elements has also been studied by several methods  @xcite and we shall compare our procedure in some detail with that of beane and savage  @xcite . \n preliminary results of our investigation have been presented in refs . \n the qcdsf and ukqcd collaborations have generated ensembles of gauge field configurations using @xmath20 non -

{"ContextTokens": 1626, "GeneratedTokens": 97, "SynthesizedBody": "the galaxy ngc 4550 , an e7/s0 lenticular galaxy in the virgo cluster , was discovered by rubin et al . \n ( 1992 ) to be a galaxy consisting of two coeval , coplanar , and counter - rotating stellar disks . \n many other cases of counter - rotation are now known in ellipticals and also in spirals , but what makes the case of ngc 4550 particular ( kuijken , fisher , & merrifield 1996 ) is that the mass ratio of the counter - rotating disks is nearly @xmath0 . in the case of ellipticals counter - rotation \n is so frequent ( e.g.  schweizer 1998 ) that the merger or accretion origins seem the most likely explanations for such kinematic misalignments . \n the difficulty with a merger scenario for ngc 4550 is that strong disk mergers usually lead to ellipticals and the destruction of the disks , a `` truth '' often believed to be general since the seminal paper of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) . \n thakar & ryden ( 1996 ) have shown that over several gyr a series of well correlated small _ gaseous _ merger events can lead to a massive counter - rotating gaseous disk . \n but then this scenario requires to preserve special correlations over several gyr , contrary to a single event . \n thus , it remains open whether a single merger of two equal mass spirals can result in some circumstances to a galaxy like ngc 4550 .    in a forthcoming paper ( pfenniger & puerari 1998 ) we will present in more details the general conditions leading to moderate heating . \n in addition to mass and energy , one must also consider the angular momentum in the final budget . \n an input of specific angular momentum tends to cool the system , while inputs of specific energy and mass tend to heat it . \n since ngc 4550 is a rare object , a generic process is not required ; exceptional conditions can be acceptable and should be expected . \n after various considerations we have retained : * 1 . * a nearly circular orbit of the initial disks , supposing that the excess energy of galaxies coming from infinity has already been absorbed by some outer matter . \n * initial disks with opposite spins ( see fig.1 ) . \n counter - rotating disks are ideal for minimizing shocks in outer gaseous disks . also the retrograde disk is less affected by tidal interactions . \n nearly or exactly coplanar disks in the orbital plane . \n this may look a rather improbable situation , but a favorable factor to align the disk spins is to have initially flattened dark matter ( the torques on misaligned disks is then high ) . \n several arguments , such as the high frequency of warped outer hi disks with straight line of nodes , do suggest flattened dark mass distributions in spirals ( see pfenniger & combes 1994 ) . \n the simulations presented here were run in geneva . \n independently , puerari run similar simulations in mexico . \n we intend to publish jointly both sets of simulations since they lead to the same conclusions despite different choices of initial parameters . in particular puerari s simulations include round massive halos , showing that the shape of the halos does not change the qualitative results , and his disks start on more elongated orbits .    in view of the poor understanding of gaseous processes in galaxies leading to exaggerate viscosity with the sph technique ( see thakar & ryden 1996 ) , we simulate first only the collisionless gravity part . \n obviously the resulting heating is enhanced with respect to simulations including gas . \n our two initial disks are identical , except for the initial coordinates . \n they consist of a bulge , with a scale - length of 1kpc , an exponential disk with horizontal and vertical scale - lengths of 3 and 0.5kpc , and a flaring ( @xmath1 ) massive `` dark '' disk with a constant surface density up to 10kpc , decreasing as @xmath2 between 10 and 30kpc , and as @xmath3 between 30 and 60kpc \n . the mass ratios of the three components are respectively ( 0.25:1:5 ) , and the particle masses are all equal . the particle velocities are found by solving the jeans equation for each component in the total potential , assuming velocity dispersions ellipsoids parallel to cylindrical coordinates . \n the potential of the mass distribution is calculated with a set of @xmath4 particles on the geneva pm polar grid code .    a rapid run of coplanar counter - rotating disks merger is performed with the pm code with @xmath5 particles . \n the result is positive but not fully convincing since during the merging process substantial changes of positions of the mass distribution occur within the grid , which has a position dependent resolution . \n therefore , we select out a subset of @xmath6 particles , the mass of which is multiplied by a factor 20 to keep the same total mass \n . the particle subset is then run with the barnes - hut ( 1989 ) treecode ( with an opening angle of @xmath7=0.5 ) , which does not imply any geometrical assumptions . in several experiments we verify that slight initial disk inclinations with the orbital plane ( 5@xmath8 ) \n still lead to counter - rotating coplanar disks . \n here we just describe the strictly coplanar disk merger . \n 1 , left , shows the initial particle distribution with the senses of rotation . \n the disks are on a prograde near circular orbit . \n the tidal perturbation creates immediately ( at @xmath9200myr ) a bar in each disks , persisting until the disks merge . \n the merging process conserves the disks fairly well , the less damaged one being the retrograde one . \n fig .  1 , \n middle , shows the inner remnant disk at @xmath10=1500myr , still containing 80% of the initial total mass , almost circular and barless . \n fig .  1 , right , shows the large - scale particle distribution , at @xmath10=1500myr . \n the excess angular momentum is transported by 10 - 20% of the mass , mostly of the prograde disk , to large distances , 100500kpc . \n fig .  2 shows how the average line profiles as seen in the edge - on disks change from unimodal to bimodal . \n the bimodal distribution is crucial in order to distinguish counter - rotating disks from a hot population with a zero net rotation \n . the ratios of final to initial velocity dispersion amount to @xmath92.4 in the radial direction , and @xmath92 in the vertical direction . \n the final mass distribution follows well a @xmath11 profile . with a relatively limited heating the final disk resembles both in shape and kinematics a typical s0/e7 galaxy , with \n , in addition , marked counter - rotating populations .    at some moments during the merging process the system as seen edge - on looks like a single galaxy but with two bulges \n such a case of `` two - bulge '' looking galaxy is pgc 57064 in the hercules cluster . \n we have shown that counter - rotating co - spatial disks can be made by a single spiral - spiral merger . \n the required initial conditions are somewhat peculiar , but favored if the dark matter distribution is flat ; however , this is not a necessary condition . \n the strong reaction of the disks , expelling 1020% of the mass to 100500kpc , means that dark matter in such systems must be distributed in a pronounced asymmetric way for several gyr . \n thus , in many spirals the outer ( dark ) mass distribution should still be chaotic .", "StartTimeOffset": 2659875023502, "RequestID": "351e8a80c48e3454b0b67136ad92c930fc6e90dd", "TotalTokens": 1723}
{"ContextTokens": 3552, "GeneratedTokens": 131, "SynthesizedBody": "the theoretical treatment of time observables is one of the important loose ends of quantum theory . among them \n the time of arrival ( toa ) has received much attention lately @xcite , for earlier reviews see @xcite . \n a major challenge is to find the connection between _ ideal _ toa distributions , defined for the particle in isolation , formally independent of the measurement method , and _ operational _ ones , explicitly dependent on specific measurement models and procedures . \n it is important to know , for example , what exactly a given operational procedure is measuring , or if and how a given ideal quantity may or may not be obtained with a particular experiment . \n modern research on the quantum toa owes much to the seminal work by allcock @xcite . looking for an ideal quantum arrival - time concept \n , he considered that arrival - time measuring devices should rapidly transfer any probability that appears at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the `` arrival position '' ) from the incident channel into various orthogonal and time - labeled measurement channels . \n as a simple model to realize this basic feature he proposed a pulsed , periodic removal , at time intervals @xmath2 , of the wave function for @xmath0 , while the @xmath3 region would not be affected , see fig . \n a similar particle removal would provide the distribution of first arrivals for an ensemble of classical , freely - moving particles as @xmath4 . \n the difficulties to solve the corresponding mathematical problem lead allcock to study instead a different , continuous model with an absorbing imaginary potential in the right half - line , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , to simulate the detection . \n he argued that the two models should lead to similar conclusions with a time resolution of the order @xmath2 in the chopping model or @xmath7 in the complex potential model . \n he then solved the schrdinger equation with the complex potential and noticed that for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a maximum relevant energy in the wave packet ,     at times @xmath10 , @xmath11 separated by @xmath2 . \n figures ( a ) and ( b ) represent two instants immediately before and after the elimination of norm at @xmath0 . \n [ f0],width=226 ]    the apparatus response vanishes , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , because of quantum mechanical reflection . \n this is one of the first discussions of the quantum zeno effect , although it was not known by this name at that time . \n eight years later misra and sudarshan @xcite generalized this result studying the passage of a system from one predetermined subspace to its orthogonal subspace : the periodic projection method in the limit @xmath4 was presented as a natural way to model a continuous measurement , however it did not lead to a time distribution of the passage but to its suppression @xcite . \n this lack of a `` trustworthy algorithm '' to compute toa and related distributions prompted them to put in doubt the completeness of quantum theory and has been much debated since then , see @xcite for review . \n for the specific case of a projection onto a region of space , as in the toa procedure proposed by allcock , several works have later emphasized that , in the limit of infinitely frequent measurements , the resulting `` zeno dynamics '' in the original subspace corresponds to hard wall ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions @xcite . \n allcock discarded the short @xmath2 ( or high @xmath14 ) limit as useless , and examined the other limit where the measurement may be expected to be @xmath14-independent , @xmath15 , later on . \n we shall not treat this limit hereafter but , for completeness , let us briefly recall that he got the current density @xmath16 by deconvolution of the absorbed norm with the apparatus response function , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the wavenumber and position operators , @xmath20 is the mass , and the average is computed with the freely moving wave function @xmath21 . \n this result makes sense classically , but in quantum mechanics @xmath16 is not positive semidefinite even for states composed only by positive momenta @xcite . \n he also got , within some approximation , a positive distribution , @xmath22 , which has been later known as `` kijowski s distribution '' @xcite , @xmath23 in this paper , instead of disregarding the zeno limit because of reflection , as it is customary , we shall look at the small amount of norm @xmath24 detected , i.e. , eliminated in the projection process , and normalize , [ pizeno ] _ \n zeno=_t0 . in this manner \n , a rather simple ideal quantity will emerge : there is , in other words , interesting physical information hidden behind the zeno effect , which can be disclosed by normalization . to fulfill this program \n we shall put the parallelism hinted by allcock between the pulsed measurement and the continuous measurement on a firmer , more quantitative basis . \n we shall now define formally the pulsed and continuous measurement models mentioned above and also an intermediate auxiliary model @xcite that will be a useful bridge between the two . \n @xcite is followed initially although the analysis and conclusions will be quite different . \n the `` chopping process '' amounts to a periodic projection of the wave function onto the @xmath3 region at instants separated by a time interval @xmath2 . \n there is nothing here beyond standard measurement theory @xcite . \n each chopping step eliminates interference terms in the density operator between right and left components , and the right component is separated from the ensamble ( detected ) so that it can not come back to the left . \n the wave functions immediately after and before the projection at the instant @xmath10 , are related by @xmath25 the wave at @xmath0 may also be canceled with a `` kicked '' imaginary potential @xmath26 where the subscript `` k '' stands for `` kicked '' and @xmath27 , = -i_i =- iv_0 ( ) , [ v ] provided [ v0 t ] v_0 t . \n the general ( and exact ) evolution operator is obtained by repetition of the basic unit [ ue ] _ \n k(0,t)= e^-i _ 0t / e^-it/ , where @xmath28 . for the continuous model , the evolution under the imaginary potential ( [ v ] ) is given by [ uot ] ( 0,t)&= & e^-i(_0+)t/=e^-i_0t/ e^-it/ + & + & o(t^2[,_0]/^2 ) . \n [ condi ] comparing with eq . \n ( [ ue ] ) we see that the kicked and continuous models agree when t^2||/^2 1 . \n [ kc ] at first sight a large @xmath29 , see eq . \n ( [ v0 t ] ) , seems to be incompatible with this condition so that the three models would not agree @xcite . \n in fact the numerical calculations give a different result and show a better and better agreement between the continuous and pulsed models as @xmath30 when @xmath2 and @xmath14 are linked by some predetermined ( large ) constant @xmath31 , @xmath32     ( normalized ) for the projection method and the continuous ( complex potential ) model . \n the initial state is a minimum uncertainty product gaussian for @xmath33na atoms centered at @xmath34 m with

center - of - mass motion of a single caesium atom that become separately minimal uncertainty packets ( with @xmath42 m , and average velocities @xmath43 cm / s , @xmath44 cm / s ) at @xmath1 and

[ f2],height=234 ]     with increasing @xmath14 versus time for the same initial wave function as in fig . 2 ( @xmath33na atoms . ) \n @xmath46 is the initial kinetic energy . \n [ f3],height=234 ]    figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] illustrate this agreement : in fig . \n [ f1 ] ( inset ) the average absorption time , @xmath47 $ ] , is shown versus @xmath2 and @xmath48 for a gaussian wave packet sent from the left towards the origin . \n the main figure shows the time averages versus @xmath2 ( chopping ) and @xmath7 ( continuous ) . \n the lines bend at high coupling because of reflection . the normalized absorption distribution as @xmath30 was derived in @xcite by making explicit use of the known stationary scattering wave - functions , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial average momentum . \n [ f2 ] shows for a more challenging state , a combination of two gaussians , that this ideal distribution becomes indistinguable from the normalized chopping distribution when @xmath2 is small enough . \n even the minor details are reproduced , and differ from @xmath51 and @xmath52 , also shown .    to understand the compatibility `` miracle '' of the inequalities ( [ v0 t ] ) and ( [ kc ] ) \n , we apply the robertson - schrdinger ( generalized uncertainty principle ) relation , ||2 |v_i| h_0 , where @xmath53 denotes the standard deviation . since @xmath54 is rigorously bounded at all times by @xmath55 , is the norm in @xmath0 , @xmath56 which is maximal at @xmath57 . ] \n imposing @xmath58 with @xmath59 , a sufficient condition for dynamical agreement among the models is v_0h_0 . \n [ condi3 ] for large @xmath14 the packet is basically reflected by the wall so that @xmath60 tends to retain its initial value and eq . \n ( [ condi3 ] ) will be satisfied during the whole propagation . fig . \n [ f3 ] shows the ratio @xmath61 for three values of @xmath14 as a function of time . \n this implies in summary that @xmath62 , eq . \n ( [ pz ] ) , a very remarkable result , which illustrates that an active intervention on the system dynamics may after all provide an ideal quantity defined for the system in isolation . \n so far we have discussed the limits @xmath63 in order to find the corresponding time distribution . \n in fact a very simple argument relates the pulsed and continuous measurements _ approximately _ for finite , non - zero values of @xmath2 and @xmath64 , when they are sufficiently large to make reflection negligible : the average detection time is delayed with respect to the ideal limit corresponding to @xmath38 as tt_zeno+t/2t_zeno+ , see fig . \n [ f1 ] , since , once a particle is in @xmath0 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are precisely the average life times in the continuous and discrete measuring models , respectively . for optimized straight lines . \n reflection at small @xmath2 ( or high @xmath14 ) favors the detection of faster particles and bends the @xmath67 lines towards shorter times , as in fig . \n ] this suggests an approximate agreement between projection and continuous dynamics provided that the relation @xmath68 is satisfied . for large @xmath14 , this is asymptotically not in contradiction with the requirement of a large @xmath31 since @xmath69 as @xmath70 ; in any case quantum reflection breaks down the linear dependence , see fig . \n [ f1 ] . \n a similar relation between pulsed and continuous measurements was described by schulman @xcite and has been tested experimentally @xcite . \n the simplest model in @xcite may be reinterpreted as a two - level atom in a resonant laser field , with the excited state decaying away from the 2-level subspace at a rate @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 . \n the relation between pulsed and continuous measurements follows by comparing the exponential decay for the effective 2-level hamiltonian with rabi frequency @xmath73 and excited state lifetime @xmath74 , with the decay dynamics when @xmath75 and the system is projected every @xmath2 into the ground state . \n it takes the form @xcite @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( weak driving ) . in our toa model \n we have a different set of parameters but a comparison is possible by taking into account that the imaginary potential ( [ v ] ) may be physically interpreted as the effective interaction for the ground state in the weak driving regime , for a localized resonant laser excitation with subsequent decay , @xmath78 . \n this gives @xcite @xmath79 , so that @xmath68 becomes t 2 , different from schulman s relation , as it may be expected since the pulsed evolution depends on @xmath73 in schulman s model but not in our case , where it is only driven by the kinetic energy hamiltonian @xmath80 . \n the first discussions of the zeno effect , understood as the hindered passage of the system between orthogonal subspaces because of frequent instantaneous measurements , emphasized its problematic status and regarded it as a failure to simulate or define quantum passage - time distributions . \n we have shown here that in fact there is a `` bright side '' of the effect : by normalizing the little bits of norm removed at each projection step , a physical time distribution defined for the freely moving system emerges . \n ( there are other `` positive '' uses of the zeno effect , such as reduction of decoherence in quantum computing , see e.g. @xcite . ) in the case of the projection measurements to determine the toa , this distribution is given by eq . \n ( [ pz ] ) . \n this result is fundamentally different from the current density or from kijowski s toa distribution , ( operational approaches to measure them by fluorescence are described in @xcite ) and corresponds to a classical time - distribution of local kinetic energy density @xcite , rather than a classical toa distribution . \n could in principle be obtained in the zeno limit for states with positive momentum support by transforming the initial state @xmath81 , with @xmath82 a constant , as in the operator normalization technique @xcite . ] \n experimental realizations of repeated measurements will rely on projections with a finite frequency and pulse duration that provide approximations to the ideal result . \n feasible schemes may be based on pulsed localized resonant - laser excitation @xcite , or sweeping with a detuned laser @xcite . \n a challenging open question for further research is the possibility to devise alternative ( non periodic ) pulse sequences to enhance the robustness of the zeno effect in a toa measurement , similar in spirit to the ones proposed in the context of quantum information processing @xcite . \n nevertheless , the ordinary ( periodic ) sequence has successfully been applied in quantum optical realizations of the quantum zeno effect @xcite . \n the proposed normalization method may be applied to other measurements as well , i.e. not only for a toa of freely moving particles , but in general to first passages between orthogonal subspaces , and it will be interesting to find out in each case the ideal time distribution brought out by normalization . \n b. misra and e. c. g. sudarshan , j. math \n 18 * , 756 ( 1977 ) . \n d. home and a. whitaker , ann . phys . * 258 * , 237 ( 1997 ) . \n p. facchi and s. pascazio , prog . in optics \n * 42 * , 147 ( 2001 ) . \n k. koshino and a. shimizu , phys . rep . * \n 412 * , 191 ( 2005 ) . \n p. facchi , s. pascazio , a. scardicchio , and l. s. schulman , phys . \n a * 65 * , 012108 ( 2001 ) . \n e. w. streed , j. mun , m. boyd , g. k. campbell , p. medley , w. ketterle , and d. e. pritchard , phys . \n lett . * 97 * , 260402 ( 2006 ) . \n h. nazakato , t. takazawa , and k. yuasa , phys . \n lett . * 90 * , 060401 ( 2003 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2669413124238, "RequestID": "ccab5d7af6f26ea92ab06abab344b57177539b27", "TotalTokens": 3683}

perot cavity is frequency locked to the laser using an electro - optic feedback loop @xcite . \n the error signal generated by this loop is proportional to the instantaneous frequency difference between laser and cavity and its power spectrum contains the information on membrane displacements . \n the pump beam , amplitude - modulated at a given frequency , is then injected into the cavity and it exerts a known force on the membrane by reflecting off it . \n the intensity of the pump beam corresponds in our case to a net force of @xmath7 n. the presence of this force is detected as a peak in the measured spectrum of the error signal . \n the membrane behaves as a mechanical oscillator and its fundamental resonant frequency and quality factor can be directly measured with the pump beam technique . \n figure [ fig : resfreq ] shows a plot of several power spectra of the feedback loop error signal . \n the peaks indicate the presence of the calibration force , while different peaks correspond to different excitation frequencies . \n the peak with the largest amplitude occurs when the the pump beam modulation frequency matches the membrane mechanical resonance freqeuncy . \n the background level in figure [ fig : resfreq ] gives a force sensitivity of @xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath3 in terms of displacement . \n these values correspond to the thermal limit at 300 k @xcite . \n to investigate the possible presence of a signal from a beam of chameleons emitted by the sun , it is necessary to impress a time modulation on it . \n this can be done by exploiting the general chameleon property of traversing any material when impinging on it at right angles , and of reflecting off it when arriving at grazing incidence ( see @xcite for details ) . \n we have designed and built a prototype chameleon chopper ( see figure [ fig : chamchop ] ) exploiting this property . \n hz , corresponding to a chopping frequency of @xmath8 hz , as a grazing incidence surface is presented to the incoming beam 4 times each turn.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the chopper was placed in the proper position in order to intercept a hypothetical solar chameleon beam hitting the membrane at grazing incidence angles between 0 and 20 degrees , depending on the time of day . \n data were then acquired by recording 40 s long power spectra of the feedback loop error signal . \n a partial preliminary analysis of the solar data was conducted by computing for each spectrum the signal -

and phloem sap , containing water and sugar , formed in the leaves by photosynthesis , and transported in phloem ( sieve tube elements ) from the leaves to the roots . \n explanations for xylem sap transport includes the cohesion - tension theory @xcite and multiforce theories @xcite ; and the pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism for phloem sap transport @xcite . \n notwithstanding their relative merits , it is of interest to note that as saps contain ions , a net voltage may be recorded within plants . \n furthermore , as a living plant is naturally submitted to a temperature gradient between its roots and its leaves , heat may also flow from its hotter to its colder regions . \n these two facts lead to the questions of the existence and strength of a coupling between electrical current and heat flux in plants , and whether this coupling plays a significant role in the plants lives . \n answers to these questions are of importance to gain further insight into plant homeostasis , closely related to the le chatelier - braun principle in chemical thermodynamics , and to develop further the field of plant electrophysiology by analysing the impact of thermoelectric coupling on photosynthesis , plant respiration , and any other processes involving bioelectrochemical phenomena @xcite . \n biophysical processes , which include energy and matter transport in dedicated structures , are essentially nonequilibrium in nature . \n their description involves the notions of thermodynamic forces and their conjugate fluxes which , in a linear response description , are proportional to each other . in a general manner , \n transport phenomena are nonequilibrium irreversible processes@xcite : fluxes within a system result from applied external constraints , and they are accompanied by energy dissipation and entropy production . as the forces applied to a system \n derive from potentials , the description of the system s nonequilibrium properties relies on the definition of these potentials and their degree of coupling @xcite . \n thermoelectricity is sometimes mistakenly viewed as a phenomenon pertaining to solid - state systems@xcite , but this effect has also been reported in liquids@xcite and gels@xcite . \n now , considering more specifically electrical phenomena in plants , one should also account for their dependence on temperature and the local variations of this latter . as a matter of fact \n , one learns from the equilibrium thermodynamics of charged fluids that heat and electricity are fundamentally related through the gibbs - duhem relation ; so , since plants , as any other system , are subjected to the laws of thermodynamics , one may anticipate that a proper understanding of the coupled transport of heat and electricity in plants will pave the way towards the potentially rich new field of thermoelectricity - based plant energy conversion , and harvesting metabolic energy from plants @xcite . \n thermoelectricity as part of non - isothermal processes in living organisms , has already been mentioned ; but except for the case of insects like hornets and bees @xcite , for which genuine thermoeletric effects have been analysed , the other studies simply reported the record of the temperature rise of colocasia odora leaves using a thermocouple @xcite , or analysed pyroelectricity , mistakenly taken as a thermoelectricity , amongst the nonequilibrium processes at the origin of life @xcite . \n we propose here to consider bean sprouts as an illustrative case of a living plant system whose physiological properties also entail thermoelectric effects , with a particular focus on the thermovoltage response of the plant . \n while a voltage difference along the stem of a plant has already been measured and analysed @xcite , its interpretation does not account for a likely the thermoelectric origin . \n nevertheless , it is clear that the source of any voltage difference is due to concentration gradients of charges inside the plant , regardless of the cause of the gradients . \n the underlying processes may thus originate in various electrochemical processes , including acid - base and redox effects@xcite . in the present work we focus on the voltage response due to a temperature difference . \n the system is presented in fig . \n the stem and leaves are kept at constant temperature while the temperature of the roots can be modified ; the thermoelectric response is recorded on both the plant ( a ) and a control wire ( b ) . \n thermoelectricity differs from electrochemistry as the latter considers isothermal systems only . \n thermoelectric effects , on the contrary , manifest themselves in non - isothermal conditions and their thermodynamic description is best done with the coupled variables @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electrochemical potential and @xmath2 the temperature of the considered system . in a force - flux approach , as a temperature bias is applied to a conductor , both heat and charges are transported in coupled flows since each electron carries an electric charge , @xmath3 , and energy ; the thermoelectric coupling parameter or seebeck coefficient @xmath4 is thus defined as :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the spatial gradient . \n equation ( [ seebeck ] ) may be viewed as a generalization of the gibbs - duhem relation to the dynamical response of the coupled intensive variables @xmath0 by defining the thermodynamic forces acting on the system as the gradients of the thermodynamic potentials . \n each force is conjugated to a flux which is proportional to the time derivative of the corresponding extensive parameter , and it follows that forces and fluxes are linearly combined as proposed by onsager @xcite . \n note that the coefficient @xmath4 , which in eq . \n ( [ seebeck ] ) is defined locally , is also often expressed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the global difference between two distant points of the system . \n these general considerations apply for any system containing free charge carriers . as a consequence , for a given temperature difference \n , the measurement of a thermovoltage directly gives an estimation of the average ratio of charge concentrations in separate parts of the system . \n therefore , any system containing free mobile carriers may be exhibit a thermoelectric signature . \n one should note that depending on the specific properties of the considered system , this signature may intertwine or not with those of other temperature - dependent processes ; hence the need for specific system - dependent approaches to extract the thermoelectric signal . in the case of liquids and gels , \n the studies usually focus on the thermoelectrophoresis parameters @xcite . for solid state - systems , \n the conduction is ensured by mobile electrons and holes , leading to a possible steady - state electrical current . for ionic carriers , in liquids and gels , \n such a steady - state current may only take place if a redox process occurs at the ends of the system . \n the experiment aims to identify and characterize the thermoelectric response of a living plant ( a bean sprout in the present work ) . as the response of the plant necessarily entails physiologic effects , \n the measured data is compared to the purely thermoelectric response of a control wire . as depicted on fig . \n [ fig : figure1 ] , the temperature of the plant s roots is imposed by a thermostatic bath ; two thermocouples are used to measure the temperatures of the roots and the leaves , and two electrodes are placed respectively in contact with the roots and the leaves of the living plant . \n the roots are bathed in an aqueous dilute kcl solution . \n the electrodes connected to the leaves are made of ag / agcl wires . \n all the temperatures and voltages are recorded using a keithley k2700 scanning multimeter and a k182 nanovoltmeter . \n the thermoelectric control wire ( cw ) is made of two chromium - nickel - steel junctions , with a seebeck coefficient @xmath9v / k ; it is placed in the same configuration as that of the plant . \n the recorded voltage at the ends of the control wire describes a _ pure _ thermoelectric response , exempt from any influence of the physiologic process . \n ( upper left panel ) and of the plant @xmath10 ( upper right panel ) , both submitted to a time - varying temperature difference @xmath11 , reported on the lower panel . \n the magnitude of measured voltage @xmath12 has been multiplied by a factor 2000 in order to report it on the same scale as that of @xmath10 . \n the red - dotted lines indicate the average slope of the collected data . in the lower panel , \n the scale is that of the temperature difference ; the voltages are also depicted in this lower panel to see how close their time - dependent behaviour is to that of the measured temperature difference.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the voltage response of the living plant and that of the control wire to the temperature difference @xmath11 are both shown on fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] , where the time evolution of @xmath11 is also displayed , illustrating the dynamics of the plant and that of the control wire . \n these data were recorded over a period of four hours for various temperature differences and variation rates . \n the two upper panels show separately the parametric plots characterising the thermoelectric response of the control wire and that of the plant . \n notice that the response of the control wire is strictly proportional to the temperature difference , as expected for a thermoelectric material , with a _ passive _ seebeck coefficient . \n conversely , the plant exhibits a complex response , which includes the effects of its physiological processes thus giving rise to an _ active _ seebeck response . \n the curves represented on the lower panel are displayed together on the same scale to qualitatively show how the responses ( voltages @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) follow the applied constraint ( temperature difference @xmath11 ) . \n the figures on the @xmath13-axis correspond to @xmath11 in @xmath14c . \n the values taken by the voltages @xmath12 and @xmath10 may be determined from the curves using a scaling factor that corresponds to the relevant seebeck coefficient . \n the control wire shows a faithful homothetic response to the temperature difference , with a linear factor of scaling of @xmath15v / k as expected for the seebeck coefficient of the corresponding chromium - nickel - steel thermocouple . \n the response of the plant gives an average seebeck coefficient of 2.5 mv / k . \n such a large value in a solid - state material would correspond to a system with low electrical conductivity . here , this results from ion movements through xylem and phloem saps circulating in opposite directions .    to analyze precisely these data , it is convenient to split each panel of fig . \n [ fig : fig2 ] into three parts , which correspond to three distinct time domains . \n the first and third ones , figs.[fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] , respectively , describes the plant s response when its roots are heated ; while the second , fig.[fig : fig4 ] , reports the response over the cooling sequence . \n .,scaledwidth=50.0% ]            depending on the precise thermal condition supported by the plant , we can identify different thermoelectric responses . consider the first warming sequence of fig . \n [ fig : fig3 ] . \n one may identify five events ( labelled from a to e ) . during the first period ( fig . \n [ fig : fig3]a ) , the temperature difference is roughly constant . \n the plant presents a large fluctuating thermoelectric response while the control wire is characterized by a constant seebeck coefficient . during the second period , shown on fig . \n [ fig : fig3]b , the plant s reaction is essentially sensitive to the temperature variation rate @xmath16 . \n this sensitivity has already been observed in studies devoted to plant sensing @xcite . \n the processes taking place within the zones a and b can be also observed in the c and d zones ; and when the rate @xmath16 is reduced , we observe a linear response for the plant , as shown in the zone e. it thus appears clearly that the passive response , probably mostly due to the xylem properties , can be strongly modified by active physiological processes . \n this latter appears to be particularly sensitive to the time derivative of the stress , but not so much on the intensity of the stress itself ; this observation is perfectly consistent with previous findings @xcite . \n we now turn to the cooling sequence , fig . \n [ fig : fig4 ] . \n the cooling rate is approximately constant , except for the two events when it is clearly larger than the average as indicated with the labels a and b , on the upper right panel . \n these events relate to time delays , also apparent in the measured data for the control wire on the upper left panel : these are signatures of the change of rate @xmath16 . \n note that although these may serve as a probe , time delays must be considered with care , since in the case of very large time response of a system , they may lead to erroneous interpretations @xcite . \n the shape of the plant response for events taking place in the zones a and b is very similar to that of figs . \n [ fig : fig3]b and [ fig : fig3]d , which confirms the acute sensitivity of the plant to the rate @xmath16 . \n this physiological response is the fastest response to a stress that a plant can use , as it has no means to avoid it . \n the last sequence depicted on fig . \n [ fig : fig5 ] concerns the plant s response to warming at a reduced rate . \n it is essentially linear , thus confirming the presence of a threshold rate process for the plant s response to a given stress . \n it also shows unambiguously that thermoelectricity naturally partakes in the complex processes that contribute to a plant s life . \n all the effects discussed in the present work are related to the internal modifications of the ionic concentrations inside the plant , including the regulation of cellular ion transporters allowing ion release into the xylem sap toward the shoots . \n it is clear that while the response is mainly driven by a classical thermoelectric process with a giant seebeck coefficient , the physiology of the plant interferes in a complex way with it . \n a complete numerical model , including series and parallel assemblies of living ( phloem sieve tube elements , root and endodermis cells ) and dead cells ( xylem tracheids and vessels ) , will be considered for further investigation of the interplay between physiologic and thermoelectric response to a thermal stress . \n further , since there is no limitation in the number of thermodynamic potentials which may be coupled @xcite , we may account for pressure and derive a complete response of a system to the direct and the cross- effects of the three thermodynamic potentials , @xmath17 . \n then the lowering of a local pressure gradient , by the coupled effect of the temperature and the electrochemical potential becomes possible . \n this latter process may contribute to the motion of saps in plant , and especially in trees . \n the reported measurements are fully scalable from the unique cell size to a complete plant or tree . in addition to \n the stationary response observed here , the voltage fluctuations are also of great interest since they permit the study of the threshold of the physiological response through its noisy signals . \n as observed in other systems , the noise response is a very sensitive probe of the emergence of a macroscopic response @xcite . \n taking each cell as a fluctuator , the convolution of the individual responses may lead to different signatures depending on the considered scale of the sample . \n seeds of bush bean ( phaseolus vulgaris l. cv . \n contender ) were sown into pots containing vermiculite as soil . \n the bean seedlings were grown in a growth chamber at @xmath18c with a cycle of 12 hours of light ( 40 @xmath1mol photon m@xmath19 s@xmath20 ) , 12 hours of darkness . \n the plants were watered at the bottom of the pots every three days . \n the 21 days old plants were removed from the vermiculite . \n roots were carefully rinsed with water to remove vermiculite particles and then transferred in dilute kcl solution ( 120 mm ) for experiments . \n two electrodes were placed respectively at the surface of the root and the stem of the living plant . \n the electrodes connected to the stems are made of ag / agcl wires moistened with 200 mm kcl and wrapped in cellophane to provide appropriate contact with the plant surface .", "StartTimeOffset": 2692932107628, "RequestID": "9d11e39d6357f11cad3f53c3b4ee6b26f1f59cd9", "TotalTokens": 3703}

to - tail . in this case , the inter - molecule interactions are always repulsive . \n note that we assume we can create a single isolated plane of dipoles , so there is no possibility to form superfluid pairing between planes , where the interactions are attractive again  @xcite . \n we assume the dipolar molecules are loaded onto a single square optical lattice with the molecules fully polarized perpendicular to the plane . \n since the @xmath2-@xmath3 molecules can be prepared in their lowest hyperfine nuclear spin state , the internal spin degree of freedom is effectively frozen out , and the molecules can be described as spinless fermions . \n previous studies of spinless fermion models  @xcite mostly focused on short range interactions and used the simplification of going to the limit of large spatial dimensions . \n these works show a rich phase diagram with charge - density - wave ordering and phase separation . \n there also has been some work in two dimensions focused on stripe physics  @xcite . \n more recent work , carried out in the context of ultracold dipolar molecules  @xcite , focused primarily on finding new exotic phases ( liquid crystal , smectic , or nematic ) , often achieved by tuning the direction of the external field with respect to the plane of molecules , but has not elucidated the details of the full phase diagram for the density - wave phases . \n the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec . \n [ sec : formalism ] we introduce the model and describe the possible density - wave orderings . \n [ sec : method ] provides the details of the mean - field - theory formalism and the numerical calculations . \n the results are presented in sec . \n [ sec : results ] , and they are further discussed in sec . \n [ sec : discuss ] , which are followed by the conclusions in sec . \n [ sec : conclude ] . \n we describe the rovibrational ground - state dipolar molecules in their lowest hyperfine state with the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator for a fermionic dipolar molecule at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the number operator , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude between the adjacent sites , and @xmath9 is the long - range dipole interaction , with @xmath10 the position vector for the site @xmath11 . the lattice spacing is taken to be equal to one . with this model \n , we have assumed that the hopping occurs only between nearest - neighbor sites , and that the molecules are always in the lowest level of the periodic optical lattice potential ( this second assumption is not always true when the interaction between the molecules is too large ) . \n we have also assumed that the form for the dipole interaction is valid even when the distance between molecules is only one lattice spacing .    due to the bipartite nature of the square lattice , \n the hamiltonian can be rewritten in a particle - hole symmetric form and one can restrict to fillings that satisfy @xmath12 . \n since there is no spin degree of freedom in this model , it can only support molecule density wave spatial order . \n such order is described by its unit cell  a parallelogram spanned by the two fundamental translation vectors for a given density wave order . \n the area of the unit cell ( @xmath13 ) gives the number of sites with independent average molecule density which is modulated periodically as the unit cell is tiled across the lattice . \n the number of the independent order parameters for this density wave is equal to @xmath14 ( the average density , or filling , is not counted as an order parameter , and is fixed in the calculation ) . \n since there is only a finite number of non - equivalent unit cells of a given area on a square lattice , there is only a finite number of possible density wave orders . \n we have considered all such orders that have up to four different order parameters ( @xmath15 ) and hence this is a restricted phase diagram restricted to low - period phases only . \n the corresponding fundamental translation vectors and the unit cells for the twelve candidate phases are shown in fig .  [ \n tab : clusters ] . \n m1.6 in m1.6 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     & & 0.1 +    another , less direct way to observe spatial order is time - of - flight measurements that use the expansion of the molecular cloud to infer the initial momentum distribution of the molecules . \n however , the momentum distribution data do not show prominent differences amongst the different ordered phases , so using this approach to detect the ordering is difficult . \n the mft results show a diverse phase diagram with a number of distinct density - wave phases . \n however , the mft is an approximate method , which neglects fluctuations and favors ordered states . \n this brings to mind the question : _ how many of these density - wave phases are actually present in the exact solution _ ?    in the limit @xmath16 , the hamiltonian essentially describes a lattice gas model and can be solved numerically without approximation using classical monte carlo methods . \n preliminary results support the existence of the checkerboard ( 2b ) and 4d phases , although strongly suppressed in temperature and filling , compared to the mft result . \n since the mft neglects fluctuations , it is not surprising that the range of ordered phases is contracted in a more precise calculation . \n however , some higher - period phases become more prominent in the mft solution for intermediate values of @xmath17 , so their presence can not be entirely ruled out by this @xmath16 study \n . a more complete study will be the topic of further research . \n also , the phase separation needs to be reviewed using better approximation techniques . \n the presence of phase separation is tied to the existence of higher - period phases and the fact that the mft strongly stabilizes these phases at the corresponding commensurate fillings . \n thus , phase separation is promoted by the mft just like the corresponding ordered phases are . \n it is possible that including even higher order phases ( beyond 4 order parameters ) in a mft study would replace the phase - separated regions with higher - period ordered phases that are commensurate at the corresponding values of filling , yielding a devil s staircase - like structure . \n another possible alternative to phase separation is the formation of a wigner crystal like state . \n the reentrant behavior of the checkerboard phase at @xmath18 in the mft results is very likely an artifact of this method and should be reexamined using more precise techniques . \n it is notable that the mft results do not favor stripes that are aligned with the lattice ( corresponding to phases 2a , 3a , 4a or 5a ) . \n we found that these phases are either not stable or they are replaced by other phases with lower free energy . for small @xmath17 , good nesting of the fermi surface appears to be important to lower the energy of the system , while for large @xmath17 , strong repulsive interactions between adjacent sites prevents formation of such striped phases . \n we also see no evidence for any nematic or smectic `` liquid - crystal '' phases . \n another important question is , _ which of these density - wave phases can be reached and detected in experiment _ ? \n the mft results show large entropy per particle when the checkerboard state develops at half filling for large interaction , but unfortunately the entropy is severely overestimated in this study , as shown by preliminary monte - carlo results . \n the most easily observable features in experiment are the structure factors and the gap in the density of states at the commensurate values of filling . \n these features are most pronounced for the checkerboard phase . in a trap environment \n , a large gap at half filling should translate into large spatial regions of checkerboard order if the local density approximation is accurate . \n of course , it is not clear if phases that are seen in a homogeneous system are stabilized or destabilized by the trap environment . \n this is another question to be addressed in a future study . \n we have studied the ordering of ultracold diatomic gases on a two - dimensional square optical lattice . we have formulated a model , based on spinless fermions with long range dipole interactions , and solved it using mean field theory . \n we have found a number of possible density - wave orders that occur mostly around the corresponding commensurate values of filling and create gaps in the density of states at these values of the filling . \n the phase separation is also often seen between different ordered phases in the mft results . \n overall , the checkerboard phase is most stable near half filling and has the highest transition temperature . due to the lack of an energy scale associated with spin exchange , the transition temperatures increase with interaction strength . \n different density wave phases show characteristic and distinct structure factors . \n we have discussed the validity of these results and the limitations of the mft method used in this study . \n this work was supported by a muri grant from air force office of scientific research numbered fa9559 - 09 - 1 - 0617 and from a grant of hpc resources from the arctic region supercomputing center at the university of alaska fairbanks as part of the department of defense high performance computing modernization program . \n we also acknowedge support from the mcdevitt endowment fund . \n n.  g.  zhang and c.  l.  henley , phys . \n b * 68 * , 014506 ( 2003 ) ; n .- \n g .  zhang and c.  l.  henley , eur . \n j.  b * 38 * , 409 ( 2004 ) ; u.  hizi and c.  l.  henley , europhys . \n lett .  * 65 * , 228 ( 2004 ) ; s.  a.  cheong and c.  l.  henley , phys . \n b * 74 * , 165121 ( 2006 ) .", "StartTimeOffset": 2695845569982, "RequestID": "fdee52bc976c7998e10306be51d546a5c146f45c", "TotalTokens": 2500}

up searches , and * reveal pre - discovery emission from sources that are newly discovered by _ \n fermi _ and/or other observers . \n the earth occultation technique is currently used with gbm to monitor fluxes for a catalog of known sources . \n sources are added to the catalog as they flare or upon request . for each source , \n the time of 50% atmospheric transmission at 100 kev is predicted using the known position of _ fermi_. a four - minute window of data is selected centered on the predicted time . \n nai detectors are selected if the angle between the detector normal and the source is less than @xmath0 . \n the data in each energy channel for each detector are then fitted with a model consisting of a quadratic background and a scale factor times a model profile for each source . \n model profiles for the source of interest and any other sources occulting within the fit window are computed by convolving the atmospheric transmission and detector response for each data point with an assumed energy spectrum for the source . \n the profile for each source is normalized using the count rate predicted by convolving the detector response at the occultation time with the assumed source spectrum ( i.e. , assuming no atmospheric transmission ) . \n once scale factors are fitted for all detectors , a fit across detectors is then performed to find the best scale factor for all detectors . \n this scale factor is multiplied by the assumed flux model integrated across each energy channel to determine flux for each source . \n this method differs considerably from the earth occultation technique used with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) @xcite on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro)_. _ fermi _ is pointed @xmath1 from zenith , so the detector response relative to a particular source is constantly changing and must be accounted for within each individual step fit . \n _ cgro _ remained at a fixed pointing relative to the sky for typically two weeks , so the detector responses could be ignored for the individual step fits and needed to be applied only to compute fluxes . \n gbm has additional energy coverage in the 8 - 25 kev band , at lower energies than batse could detect . \n the placement of the gbm detectors on the spacecraft also results in occasional blockages by the solar panels and other parts of the spacecraft . \n these must be accounted for in the detector response as well . \n currently the solar panels are not well modeled in the detector response because they are constantly moving . \n if a detector is blocked by a solar panel during a fit window , it is excluded from the fit . \n as of december 15 , 2009 , we are currently monitoring a catalog of 64 sources ( 60 x -

ray binaries , we will be able to better investigate fainter sources such as active galaxies and search for flaring activity . \n the earth occultation technique can be applied to the higher energy bgo detectors on gbm , essentially using identical software as for the nai detectors . \n the bgo energy channel edges differ more significantly than the nai edges , so fluxes are computed for the bgo detectors separately . \n the lower energy bounds of the ctime channels are for bgo 0 : 0.18 , 0.34 , 0.97 , 2.1 , 4.6 , 9.8 , 21 , and 45 mev and for bgo 1 are : 0.10 , 0.38 , 0.93 , 2.1 , 4.8 , 10 , 22 , 46 mev . in addition , many of the sources that are very bright that must be considered as interfering sources in the nais , e.g. sco x-1 , are not at all bright in the bgos , so source interference must be addressed carefully as well . \n code to monitor sources using the bgos has just been developed . \n a light curve for the crab is shown in figure  [ crab_bgo ] for the 100 - 380 kev band in bgo 1 , to demonstrate that preliminary runs have been successful . \n the gbm earth occultation technique is working well . agreement with swift / bat is good in the 15 - 50 kev range . \n currently 64 sources are being monitored . of these \n , we have preliminary detections for 42 sources in at least one of the energy bands between 8 kev and 300 kev . \n future plans for the earth occultation project include monitoring sources using the bgo detectors , expanding the catalog to include more extra - galactic sources , and application of the technique to cspec data . \n the gbm earth occultation project is a funded fermi guest investigation . \n this paper uses quicklook results provided by the asm / rxte team and swift / bat transient monitor results provided by the swift / bat team .    9 e. beklen & m.h . \n finger , atel # 3276 ( 2009 ) . \n m. cherry et al . , proceedings of the fermi symposium , econf c091122 ( 2009 ) . \n harmon et al . \n apjs , 138 , 149 ( 2002 ) . \n harmon et al . \n apjs , 154 , 585 ( 2004 ) . \n finger et al . \n , proceedings of the fermi symposium , econf c091122 ( 2009 ) . \n c.b.markwardt et al . , atel # 2258 ( 2009 ) . \n meegan et al . , \n apj , 702 , 791 ( 2009 ) . \n wilson -

{"ContextTokens": 2044, "GeneratedTokens": 95, "SynthesizedBody": "laser - compton scattering is an attractive method to generate photons in an energy range from x to @xmath0 rays . \n the advantages of of this scheme are ; the required electron energy is lower than those of synchrotron radiation , polarized photons can be produced and easily controlled by the incident laser beam polarization . \n thanks to these advantages , this scheme can be applied to a wide area of scientific and industrial fields such as material science , medical science , particle - nuclear physics , and therefore , its characteristics and possible applications have been discussed by many authors @xcite . \n one of the issues of the laser - compton scheme is to obtain sufficient photon intensity for various applications . \n an optical resonant cavity is an idea to provide high power and high repetition laser pulses by coherently accumulating them in the cavity , which allows us to construct a laser - compton facility without a large scale laser system . for the coherent superposition of laser pulses , \n however , the length of the optical path in the cavity should be multiples of the wavelength with high precision , that reaches o ( 10 ) pm for the finesse of @xmath1 . \n therefore , controlling the optical path length is a key issue to realize the laser system with the high finesse optical cavity . \n we have developed optical cavities and performed a series of experiment to generate photon beams by laser - compton scattering at the accelerator test facility ( atf ) in kek , japan , by the collaboration of kek , waseda university and hiroshima university with a close information exchange with a group of lal orsay , france . \n the initial results were published in @xcite . at the latest experiment \n , we successfully kept the optical path length of the cavity with the order of 10 pm and enhanced the laser pulse intensity to 1230 times in the cavity @xcite .    for more power enhancement in the cavity , \n one order higher for example , the required precision will reach o(1 ) pm . \n it could be achieved with a sophisticated optical and feedback system , however , is technically challenging to develop such system . as an alternative of precise control of the optical path length by active feedback system , we proposed an idea of self - resonating cavity , in which the optical system composed of a laser amplifier and an optical cavity keeps resonance condition by itself @xcite \n .    in this article , we report a status and prospect of our effort to develop optical cavities for laser - compton scattering , including a self - resonating cavity . \n a schematic of an optical cavity installed in the atf is shown in figure [ 4mcavity ] . \n the cavity is a 4 mirror ring cavity with the optical path length of about 1.68 m. a discussion about various configurations of the 4 mirrors cavities is find in @xcite . \n comparing with a simple two mirror cavity , the 4 mirror cavity has advantages of stability against miss - alignment of the mirrors . particularly for an operation with a tight laser beam focusing @xcite . \n the main parameters of the atf and laser pulses used in the experiments are summarized in table [ parameters ] . \n energy & 1.28 gev + energy spread @xmath2 & @xmath3 + beam intensity & @xmath4/bunch + bunch spacing & 5.6 ns + circumference & 138.6 m + emittance ( @xmath5 ) & @xmath6 + revolution & 2.16 mhz +   + wavelength & 1064 nm + repetition frequency & 357 mhz + pulse width & 11 ps ( fwhm ) + power & 10 w ( 28nj / pulse ) +    [ parameters ]        a unique feature of the cavity is that the 4 mirrors of the cavity are arranged in a way to make a twisted optical path for the circulating laser pulses . \n it causes a geometric phase for a laser wave state in the cavity , and as a result , the cavity only resonates with left- or right- circularly polarized state separately at different optical path length . \n this feature is useful for generating circularly polarized photon via laser - compton scattering and also applicable to a feedback control scheme with a simple setup @xcite . \n we conducted the laser - compton experiments at the kek atf , an electron storage ring which was constructed to develop technique for an ultra - low emittance electron beam required for future linear colliders @xcite . \n figure [ storage ] shows the stored power in the cavity during the operation in the atf ring . \n the average power was observed to be 2.6 kw . \n since the input power to the cavity was 2.1 w , the stored power was enhanced by a factor of 1230 . from the fluctuation of the stored power , 38 w , \n the precision of the optical path control was calculated to be @xmath7 pm . \n we also succeeded to generate @xmath0 rays at the rate of @xmath8 with their average energy of 24 mev    it must be mentioned , while not discussed in this article , another 4 mirror optical cavity was installed by the french group in the atf and successfully demonstrated photon generation of @xmath9 photons per second with an average power in the cavity of 35 kw @xcite . \n the cavity equipped an automated mirror alignment system with pound - drever - hall stabilizing technique , while the cavity described in this article adopted relatively simple mechanical configuration and the polarization based feedback system . \n the average photon yield depended on the electron beam conditions during the experiments , which eventually gave us a similar number of photons per second . \n the photon yields normalized by the electron intensity for both experiments were consistent with the laser power and the french cavity showed approximately 400 photons per laser - election pulse interaction , which is the world record at the time of the publication @xcite . \n the obtained photon yields of @xmath10 , described in the previous section , are still not sufficient for realistic applications , thus we need to increase intensity of both electron and laser beams . in terms of the laser power in the optical cavities , \n the required precision of the optical path control will reach order of picometers or less . to avoid \n the technical difficulty , an idea of the self - resonating cavity was proposed @xcite . \n a configuration of the self - resonating cavity is illustrated in figure [ self - setup ] , which forms an optical loop with a laser amplifier and an optical cavity . at the beginning , a laser wave which satisfies \n the resonance condition , @xmath11 , circulates in the optical loop and acts as a seed of the laser oscillation . \n when the gain of the amplifier becomes sufficient to compensate over all power loss in the loop , the laser oscillation starts spontaneously with a wavelength which satisfies the resonance condition . \n the length of the cavity , @xmath12 , and therefore the resonance wavelength , fluctuates due to environmental disturbances , however , the system , in principle , keeps the laser oscillation with a new wavelength chosen by the cavity . \n we demonstrated the idea with a two mirror fabry perrot cavity@xcite . \n the reflectivity of the mirrors are 99.999% and the intrinsic finesse of the cavity was independently measured to be @xmath13 .        as the first trial , we operated the system with continuous wave laser with the wavelength around 1047 nm . \n we observed a highly stable operation with the power fluctuation of @xmath14% for more than two hours . \n figure [ drop ] shows a demonstration of the stability of the self - resonating cavity . during a stable operation of the cavity \n , we hit the body of the cavity with a hammer . \n a sharp drop of the stored power was observed , but was automatically restored in about 40 ms , which was consistent with a damping time of the mechanical vibration of the body of the cavity .    . \n what shown in b ) is a magnification of the behavior at the power recovery . \n see text for the description of a sharp drop the power and its recovery . ]    the effective finesse , which is a measure of the performance of the cavity including the stability of self - resonating mechanism , was measured to be @xmath15 . the stored power in the cavity , which was calculated from the transmitted power with the transmittance of the mirror , was @xmath16 kw , showing a power enhancement factor of approximately 187,000 . \n toward application of this idea to the laser - compton scattering , the mode locked pulsed oscillation is necessary . \n it requires a mechanism to make pulses in the system such as a nonlinear polarization rotation optics . \n in addition , mode locked oscillation requires a relation between the entire optical path and the cavity length as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath12 are the optical path length of the entire loop and the length of the cavity embedded in the optical loop . \n we succeeded a proof of the principle experiment of a mode locked oscillation with low finesse ( about 220 ) cavity as shown in figure [ self - modelock ] . \n the details of the mode locked operation can be found in @xcite and the r&d toward a stable and high power storage is now in progress . \n a series of experiments has been performed at the atf electron ring in kek and demonstrated photon generation by laser - compton scattering .    a new cavity based on the self - resonating mechanism has been developed and we successfully demonstrated a stable operation with continuous wave . \n an effort is in progress toward realization of stable mode lock operation for the laser - compton experiment . \n the authors would like to thank the members of the atf group and collaborators of lal orsay , france . this research has been supported by quantum beam technology program of japanese mext and also supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 23226020 , 24654076 and 25246039", "StartTimeOffset": 2716054079010, "RequestID": "0ba4628e84e67a1be5bf74609fd4410a2b18c232", "TotalTokens": 2139}
