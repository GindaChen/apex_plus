The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Ariz., which sits on the Mexican border. Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helped Mexican authorities nab the cartel members, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the US border, ICE rep Gillian Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand. \"This operation was conducted with utmost secrecy to maintain the element of surprise and to ensure the safety of the Mexican law enforcement officers executing it,\" Christensen said, per CNN. ICE helped Mexican federal police into the US to keep them safe during the operation, Christensen said. The sting also netted the seizure of several assault-type weapons and hundreds of pounds of drugs. \"ICE applauds the government of Mexico for their bold action in taking down this criminal organization and for their continued pressure on the Sinaloa Cartel throughout Mexico,\" Christensen said.

Matthias Ernst at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute explains that white blood cells called macrophages help to heal wounds and remove damaged cells in the body. But those with a protein called hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) can also be hijacked by cancer cells to fuel cancer, reports the Herald Sun. As Ernst puts it to the Age, \"the more HCK activity a macrophage has, the more it nurtures cancer cell growth and survival.\" Ernst believed, however, that inhibiting the HCK protein would prevent cancer cells from taking over. When researchers used a drug-like molecule to inhibit the protein in animal tests, existing colon and stomach cancers stopped growing. The appearance of new cancers was also reduced, reports News.com.au. \"Our discovery could potentially offer a new and complementary approach to chemotherapy and immunotherapy as options for treating gastrointestinal cancers,\" which is especially important as colon cancers are usually resistant to most immunotherapy treatments, Ernst says.

Toyota is partnering with Getaround, a startup that assists drivers who want to rent out their cars, to launch a 500-car pilot test of the program in San Francisco in January, CNNMoney reports. Owners of a Toyota Prius or Lexus C200h who live in San Francisco will be eligible for the pilot program, and anyone who rents one of the cars will be able to unlock and start it using a smartphone app thanks to a \"smart key box\" Toyota developed. If the pilot is a success, Toyota may sell the smart key box, which can be installed on a car's dashboard, to current Toyota owners. (Just Friday, Toyota announced a $10 million investment in Getaround, the Consumerist reports.) Currently, 20% of cars being rented out on Getaround are Toyotas, and Sam Zaid, the CEO of the company, says the average San Francisco Prius owner makes $500 a month by renting out their car. That involves making it available to rent 75% of the time, but owners can choose when exactly it's available. For example, Forbes reports, a person can rent out their car during the eight hours it would otherwise be parked at an office building. The cost of renting a car via Getaround is typically $5 per hour. \"It really empowers people who may not be able to afford\" to buy a car otherwise, Zaid says. \"The average person in San Francisco can get a new Prius as long they're willing to share it.\" Under the pilot program, Toyota will allow owners to make lease payments directly from rental earnings, and, for those who purchase after January, will also consider those earnings when looking at whether a driver qualifies to buy the car.", "StartTimeOffset": 94959443168, "RequestID": "013dfd04b8cb42d6b5817bf73c4805bb", "TotalTokens": 1436}

Their formula-filled study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, kicks off with this sentence: \"Popcorn is the funniest corn to cook, because it jumps and makes a 'pop' sound in our pans.\" But Emmanuel Virot and Alexandre Ponomarenko get far more scientific from there, noting that while previous studies have examined the conditions needed to properly pop corn, the physical origin of a kernel bursting open, jumping, and making that sound remain \"elusive in the literature.\" Using elementary tools of thermodynamics and fracture mechanics (along with an oven, a microphone, and some cameras), they set out to solve the mystery. Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees Fahrenheit, 96% of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture (the Guardian reports kernels are 14% water) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains Phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture.

The result: \"Playing Tetris decreased craving strength ... from 70% to 56%,\" researcher Jackie Andrade says in a press release. What sort of power might Tetris hold? A relatively simple one, it turns out. \"Craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity,\" says Andrade. It's \"hard to imagine something vividly and play Tetris at the same time.\" And the effect didn't wear off: Those who played averaged 40 sessions during the week, but the impact remained consistent. Researchers were so impressed that they hope to test the theory on people with drug addictions. Just as significantly, \"this is the first demonstration that cognitive interference can be used outside the lab to reduce cravings for substances and activities other than eating,\" the researchers write. As far as undergrads' cravings, they reported wanting something about 30% of the time: about two-thirds of cravings were for food and non-alcoholic drinks; 21% were for cigarettes, beer, etc.; and 16% were for activities, including sleep, video games, socializing, and sex.

Billings, Montana, news station KULR-TV reports that Jeff Murphy of Batavia, Illinois, was looking for the treasure that antiquities dealer and author Forrest Fenn said he stashed somewhere in the Rocky Mountains several years ago. The investigation by Yellowstone officials into Murphy's death was kept private, but KULR obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request, the AP reports. The investigative report reveals Murphy's wife told park authorities that Murphy was looking for the treasure when she called to report him missing. Murphy's body was found June 9, 2017. He had fallen about 500 feet down a steep slope. The report ruled the death an accident. The lure of the treasure, which is said to be worth nearly $2 million, has prompted thousands to comb areas of New Mexico, Yellowstone National Park, and elsewhere. Murphy is one of several people who have died while looking for the treasure; the deaths have led some to call for an end the treasure hunt. Besides the danger to the treasure hunters, they note that search and rescue efforts for missing treasure hunters are costly. Fenn has dropped clues to the chest's whereabouts in a cryptic poem in his memoir, The Thrill of the Chase. Those who have lost their lives to the hunt include a 54-year-old grandfather, a pastor whose body was found in a river, and a 31-year-old whose raft flipped in another river.

In what the study in Gender Issues describes as a \"low violation\" scenario, the male asks to borrow a pen; in the \"high violation\" or \"disconcerting\" scenario, he suggests she try modeling and asks to take her photo. The women were then asked a series of questions, including whether they would comply; most said yes to the pen and no to the photo, regardless of how attractive the man was. But they also ranked each man as to how friendly, ambitious, mean, rude, and creepy (and more) he was. In the low-violation case, both men's personalities were perceived to be similar. But in the modeling scenario, \"the perceptions of the facially attractive male's personality were significantly less negative ... than the perceptions of (the) facially unattractive male's personality.\" As researcher Jeremy Gibson puts it, \"The unattractive male is tolerated up to a point; his unattractiveness is OK until he misbehaves.\" The researchers call it a \"double\" devil effect, Science Daily reports: The bad behavior and the unattractiveness combine, and the negative perception is magnified.

In a study in the journal Perception, scientists had a group of 19 healthy (i.e., no brain damage or other malady that would affect sensation interpretation) volunteers between the ages of 22 and 34 stick out their feet and have their toes prodded, and while 94% knew if it was their big toe or little toe being touched, only 57%, 60%, and 79% could correctly ID their second, third, and fourth toes, respectively. Meanwhile, when asked to ID their fingers using the same method, the rate shot up to 99%. The most problems came in differentiating between the second and third toes, per a press release, and no subject was able to guess every toe correctly. The confusion seemed to be more prevalent when testing a subject's non-dominant foot, and surprisingly, just under half of the volunteers reported feeling like one of their toes wasn't even there. \"We do know of medical conditions that can cause people to lose the sense of one of their digits,\" Nela Cicmil, one of the study's co-authors, says in the release. \"The people being tested here were healthy, yet some were reporting the feeling of a missing toe.\" Why this finding could potentially be useful: If healthy people aren't able to \"feel\" their toes accurately, tests that check toes for sensation or movement may not be the best method to assess if a patient may have brain damage.

Elise Huchard and Dieter Lukas studied 260 species; in about 45% of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says Huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies\u2014though not their own\u2014so the mom is available for mating. In the case of Chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes Lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the \"most detailed to date\" on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But Mom has a Jerry Springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the Telegraph reports. After all, \"males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own,\" Lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: The researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports Smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too.

All of the farms supplied birds to Pilgrim's Pride, a massive poultry producer, and a local sheriff thinks the killings are related to recent layoffs by the company, reports Reuters. Whoever did it had knowledge about how the chicken farms operate, says Clarendon County Sheriff Randy Garrett; the suspect or suspects bypassed the alarm systems in order to change the chicken house temperatures. Young chicks need the temperature to be around 95 to 100 degrees; as they get older, that temperature drops to 65 to 70 degrees, the sheriff says. \"Depending on the age of the birds, they knew whether to jack the heat up\" or turn it down, he says. \"They had all that knowledge of the farms and how many weeks growth the chickens were.\" The alarm systems are set to control the temperature and ventilation and notify farmers via phone if the buildings get too hot or cold, but without the system working, chickens can die in as little as an hour, the sheriff says. \"They roasted them,\" says one farmer who lost 200,000 chickens. \"I hate for them to be destroyed like that.\" The employee who discovered the deaths first noticed steam coming from the chicken houses, and found the inside temperature at 115 degrees. \"The heat could have knocked you down,\" he says. \"It takes dirty people to do something like that.\" Pilgrim's Pride laid off 60 people prior to the killings, which have caused an estimated $1.7 million in losses to the farmers.

The Wall Street Journal reports on a somewhat whimsical sounding potential treatment for anxiety and insomnia: \"night milk.\" That would be milk taken from cows at night; it's been found to be naturally higher in sleep-promoting compounds. South Korean researchers recently put the theory to the test in a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food. In this case, the subjects were lab mice that were fed milk in powdered form that had been collected either during the day or at night. The latter contained notably higher levels of tryptophan (24% more) and melatonin (almost 10 times more), and the researchers found night-milk \"shortened the sleep onset and prolonged the sleep duration\" of drug-induced sleep. On the anxiety front, the Journal reports that those mice who received night milk were more likely to explore open spaces, \"an indication of reduced anxiety\"; further, their behavior was similar to that of mice who had been administered the anti-anxiety drug diazepam. The big \"but\" in this study is that the subjects were, again, mice, not humans. But that doesn't mean humans haven't tried night milk.

To figure that out, they injected the fish with a dye that turned urine blue, then measured a fish's urine while it was kept separate from other fish. Researchers then placed a larger cichlid and a smaller cichlid in the same tank, separated by a transparent barrier. When the fish spotted each other, they swam toward the barrier in an aggressive manner with fins raised and peed. Researchers say the fish clearly used their fins to communicate visually. But the fish also gave off a chemical signal with urine. In cases where the barrier had tiny holes allowing water to flow through, for example, the smaller fish appeared to get a signal from the larger fish to stop their attack since they were more likely to show aggression when the barrier was solid. Both the smaller and larger fish also peed more when presented with another fish than they did when alone, especially when the barrier between them kept them from receiving the other fish's signals.

In 2002, Ilott's mother, Melita Jackson, made her last will, specifically noting that Ilott had been disinherited and instructing executors to fight any claim Ilott might attempt to make on the estate. Jackson died in 2004, leaving the majority of her $600,000 estate to animal charities. In 2007, Ilott challenged the will under the Inheritance Act, which allows a child to sue if a parent's will does not reasonably provide for their maintenance, per the Evening Standard. She argued she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded and that she, now a mother of five herself, was living on state benefits because she had no pension. A district judge awarded her about $60,000 of the estate. Quite a bit of back-and-forth followed, per the BBC: Ilott then tried to get more of the money, leading a High Court judge to reverse the district judge's decision, awarding Ilott nothing. In 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled she should get some of the money, but in 2014, again battling to get more of the money, the High Court denied her. The following year, however, she won a challenge at the Court of Appeal, which heard testimony that she couldn't even afford clothes for her children, and was awarded about $200,000. But three of the animal charities that were named in Jackson's will then challenged that increase, and now the Supreme Court has ruled in their favor.

Shultz then filed the first reported regulatory complaint against Theranos under an alias and started talking confidentially to the Journal, which published articles that blew the scandal open. But his involvement has also blown his relationship with his grandfather apart: He tells the Journal that while he used to check in with George regularly, he's barely seen or spoken with him since, not even going in December to his grandfather's 95th birthday party (which, the Journal points out, was attended by Holmes). In the meantime, he's been dealing with his concerned parents, what he depicts as a Theranos attempt to strong-arm him into admitting he leaked trade secrets, and a possible private investigator on his tail. Perhaps the most distressing part for Tyler Shultz, who sources say is cooperating with the feds investigating Theranos: that his grandfather stayed on with the company after he blew the whistle, even after Tyler Shultz asked him to \"do the right thing\" at a July meeting that proved to be their last.

The Environmental Integrity Project, which was created by former EPA officials, took a look at Pruitt's travel records from March to May and discovered that he spent 43 out of 92 days either in Oklahoma or traveling there, reports the New York Times. Critics say it fits with a narrative that Pruitt plans another run for office, perhaps as governor or senator, and is cultivating political ties in his home state, reports Reuters. An EPA spokesperson disputes that, saying that \"Administrator Pruitt works long hours and is available around the clock,\" she says. \"He is extremely focused and disciplined, which is evident by the fact that he spearheaded over two dozen significant regulatory actions since being sworn in.\" The report shows that Pruitt traveled home 10 times over the three-month span, generally for long weekends. On some of those trips, he picked up a portion of the travel costs himself, though the Times frames the costs as being \"largely at taxpayer expense.\" In all, his federal travel expenses totaled $12,000. The EIP says it sought the records after fielding complaints that it was difficult to arrange meetings with Pruitt in Washington, DC, because he was so rarely there. \"The American people aren't paying taxes for part-time Cabinet officials,\" says Liz Purchia Gannon, who served as spokeswoman for former Obama EPA chief Gina McCarthy. The report shows that Pruitt would sometimes stay in Oklahoma three to five days, though he had only one official meeting on his schedule.

Her asthma inhaler didn't help, and she had her boyfriend call 911. Paramedics arrived within minutes but were still too late; Myriam died at the hospital from a lack of oxygen to her brain. Ducre says her daughter had recently told her new boyfriend she loved him. \"Sadly, she did not have the time to tell him she had a peanut allergy.\" Ducre opened up about her daughter's death for the first time Wednesday to the Journal De Quebec. She wants young people to know how important it is to carry EpiPens and tell others about their allergies. Myriam wasn't wearing a Medical Alert bracelet and didn't have her EpiPen with her. \"(This) is why you have to carry your EpiPen, even though you don't want to and even though it's not cool,\" Dr. Christine McCusker at the Montreal Children's Hospital tells CTV. Traces of allergens\u2014from peanuts, for example\u2014can linger in saliva for hours. \"The most important part of managing your allergies is that you have to inform people,\" McCusker says. \"You have to say, 'Listen guys, I have food allergies, I have my EpiPen.

This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. \"To deal with a few boxes of this [variety] and few pellets of that is a real challenge,\" says Diane Gooding of Gooding Farms in Idaho.

That's essentially what the Hubble Space Telescope has captured in a new image of the Twin Jet Nebula, a shimmering planetary nebula that strongly resembles a winged insect, reports CNET. What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the European Space Agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun. \"The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf,\" the ESA says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display. At the center of each wing, blue areas represent violent jets of gas gushing into space at approximately 621,000mph. Discovered in 1947 and officially known as PN M2-9, the Twin Jet Nebula gets its more common name from its shape. \"If the nebula is sliced across the star, each side of it appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines,\" says the ESA. Astronomers believe the nebula is only about 1,200 years old, based on how quickly the wings are expanding, which they will continue to do.

The Survivor producer's Mexican trial for Monica Burgos' murder has finally wrapped up after stretching on for nearly three years. Prosecutors argued Beresford-Redman killed his wife in their room at Cancun's Moon Palace resort on the morning of April 5, 2010, then hid her body in the room until evening, when he deposited it in a cistern, about 75 yards away. The judge's verdict is expected sometime next spring, and Beresford-Redman could face 30 years in prison if convicted. But as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the case is hardly cut and dried. Coroner's tale: Evidence gathered from Burgos' body doesn't support the prosecution's argument. As her body showed no evidence of lividity\u2014the bluish marks left by exposure to a hard surface, like in a hotel room\u2014a coroner said Burgos likely died at the cistern itself. The coroner also determined Burgos died at around 11pm on April 5, not that morning. Missing evidence: Police didn't complete a rape kit on Burgos and didn't test under her fingernails, though the state claimed scratches on Beresford-Redman's neck indicated a fight. The prosecution later said much of its evidence was \"lost\" or damaged by mold and water. It also turned out that blood samples prosecutors said were taken from the hotel room and a railing outside didn't belong to Burgos or Beresford-Redman. Witnesses recant: Hotel employees who said they'd seen the couple fighting later said Beresford-Redman wasn't the man they'd seen. A worker testified that a British family had complained\u2014in a handwritten note\u2014of a woman's screams coming from the couple's hotel room, but no official statement was ever taken from the family. Expert opinion: A forensic scientist and criminologist hired by Beresford-Redman's Mexican defense attorney said Burgos was likely killed by two people familiar with the layout of the hotel. He also found no evidence tying Beresford-Redman to the crime. An expert for the prosecution and an independent forensic expert brought in by the judge couldn't link him to it either.

Morgan has inserted himself into the life of Lee, 95, according to the restraining order. The filing accuses Morgan, 42, of taking advantage of Lee's impaired hearing, vision, and judgment, moving Lee from his longtime family home and preventing family and associates from contacting him. Morgan was arrested on Monday for allegedly filing a false police report by calling 911 saying burglars were in his house when in fact two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on Lee. Morgan's arrest and ouster is the latest and thus far most dramatic move in a struggle that has emerged over Lee's business and fortune since his wife of 69 years, Joan, died in July. Police have been investigating reports of elder abuse against Lee since at least February, and had issued an emergency order keeping Morgan from Lee before Wednesday's order was issued. Lee has for decades been revered as a comic book giant for his central role in creating the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and other major Marvel characters. Morgan is a memorabilia dealer and Marilyn Monroe expert who befriended Lee's daughter and only child JC Lee.

Americans' stock and mutual fund portfolios jumped $728 billion in value in the October-December quarter, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. Home values rose $557 billion. Total household wealth increased 2.3% to $92.8 trillion. The figure includes checking and savings accounts, and subtracts mortgages and other debt, and the Wall Street Journal notes that it's a record. Still, not all Americans are reaping the gains. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 80% of the stock market. And younger Americans are less likely to be homeowners than previous generations, as renting increased in the wake of the housing bubble. They have missed out on the rebound in home prices that began in 2012. Typically, an increase in household wealth can boost overall spending and help accelerate growth. By some estimates, Americans spend three to five cents for every dollar of additional wealth, what economists call the \"wealth effect.\" Yet with wealth gains more concentrated among richer and older households, who are less likely to spend more, that effect may be limited.", "StartTimeOffset": 1167106002631, "RequestID": "0f78448e2f104539b0742baaaedf90af", "TotalTokens": 939}

In the #MeToo era, however, an increasing number of women are speaking out publicly against Kelly; just this week, the Time's Up campaign called for his alleged misdeeds to be investigated and for various music entities to sever their relationships with him. On Friday, two more expos\u00e9s on Kelly were published: lengthy pieces in BuzzFeed and the Washington Post. The Post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against Kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him (two of whom have never spoken out publicly before); BuzzFeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with Kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly \"brainwashed\" by Kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call \"Daddy.\" They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups. And BuzzFeed's sources say Kelly rules all aspects of the women's lives, telling them when to eat and sleep and what to wear, among other things, and punishing them if they break a rule. Parents who spoke to both publications claim Kelly is keeping their children from contacting them. Read both pieces in full here and here.

A study of men in Montreal finds that those who'd slept with more than 20 women had a 28% lower risk of prostate cancer than did men who'd had sex with just one woman, CBS News reports. As for virgins, they faced double the cancer risk faced by those who'd had sex, the Telegraph reports. The reasons behind the findings aren't clear, but lead researcher Marie-Elise Parent notes that frequent sex means more frequent ejaculation; earlier studies, she says, have indicated that frequent ejaculation helps prevent prostate cancer. But the findings, based on surveys of 3,200 subjects, didn't hold true for men sleeping with men, the Independent reports. Men who had sex exclusively with men and had had more than 20 partners actually saw twice the prostate cancer risk of men who'd never slept with men. Parent says she has only \"highly speculative\" explanations for that, and anyway, those findings weren't statistically significant. So is all this a good reason for men to run out and sleep with as many women as possible? Parent throws a little cold water on that particular fire: \"I don't think we can say that.
